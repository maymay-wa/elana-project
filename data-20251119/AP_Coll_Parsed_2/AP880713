a magistrate on wednesday ordered the coast guard 
to turn over tapes of its seizure of a marijuanaladen cargo ship 
to attorneys defending the vessels 18 crewmen 
defense attorneys had requested to see and hear hours of video 
and audio tapes to prove their claim that the coast guard boarded 
the ship and arrested the 18man crew without probable cause 
the attorneys began reviewing the tapes wednesday afternoon 
after the order from us magistrate john weinberg 
the coast guard seized the cargo ship encounter bay on june 30 
about 500 miles off the washington coast it was carrying an 
estimated 72 tons of marijuana with a street value of about 280 
million making it the largest maritime drug bust on the west coast 
defense attorneys had asked to review all communications 
regarding the vessels seizure but weinberg declined the request 
after assistant us attorney jerry diskin said much of the 
material was classified 
among material not released was the first of two messages to the 
boutwell indicating that the panamanian embassy in washington 
dc gave the coast guard permission to board the encounter bay 
which was registered in panama 
raul san malo panamanian embassy minister told the associated 
press that permission to disable with gunfire board and search the 
vessel had been granted by ambassador juan sosa 
sosa is recognized as ambassador by the us government but not 
by gen manuel noriega the panamanian military leader who has been 
indicted on drugrelated charges in florida 
if probable cause is found crew members would face charges of 
possession with intent to distribute marijuana which carries a 
penalty of 10 years to life in prison diskin said 
diskin also began presenting arguments to continue to detain the 
crewmen who include three americans one englishman one new 
zealander and 13 from indonesia thailand and singapore 
jeffrey bernard press 41 a british citizen who lives in 
singapore and anthony gilbert sayers 53 of auckland new 
zealand have a long association with the encounter bay as master 
and chief officer respectively diskin said 
samuel j colflesh 31 of springfield pa admitted 
being the master at least on this voyage diskin said 
as for terrance albert nolan 36 who gave an address in new 
orleans and gary robinson 34 of missouri the reasons for 
their presence aboard the vessel is connected only with the 
contraband aboard because theres no evidence of them being part of 
the crew diskin said 
five of the southeast asian crewmen aboard the encounter bay 
appeared to have worked on the ship for years diskin said the 
backgrounds of the other southeast asian crewmen was not known he 
said 
on tuesday lt thomas rogers testified the coast guard had 
information indicating that the highgrade thai marijuana was 
loaded off danang vietnam during the first 10 days of june and 
that the vietnamese army was involved in the operation 
no questions about vietnams alleged involvement were raised in 
court wednesday but in a telephone interview tuesday night with 
the seattle postintelligencer be an second secretary to the 
vietnamese consul general in mexico city denied the coast guard 
account 
the problem is this some people dont tell the truth he 
said theyve been caught they could say any old thing 
our government doesnt permit drug trafficking weve never 
had an interest dealing with these drug operations

a former city council member who helped bring 
the dodgers to los angeles is crying foul over what she says is a 
law firms refusal to play fair with eight baseball season tickets 
rosalind wyman is suing the firm of wyman bautzer kuchel and 
silbert where her husband worked until he died in 1973 
mrs wyman appeared tuesday in los angeles county superior court 
and said the firm gave her use of the tickets in the 1960s and that 
she signed an agreement when her husband died that gave her right 
of first refusal of the tickets and the right to buy them if the 
firm didnt 
mrs wyman contends the firm gave away two of the tickets and 
failed to give her access to the rest 
law firm spokesman charles stern said he had not seen a copy of 
the complaint but added i was dismayed she felt she had to sue 
since i had been negotiating with her and her attorneys for many 
weeks and we were very close to an arrangement that would have made 
everybody happy 
theres principle involved said mrs wyman who served on 
the city council from 1953 to 1965 and was instrumental in the 
dodgers move from brooklyn in 1958 at 22 she was the youngest 
person ever elected to the council 
one of my biggest and longest and most involved fights was to 
bring a major league baseball team to this city as an elected 
official i really feel i made a contribution to my community 
the dodgers are in first place in the national league west 2 
games ahead of san francisco

volkswagen opened its only us assembly 
plant amid much hoopla but the west german automaker laid on only 
a simple farewell as it prepared to close the plant today when the 
last car moved down the line 
people are saying goodbye to each other people who have 
worked together for 10 years said vw spokesman chet bahn its 
a very personal day 
volkswagen cited slumping sales and increased smallcar 
competition when it announced last fall it would close its us 
manufacturing venture once one of the economic bright spots in 
this rustbelt region of western pennsylvania 
the plant had been operating below capacity for the past five 
years 
layoffs of 2500 blue and whitecollar workers began in march 
when production of the jetta model now imported from west germany 
ended the last golf model was scheduled to roll off the 15mile 
assembly line today the golf now will come from a plant in mexico 
about 700 to 800 employees will remain to help mothball the 
plant bahn said by midseptember about 150 employees will be 
left he said 
the plant was dedicated in 1976 amid rolling dairy farmland 
about 35 miles southeast of pittsburgh bringing the promise of 
prosperity and lifetime employment to an area already hit hard by 
declining manufacturing 
there was so much room for growth said john burish 35 of 
penn hills who worked in the body shop for 10 years when you 
came into this place you knew this is where you were going to 
retire 
the first car a white rabbit was finished april 10 1978 but 
plans to produce 500000 cars a year using workers on three shifts 
a day never materialized 
the plant has been making cars for sale in the 1989 model year 
thousands of golf and jetta models are being stockpiled in the 
plants parking lot 
the modern plant will be the largest single vacant manufacturing 
facility in pennsylvania with more than 28 million square feet 
under roof most of its production equipment will remain in place 
gov robert casey has said finding a new occupant for the plant 
is a top priority but no one has expressed interest so far 
i think most people are hoping somebody else will take it 
over said joel suter chairman of the east huntingdon township 
supervisors i really think that will happen 
meanwhile many laidoff workers are finding its hard to match 
the 14 to 16 per hour they made on average at the plant 
volkswagen has been the largest employer in westmoreland county 
where the unemployment rate in may was 62 percent compared to 56 
percent for the nation 
there are a lot of people on the streets looking for a couple 
good jobs said edward prevenslik 46 of ruffsdale a 
maintenance worker at the plant they can go through 50 or 75 
before they hire one

as birds learn to sing their bodies create new 
brain cells that indirectly link up to nerves controlling vocal 
muscles scientists reported today 
a major portion of the vocal motor nerve pathway is actually 
created during song learning researchers wrote in the british 
journal nature 
previous studies have found that adult canaries create cells in 
a portion of the brain involved in controlling songs the new work 
strengthens the case that such growth in birds plays a role in song 
learning said an editorial accompanying the new report 
in the study kathy and ernest nordeen of the university of 
rochester in new york studied brains of male zebra finches the 
birds memorize song between 20 and 65 days after hatching and 
start practicing at about 30 days of age 
the researchers identified brain cells that arose between ages 
of 20 days and 64 days in a part of the brain critical for song 
production more than half the new cells reached into a second area 
of the brain that in turn projects to nerve cells that control 
vocal muscles they report 
males beyond the learning period and young females which do not 
sing create far fewer extra brain cells in the critical part of 
the brain researchers said

the judge in the irancontra conspiracy case 
on wednesday scheduled two closed hearings next month about 
classified information that fired white house aide oliver l north 
wants to use in his defense 
us district judge gerhard a gesell set arguments on aug 8 
and aug 22 on norths proposed use of classified documents 
gathered by independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
gesell also denied a defense motion to reconsider his june 16 
ruling that the prosecutions investigation was not tainted by the 
improper use of the congressional testimony north and two 
codefendants gave under limited grants of immunity from 
prosecution 
north is charged with conspiring with former national security 
adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and 
retired air force maj gen richard v secord to illegally divert 
profits from the usiran arms sales to the nicaraguan rebels 
gesell has ordered separate trials for all four defendants and 
has scheduled norths to begin sept 20 
north last weekend criticized gesells scheduling of his trial 
as being politically motivated according to a published report 
we will go to trial before the election in what is a truly 
blatant effort to politicize this activity and create dissension 
right at the time of a national election north told a group of 
supporters at a fundraiser in dallasaccording to excerpts of his 
speech provided to the washington post 
reporters and photographers were barred from the event except 
for a photo opportunity with the former national security aide 
according to the account in thursdays edition of the newspaper 
in the order about classified documents gesell said that during 
the aug 8 hearing he wanted to consider the prosecutions proposal 
to substitute portions of classified documents with statements of 
facts the material would prove if they were shown directly to the 
jury 
such a procedure is provided by the classified information 
procedures act which contains rules for disclosing government 
secrets in court 
the judge said he is particularly interested in hearing the 
governments explanation of a need to substitute where substitution 
is challenged and will expect defendant to show why the 
substitutions proposed will conceal facts required by the defense 
both hearings will be closed to the press and public to protect 
the secret documents to be discussed 
in a related development former cia officer joseph fernandez 
charged last month with conspiring to illegally set up a secret 
arms network to the contras challenged the constitutionality of 
the classified documents statute as it applied to his case 
fernandez who was scheduled to appear before us district 
judge aubrey e robinson jr on thursday contends that the laws 
requirement that he notify the government of his intention to 
disclose government secrets tramples on his right to a fair trial 
such disclosure in advance of trial would tip prosecutors to the 
defense strategy fernandezs lawyers said in court papers 
the defense noted that walsh has indicated there are 60000 
classified documents that pertain to the case and there may be 
thousands of additional documents that are relevant 
testimony of virtually every government witness and the vast 
majority of likely defense witnesses will inevitably contain a 
great deal of classified information the defense said 
even the identity of many of the witnesses in the case 
witnesses for both the government and the defense will be 
classified fernandezs lawyers said

lawmakers unveiled a wideranging drought 
relief package for the nations farmers and quickly began work on 
it as a house chairman called for final action by midaugust 
house agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza 
dtexas promised fast action as his panel began reviewing the bill 
on tuesday he said congress should send a signal that we care 
about the drought ravaging the nations cropland 
to speed the bill to passage de la garza said lawmakers should 
dispense with the usual parade of witnesses from farm organizations 
and other groups 
across capitol hill the senate agriculture committee raised the 
curtain on a similar bill to provide disaster payments of up to 
100000 each to farmers whose crops have been wiped out by the 
drought 
the lawmakers acted as the agriculture department released a 
fresh report forecasting severe damage to the harvest from the 
drought 
it estimated for example that us corn output this year would 
shrivel to 52 billion bushels down from 706 billion last year 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng told lawmakers it is the 
largest drought that our nation has ever experienced 
i think history will show that its truly more mammoth than 
any of us has ever experienced lyng said he said a recurrence 
next year would suggest that weve done something wrong and the 
gods are against us 
for their part agriculture committee members resolved not to 
allow the drought to force a rash of bankruptcies in the 
countryside just as the farm economy is shaking off the stagnation 
of the early 1980s 
were not going to allow their lives as farmers and ranchers 
to end because of a freak of nature senate agriculture committee 
chairman patrick j leahy dvt said in remarks on the senate 
floor 
the legislation unveiled tuesday is going to be expensive by all 
estimates but there will not any sure way to gauge costs until 
august at the earliest sponsors express confidence that government 
savings resulting from the drought will be enough to offset the 
disaster payments 
the measure would cap disaster payments at 100000 for each 
individual farmer payments would represent 65 percent of 
predrought expected earnings whether from target prices 
pricesupport loans or market prices but they would apply only to 
losses in excess of 35 percent of the crop 
a 50cent per hundredweight reduction in dairy price supports 
scheduled for next year would be canceled under the legislation 
dairymen say rising feed costs resulting from the drought warrant 
such action 
feed in government storage that is already being provided on an 
emergency basis would be made available to a broader range of 
livestock producers up to a maximum benefit of 50000 for each 
individual 
the drought has burned up a considerable amount of hay and 
grazing land and thus feed is now at a premium 
under the legislation wheat feed grains cotton and rice 
producers would not be required to refund to the government any 
deficiency payment they have received in advance 
deficiency payments are income supports provided by the 
government they represent the difference between the market value 
of a crop and its value at higher target prices set by congress and 
adjusted annually by the secretary of agriculture 
as the drought has spread across rural america market prices 
have climbed steadily reducing the size of deficiency payments at 
the very time that many farmers find themselves without crops to 
take to market 
to complicate matters many farmers already have received 40 
percent of their deficiency payments from the agriculture 
department and will have to refund a portion of them unless rescued 
by relief legislation

attorney generaldesignate richard thornburgh 
should pledge to complete an ethics investigation of edwin meese 
iii according to members of the senate panel who will pass 
judgment on thornburghs nomination 
thornburgh almost has to guarantee it will be completed 
said sen patrick j leahy dvt and a member of the senate 
judiciary committee i dont think anyone could ask less 
thornburgh chosen by president reagan to head the troubled 
justice department pledged after his nomination tuesday to 
follow the evidence wherever it may lead on meese 
the nominee will likely be asked about the internal probe at his 
confirmation hearing 
although no date has been set a staff source at the judiciary 
committee speaking on condition of anonymity said its 
reasonable to assume a hearing will be held in early august with 
a full senate vote by aug 12 the last scheduled session before 
labor day 
meese will depart as attorney general in a few weeks already 
having pronounced himself vindicated by an 830page independent 
counsels report that has not been released by a threejudge court 
the report has recommended no criminal charges against meese 
according to sources but could question his ethics and candor 
independent counsel james mckays report has been turned over to 
solicitor general charles fried the first step toward a justice 
department ethics review by michael e shaheen jr counsel for the 
office of professional responsibility the internal investigation 
would center not on possible criminal acts but on whether meese 
violated federal conflictofinterest rules 
the pending investigation ought to go forward said sen 
arlen specter rpa there are ethical questions that go to the 
conduct of the office i think that investigation ought to be 
completed 
sen gordon humphrey rnh agreed if the report of the 
independent counsel warrants an investigation i think there should 
be one 
other senators were more cautious 
sen orrin g hatch rutah said until im able to know more 
about mckays report it would be too early to recommend that the 
office of professional responsibility continue or not 
the judiciary panels ranking republican strom thurmond of 
south carolina said a special counsel has investigated this 
matter but we dont know what information he has obtained im 
sure gov thornburgh will take that information into consideration 
when it is released publicly 
meanwhile thornburgh got rave reviews from liberals and 
conservatives alike a consensus the conservative meese was never 
able to build 
the nominee was praised for his qualifications two terms as 
pennsylvania governor a us attorney in pittsburgh a former 
chief of the justice department criminal division and currently 
head of the institute of politics at harvard universitys kennedy 
school of government 
humphrey a staunch conservative was the only judiciary 
committee member to announce opposition saying thornburgh did not 
support the strong antiabortion stance of the republican party 
leahy a liberal said i urged competency ahead of ideology 
in selecting a meese replacement at first blush it appears that 
is what they have done had they sent an ideological symbol it 
would have been a battle royal for the rest of the year 
now leahy said chances of a partisan or ideological battle 
are almost nil 
thurmond expressed hope that hearings would begin right away 
and added that they can if the democrats dont delay the matter 
sen edward m kennedy of massachusetts the no 2 democrat on 
the committee said there wont be a delay 
i have the greatest respect for dick thornburgh kennedy 
said the state of justice in america would be very different 
today if dick thornburgh had been attorney general for the past 3 
years instead of ed meese 
meese was investigated by mckay on a number of matters 
including his assistance to wedtech a bronx ny defense 
contractor under investigation for payoffs to win government 
contracts meeses actions in connection with a proposed 1 billion 
iraqi oil pipeline project and whether he took actions favorable 
to regional bell telephone companies at a time he held 14000 in 
telephone stock 
when asked whether he planned to look into the meese matter 
thornburgh said i really cant answer any substantive questions 
at this time 
my intention and this is in any area is to follow the 
evidence wherever it may lead he said and not knowing what 
that evidence is i cant give you a prediction

despite one of the worst batterings on record 
by drought and heat us farmers still are going to outproduce the 
soviet union which is having one of its best harvest years in 
history 
overall total us grain production is now estimated at 212 
million metric tons down 24 percent from 1987 
the agriculture department issued that downward revision 
tuesday but in a related report it released figures on total 
soviet grain production that show the united states is still far 
ahead 
usda said total soviet grain production this year is forecast at 
a bumper yield of 215 million tons but that figure includes peas 
beans buckwheat rice and other miscellaneous commodities in 
addition to wheat barley sorghum corn and rye 
many of the secondary crops are not included in the us grain 
total thus if only soybeans are added projected at 449 million 
metric tons this year the droughtshriveled us harvest still 
towers over the bumper soviet yield 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat or soybeans or 394 bushels of corn 
the special us crop report showed that the 1988 corn harvest 
may produce 52 billion bushels this year 29 percent less than 
expected a few months ago and 26 percent below last years bumper 
harvest 
until drought and extreme heat tightened their grip in may and 
june usda had projected this years corn harvest based on yield 
trends and an assumption of normal weather at 73 billion 
bushels up from last years output of 706 billion 
corn is the largest and most important us grain crop and is a 
key peg in the nations agriculture as a livestock feed it is the 
major building block for beef pork poultry and dairy products 
along with wheat soybeans and other commodities corn also is 
vital as an export desired by many countries wanting to upgrade 
their livestock programs 
soybean prospects were shown at 165 billion bushels down from 
about 19 billion in 1987 until the drought the 1988 harvest had 
been expected to be around 188 billion bushels 
projected 1988 output of all wheat was reported at 184 billion 
bushels down from 21 billion bushels produced last year in may 
and june before the drought made its impact usda had projected a 
slightly larger crop than last year 
the wheat total included winter wheat planted last fall which 
stayed barely ahead of the drought later plantings of durum and 
other spring wheat varieties were brutalized by heat and dryness 
winter wheat output an actual infield estimate as of july 1 
not a statistical projection was estimated at 157 billion 
bushels up slightly from 156 billion last year and matching the 
june estimate 
consumer food prices overall are going up as a result of the 
drought averaging 3 percent to 5 percent higher this year than 
they did in 1987 usda said before the heat and dry weather became 
pervasive usda estimated the 1988 food price hike at 2 percent to 
4 percent 
department officials have said 1989 food prices could rise an 
additional 2 percent to 3 percent because of this years crop 
losses that would be on top of an expected rise in 1989 living 
costs generally perhaps around 4 percent 
currently the usda considers more than 1900 counties in 37 
states as feedscarce drought areas where emergency assistance is 
available 
assistant secretary ewen m wilson the usdas chief economist 
said total us grain production this year is estimated at 212 
million metric tons down 24 percent from 1987 
total supplies of grain which take into account existing 
stocks from prior harvests are estimated at 388 million metric 
tons down 20 percent from a year ago wilson said 
wilson said springplanted crops are entering a critical stage 
of development and that final levels of 1988 production will 
depend on further weather developments 
some other crop projections 
cotton 137 million bales this year compared with 14 million 
bales projected in june and 1476 million bales harvested in 1987 
rice 159 million hundredweight up from 157 million projected 
in june and the harvest last year of 1277 million hundredweight 
barley 291 million bushels down from 500 million projected in 
june and 527 million produced last year 
sorghum 560 million bushels down from 650 million indicated 
in june and 741 million harvested in 1987 
the projections released tuesday were based on an assumption of 
normal weather from here on wilson said the estimates will be 
updated as the growing season progresses 
on aug 11 the department will issue a fullscale production 
report including the first onsite estimates for corn soybeans 
spring wheat and other crops 
looking at the reduced corn crop wilson said that when the 
projected 52 billion bushels are added to 44 billion bushels left 
over from previous crops when the new marketing year begins sept 
1 the total supply for 198889 will be 96 billion bushels 
this is more than enough to meet the needs of domestic 
livestock producers the food industry and our export customers in 
the coming year and leave a fourmonth supply of nearly 236 
billion bushels on hand on sept 1 1989 he said 
large supplies of wheat also will serve as a buffer against 
shortages wilson said 
but some other grains including barley and oats will be in 
much shorter supply wilson said oats production could drop to 255 
million bushels well below the predrought forecast of 450 million

a judge cannot block a woman from having an 
abortion her estranged husband wanted to stop the indiana court of 
appeals ruled tuesday 
in a 30 decision the court threw out a shelby circuit court 
preliminary injunction that prevented jennifer ann conn 19 of 
morristown from ending her pregnancy 
erin andrew conn 23 of elkhart had argued that a fathers 
rights should be weighed against the mothers wishes when 
determining if the woman can go ahead with an abortion mrs conn 
who is approximately eight weeks pregnant filed for a divorce on 
june 17 
an attorney for the father immediately asked the state supreme 
court to take an appeal of tuesdays ruling and to issue a stay of 
the court of appeals action 
the states highest court will likely consider those requests on 
wednesday court administrator karl mulvaney said 
the appellate panel said acting judge robert t thopy of the 
shelby county court ignored case law from the us supreme court 
when he issued an injunction june 27 to prevent the abortion 
we hold that erin has no right to veto jennifers decision to 
obtain an abortion as such decision concerns only her judge 
robert w neal wrote for the court 
the appellate court also ordered the shelby county court to 
dismiss all other proceedings concerning mrs conns planned 
abortion thopy had planned to hold another hearing to determine if 
mrs conn should be permanently barred from having an abortion 
the appellate opinion quoted extensively from two us supreme 
court decisions the 1973 roe vs wade case in which state 
statutes barring abortions in the first trimester were declared 
unconstitutional and the 1976 planned parenthood of central 
missouri vs danforth case 
in the danforth decision the high court struck down a law that 
required a woman to have spousal approval before getting an 
abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy 
the appeals judges said conns arguments were philosophical and 
moral in nature but werent grounded in case law developed since 
the high court rulings 
neal was joined in the opinion by chief judge wesley w ratliff 
jr and judge jonathan j robertson 
james bopp jr an attorney for conn and a counsel for the 
national right to life organization said the decision is ripe 
for appeal bopp who filed an appeal motion tuesday afternoon 
said the appellate judges had ignored a fathers constitutional 
rights 
im very disappointed the indiana court of appeals failed to 
recognize a fathers rights to have his interests weighed bopp 
said 
richard a waples an indiana civil liberties union attorney who 
represented mrs conn said he was satisfied that the court 
correctly applied the law and said that lower courts cant keep 
issuing orders stopping abortions

a fight over dutyfree ethanol imports from 
caribbean refineries is one of the fights flaring up as the house 
readies for yet another round in the battle over trade legislation 
its a sweetheart arrangement for a few select companies 
house minority leader robert h michel rill declared tuesday as 
he opened fire on the ethanol provision in the 1000page trade 
bill 
the bill is set to come to the house floor for a vote today 
president reagan vetoed a slightly different version of the bill 
on may 24 he cited provisions that would limit alaska oil exports 
and require companies to provide employees with 60day notice of 
plant closings and largescale layoffs 
within hours of reagans veto the house voted to pass the 
legislation and make it law in spite of his objections but the 
senate fell short of the twothirds required for a veto override in 
a june 8 vote 
the alaska oil and plantclosings provisions have been dropped 
from the version of the bill now coming to the floor sponsors say 
reagan might be more willing to accept the measure in its modified 
form 
i strongly believe congress owes it to the american people to 
do all we can to enact a trade policy house ways and means 
committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill said 
reagan however also was critical of the ethanol provision in 
his veto message the plan was conceived as a way to expand 
benefits under reagans caribbean basin initiative but critics say 
it goes too far 
ethanol or ethyl alcohol is used for fuel and can be refined 
from a variety of farm products us corn growers have been irate 
over the trade bills provision to open the door to dutyfree 
imports 
michel said it would not only hurt corn growers but take away 
refining jobs in the united states and abuse the caribbean basin 
initiative he said the initiative was designed to boost industries 
native to the caribbean but that five companies currently are using 
island refineries to convert european products into ethanol 
for example michel said spanish wine has been shipped to the 
caribbean and refined into the alcohol fuel 
meanwhile the plantclosings provision is moving through 
congress as a separate piece of legislation or almost separate 
the house is acting under a format requiring a vote first on the 
plantclosings bill followed quickly by action on the trade 
measure labor officials were uneasy over splitting off the 
plantclosings issue in the first place they went along with the 
idea after democratic leaders agreed to place it first in line 
ahead of trade 
the plantclosings bill already passed by the senate will go 
to the presidents desk if as expected it wins house approval 
exactly what lies in store for the trade bill remains unclear 
house approval would send it to the senate which already has 
another version of the measure on its calendar and where numerous 
amendments await it 
little time remains to sort out the amendments many highly 
controversial before lawmakers leave washington for the campaign 
trail 
and there is a question about how much appetite the senate will 
have for the painful nittygritty of committee action on trade with 
the bills sponsor sen lloyd bentsen dtexas increasingly torn 
away by his responsibilities as gov michael dukakis running mate 
the central provisions of the bill would overhaul the system 
under which the united states imposes import curbs to protect 
american industries and retaliates against international trade 
violations by other countries 
the measure also contains a wide array of other provisions 
ranging from repeal of the 1980 windfall profits tax on oil 
companies to more than 2 billion in agricultural subsidies

the pentagon is likely to propose closing 20 
to 25 major military installations if congress finally approves a 
plan to permit the elimination of unneeded bases a key congressman 
says 
that seems to be about the number that have been recommended 
in the past rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed 
services committee said as the house voted overwhelming approval 
of the complicated plan 
the 37439 vote by the house late tuesday afternoon sends the 
plan to a housesenate conference committee to be reconciled with a 
senate measure approved two months ago 
while the congressional negotiators are working out the legal 
details a bipartisan ninemember commission appointed by defense 
secretary frank c carlucci is already at work trying to come up 
with a list of unneeded bases 
the commission is headed by former sen abe ribicoff dconn 
and former rep jack edwards rala 
carlucci has estimated that between 2 billion and 5 billion a 
year could be saved if unneeded bases were closed 
but congress worried about the loss of jobs has blocked the 
pentagon from closing any major bases since 1977 the commission 
plan was developed as a way to take congress off the hook and it 
is strongly supported by the reagan administration 
the commission is supposed to make its recommendations by dec 
31 president reagan would then have until jan 16 four days 
before he leaves office to accept or reject the entire list he 
could not approve a partial list 
if reagan approved the list the action could be blocked only by 
a majority vote of both the house and senate the closings would 
begin after jan 1 1990 
the pentagon has about 3800 installations in the united states 
but only 355 are major bases that employ more than 300 civilians 
aspin said he said the 20 to 25 bases to be closed would come from 
among that list of 355 
aspin said his figure is based on the historical record he 
noted that the pentagon in 1985 had proposed shutting 22 bases 
after world war ii the pentagon generally was permitted to do 
what it wanted with bases with the exception of a handful 
protected by key members of congress the pentagon closed 3600 
installations between 1961 and 1977 
but things changed after 1975 when the air force proposed 
shutting down loring air force base in northern maine that states 
legislators blocked the move by requiring lengthy and costly 
environmental impact studies for the loring closing and all future 
closings 
the chief author of the baseclosing plan rep dick armey 
rtexas said the vote will go a long way toward cutting fat 
instead of muscle from our national defense 
armeys plan was rejected in 1987 by a 199192 vote but he 
offered the proposal again because he argued that a lameduck 
administration might be willing to approve the unpopular cuts 
rep chalmers wylie rohio told his colleagues for too many 
years obsolete military bases have been treated as sacred cows and 
the country cannot afford this anymore the time has come for 
congress to stiffen its backbone 
house approval came after the chamber on a voice vote rejected 
a proposed amendment that would have required closing overseas 
bases before us bases were shut down there are about 1900 us 
installations in other nations and the commission will study them 
but will not have authority to recommend that any of them be closed

here is a transcript of gov michael dukakis 
announcement tuesday of his choice of sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
as his running mate 
i think massachusetts likes lloyd bentsen and massachusetts 
likes ba beryl ann bentsen and we love you and doesnt my 
bride look fantastic without that collar on 
it is as all of you know because youve been here a while 
exceedingly warm so were going to keep this brief let me begin 
by thanking the chairman of our national committee another son of 
massachusetts that you and i are very very proud of for what he 
has done over the course of the past four years to create the kind 
of winning spirit that will carry mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen to 
the white house in january of 1989 
and i dont have to tell you how i feel this son of 
massachusetts in this historic place with this citys mayor with 
my colleagues the constitutional officers of this state with some 
great democratic party chairs from all over the country welcome to 
massachusetts all of you welcome to massachusetts 
i dont know why bonnie campbell but i look at you and i think 
about iowa and i think of how far weve come and its great to have 
all of you with us paul talked about what happened 28 years ago 
and many of you have heard me say so many times that the parallels 
between 1960 and 1988 are very close indeed then we had had eight 
rather amiable but sleepy years of republicans in the white house 
we had a country that was ready for change a son of massachusetts 
born in our hometown just a mile from where kitty and i live 
winning that nomination reaching out to the state of texas asking 
a great senator from the state of texas to join him on the 
democratic ticket well the republicans in 1960 did what theyre 
about to do in 1988 they nominated an incumbent republican vice 
president jack kennedy and lyndon johnson beat that incumbent 
republican vice president in 1960 and mike dukakis and lloyd 
bentsen are going to beat them in 1988 
selecting a running mate is probably the first presidential act 
if i can use those words that i will do and i dont have to tell 
you how seriously i took this responsibility i am very greatful to 
some very special people who worked with me one in particular 
paul brountas who managed this process and who did a superb job 
little could the greek troika in the class of 1960 at harvard law 
school possibly imagine that dukakis would be the democratic 
nominee for president sarbanes would be a democrat from maryland 
in the united states senate and our counselor and adviser and 
friend would not only be the chairman of our campaign committee but 
the person who managed this wonderful process which has brought us 
lloyd bentsen and im grateful to all of you and to all who worked 
with you 
lloyd bentsen brings to this ticket and will bring to this 
nation years of experience a deep commitment to civil rights and 
equality of opportunity that goes way back to the 1940s and if 
there is one commitment that defines him it is the commitment that 
we share together and that is good jobs and economic opportunity 
for every single citizen in this country no matter who they are or 
where they come from or what the color of their skin and this 
year as one of the most respected democrats and members of the 
united states senate he has hit a grand slam homerun because as 
chairman of the senate finance committee he has personally and 
successfully led the fight for welfare reform for catastrophic 
health insurance for a thoughtful and responsible trade bill and 
for a plant closing law that will give american workers at least 60 
days notice before theyre thrown out on the street and my 
friends if edwin meese can give himself 30 days notice the least 
we can do is give honest hardworking american workers 60 days 
notice before we lay them off 
may i present to you with respect with affection and with 
great pride the next vice president of the united states lloyd 
bentsen

to grow up to be president of the most powerful and prosperous 
nation in the world a man whose living out his parents dreams 
but once that dream of reality for all americans a reality of 
jobs education health care these are the things michael dukakis 
is for and what im impressed with is how he reaches out to the 
rest of the country 
you got a situation in the economy today where its like a piece 
of swiss cheese with holes in it other parts of this economy not 
doing as well as the two coasts but choosing a representative from 
that part of the country once that kind of imput an inclusive 
campaign that reaches out across america thats what michael 
dukakis has done and its going to be a winner 
michael dukakis is a man who didnt turn massachusetts around 
with taxes and spending but he turned it around with some virtues 
that we understand through the southwest and the south the virtues 
of hard work the entrepreneurial spirit integrity and he brought 
effective management of the taxpayers dollar to a new high and 
im impressed with that kind of record and so is the country

texas sen lloyd bentsens moderate record 
over 24 years in congress makes him a relatively tough target for 
critics as he sets out to carry the democratic vicepresidential 
standard 
but on some issues including the highprofile matter of us 
policy toward nicaragua he is at odds with the man who chose him 
michael dukakis 
himself a millionaire businessman bentsen has consistently 
backed favorable tax treatment for businesses particularly his 
homestate oil industry and believes in minimizing governments 
regulatory hand on industry 
he has been hawkish when it comes to supporting weapons 
programs backing the modernization of us nuclear capability by 
voting for systems such as the mx missile and b1 bomber 
those conservative stances have been balanced by a strong civil 
rights record and by positions in favor of pension reform 
permitting housewives to establish individual retirement accounts 
and providing prenatal care for poor pregnant women he also has 
supported the supreme court decision that legalized abortion 
bentsen also has been behind some of the democrats most potent 
political issues this year the trade bill including a provision 
requiring worker notification of impending plant closings and 
protection against costs of catastrophic health care 
lloyd bentsen is a centrist democrat said oilstate 
colleague sen j bennett johnston dla all democrats supported 
his trade bill and supported his tax policies he builds a 
coalition hes not out on the fringe 
he is out of step with his campaign partner however on one 
matter that leaped into the headlines this week us relations 
with nicaragua 
bentsen like many other southern democrats has supported the 
administrations policy of giving weapons to the contra rebels to 
put military pressure on the leftist managua government dukakis is 
a staunch opponent of the policy calling instead for nonmilitary 
solutions to the countrys political schism 
senate leaders rescheduled a defense money bill which had been 
expected to come to the floor this week until after the democratic 
convention in part because an anticipated contra military aid 
amendment would have highlighted the disagreement between the two 
men at a time when the united states and nicaragua have expelled 
each others top diplomats and plunged relations even further into 
the deep freeze 
also bentsen has favored allowing prayer in public schools 
imposing fees on imported oil and passing a constitutional 
amendment to balance the federal budget and he voted for reagans 
1981 tax cuts and he supports the death penalty dukakis is on the 
opposite side of each of those issues 
politically the mix has helped bentsen thrive in a state where 
ronald reagan won big victories in 1980 and 1984 and where 
democratic influence has waned in recent years his strength has 
helped him build a respected statewide organization in texas and 
become congress most successful fundraiser 
the federal election commission says bentsen in the 15 months 
ending march 31 raised more than 5 million toward his senate 
reelection bid of that amount 146 million was in 
specialinterest money more than any other congressional candidate 
that the bentsen record and organization lend strength to the 
democratic ticket seemed to be indirectly supported by the comments 
of conservative republicans who preferred tuesday to ignore the 
texan and instead aim their barbs at the likely presidential 
nominee 
i dont think republicans are going to be running against 
lloyd bentsen said gop sen phil gramm another texan 
republicans are going to be running against michael dukakis the 
distinctions are just so clear that bentsen is not an issue 
bentsen has for the most part avoided personal controversy 
during his sixyear house stint beginning in 1949 and during his 
three senate terms the most notable recent exception was his 
establishment of a 10000perperson breakfast club for lobbyists 
last year after he took over as chairman of the taxwriting senate 
finance committee he disbanded the effort as soon as it became 
public acknowledging a doozy of a mistake 
despite dukakis rejection of presidential runnerup jesse 
jackson for the no 2 spot on the ticket civil rights advocates 
were generally positive on bentsens record 
one of his first votes after being elected to the house in 1948 
was to oppose the poll tax considered a courageous move for a 
firstterm southerner and bentsen tells of making a hotel he owned 
in houston the first integrated hotel in the city said ralph neas 
executive director of the leadership conference on civil rights 
bentsen is a sponsor of fair housing legislation and voted for 
the civil rights restoration bill an extension of the voting 
rights act and for the bill making martin luther kings birthday a 
holiday neas noted 
it might almost be said that bentsen takes moderation to an 
extreme in 1986 he was given perfect middleofthe road voting 
ratings of 50 percent by both the liberal aflcio and the american 
conservative union 
last year according to a voting analysis by congressional 
quarterly bentsen supported president reagan on 47 percent of 
issues on which the white house announced a position and opposed 
the president 50 percent of the time 
on matters where party unity was a key to the outcome bentsen 
sided with fellow democrats 78 percent of the time a figure 
roughly midway between the partys high of 95 percent and the low 
of 50 percent

democrat michael s dukakis who frequently 
invokes the legacy of massachusetts john f kennedy has again 
wrapped himself in the kennedy mantle by picking a texas senator as 
his running mate 
many of you have heard me say so many times that the 
parallels between 1960 and 1988 are very close indeed dukakis 
said on tuesday while formally announcing his selection of sen 
lloyd bentsen 
like kennedy dukakis was born in brookline mass and he has 
spent a lifetime in democratic politics and like kennedy dukakis 
is competing for the presidency at the end of a twoterm republican 
administration 
on tuesday dukakis added another similarity to the list like 
kennedy who picked senate majority leader lyndon johnson as his 
running mate dukakis turned his eyes to texas when it was time to 
fill out the ticket 
bentsen for his part shares some political roots with johnson 
both were proteges of the late house speaker sam rayburn of texas 
products of the moderate wing of the texas democratic party and 
rose to powerful senate posts 
in 1960 the republicans nominated their sitting vice president 
richard nixon and lost a close election dukakis said tuesday that 
he hoped history would repeat itself 
jack kennedy and lyndon johnson beat that incumbent republican 
vice president in 1960 and mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen and 
going to beat them in 1988 he said 
sen edward m kennedy jfks only surviving brother gave his 
blessing to dukakis choice 
the massachusettstexas combination got this country moving 
again in 1960 and it will do the same for the nation in 1988 
said kennedy whose own early decision not to run this year cleared 
the way for dukakis to enter the presidential race 
texas rep martin frost a 10year veteran of the house who 
knows bentsen said even before bentsen was picked ive thought 
there were parallels with 1960 
unlike bentsen however johnson was actively seeking the 
presidency for himself up until kennedy was nominated and by some 
accounts kennedy offered johnson the no 2 spot in the belief he 
would turn it down 
observers with ties to both massachusetts and texas were tickled 
by tuesdays turn of events 
texas transplant james jim howell a vice president and 
economist at the bank of boston called it a great day for the 
republic of texas 
im absolutely delighted that gov dukakis shows such 
remarkable timing and judgment howell said he said bentsen 
could help dukakis in texas where dukakis is not all that well 
known 
my relatives have been calling repeatedly and asking who he 
is the banker said 
but theres only so much bentsen can do for the nominee howell 
said 
the baptists will aircondition hell before lloyd bentsen can 
teach dukakis to talk texan he said

defense secretary frank c carlucci is urging 
defense contractors to rein in their private consultants but says 
his job is not to punish companies in the pentagon bribery 
probe 
carlucci appeared before the senate armed services committee on 
tuesday to explain his decision to rescind contract payment 
suspensions he had imposed july 1 on nine defense contractors 
carlucci said a navy review showed the contracts hadnt been 
tainted as he had feared when he acted on the basis of fbi 
affidavits outlining alleged trading in inside pentagon contracting 
information 
my job is not to punish companies my job is to protect the 
national security carlucci said noting that its up to the 
justice department to prosecute alleged legal violations 
but he added if other official information becomes available 
during the course of the investigation which warrants new concern 
regarding these or other contracts the department will evaluate it 
and take any appropriate action 
carlucci characterized the suspensions as a warning and said 
he is writing the heads of the nations top 200 defense contractors 
to urge them to ensure stringent management controls on the use 
of consultants to avoid improper business practices 
the investigation focuses on allegations that defense 
contractors and their consultants bribed pentagon officials for 
inside information that could have been vital in bidding for 
contracts worth billions of dollars no charges have yet been filed 
carlucci has appointed a task force to look at the complicated 
weapons procurement process and recommend any needed changes he 
urged congress to let that panel do its job hasty or piecemeal 
reforms could do more harm than good he said 
in addition some of the wrongdoing being uncovered may simply 
be violations of the law not system deficiencies he said 
but he admitted there are problems that need to be fixed 
there are defects in how america equips its forces 
one of those he noted is what i would term intervention 
points opportunities for friendships or political clout to carry 
more weight than contractor performance or product quality and 
cost 
we can reduce these opportunities for intervention through 
such techniques as longterm contracts simplifying specifications 
freezing weapons designs contracting to performance and 
multiyear approvals of programs he said 
while carlucci was promising more reviews of contracts the 
justice department is weighing a request from some defense lawyers 
to investigate the source of leaks to the press 
john russell a department spokesman said officials are looking 
at the letter sent july 8 to michael e shaheen jr head of the 
justice departments office of professional responsibility 
the letter signed by 16 attorneys for people and companies in 
the defense probe said we are writing to you to request that 
you commence an investigation and take appropriate remedial action 
to deal with the virtual flood of leaks by department of justice 
employees involved in or privy to the details of the 
investigation 
russell said it was too early to determine that we will 
undertake an investigation shaheen who has responsibility for 
investigating ethics cases involving justice employees refused to 
comment 
investigations into leaks are not unusual russell said at 
one time we have anywhere from 10 to 15 leak investigations going 
on he said some of those include improper revelations of 
classified material 
the letter claims the frequency and substance of these news 
leaks have been unprecedented and are unfair to the people whose 
names have surfaced in the investigation 
the letter outlined seven statutes regulations or rules that 
bar justice employees from revealing unauthorized material one law 
carries a fine of up to 1000 and imprisonment of a year for 
divulging certain material other penalties can include a letter of 
censure or dismissal 
henry e hudson the us attorney in alexandria va who is 
coordinating the massive probe has also expressed concern about 
leaks in the case which was brought to public attention june 14 
fbi agents conducted surprise searches on more than three dozen 
homes and offices in 12 states that day

us military helicopters drove off iranian 
gunboats attacking a panamanianflagged tanker in the persian gulf 
in the first such exchange of fire since the downing of iran air 
flight 655 the pentagon said 
the iranian gunboats were firing at the 81282ton universal 
monarch which signaled at about 1130 am edt tuesday that it 
was being attacked and was on fire said defense department 
spokesman dan howard 
a lamps mk iii surveillance helicopter from the guidedmissile 
frigate uss nicholas plus two attack helicopters responded to the 
mayday call said lt col david titus a spokesman for us 
central command in tampa headquarters for american forces in the 
gulf 
as the armed helicopters approached the universal monarch two 
small boats were seen departing the area said titus the boats 
fired at the helicopters at approximately 12 noon edt and the 
helicopters returned their fire with rockets and machine gun fire 
it is believed one of the boats was damaged there was no 
damage to the helicopters and no us casualties the universal 
monarch suffered some hull engine and and fire damage no 
casualties were reported and the ship required no further 
assistance acording to its master 
pentagon spokesmen declined to identify the attack helicopters 
but it was believed they were army ah6s flown by special 
operations forces attached to the us fleet in the gulf and 
operated from specially outfitted barges 
the incident happened in the northern persian gulf 23 nautical 
miles west northwest of farsi island which has been used by irans 
revolutionary guards to launch attacks by small boats against 
neutral shipping in the gulf 
the londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit said the 
universal monarch is owned by a hong kong company and managed by 
the japanese company tokudo shasen kk of tokyo 
the vessel flying a panamanian flag was sailing empty to pick 
up cargo from the khafji fields owned jointly by kuwait and saudi 
arabia according to shipping executives in the gulf who spoke on 
condition they not be identified by name 
howard said that to my knowledge this is the first such 
exchange since the incident of july the third when the uss 
vincennes mistakenly shot down an iran air jetliner killing all 
290 people aboard 
since the vincennes incident iran has attacked two commercial 
vessels the norwegianowned tanker berge strand and the 
romanianowned freighter plataresti 
in the tanker war that is an offshoot of the 8yearold 
iraniraq war iran attacks neutral shipping in the gulf in 
retaliation for iraqi raids on its oil tankers 
last thursday iraqi warplanes raided two supertankers in the 
vicinity of irans kharg island oil terminal at the northeastern 
end of the gulf the greekowned 264108ton fellowship l and the 
cypriot 215780ton star ray were set afire but no casualties were 
reported 
the iranian ship attacks have continued despite a broadened role 
for us navy warships in the gulf enabling them to protect 
commercial vessels even if they do not fly the stars and stripes 
in another development the pentagon announced the completion of 
the 46th us convoy through the gulf as the uss robert g bradley 
finished escorting the reflagged kuwaiti tanker townsend to 
international waters off kuwait at about 740 am edt tuesday

state and local government leaders recommended 
tax increases and reforms in entitlement programs to a national 
commission studying ways to reduce the federal budget deficit but 
few of the witnesses had specific proposals 
the witnesses offered their recommendations tuesday to the 
national economic commission which will present its findings to 
the new president and congress in late december 
new hampshire gov john h sununu chairman of the national 
governors association called for the reform of major 
nonmeans tested entitlements social security medicare 
veterans benefits farm subsidies and federal pensions 
that is obviously the hard political decision he told the 
12member bipartisan panel which was holding its third public 
hearing 
democratic washington attorney robert strauss cochairman of 
the bipartisan commission along with former reagan administration 
transportation secretary drew lewis unsuccessfully pressed sununu 
for details saying were trying to craft a political solution 
thats salable 
sununu replied it is one of the luxuries that i have now of 
being on this side of the table with you on that side of the table 
charged by congress to address those tough decisions that i say 
were proud youre there and we hope you make the right choice 
sununu a close adviser to vice president george bush did not 
talk specifically about tax hikes but he said revenue options 
should be considered only after a spending restriction and other 
reforms are enacted 
he said spending on domestic programs should be allowed to rise 
at about half of the rate of inflation while military spending 
should increase at 1 percent to 3 percent above the rate of 
inflation 
in contrast john h stroger jr a cook county ill 
commissioner called for tax hikes for the richest 10 percent of 
individuals and corporations 
stroger who was representing the national association of 
counties said various tax cuts passed during the reagan 
administration have had the net effect of reducing tax revenue by 
158 billion next year probably enough to wipe out the projected 
1989 budget deficit 
those who benefited from tax cuts should now pay their share 
towards deficit reduction he said unfortunately some 
policymakers want to avoid the hard decision to increase revenues 
by looking only at the expenditure side of the budget equation 
any comprehensive solution to the deficit problem must 
look at that terrible t word call it revenue enhancement or 
whatever we simply must pay for our needs agreed trenton nj 
mayor arthur j holland president of the us conference of mayors 
calls for more taxes were greeted by skepticism from members of 
the commission 
its going to be extremely difficult for us to accommodate the 
needs of various groups like yours when our fundamental job is to 
cut spending lewis now head of union pacific corp told 
stroger 
the witnesses were unanimous in urging the commission to avoid 
recommending new federal taxes in areas traditionally reserved for 
the states such as sales taxes 
i urge you to reject proposals for a national sales or 
valueadded tax said colorado state sen ted strickland 
president of the national conference of state legislatures 
states rely heavily upon sales taxes the impact of a 
national sales tax on state fiscal systems would be severe

senate and house negotiators must square the 
differences between the fiscal 1989 transportation appropriations 
bills that both chambers have now passed but their work is already 
shadowed by a threatened veto over appropriations for mass transit 
and amtrak 
the senate passed its version of the legislation tuesday a 
106 billion measure that ignores president reagans efforts to 
rein in federal spending for local mass transit systems and for 
amtrak the passenger railroad the vote was 916 
reagan administration officials complaining that the bill would 
spend 23 billion more than the president believes is justified 
say they will urge him to veto the measure 
the next step is for house and senate bargainers to reach a 
compromise on the measure which covers the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 the house passed a 108 billion version of the bill on 
june 29 
the senate bill would allow expenditures of an additional 143 
billion from taxes that are collected on fuels and other items and 
are set aside for aviation highway and mass transit programs 
mass transit programs would receive nearly 32 billion under 
the legislation double what reagan wants the legislation also 
would provide 581 million to amtrak the federally subsidized 
passenger railroad 
the bill would bring spending for the coast guard to 3 billion 
provide 65 billion for the federal aviation administration and 
set aside 116 billion for highway programs 
as usual the legislation contains pet projects for the home 
states of members of the appropriations committee among them are 
35 million for work on route 1 in new jersey home state of 
democratic sen frank r lautenberg 16 million for a road project 
in buckhannon and upshur counties in west virginia home of senate 
majority leader robert byrd and 4 million for a bridge in nashua 
nh home of republican sen warren rudman 
the bill would make it harder for a developer to build a 
shopping mall and other buildings on a parcel of land in manassas 
va that was part of the battlefield of the second battle of bull 
run an 1862 confederate victory it would forbid the federal 
government to approve the construction of highway interchanges in 
the area 
the legislation also would prohibit bostons logan airport from 
receiving federal assistance unless its system of higher landing 
fees for small planes receives a green light from the department of 
transportation the case is considered a harbinger for how other 
major congested airports around the nation will handle private 
aviation in future years 
logan officials raised landing fees for private and commuter 
aircraft on july 1 trying to encourage the smaller planes to use 
suburban airfields and ease congestion for airline passengers 
the amendment would require the transportation department to 
decide by dec 5 whether the new charges discriminate against small 
aircraft users if the agency decides against the new fees federal 
aid to logan will be withheld unless airport officials change their 
plan 
an amendment was included to suspend for one year the penalties 
leveled against states whose motorists consistently ignore the 55 
mph speed limit 
if authorities find that more than half the drivers monitored 
are driving above 55 mph a state can lose up to 10 percent of its 
federal highway aid that requirement however was not extended to 
states that raised their maximum driving speeds to 65 mph under a 
federal law passed last year an omission that has sparked 
complaints of unfairness by lawmakers from 55 mph states 
the amendment sponsored by sens daniel p moynihan dny 
and alfonse damato rny was approved on a voice vote new york 
is one of three states the others are california and north dakota 
whose drivers have been found to have been driving too fast and 
which risk losing some of their federal road assistance 
moynihan said the oneyear suspension would give congress a 
chance to make the law more consistent

the chairman of a house subcommittee is 
accusing the securities and exchange commission of yielding to 
pressure from the brokerage industry over a proposal to widen the 
choices investors have in disputes with brokers 
rep edward markey dmass chairman of the house 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee told sec chairman 
david s ruder on tuesday that his agency apparently suffered a 
failure of nerve after receiving a firestorm of criticism from 
industry lobbyists 
last month the sec considered proposing a bill that would have 
allowed the agency to ban contracts that bind investors to 
arbitration instead of going to court 
clauses that require binding arbitration are standard in many 
brokerage contracts they have been under scrutiny since the 
october stock market crash which generated thousands of complaints 
by investors claiming they had been treated poorly by brokers 
the commission decided against submitting such legislation 
instead at its july 7 meeting the sec voted to ask the exchanges 
to study the issue and report by oct 15 
markey complained to ruder who was appearing before the 
telecommunications panel that the brokerage industry has had 
numerous contacts with the sec in recent weeks to complain about 
efforts to rein in arbitration 
im sure these visitors spoke with one voice in a chorus of 
opposition to any interference with their right to impose 
arbitration clauses on investors markey said 
a bill was introduced last week by rep rick boucher dva 
that would forbid brokers from requiring that their customers agree 
to binding arbitration it also would require that brokers make 
investors aware of arbitration clauses in contracts and alter some 
arbitration procedures such as requiring written decisions 
ruder however said such legislation seems unnecessary he said 
many brokerage companies have told the sec in recent weeks that 
they have abandoned plans to include the arbitration clauses in 
their contracts 
i think where the industry is going has changed ruder said 
ruder told the lawmakers that congress should hold off action 
until oct 15 when the nations stock exchanges have been asked to 
offer suggestions on the matter 
markey and others pointed out that congress is scheduled to 
adjourn for the year in early october that would mean if lawmakers 
were to withhold legislation until the industry offers its 
suggestions congress could not act until next year 
the brokerage industry has argued that arbitration is a quick 
relatively inexpensive way of resolving disputes between investors 
and brokers critics however have argued that investors often 
dont realize they are agreeing to limit themselves to arbitration 
and should not be denied an opportunity to go to court

a power outage affecting thousands of staten 
island customers tuesday caused a treatment plant to spew 2 million 
gallons of sewage an hour into new york harbor and gave the city a 
new reason to close beaches 
the outage began monday and continued until 430 pm tuesday 
except for a twohour respite tuesday morning authorities said 
parks commissioner henry stern tuesday announced the closing of 
coney island brighton and manhattan beaches in brooklyn and 
south wolfes pond park and midland beaches on staten island 
midland beach already was closed because of the discovery of 
blood samples and other medicaltype debris beginning last 
wednesday there and on long island beaches where beaches had 
reopened by tuesday 
just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water 
misfortune strikes again said stern 
once power is restored it will be very quick to open on 
control plant between staten island and bayonne nj said tina 
casey a spokesman for the department of environmental protection 
in another beach pollution development state health 
commissioner dr david axelrod said tuesday in albany that a vial 
that washed ashore last week on long island contained blood from a 
person exposed to the aids virus 
tests showed that the seal on the vial and on two other glass 
vials containing human blood that were found on long island beaches 
last week hadnt leaked and allowed tainted blood to escape 
axelrod said 
while the results confirm some of our fears about the 
dangers of the medical debris that washed up on the shoreline last 
week and temporarily closed some beaches axelrod said we do not 
feel the presence of these materials represents a significant 
public health hazard 
while there is always the remote possibility of transmission 
of the virus by someones stepping on a tube of blood breaking the 
containers sustaining a cut and in effect injecting himself with 
the blood containing a sufficient dose of the live virus we do not 
believe that this is a significant likelihood axelrod said

irans attempts this week to elicit 
international condemnation of the downing of iran air flight 655 
could also give us officials a chance to demand answers to 
several puzzles that only iran can provide 
iran is taking the us downing of its airliner onto the 
international stage beginning today in hopes of bringing worldwide 
pressure to bear on the united states to withdraw its naval forces 
from the persian gulf 
but in going before the international civil aviation 
organization today and the un security council on thursday iran 
may also give the united states a chance to demand answers from 
tehran on several key questions 
chief among them are whether the airliner was indeed 
broadcasting some of its identification signals on a military 
channel and if so why 
meanwhile in the persian gulf rear adm william fogarty is 
heading the us investigation to determine why the sophisticated 
radar and tracking system aboard the vincennes mistook the a300 
airbus for an f14 fighter and to determine how the ships 
skipper capt will c rogers iii reached his decision to fire 
defense secretary frank c carlucci testifying before the 
senate armed services committee said tuesday the investigation 
will take at least another two weeks to complete fogarty 
originally was given 15 days after the july 3 incident to finish 
his report with an option to extend 
here are some of the questions the us investigators will 
address and the answers in many cases only partial that have 
been suggested so far 
q why did vincennes believe the airbus was an f14 
a pentagon spokesman dan howard has said the most compelling 
reason was that the airbus was broadcasting two identification 
signals one using a frequency and a code used by both civilian and 
military aircraft the other using a frequency used only by 
military aircraft and a code associated with iranian f14s 
investigators are looking for further confirmation of the two 
signals if the signals were sent iran has not explained why 
q did the vincennes officers realize a commercial aircraft was 
due in the area 
a officers in the wardroom of the vincennes thumbed frantically 
through a commercial schedule but did not see flight 655 from 
bandar abbas to dubai howard said that the plane was 27 minutes 
off schedule and fourandahalf miles off the center of a 
commercial air corridor iran says it recognizes an air corridor 20 
miles wide and that in any case the plane was within the 
ninemilewide corridor recognized by other nations 
q do f14s pose a special threat 
a us commanders in the gulf were on heightened alert over 
that weekend in part because they had received intelligence 
reports from multiple sources that you can expect a fourth of 
july surprise according to an official familiar with the 
incident 
additionally iran recently moved several of its estimated 15 
f14 fighters to bandar abbas the f14 the most sophisticated 
iranian plane has been used sparingly in combat although one did 
shoot down an iraqi f1 last february for the most part iran uses 
the sophisticated radar system aboard the f14 to spot possible 
iraqi air attacks against tankers carrying iranian oil through the 
gulf according to pentagon and congressional sources 
q iranian officials say that flight 655 had been in radio 
contact with air traffic control although it is not clear whether 
this was before or after it took off did american forces overhear 
such communications 
a the investigation will reveal whether us listening posts 
monitored such radio broadcasts say pentagon spokesmen but the 
vincennes did not hear the broadcasts howard said such broadcasts 
are made on vhf wavelengths which are best received within sight of 
the transmitter said one pentagon expert if a us surveillance 
aircraft had been aloft it might have overheard transmissions from 
the iran flight while it was on the ground

after one last latenight meeting the decision 
was made michael dukakis the democratic presidential 
nomineeapparent would ask lloyd bentsen to be his running mate 
the call was put through and the call went unanswered 
bentsen the texas senator had gotten tired of fielding 
midnight calls from reporters about the vice presidential selection 
process so he unplugged his phone and went to sleep 
he got word of dukakis offer the next day at 630 am he was 
shaving he said yes 
it marked the end of a fiveweek search that began the day after 
a long grueling primary season 
dukakis anxious to avoid appearing arrogant refused to talk 
about the topic of running mates while the race for the nomination 
was still on 
on the night of june 7 in the final four primaries dukakis 
clinched the delegates he needed on the morning of june 8 at 
breakfast campaign chairman paul brountas presented dukakis with a 
long memo outlining qualifications for the no 2 spot 
then brountas a college classmate and longtime confidant of 
dukakis began painstakingly gathering information on prospective 
running mates 
he said he gained the confidence of the 200 or so people he 
consulted by describing himself as a committee of one who would 
pass information only to dukakis 
the boston lawyer assembled a team of lawyers and tax 
accountants to investigate the finalists none of them he said 
were eliminated from consideration as a result of the background 
checks but he refused to say why bentsen won out 
in a recent interview bentsen had insisted he wasnt 
interested saying fellow texan lyndon johnson kennedys pick in 
1960 had repeatedly complained about the job 
brountas knew otherwise 
he had met with bentsen in midjune and the senate finance 
committee chairman indicated to me he would accept if asked 
brountas recalled tuesday 
the process of course was meant to be secret dukakis team 
sequestered on the fifth floor of his campaign headquarters 
jokingly called their task the manhattan project 
but the search took place to a large extent in the public eye 
reporters tracked brountas as he made his rounds they trailed 
dukakis when he came to capitol hill to talk with prospective 
running mates they staked out the statehouse when potential 
candidates came to boston 
in due course the names emerged 
ohio sen john glenn the astronaut and hero was the early 
favorite his chances were hurt as the brountas team reviewed his 
unorganized 1984 presidential campaign nevertheless he remained 
the leading choice among many democrats as they began to prepare 
for next weeks convention 
another leading choice was georgia sen sam nunn whose foreign 
policy and defense expertise conservative views and southern base 
were seen as three attributes certain to help a dukakisled ticket 
first there were reports nunn would also want to serve as defense 
secretary ultimately he told dukakis he wasnt interested 
there were two candidates who had developed quick rapports with 
dukakis new jersey sen bill bradley and indiana rep lee 
hamilton bradley bowed out and hamilton a virtual unknown from a 
predominantly republican state would have been a risky choice 
florida sen bob graham offered the democrats a chance in 
florida but the former governor in his first senate term lacked 
the washington experience dukakis was looking for 
sen albert gore of tennessee and rep richard gephardt of 
missouri both had strengths but had criticized dukakis when they 
were still in the presidential race they also placed behind jesse 
jackson and picking one of them could have offended jacksons 
supporters 
every major poll showed jackson would hurt the ticket despite 
dukakis statement that the civil rights leader was getting very 
serious consideration right up to the decision was made 
jacksons flamboyance and lack of government experience all but 
ruled him out from the outset 
so it came down to bentsen in that final meeting monday night 
in dukakis brookline home 
while he waited for brountas to arrive dukakis mowed the lawn 
after the meeting ended he took out the trash 
with the kitchen clock approaching midnight dukakis looked 
around the table with him were his wife kitty brountas campaign 
manager susan estrich and deputy jack corrigan 
bentsen was the choice of all four dukakis made it unanimous 
thats my choice he said 
like his close friend dukakis brountas is serious determined 
disciplined little inclined to show his feelings 
but as he drove away from dukakis home that night his weighty 
task completed brountas was smiling broadly

iran denied involvement in the terrorist 
attack on a greek cruise ship and said the cia may have carried it 
out to whitewash the us attack on an iranian airliner last 
week 
the iranian foreign ministry said tuesday in a statement 
broadcast by tehran radio that the united states is confronted 
with a major difficulty in the face of world public opinion and 
political and international circles after its navy shot down the 
iran air a300 airbus on july 3 killing all 290 people aboard 
in view of the nature of imperialism and its inhuman attitude 
it can be predicted that the american espionage network the cia 
and its agents may commit such unpleasant incidents in various 
parts of the world in order to whitewash the disaster of the attack 
on the iranian passenger airliner the statement said 
up to 11 people were killed and 98 wounded when terrorists 
opened fire with automatic weapons and hurled grenades aboard the 
greek cruise ship city of poros on monday 
greek authorities speculated tuesday that proiranian arab 
terrorists may be responsible 
irans ambassador to greece habibullah biazar said the 
speculation was a pack of lies he spoke in an interview in 
athens with tehrans official islamic republic news agency 
irna monitored in nicosia quoted him as saying we 
categorically condemn such acts of terrorism against innocent 
people which damage the interests of a friendly and peaceloving 
country like greece 
he denied police reports that an iranian magazine was found 
around the wreckage of a car that exploded monday six hours before 
the ship attack two people were killed in the blast near the city 
of poros dock 
biazar said the magazine was arabic iranians speak farsi

they have been called unsung heroes the legions 
of nurses who have devoted their working lives to the aids 
epidemic on thursday the federal government honors 14 a way to 
celebrate the dedication and compassion of them all associated 
press writers lisa levitt ryckman and jerry estill profile two of 
them in sidebyside stories terry miles who helped change the 
way an entire city cared for aids patients and dorothy 
wardwimmer who comforts dying children

terry miles entered the eye of the epidemic 
three years ago to find an aids ward where he could nurse patients 
his way with healthy doses of compassion care and dignity 
i found there was no such thing in new york miles said 
recalling those days of disillusionment and most of the time i 
was treated curtly and i was a registered nurse looking for a job 
so if i was being treated that way then how were the people 
needing the care being treated 
he already knew the answer he had seen it in the florida 
hospital where hed worked food trays left outside rooms by nurses 
and orderlies too frightened to venture in health care workers 
donning mask gown and gloves just to peek at an aids patient 
through a halfopened door four years into the epidemic people 
were still being abandoned starved for human contact because of 
fear and ignorance 
it was an agonizing ache within me to do something about 
that the 32yearold miles said he was preparing to leave new 
york when a call came from kathleen mcguirk a former colleague who 
had become nursing director at st clares a small aging roman 
catholic hospital tucked into manhattans tough hells kitchen 
neighborhood 
she was planning to open an aids ward there the citys first 
i came to new york willing and assuming i would be a small 
participant miles said i didnt come here with any notion to 
be a person to create the healthcare system for people with hiv 
infections 
he did it anyway less than six months after he arrived miles 
was running st clares new spellman services center a model for 
other hospitals 
on thursday he and 13 other nurses who care for aids patients 
will receive awards in washington from the federal government dr 
robert e windom assistant health and human services secretary 
called nurses the unsung heroes of the aids epidemic 
looking back on it i dont think any of us really knew what 
we were doing in the sense of how much work it was going to be 
how involved we were going to become how almost three years later 
were still growing and changing and looking like were never going 
to finish said miles now the hospitals assistant nursing 
director but this little hospital that could did by doing 
not by talking the issue to death 
what miles began as one 15bed unit has grown to five units with 
60 beds with 25 more by the end of july the outpatient program 
sees 250 people a week for a variety of services including 
treatment education and counseling 
spellman runs a secured unit for state prisoners with aids and 
a new neuropsychiatric unit is in the works for people too sick to 
be outpatients but too well to be in acute care 
getting this far has been a struggle from the beginning many 
inside st clares were hostile and resistant miles mcguirk and a 
few other nurses did it alone 
there were times literally for days when we didnt walk 
out of this hospital said miles whose robust blond blueeyed 
good looks bespeak indefatigable energy we would take turns 
sleeping on the table in the staff education room because we had 
to be here 
ellen altmann a nurse who came to spellman three weeks after it 
opened in 1985 and now is its clinical coordinator said miles held 
the project together 
when there were problems on the spellman unit and we had 
many many problems of people being frightened the only thing 
that calmed the staff down was being able to talk to terry she 
said he never got annoyed or distraught and he really did take 
a lot of abuse in the beginning we all did he remained like a 
rock 
the boy who grew up in smalltown kentucky the youngest of six 
children came to nursing 13 years ago looking for security 
english majors were waiting tables nursing students were getting 
jobs 
he discovered that nursing fulfilled his need to be needed and 
nurtured his special gift an ability to educate people to break 
down barriers the aids epidemic has brought miles into his own he 
spends 70 percent of his time teaching dispelling ignorance about 
the virus around the country with almost evangelical zeal 
one of the best lessons he has taught his staff altmann said 
is the importance of touch the gesture the hug that can heal as 
powerfully as any medicine 
working with people with aids more than anything else makes 
you realize youre working with individuals not with diseases not 
with illnesses but with individuals miles said were here to 
care about people and wherever that caring takes us is where we 
willingly go

for george bush the selection of sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas the man who beat him in a 1970 senate race for 
the no 2 spot on the democratic ticket must bring back haunting 
memories 
but the choice which caught bush supporters by surprise could 
give the vice president new latitude in selecting his own running 
mate 
it was against bentsen that bush lost his last solo general 
election race 
but if democrats think that naming bentsen with his proven 
record of beating bush on home turf will bedevil the certain 
republican nominee and hand over texas and the south they may have 
miscalculated according to bush backers 
people in texas want a president not a vice president said 
bushs campaign manager lee atwater 
atwater claims bentsens selection may give dukakis an immediate 
surge in the polls in texas but that will settle down and after 
all is said and done george bush is going to win texas 
still the name of the game is electoral votes and texas has 29 
of them a bonanza that could help put the democrats over the top 
if their strategy succeeds 
the fight for texas could bolster arguments for the gop to add a 
westerner to its ticket in a steppedup effort to capture 
californias 47 electoral votes republican california gov george 
deukmejian for instance recent polls suggest dukakis has a 
comfortable lead in california at this time 
at the same time the naming of bentsen does nothing to detract 
from arguments that bush should choose a midwesterner and shore up 
support in an area also rich in electoral votes where republicans 
might otherwise have a difficult time this fall 
that keeps alive prospects that bush might name sen bob dole 
rkans a ticket popular with many republicans or another 
midwesterner possibly illinois gov james thompson or sen nancy 
kassebuam 
bush campaign officials and gop consultants say the bentsen 
selection leaves the choice of bushs running mate wide open thus 
bush supporters welcomed the naming of bentsen even if some did so 
a bit warily 
bush himself had little to say about the selection telling 
reporters on air force ii on his way to cincinnati for the allstar 
baseball game thats interesting thats what i think 
gop consultant eddie mahe said bush is in tall cotton today 
hes now free to choose anyone he wishes to choose 
mahe denied that bentsen would carry the south for the 
democrats saying no one thinks lloyd bentsen is a southerner 
and hes surely not a westerner hes never been in a room with a 
pair of boots 
however mahe and some other gop advisers suggest that bush 
might do well to consider a conservative for the ticket mahes own 
choice either supreme court justice sandra day oconnor or rep 
jack kemp rny 
for one thing bush is likely to step up his own selection of a 
running mate now that the democratic ticket is a known quantity 
he will take a look at the process quickly said bush 
spokeswoman sheila tate she said bush would meet this week with 
campaign adviser robert teeter who is overseeing bushs vice 
presidential selection effort 
however ms tate said bush still plans to withhold announcing 
his choice until the republican national convention if that is 
possible 
bush backers reject the comparison that democrats are making to 
the 1960 ticket of sen john f kennedy of massachusetts and senate 
majority leader lyndon johnson of texas 
im sure were going to hear 1960 ad nauseaum theres a 
slight difference of course he bentsen was not selected by his 
peers to be in leadership nor is dukakis john kennedy said rep

simple inexpensive monitoring of uterine 
contractions during pregnancy can help predict and prevent the 
birth of premature infants whose medical care costs the nation 2 
billion annually a new study shows 
the monitoring done once a week beginning in the seventh month 
of pregnancy identified 70 percent of women who later gave birth 
to premature infants said the studys author dr michael katz of 
the childrens hospital of san francisco 
we can use this data to make prematurity a preventable 
event katz said tuesday not always but most of it he 
said 
about 350000 babies are born prematurely in the united states 
each year said richard leavitt a spokesman for the march of dimes 
in white plains ny ten percent of them have serious health 
problems and the bill for intensive care for premature infants 
totals 2 billion each year leavitt said 
until now doctors have had few ways to identify women likely to 
give birth prematurely katz said in new york at a reporters 
seminar sponsored by the st jude childrens research hospital of 
memphis tenn 
he noted that prevention of premature births could cut medical 
costs drastically by reducing reliance on extremely expensive 
intensive care units for newborns 
the techniques he has devised to prevent premature births might 
add 100 or 200 to the cost of a pregnant womans health care he 
said in comparison it costs about 2000 per day to treat a 
premature infant in a newborn intensive care unit he said 
dr russell chesney professor of pediatrics at the university 
of tennessee and past president of the society for pediatric 
research said after hearing katzs presentation i was struck by 
his results if we could identify those people who would 
benefit it would be very exciting 
chesney added however that many lowincome women might not be 
helped by katzs methods because they dont consult an obstetrician 
during their pregnancy you dont see them they show up two 
weeks before delivery he said 
lowincome women often cannot afford prenatal care and lack of 
prenatal care is statistically linked to a much higher probability 
of premature birth 
katz said his research has focused on the early identification 
and treatment of women likely to have premature births not on the 
social problem of getting care to women who cant afford it 
the key to early identification is a device called a 
tocodynamometer a small instrument worn around the waist that 
measures contractions of the uterus 
in a study of 150 black innercity women in philadelphia katz 
and dr denise main of mt zion hospital in san francisco measured 
the womens uterine contractions with a tocodynamometer in a 
doctors office for one hour once a week from the 28th to the 
32nd weeks of pregnancy katz said 
women who had more than six contractions during an hours 
monitoring were considered at risk of premature birth katz said 
the contractions are mostly too mild for pregnant women to feel 
he said 
that simple method picked out 70 percent of the women who later 
went on to have premature infants he said 
in subsequent studies katz has shown that judicious use of 
socalled tocolytic drugs to control contractions can reduce 
substantially the incidence of premature births 
he emphasized that the women studied did not have any of the 
traditional risk factors for prematurity such as carrying more 
than one fetus or having a history of preterm labor

an opposition leader says the 
sandinista governments crackdown on domestic critics is meant to 
improve its negotiating position in future peace talks with contra 
rebels 
adan fletes a director of the social christian party also said 
tuesday that the leftist governments expulsion of eight us 
diplomats including ambassador richard melton reflected an 
extreme radicalization in policy after president daniel 
ortegas june 2730 visit to cuba 
the government on monday accused the americans of inciting 
unrest and gave them 72 hours to leave the country melton left 
nicaragua tuesday the us embassy said the seven others will 
leave thursday 
in washington president reagan retaliated by ordering 
nicaraguas ambassador and seven other sandinista diplomats out of 
the united states 
also monday the government closed the roman catholic churchs 
radio station radio catolica and shut down the only opposition 
newspaper la prensa for 15 days 
the actions mark a sharp setback in democratic reforms made in 
recent months to comply with a regional peace plan that aims in 
part to end nicaraguas nearly 7yearold civil war 
fletes told the associated press the sandinistas are seeking to 
use the crackdown on dissent as a bargaining chip in future peace 
talks with the ussupported contras who suffered a major blow in 
february when congress refused reagans request to continued 
supplying them with military aid 
fletes said the government could offer an easing of press 
restrictions and more political freedom in exchange for rebel 
concessions 
he did not say what advantages the government could seek 
the sandinistas said part of an alleged us plan to destabilize 
their government was put into effect sunday in nandaime a town 40 
miles south of the capital where fighting broke out between 
security forces and some of the estimated 10000 demonstrators at 
an antigovernment rally 
the sandinistas called the alleged plan between the embassy and 
the domestic opposition plan melton 
some us embassy personnel attended the rally but the embassy 
said it is normal for its diplomats to maintain contact with 
nicaraguans 
ortega said the decision to expel the diplomats was made so the 
united states would learn to respect this country and its 
people he said nicaragua is prepared to confront any type of 
american escalation as a result 
staterun television reported tuesday night that the government 
had determined the eight us diplomats were cia agents it did not 
elaborate 
an interior ministry statement charged la prensa with violating 
internal security and national defense it said the paper incited 
violence and subverted public order 
the sandinistas claim la prensa is the voice of the cia the 
paper receives us funding through the national endowment for 
democracy 
on sunday radio catolicas programming included cardinal miguel 
obando y bravos homily in which he defended the right of the 
people to civic protest 
cristina chamorro assistant director of la prensa said the 
closings of the opposition daily and radio catolica flagrantly 
violate the commitments signed by the sandinista government under 
the regional peace plan and a march 23 preliminary peace accord 
with the rebels 
the government of president daniel ortega demonstrating its 
incapacity to fulfill its obligations to initiate a democratic 
process in nicaragua has decided to silence the nicaraguan 
people she said in a statement tuesday 
in compliance with the regional peace plan signed last august 
the sandinistas allowed radio catolica and la prensa to reopen in 
october after keeping them shut for more than a year 
the government also began authorizing opposition demonstrations 
including sundays rally 
the nicaraguan democratic coordinate an umbrella organization 
of opposition groups that organized sundays demonstration charged 
tuesday that hundreds of its members were being rounded up by 
police 
there was no confirmation from the government 
a coordinate delegation will meet with president oscar arias of 
costa rica in san jose on thursday said alberto saborio of the 
conservative party 
arias won last years nobel peace prize for authoring the 
regional peace plan

the head of the job corps says testing 
candidates for aids without their knowledge is totally against 
our policy even though a recruit claims he was tested unwittingly 
and expelled after showing exposure to the deadly disease 
but job corps director peter rell said he was not aware of the 
specific case of james dorsey 19 who has filed suit against the 
agency 
dorsey says he suffered severe emotional distress trauma 
fear and humiliation when informed of the results of the test 
that he had not been previously told was performed on his blood 
the suit filed in us district court on tuesday seeks an 
injunction to bar the job corps from expelling recruits based on 
test results showing the presence of antibodies against the disease 
rell said corps policy calls for informing the young people 
when they come in that they are going to have their initial 
physical examination including the fact they are going to be 
tested for aids 
the policy which applies to 36000 recruits who live at 105 job 
corps residential training centers provides counseling and help 
enrolling in a nonresidential program if possible for those 
testing positive rell said 
the job corps is required under the policy to refer the recruit 
to a doctor and to attempt to follow up for 90 days rell said 
the lawsuit said however that the policy ignores the 
overwhelming consensus among medical and public health authorities 
that mandatory testing does not inhibit or prevent the spread 
of aids the lawsuit said 
such testing helps create a climate of fear suspicion and 
discrimination the lawsuit said 
expelling recruits who test positive violates the rehabilitation 
acts ban on discriminating against anyone with a physical 
handicap the lawsuit said 
the job corps is just one of a few federal agencies that test 
for aids military recruits and foreign service employees of the 
state department and the agency for international development are 
also tested 
a court challenge by foreign service officers was rejected last 
year by a federal judge here 
us district judge gerhard a gesell ruled in that case that 
the state department was justified in testing for aids to ensure 
that no foreign service officer with aids was sent to a country 
where there were inadequate facilities to treat the disease

vietnamese soldiers helped load 72 tons of 
marijuana onto a ship off danang vietnam a coast guard officer 
said in a hearing for 18 men arrested in what officials call the 
largest west coast maritime drug bust 
the coast guard cutter boutwell seized the panamanianregistered 
encounter bay on june 30 when it was 500 miles off the washington 
coast coast guard officials last week said the vessel was boarded 
because it looked suspicious 
the hearing which continues today was to determine whether 
there was enough evidence to prosecute the 18 crew members who 
could face potential prison terms of several years to life 
lt thomas rogers testified tuesday the coast guard had prior 
information that about 72 tons of highgrade thai marijuana was 
loaded off danang 
rogers the law enforcement officer aboard the boutwell said he 
didnt know whether the cargo was already aboard when the crew got 
on the ship 
asked by defense lawyer peter mair what he knew about who loaded 
the ship rogers said the only additional information i can 
recall is that the vietnamese army was involved he did not 
elaborate 
i am shocked at the revelation mair said 
assistant us attorney jerry diskin refused to comment after 
the hearing 
us drug enforcement administration officials in bangkok 
thailand say there have been reports of merchant vessels taking on 
drugs in danang for shipment to international markets in addition 
there have been unconfirmed reports that impoverished vietnam has 
been growing opium to pay foreign debts 
defense lawyers for the crewmen arrested on felony charges of 
intent to distribute marijuana have tried to prove the seizure 
which the coast guard has called the largest maritime drug bust off 
the west coast was illegal and the crews constitutional rights 
were violated 
rogers testified he didnt know whether documentation was found 
on board that would clarify when and where various crew members 
boarded 
defense lawyers argued that the us government cant prove that 
the crew knew what was aboard the encounter bay and that there 
wasnt probable cause to stop the ship 
rogers testified he believed the crew members were told their 
rights but didnt know whether the rights probably read in 
english were understood by the crewmen from southeast asia 
the encounter bay crew members are three americans one from 
england one from new zealand and 13 from indonesia thailand and 
singapore 
howard weitzman of los angeles representing crew member samuel 
j colflesh 31 of philadelphia and other defense lawyers have 
questioned whether the coast guard had the authority to fire upon 
board search and seize the 180foot converted oil rig supply ship 
in international waters 
us magistrate john weinberg would not allow questions about 
the encounter bays destination saying it was irrelevant to the 
proceeding 
attorney john muenster representing terrance albert nolan 36 
of the united states said the ships destination was relevant 
since part of the charges against the crew require that the 
government prove the ship had either left or was approaching a us 
port or was in us customs territory a term that neither he 
nor rogers could define 
weinberg denied a request by defense lawyers for copies of all 
coast guard communications leading to the encounter bays seizure 
saying the question of jurisdiction on the high seas should be 
addressed at later hearings

a financial officer who worked 24 years for 
the agency for international development faces arraignment today on 
charges he stole 12 million from the government by issuing checks 
to a fictitious person 
william j burns 48 of burtonsville md was taken into 
custody at his office tuesday after being charged in a complaint 
with stealing aid money making false claims against the government 
and racketeering an aid statement said burns allegedly embezzled 
the money over a sixyear period the statement said 
herbert beckington aids inspector general said burns 
unexplained affluence first caught the attention of security 
investigators performing a routine security evaluation last year 
burns earned 35108 annually but he lived in a neighborhood of 
500000 estates and he was able to enjoy expensive cars 
travel exquisite home furnishings and other embellishments 
normally beyond the reach of civil servants of his rank the 
statement said 
an investigation by aid the us postal inspection service and 
the internal revenue service determined that burns allegedly ran a 
scheme that involved the issuing of fictitious us government 
checks to a fictitious person named victor kauffman whose only 
known address was a post office box 
the money deposited in the kauffman account was later 
transferred to burns account at another bank the aid statement 
said 
gene richardson the assistant inspector general for 
investigations at aid said weak internal controls allowed these 
taxpayers dollars to be diverted in a sophisticated yet simple 
manner that avoided detection year after year

henry wilson vice president from 187375 under ulysses s 
grant was a staunch abolitionist crediting with helping found the 
republican party in the 1850s 
bill maddox a spokesman for bentsen confirmed that the senator 
and wilson are related but did not know the lineage 
wilson was senator from massachusetts from 1855 until 1873 when 
he became vice president before that he served in both houses of 
the massachusetts legislature and was state senate president but 
was defeated when he ran for governor in 1853 
wilsons portrait hangs in the massachusetts senate reading 
room after addressing the state senate on tuesday dukakis 
bentsen and bentsens wife beryl made a brief detour into the 
reading room to view the portrait 
in remarks to the massachusetts house bentsen noted that his 
greatgreatuncle had served 18 years in the us senate just 
like bentsen then went on to become vice president he said that 
sounds like a good idea to me 
according to the us house of representatives history office 
wilson was a delegate to the whig party national convention in 1848 
but withdrew from the party because it rejected an antislavery 
resolution

director joshua logan who enthralled postworld 
war ii theatergoers with his deft staging of south pacific 
annie get your gun and other broadway hits has died at the age 
of 79 
although he was known primarily as a stage director logan also 
directed several successful films including paint your wagon 
camelot and the memorable 1956 screen adaption of bus stop 
starring marilyn monroe 
the 1949 musical south pacific which he cowrote 
coproduced and directed won the 1950 pulitzer prize for drama 
logan died tuesday at his manhattan home of a rare progressive 
neurological disease called supranuclear palsy said his widow 
actress nedda harrigan 
no matter how sick he was and how awful it was for him he 
never complained said logans son thomas he went out with a 
lot of courage 
as a director logan was known for his fluid staging 
particularly in supervising the storyheavy musicals that were 
popular after world war ii 
although his broadway career began in 1932 and continued for 
more than 40 years logans biggest stage successes were in the 
late 1940s and early 50s they included such hits as happy 
birthday john loves mary wish you were here 
picnic kind sir and fanny 
that golden period began after logan got out of the army in 1945 
and richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein asked him to direct a new 
musical they were producing but not writing the composer was 
irving berlin and the star was ethel merman the show annie get 
your gun told the story of annie oakley it opened on may 16 
1946 and ran for 1147 performances 
in 1948 logan directed and helped write the stage version of 
mister roberts thomas heggens best seller about the officers 
and crew aboard a navy cargo ship in the pacific during world war 
ii the play with henry fonda originating the title role ran for 
nearly three years 
south pacific which opened the next year and starred mary 
martin and ezio pinza was the biggest hit of logans stage career 
it ran for 1925 performances 
logan coproduced and cowrote the show with hammerstein but 
the pulitzer committee mistakenly awarded the 1950 drama prize to 
rodgers and hammerstein 
the error was corrected but as logan wrote in josh his 
autobiography my name had been so minimized that i lived through 
years of having people praise south pacific in my presence 
without knowing i had had anything to do with it 
among logans movies mostly film versions of broadway 
successes were picnic 1955 sayonara 1957 south 
pacific 1958 tall story 1960 fanny 1961 
camelot 1967 and paint your wagon 1969 
born in texarkana texas on oct 5 1908 logan attended 
princeton university and also studied at the moscow art theater 
under constantin stanislavsky after founding a small theater 
company in the early 1930s he made his new york stage debut in 
1932 in carrie nation three years later logan directed on 
broadway for the first time in the comedy to see ourselves but 
didnt attract attention until 1938 when he staged on borrowed 
time 
logans later efforts on broadway were unsuccessful in 1962 he 
directed two big flop musicals all american which starred 
ray bolger and mr president irving berlins last musical 
miss moffat a 1974 musical version of the corn is green 
starring bette davis died out of town 
logan was a manicdepressive and he often participated in 
medical seminars on the mental illness and appeared on television 
to discuss it saying he felt its manic phase contributed to his 
creativity 
he wrote about the illness in movie stars real people and 
me a collection of anecdotes about his life without the 
illness he said i would have missed the sharpest the rarest 
and yes the sweetest moments of my existence 
logan began taking lithium carbonate in 1969 to control the 
ailment 
miss harrigan said no funeral arrangements would be announced 
were going to have it very very private just the family 
thats what he requested she said 
logan is survived by his wife a daughter harrigan logan of los 
angeles thomas a musician composer and writer who lives in new

the governing partys carlos salinas de 
gortari celebrated a presidential victory while his two main 
opponents called for street demonstrations to protest alleged vote 
fraud in last weeks election 
the federal electoral commission which is dominated by the 
governing institutional revolutionary party said it would not 
release final official results until tonight at the earliest 
but partial returns show salinas winning with just over half of 
the vote the lowest margin of victory for a presidential candidate 
in the partys 59year history 
the party known by its spanish initials pri has never lost a 
presidential race and usually wins with 70 percent of the vote 
leaders of mexicos largest peasant labor and popular 
organizations the three traditional pillars of support for the 
governing party toasted salinas at party headquarters on tuesday 
we believe that today we are stronger than before these 
elections said fidel velazquez veteran leader of the powerful 
mexican labor confederation who referred to the candidate as 
presidentelect 
the confederation claims more than 5 million members 
salinas thanked velazquez for the confederations support and 
promised to achieve necessary progress in workers living 
standards 
he declared victory on thursday one day after the voting 
opposition presidential candidate manuel clouthier and about 150 
supporters scuffled with presidential guards on tuesday then vowed 
to lead sitins wherever president miguel de la madrid and salinas 
make public appearances 
he called for a national civil disobedience campaign 
unofficial returns show clouthier of the conservative national 
action party running third behind salinas and cuauhtemoc cardenas 
of the leftist national democratic front 
clouthier and cardenas charge the pri is taking advantage of the 
slow vote count to doctor the final results in favor of salinas 
as de la madrid arrived at the fine arts palace in downtown 
mexico city to make a speech to about 2500 lawyers clouthier 
stood up carrying a sign that read mr president keep your 
word 
he and supporters pushed past a line of about 50 plainclothes 
guards who tried to stop them 
after a scuffle the group sat down at the entrance to the 
building 
inside de la madrid pledged to ensure that the remaining 
stages of the electoral process occur with strict attachment to 
legality 
clouthier also filed criminal charges with the federal attorney 
general against jose newman valenzuela director of the national 
electoral registry he charged newman with overseeing the tampering 
of voter registration rolls to benefit candidates of the governing 
party 
during a rally attended by about 1500 supporters in the citys 
downtown solidarity park cardenas announced a protest march 
against fraud for saturday 
our country already is mobilized our companions in all of the 
republic are deciding not only to defend the personal vote of 
each person we are deciding to defend the democracy of the 
country he said 
the crowd frequently interrupted cardenas speech with chants of 
death to the pri and the people voted and cardenas won 
a week after the elections the federal electoral commission 
still has not finished releasing official results for the chamber 
of deputies the lower house of congress 
the pri on tuesday released data it attributed to the commission 
that shows salinas had 5359 percent of the votes counted cardenas 
was second with 2608 percent and clouthier had 1604 percent 
it did not say how many votes had been counted but said that 
voter turnout had been 517 percent and that the results accounted 
for 235 of 300 elecotral districts mexico has 38 million 
registered voters 
partial commission results gave 241 of the 500 seats in the 
chamber to the governing party 32 to the national action party and 
10 to parties that support cardenas

when sen lloyd bentsen was being suggested as 
a possible candidate for vice president in 1984 he mentioned to a 
friend that the no 2 job had been pure misery for fellow texan 
lyndon b johnson 
lbj had been one of the most powerful members of government 
when he was in the senate and was second banana at the white house 
taking orders from kennedys aides the friend remembered bentsen 
complaining 
four years later political realities and bentsens horizons 
have changed he eagerly announced tuesday he was accepting an 
invitation from michael s dukakis to be his running mate 
were going to fight for every state in the union and were 
going all out to win he vowed in boston with dukakis at his 
side 
bentsen 67 is tall thin and welldressed a millionaire a 
highly decorated world war ii bomber pilot lawyer presbyterian 
and native texan who has close ties with business a strong record 
on civil rights and a history of supporting two of his home states 
biggest industries oil and the military like dukakis he speaks 
fluent spanish 
he is a forceful chairman of the senate finance committee who is 
seldom heard to raise his voice a congressional insider who in 
1976 made a shortlived run for the presidency bentsen is credited 
with having the strongest political organization seen in texas in 
modern times it was he who denied george bush a seat in the senate 
bentsens marked success at fundraising produced the only thing 
approaching a personal scandal during his time in washington 
immediately after ascending to the chairmanship of the finance 
committee in january 1987 bentsen sent word to lobbyists and other 
potential contributors that he would be glad to have breakfast with 
them once a month for a 10000 contribution once the story 
broke and critics raised the specter of a powerful lawmaker 
offering himself for sale it took bentsen only a couple days to 
back down 
im not known to make many mistakes but when i do its a 
doozy he said in a statement and in forming that breakfast 
club i really blew it the last thing i want is anything that 
would reflect on my integrity 
until taking over the finance committee bentsen was little 
known outside the washington establishment despite six years in 
the house and 16 years in the senate 
he had had a stint in the late 1970s as chairman of the joint 
economic committee a panel that does not write legislation and 
used the post to advocate tax cuts to spur investment and savings 
long before president reagan came to power with promises of such a 
program 
by the time sen russell b long dla retired as chairman of 
the finance committee in 1986 giving bentsen a chance to push his 
own ideas reagans plan had been written into law 
bentsen often is described as a centrist in 1986 a 
conservative rating group gave him a 50 for his senate votes a 
liberal group rated him at 45 he supported democratic partyline 
votes 46 percent of the time and opposed them 50 percent of the 
time 
as chairman of the finance committee bentsen is wellplaced to 
put his mark on legislation dealing with taxes trade welfare 
health insurance and social security as chairman he seems to push 
for the middle ground as often as he was pulled toward a consensus 
in earlier days on the committee 
thus in an effort to get a trade bill that president reagan 
would sign bentsen accepted several house provisions especially 
those aimed at protecting us workers and at retaliating against 
unfair trade practices that were less than he wanted 
republicans controlled the finance committee when the massive 
1986 tax overhaul was enacted and bentsen faced the prospect of 
voting to repeal major provisions including the investment credit 
and capitalgains preferences that he had supported in the end 
he voted for repeal in order to pay for a significant rate 
reduction for most individuals and corporations but he was never 
enthusiastic about the package 
the texan has fought feverishly to retain special tax treatment 
for the oil industry especially the independent companies not 
affiliated with the giant major firms 
but his biggest battle over the 1986 bill was waged for the 
benefit of realestate developers not the oil industry and 
ironically it was bentsen himself who had spurred the committee to 
eliminate some tax incentives for investment in commercial real 
estate he pointed to a 35 percent vacancy rate in houston offices 
buildings to support his case 
under bentsens leadership the finance committee this year has 
cranked out landmark bills overhauling the welfare system and 
expanding medicare to cover some costs of catastrophic illness 
bentsen who served briefly as a county judge used his familys 
considerable wealth to win election to the house for the first time 
in 1948 at age 33 he retired after three terms to run his own 
lucrative insurance business 
he won election to the senate in 1970 by unseating liberal sen 
ralph yarborough in the democratic primary he defeated bush in 
november with 54 percent of the votes and was reelected in 1976 
with 57 percent and in 1982 with 59 percent 
bentsen has been married for 44 years to beryl ann bentsen 
known as ba a former fashion model they have three grown 
children

researchers want to build a 
highfidelity telescope network to peer inside the earth for 
signs of big small and silent earthquakes and to track the 
drift of continental plates 
the proposed 42 million terrascope system of 10 earthquake 
monitors would quickly provide detailed information about quakes 
letting scientists learn as much as possible as fast as possible 
so we can keep the public informed about what is happening 
seismologist don anderson said tuesday 
terrascope would be the worlds largest continuously operating 
scientific instrument said robert finn spokesman for the 
california institute of technology some arrays of dishshaped 
radio telescopes are spread over a larger area but they dont scan 
the heavens continuously he said 
the system is called a terrestrial telescope because it would 
use seismic waves to make pictures of earths interior just as 
optical telescopes use light waves to make pictures of objects in 
space said anderson director of the caltechs seismological 
laboratory 
the contrast between the proposed network of seismic monitors in 
southern california and existing quakemonitoring networks is 
like comparing a compact disc recording with the original 
phonographs anderson said 
this new array will be able to detect the very smallest 
earthquakes as well as the very largest earthquakes with equal 
fidelity which existing seismic networks cant do said anderson 
small earthquakes tend to have very high frequencies like a 
violin anderson said large quakes tend to be more booming 
like the bass section of an orchestra 
terrascope should let scientists provide detailed information 
on the characteristics of an earthquake within minutes after its 
occurrence maybe even while it is still happening said caltech 
geophysicist hiroo kanamori 
even with the existing seismometers which record quake waves as 
they happen caltech scientists need 20 minutes or more to analyze 
a quakes location and magnitude 
anderson said the seismometers also would measure silent 
quakes which can have large magnitudes and generate giant sea 
waves but break the ground too slowly to be detected by the 
existing caltechus geological survey array of 250 conventional 
seismometers 
each terrascope station also will be equipped to transmit 
signals to satellites in the governments navstar global 
positioning system such signals allow scientists to pinpoint the 
location of each ground station so they can measure continental 
drift the slow movement of the plates that make up earths crust 
unlike conventional seismometers terrascope also would detect 
very longperiod waves generated as the earth rings likes a bell 
for months after a giant earthquake anderson said 
by studying those waves terrascope will allow us to get a 
better look at the structure of the earths interior using 
seismic tomography a method similar to the cat scans that use 
xrays to make pictures of the inside of a human body he added 
scientists from caltech harvard university the university of 
southern california and usgs installed the first of terrascopes 10 
seismometers about six months ago in caltechs kresge lab near the 
rose bowl at a cost of about 100000 
researchers are talking to the governors staff state lawmakers 
and private donors to raise the remainder of terrascopes 42 
million cost anderson said 
the terrestrial telescope system would be part of a global 
network of highfidelity seismometers operated by the 
virginiabased incorporated research institutions of seismology 
which already has 10 of the devices operating around the world on a 
noncontinuous basis anderson said 
when information from terrascope and the virginiarun network is 
combined we will be able to build up a threedimensional picture 
of earths interior with unprecedented clarity caltech 
geophysicist robert clayton said

womens groups say sen lloyd bentsen offers a 
mixed record on womens issues but his stance on contra aid and 
defense spending could turn some female voters away from the 
democratic ticket in november 
basically hes more a plus than he is a minus molly yard 
president of the national organization for women said after the 
texas senator was announced as michael dukakis running mate choice 
tuesday 
i think the one thing that disturbs us about him is that he is 
very much a hawk he was procontra aid and for all the money 
spent on defense he is really business as usual and thats why the 
voters want change she said 
irene natividad chairman of the national womens political 
caucus said womens groups had not expected this year that 
democrats would name a woman vice president candidate because the 
sense was that the democratic party felt they had already done a 
women on the ticket 
geraldine ferraro who was walter mondales running mate on the 
losing democratic ticket in 1984 said she was delighted by the

a space shuttle is likely to crash every 
five years under nasas current schedule because key power units 
will fail predicts a nasafunded study that was disputed by a 
space agency official 
the study said there was a 1in70 chance on any flight that the 
shuttles three auxiliary power units which control flaps needed 
to land will all fail and cause the shuttle to crash the san jose 
mercury news reported tuesday 
the national aeronautics and space administration hopes to 
launch about 14 shuttle missions a year once it resumes its full 
schedule in the early 1990s said agency spokesman steve nesbitt 
that would mean 70 missions every five years 
the 2 million study conducted by a consultant was among those 
commissioned in the wake of the challenger disaster on jan 28 
1986 to examine risk assessment by nasa 
i know theyre quoting 1 in 70 but in my opinion the unit 
is much more reliable than that based on results of nasa testing 
said chester vaughan chief of the shuttles power and propulsion 
division at the johnson space center in houston i think we have 
a hell of a good unit 
the studys finding quantifies the potential dangers of just one 
of the shuttles two dozen critical systems the mercury news 
reported 
according to nasa tests the power units are far more reliable 
than the study indicates and the agency has not changed plans to 
resume launches this fall nasa officials said the space agency 
said there is a plan to double the shuttles lifespan from 20 
missions to 40 
however independent experts and scientists close to nasa told 
the mercury news they were startled by the report 
thats high risk said george apostolakis an expert in 
risk assessment and a professor at the university of california 
los angeles 
john garrick president of the newport beach consulting firm of 
pickard lowe and garrick inc which conducted the study for 
mcdonnell douglas corp stood by the findings 
we have pretty high confidence in our results said garrick 
in trying to tell the truth the answers arent exactly as 
favorable as nasa would like 
the report recommended that nasa carry out similar studies on 
other shuttle systems the space agency plans studies on the main 
engines and the 30000 heatresistant tiles on the shuttles belly 
but nothing new on the auxiliary power units 
nasa decided in 1987 to spend about 2 million on the mcdonnell 
douglas probability study and a second study of the pressurizer 
system for the main fuel tanks 
the second study conducted by lockheed missiles and space co 
in palo alto found that a malfunction of that system would likely 
cause a crash in about one of every 400 missions

a nationally known transplant physician has 
surprised some nutritionists by opening a fastfood restaurant 
featuring fried foods that have been linked to heart disease 
popeyes famous fried chicken and biscuits the new fastfood 
restaurant that dr john najarian opened tuesday in minneapolis 
offers fried chicken onion rings french fries and buttermilk 
biscuits among other fare 
i think its an embarrassment the problem is his name 
brings credibility to the food people will say if the chief of 
surgery is promoting this food then it must be good for you 
said bonnie liebman director of nutrition for the center for 
science in the public interest a consumeroriented group based in 
washington dc 
im expecting its going to be a real lean chicken i mean 
coming from a surgeon said mark anderson editor of the 
whittier globe the neighborhood newspaper 
najarian chief of surgery at the university of minnesota 
hospital and personal physician to the late hubert humphrey 
defended his investment 
it wouldnt be like backing a cigarette company or something 
like that said the 60yearold kidney and livertransplant 
physician today the important thing is to get away from beef 
and red meat so what we stress as physicians is chicken and 
fish its a heck of a lot better than burger king or wendys 
among his friends najarians fastfood business is seen as in 
keeping with his personality hes country he likes to go 
down to the state fair and munch on doughnuts said jim johnson 
a longtime friend 
najarian as president of cajian inc holds the franchise 
rights along with his family for popeyes in the twin cities 
a study of fast foods released by the center for science in the 
public interest in 1986 said that popeyes french fries had the 
secondhighest percentage 55 percent of saturated beef fat 
surpassing both mcdonalds and wendys saturated fat according to 
medical experts tends to raise cholesterol levels in blood and 
increases the risk of heart disease 
najarians son david said the cajunstyle chicken at the 
familys restaurant would be fried in vegetable oil which is 
considered less harmful to the health but a popeyes regional 
official in chicago said tuesday that najarian had misspoken 
its not vegetable oil said richard karlsen regional 
operations manager for popeyes 153 midwest locations including 
minneapolis he said all popeyes use the same ingredients and 
cooking methods but he declined to say what shortening is used 
popeyes comprises more than 700 restaurants in 40 states and was 
started in new orleans in 1972

new hampshire and south dakota lead the lower 48 states when it 
comes to offering a favorable business environment as wages 
continue to top the list of concerns among manufacturers according 
to a private study released today 
based on 21 factors that include wages energy costs state 
business incentives and education new hampshire offers many of 
the economic and social qualities conducive to successful 
manufacturing said the accounting firm grant thornton 
the factors were based on surveys of governors state economic 
development officials and statewide associations representing more 
than 100000 manufacturers the new yorkbased firm stated 
wages were the single most important factor to the associations 
when assessing business climates the survey indicated available 
workforce unionization and workers compensation insurance levels 
were the next most important factors respectively 
for the first time in the nine consecutive years grant thornton 
has conducted the study the firm differentiated states by their 
manufacturing intensity to make statetostate comparisons more 
valid 
states where total employment in manufacturing exceeded the 
national average of 17 percent or where manufacturing shipments 
exceeded the national average in dollar terms were considered 
intensive 
ranked right behind new hampshire on a list of 27 states deemed 
as manufacturing intensive were missouri north carolina delaware 
and florida 
heading the list of 21 states with a lighter concentration of 
manufacturing was south dakota followed by north dakota nebraska 
nevada and kansas 
according to the study south dakota is the least unionized 
state in the nation only 31 percent of its workers are union 
members compared with a national average of almost 20 percent the 
state ranked as the most favorable among the 48 states in terms of 
overall labor costs 
ironically new hampshires overall labor costs put it at no 35 
when ranked among the 48 states however the granite states 
government fiscal policies ranked first overall 
north carolina ranked first in terms of stateregulated 
employment costs 
kansas ranked first in terms of availability and productivity of 
resources while north dakota ranked first in terms of quality of 
life although the associations ranked factors such as cost of 
living health care and transportation as their least concerns 
other groups have made similar assessments of business climates 
around the nation the corporation for enterprise development a 
washingtonbased nonprofit economic development research and 
consulting group has used a broad range range of factors to make 
its assessment 
but selwyn price a grant thornton partner has said while his 
firms index also considers a range of factors it weights them in 
accordance with what manufacturers identified in a survey as 
important 
alaska and hawaii were not included in the survey because it 
would be difficult to compare them with other states due to their 
substantially different economies grant thornton stated

a domestic airliner carrying 173 people wound up 
in a rice paddy when it ran short of fuel and made an emergency 
landing an official report said today 
none of the 162 passengers including 100 foreigners or the 11 
crew members were injured in the landing monday evening the 
guangming daily said 
the pilot landed the plane at the jiujiang airport in eastern 
chinas jiangxi province but could not stop the plane in time and 
ran off the runway into an adjoining paddy the paper said 
japanese television on tuesday night showed film shot by a 
japanese passenger of people climbing off the wings into the rice 
paddy 
the guangming daily said the runway was too short for landing 
planes as large as the sovietdesigned tupolev tu154 a 
threeengine plane that can accommodate up to 180 passengers 
the plane was flying from canton to shanghai when it ran into 
bad weather 
the pilot increased altitude but his navigation equipment and 
radio failed the paper said after flying for an hour he ran 
short of fuel and decided to make an emergency landing in jiujiang 
japanese sources said the plane began flying to shanghai from 
urumqi in northwestern chinas xinjiang uyghur autonomous region 
but diverted to canton hundreds of miles out of its way to pick 
up parts after developing an unspecified mechanical problem 
canton is 740 miles southwest of shanghai and well off a direct 
urumqishanghai flight path it was not clear why the pilot needed 
to go to canton for the parts 
the paper said the plane was stuck in the paddy but did not say 
what efforts were being made to pull it out

all commuter trains in south 
africa have been desegregated and integration of longhaul 
intercity trains is being considered railroad officials said today 
from now on segregation will be based only on economic

enterprise said transvaal province railroad manager jc van der 
merwe 
whites only signs on firstclass commuter trains which cost 
about twice as much to ride as thirdclass began coming down 
tuesday all over the country railroad officials said there is no 
secondclass service on commuter trains 
beginning in 1985 the transport services began integrating 
restrooms waiting areas railroad cafeterias and other amenities 
at train stations most carriages continued to be segregated 
although in 1985 a few firstclass trains were declared open to all 
races 
leon els a spokesman for transport minister eli louw said 
today in reference to the continued segregation on the countrys 
120 intercity trains nothing can change overnight we still have 
partial segregation on the intercity trains but it is being looked 
at we havent put a time schedule to that we have to see what is 
practical 
els said the considerations that have so far prevented 
integration of intercity trains are the long travel distances 
involved and the fact that the intercity trains are overnight 
trains and people sleep in the compartments people would be 
sleeping in a compartment together 
one intercity train the luxury blue train between johannesburg 
and cape town is designated as an international service and always

ptls trustee says he has asked that jim 
and tammy bakker curtail their increasingly frequent visits to 
heritage usa 
theyre not creating a big disturbance but its sort of an 
irritant mc benton said tuesday 
the trustee said he was told that tammy bakker and a member of 
the band of the ptl today show recently got into an argument in 
front of the studio audience minutes after the program ended 
i got a report that she had been particularly abusive 
benton said so i just said thats enough ive got enough 
other problems without having to worry about them 
benton said ptl lawyers asked the bakkers through the couples 
attorneys to restrict themselves voluntarily to residential areas 
at heritage usa the christian theme park run by the evangelical 
empire built by bakker 
mr bakkers father and mother live there and i didnt want to 
shut him out of visiting them said benton who was appointed by 
us bankruptcy court in may to oversee the sale of heritage usa 
property to pay ptl creditors 
bakker attorney jim toms said benton had not communicated those 
wishes either to him or to bakkers other lawyer ryan hovis 
im astonished to hear such a thing toms said there 
certainly has been no breach of the peace and when hes the 
founder of the ministry and has a substantial constituency there 
im astonished that mr benton would prohibit him from going on the 
property 
the bakkers moved to the lake wylie area in june after nearly a 
year in exile in tennessee and california bakker resigned from ptl 
in 1987 in a sex and money scandal but has been trying ever since 
to return 
in the past month the bakkers announced their intentions to buy 
heritage usa and return as its leaders 
benton is considering several offers to buy ptl including one 
from bakker and is to report his recommendation to bankruptcy

mikhail s gorbachev today urged polish 
workers to support his social and economic reforms in a speech at a 
baltic port shipyard that was a center of unrest during the birth 
of solidarity 
speaking in a huge hall at the warski shipyard to rows of 
stonyfaced workers in hard hats and dungarees the kremlin leader 
emphasized the theme of cooperation between poland and the soviet 
union 
it the soviet and polish leadership did not feel the support 
of the working class it would not be able to undertake the act of 
perestroika restructuring and renewal he said 
and one more thing without the support of the working class 
these policies would not be worth anything 
overhead shipyard officials hung a banner reading we are in 
solidarity with the soviet leader 
the stop was gorbachevs main opportunity to address polish 
workers during his sixday polish visit which began monday 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski spoke earlier to the 
warski workers and referred to the stormy days when solidarity 
the soviet blocs first and only independent labor movement was 
born 
everything creative and valuable brought along by that period 
will be developed he promised but he said the period set 
working people at variance it has already become history 
in southeastern poland 1600 workers struck two departments of 
a steel and defense plant that employs 18000 opposition activists 
said the government denied any strike was in progress 
two months ago workers at various enterprises throughout the 
country went on strike to demand free trade unions and higher 
wages but warski employees did not join them 
solidarity was chartered by communist authorities in 1980 during 
nationwide strikes the lenin shipyard in gdansk is considered the 
birthplace of solidarity but workers at the warski complex also 
were militant backers of the free trade union federation 
after months of tension solidarity was suspended by the 
government in a december 1981 military crackdown and subsequently 
outlawed 
at the stalowa wola steel mill 120 miles southeast of warsaw a 
research department a tools department and a smithy went on strike 
this morning said ewa kaberna a solidarity activist in the city 
solidarity advisor jacek kuron later said the tool department 
had returned to work but the other two departments were still out 
workers at the plant had been threatening to strike during 
gorbachevs visit unless seven solidarity leaders fired after a 
strike there april 2930 are reinstated police and plant workers 
had a tense standoff at a church in stalowa wola on monday and 
tuesday 
government press aide ryszard straus denied there was a strike 
i have just checked there is no strike at stalowa wola 
in krakow on tuesday gorbachev broke precedent for a soviet 
leader by visiting a functioning church 
his 20minute tour of the 14th century st marys roman catholic 
church on krakows market square was believed to be the first time 
that the head of the officially atheist soviet communist party made 
such a visit 
six hours before gorbachev arrived the square was closed to 
anyone who did not have a special pass from their factory or office 
in april gorbachev received at the kremlin the head of the 
russian orthodox church the first such meeting in at least 40 
years 
gorbachev who has introduced programs of restructuring and 
reform in certain areas of soviet society has promised a new law 
on relations between the church and state in connection with 
recent celebrations of the 1000th anniversary of christianity in 
russia some churches were allowed to reopen with their confiscated 
property returned 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said after 
the krakow tour that it was gorbachevs first visit to a 
functioning church since he became general secretary of the party 
in 1985 
i believe mikhail gorbachev has visited various churches 
previously gerasimov told reporters i believe that he finds in 
them a precious piece of art 
the catholic church claims 95 percent of polands 37 million 
people as members and churches in poland including the one visited 
by gorbachev have traditionally been rallying points for 
antigovernment demonstrators 
after the visit gorbachev went to a rally attended by about 
3000 invited polish and soviet young people and urged them to 
return to the teachings of vladimir lenin the founder of the 
soviet union 
speaking in a courtyard at wawel castle the residence of polish 
monarchs until the late 1500s gorbachev said lenins example could 
serve as a model in the era of the second world revolution since 
the birth of socialism 
he urged the people to join the drive for rebuilding communism 
and said do not miss the perestroika restructuring train 
also on tuesday gorbachev visited a house in mountains south of 
krakow where lenin spent several years before world war i

this is one of a series of periodic reports 
compiled by associated press bureaus on how the us presidential 
election campaign is viewed abroad 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
here is what two leading british newspapers had to say in 
editorials today on gov michael dukakis selection of sen lloyd 
bentsen as his democratic running mate in the presidential election 
financial times independent only once in the last 30 
years in 1960 have the democrats been able to field a dream 
ticket one which combined a charismatic northeastern liberal 
john kennedy with a wily experienced washington insider the 
texan lyndon johnson that election was in many respects like the 
one now under way a popular ageing republican president was 
retiring the mood of the country and the balance of power inside 
it was shifting and neither party could command an automatic lien 
on public support 
this historical comparison must have weighed on the mind of 
michael dukakis as he contemplated chosing a running mate 
mr bentsen brings indisputable qualifications if no fire to 
the ticket eighteen years a senator and never forget the man 
who defeated george bush to make it to the upper chamber he has 
the washington experience mr dukakis lacks 
the real reason why the lot has fallen on mr bentsen is 
because of where he is from texas may be a law unto itself but it 
is the third largest state of the union the democrats must carry 
it and the formidable bensen machine is likely to be more effective 
with him on the ticket his mere presence alongside mr dukakis 
is explicitly designed to tie vice president george bush a 
neotexan down to a part of the country he thought he had in his 
pocket and to a state which once rejected him at the hands of a 
man called bentsen

the times of london independent mr dukakis has reverted 
to the tried and tested values of a balanced ticket mr 
dukakis may be tainted with massachusetts liberalism but mr 
bentsen gives the appearance of comfortable southern conservatism 
mr dukakis is accused of haste and brashness mr bentsen at 
67 has the solid values of age while mr dukakis has no 
experience of national political office mr bentsen is a skilled 
manipulator of the levers of washington power mr dukakis is 
ethnic mr bentsen is patrician 
it is clear that mr dukakis intends to rely on his running 
mate for delivering those southern democrats who voted for mr 
reagan to that end his reassuring prodefense and probusiness 
attitudes will help the fact that he is a selfmade millionaire 
from insurance will not hurt he has always been a stout defender 
of oil interests and that will stand him in good stead in oklahoma 
and louisiana where the oil industry has been badly winded by the 
price decline

a store that sold a 357caliber pistol less than 
an hour before a distraught investor used it to kill a stockbroker 
and paralyze another has agreed to pay 500000 to settle a 
negligence suit a lawyer said 
arthur h katz a former kansas city mo lawyer who lived in 
miami as a protected government witness under the name arthur kane 
used the weapon to kill himself after the oct 26 shooting at a 
merrill lynch office here 
in selling the weapon the tamiami gun shop violated a florida 
law requiring a coolingoff period between the purchase and pickup 
of a gun the suit contended katz bought the weapon 45 minutes 
before the shootings 
the settlement will be divided between the estate of the late 
jose argilagos 51 manager at the merrill lynch office and lloyd 
kolokoff 39 who was paralyzed from the waist down in the attack 
were not satisfied but thats the best we could do george 
vogelsang a lawyer for kolokoff said tuesday a separate lawsuit 
is pending against katzs estate and his widow vogelsang said 
edward carhart representing the gun shop said the store denied 
it was negligent or responsible for katzs actions but decided to 
settle instead of risking a larger verdict at trial 
katz 53 became an informant during a 1976 investigation of 
insurance fraud in kansas city 
the government contended his life was threatened and he was 
placed in the witness protection program in 1977 katz pleaded 
guilty to fraud in 1978 and served six months in a halfway house 
after being relocated to miami under a new name katz amassed a 
huge stock portfolio but lost 10 million to 15 million in the 
october crash he was a clerk with the social security 
administration a job the government had arranged

rough weather today again kept 
disaster specialists from searching for bodies and capping the 
burning wells of the piper alpha platform one week after the 
worlds worst oil rig disaster 
police said two more bodies were found tuesday bringing to 22 
the total recovered 
assistants to red adair the 73yearold texas oil 
troubleshooter tuesday night visited the oil and gas platform 
where 166 of the 230 men on board died when explosions ripped apart 
the structure according to a spokeswoman for occidental petroleum 
corp the platforms operator 
but the spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
adairs men were forced to return because of high winds and rough 
seas in the area of the platform 120 miles off scotlands east 
coast 
bad weather since sunday has frustrated adairs plans to clear 
debris from the twisted tilting platform and to seal three 
wellheads still burning 
adairs team is based aboard a semisubmersible rig the tharos 
stationed alongside the platform which is approached from a basket 
suspended from a crane 
occidental said a miniature submarine which has circled the 
platform tuesday sighted what was believed to be the housing module 
in which most of the men are thought to have died but occidental 
officials said that divers cannot begin searching for bodies until 
the wells are capped and the structure is strengthened 
occidental executives have said they believe a gas leak caused 
the disaster

opponents of a planned state prison in the tiny 
town of new braintree have filed suit seeking to force gov michael 
dukakis to divulge documents detailing the prison siting process 
the suit seeks to force disclosure of 198 documents relating to 
the states decision to locate a new mediumsecurity prison on the 
site of a former boarding school in the farming community of new 
braintree 
there isnt anything about the process that has gone 
straight new braintree selectman dorothea vitrac charged at a 
news conference after the suit was filed tuesday in worcester 
superior court 
prison opponents have raised questions about the propriety of 
the siting decision suggesting that the administration engineered 
a deal that could mean millions of dollars in profit for the sites 
current landowners one of whom has contributed to dukakis 
campaigns 
the fbi is conducting a preliminary inquiry into the matter but 
says it is not investigating dukakis personally 
the investigation has been a political embarrassment to dukakis 
the likely democratic presidential nominee he has defended the 
siting decision maintaining the targeted documents are covered by 
executive privilege and are not public records as the suit by 
prison opponents argues 
a norwood mass development firm owned by daniel striar and 
gary jacobson purchased the land from the seventhday adventist 
church in december 1985 for 3 million the purchase occurred one 
month after the state listed the land as a possible prison site 
questions surrounding the prison arose when the owners offered 
to sell the land to the state for 95 million a statefunded 
appraisal of the property in 1986 valued the land at 87 million 
but last week based on fresh appraisals the state division of 
captial planning and operations offered to pay 5 million striar 
and jacobson immediately rejected the offer and dukakis has said 
the state will take the land by eminent domain if necessary 
dukakis has said that he did not know who owned the land when 
the site was picked and that he met striar only once jacobson grew 
up in the same neighborhood as dukakis and has donated to his 
campaigns but both men said they are only casual acquaintenances

texans took for granted their states 
importance as a 1988 election battleground long before michael 
dukakis picked texan lloyd bentsen as his running mate 
but dukakis choice on tuesday of a political partner who can 
challenge republican george bush on his adopted home turf 
guarantees a fight as hot as texasstyle chili 
democrats said picking bentsen was the best kind of southern 
strategy 
democratic prospects in texas oklahoma and louisiana will be 
boosted immediately said sen paul simon dill a former 
democratic presidential contender 
lloyd bentsen helps win texas echoed new york gov mario 
cuomo 
texas republicans naturally declared that the democrats wont 
carry the state even with bentsen on the ticket 
bentsen beat bush in a senate race 18 years ago but the 
republicans were quick to dismiss that matchup 
its important to look again at 1970 texas has changed 
said former congressman tom loeffler cochairman of bushs texas 
campaign texas is now a republicanleaning state 
i believe mike dukakis made a critical mistake in thinking 
texas will bail him out loeffler said its a riverboat 
gamble and michael dukakis will lose that gamble in a very big 
way 
texas gov bill clements concurred now texans will have a 
choice between one of their own for the top job or for no 2 and 
theyre likely to go for the big prize he said 
given the choice of a texan president or a texan vice 
president the people of our state will certainly choose a texan 
president clements said 
sen phil gramm rtexas cochairman of the bush campaign in 
his state said flatly that bentsen will not carry texas for 
dukakis 
some national pollsters said bentsen gives dukakis a shot to win 
texas and its 29 electoral votes but they too called it a gamble 
its a highrisk technique youve got to beat george bush in 
his home state said claibourne darden an atlantabased 
pollster if dukakis can do that george bush will be whupped 
a statewide poll in texas in midjune had dukakis trailing bush 
by 23 points but when bentsen was proposed as dukakis running 
mate the democrats closed to just 5 points 
picking bentsen makes texas a competitive state said brad 
coker of masondixon opinion research which did that poll if 
theres a drawback its that bentsen doesnt guarantee texas that 
makes it risky for dukakis 
jim oberwetter who helped run bushs primary campaign in texas 
said bentsens name on the democratic ticket wouldnt be a rerun of 
the 1960 success of the last bostonaustin ticket john f 
kennedy and lyndon b johnson 
oberwetter noted that in 1960 kennedy and johnson carried the 
state by just over 40000 votes and that was a texan who was a 
powerhouse he said 
still the democrats said dukakis choice amounted to the best 
southern strategy

some of the highest praise of sen lloyd 
bentsens selection as running mate for democrat michael s dukakis 
came from a republican colleague but a fellow texan disputed 
bentsens impact on the race 
dukakis couldnt have picked a better man said senate 
minority leader bob dole who ran unsuccessfully for his partys 
nomination this year its an excellent choice and i think that 
will come from both sides of the aisle 
fellow texas sen phil gramm a republican said bentsen still 
will not carry texas for the democrats 
i dont think republicans are going to run against lloyd 
bentsen gramm said tuesday republicans are going to run 
against michael dukakis the distinctions between george bush and 
michael dukakis are so clear that bentsen is not an issue 
gramm like many other republicans passed up opportunities to 
criticize bentsens record a record that includes expertise on 
taxes trade health and welfare 
vice president george bush also claims texas as home base and 
gramm said that given a choice between electing a texan to one of 
the nations two top positions texans will choose the presidency 
every time 
democrats in congress and elsewhere hailed bentsen as a moderate 
coalition builder who will give the ticket a strong chance in the 
south and across the nation 
bentsen has the added advantage they said of having entered 
the senate in 1970 by beating bush then a texas republican 
congressman 
he knows how to beat george bush said sen barbara 
mikulski dmd he did just that in 1970 
former vice president walter f mondale the 1984 democratic 
presidential nominee said dukakis made a superb choice 
senator bentsen is regarded as one of the nations top experts 
in financial and economic affairs and is one of the most thoughtful 
minds in international security and defense matters mondale said 
tuesday 
more than that he has been a source of good sense moderation 
and decency throughout his years of public life he said he 
will make an excellent vice president and governor dukakis deserves 
a straight a on his first choice 
said paul simon dill a former democratic presidential 
candidate democratic prospects in texas oklahoma and louisiana 
will be boosted immediately and when the american people get to 
know lloyd bentsen it will strengthen the ticket everywhere 
more important than anything else if there should be a 
tragedy lloyd bentsen would make a superb president 
sen john glenn dohio who had been on dukakis short list of 
prospective running mates said he heard of the choice with some 
regrets at not being selected 
disappointed would be overstating it said glenn 
responding to questions glenn said jesse jackson has made a 
valuable contribution to american politics assuring that no black 
person will ever again be ruled out of presidential politics merely 
because of his race 
but some of jacksons supporters described the choice as a 
slap in the face 
its safe to say there are many many people in this country 
who are enthusiastic supporters of jesse jackson who will look with 
disfavor and pain at this nomination said rep ronald dellums 
dcalif 
dellums said choosing bentsen creates the impression that 
dukakis either walked away from jackson and his backers or chose to 
ignore the issue of race 
but other democrats disagreed 
i think on the issues of the big constituencies lloyd bentsen 
has been right right on civil rights right on womens issues 
he is acceptable to blacks and business and thats the key said 
sen j bennett johnston dla youve got to build a coalition 
broad enough to get elected and lloyd bentsen will help to do 
that 
union activists also praised bentsen saying he has recently 
shored up a relatively poor labor record with his deft handling of 
legislation on trade and mandatory notice of plant closings and 
massive layoffs 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said the choice gives the 
nation the same massachusettstexas combination that carried 
president john f kennedy to victory in 1960 after his selection of 
texan lyndon b johnson as his running mate

a group of israeli reserve soldiers who refuse 
to serve in the occupied territories today accused the government 
of harassing them with security checks and urged the attorney 
general to drop an inquiry into their activities 
a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir whose office 
oversees the shin bet security service said he could not respond 
to the charges of unusual security checks and mail tampering but 
he said the conscientious objectors were engaged in clearly illegal 
activity 
there are democratic ways in israel to express ones opinion 
and engage in political struggle said the spokesman avi pazner 
the problem with these people is they think they can be their own 
judges and do whatever they like 
about 600 soldiers who refuse to serve in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip belong to a group calling itself yesh gvul hebrew 
for there is a limit twentynine have been jailed on charges 
of disobeying orders 
the latest to be sentenced was capt nissim kedem 33 a member 
of a tank division who today was ordered to serve a 21day term 
yesh gvul spokesman ronen shamir said 
attorney general yosef harish has ordered a police inquiry into 
whether yesh gvul members are guilty of incitement for encouraging 
reserve soldiers to refuse orders to serve in the territories 
yesh gvul spokesman shamir said tactics used against his group 
included a rigorous security check of a group member returning to 
israel from abroad and a case where 20 letters the group mailed to 
other countries were returned with the envelopes opened 
this indicates there is a storehouse of data on members of the 
group that marks them as posing a danger to the country shamir 
said 
also today israeli troops dynamited the homes of two 
palestinians suspected of hurling firebombs at military patrols in 
the occupied west bank the sound of the explosions was broadcast 
on israel army radio 
the predawn demolitions were in the villages of ras karkar and 
janyeh near ramallah north of jerusalem an army spokesman said 
the homes belonged to suspects in a june 9 firebombing in which two 
army officers were badly burned 
the home of a fourth suspect in the firebombing was sealed the 
army said 
three other homes in atil near the northern west bank city of 
tulkarem also were sealed shut the army said adding that the 
homes belonged to palestinians suspected of burning and stoning 
buses in april 
the army recently has issued troops with new fireproof suits 
because of the frequency of firebomb attacks in the occupied 
territories army radio said

the leadership of azerbaijan annulled 
nagornokarabakhs decision to secede from the republic and accused 
officials in the disputed region of breaking the law and defying 
higher authorities tass said today 
the official news agency said the presidium or executive 
committee of azerbaijans parliament met tuesday night a few 
hours after the secession declaration by nagornokarabakhs 
legislature 
the legislature failed to secure strict compliance with 
principles of legality and openly encroached on the 
nationalstate composition of the republic tass quoted the 
azerbaijan presidium as saying in a resolution 
tass said the presidium proclaimed nagornokarabakhs 
declaration of secession null and void and revoked it 
armenians have been pressing for five months for 
nagornokarabakh to be annexed to the republic of armenia 
nagornokarabakh a mountainous region of 160000 people is mainly 
armenian 
the campaign has brought nagornokarabakhs armenians into 
direct confrontation with central authorities in moscow and with 
azerbaijani authorities who oppose any change in the territorial 
status of nagornokarabakh 
in february the ethnic tension led to riots in the azerbaijan 
city of sumgait at least 32 people were killed 
nagornokarabakhs declaration of secession was the first such 
action in the 70 years of soviet history it immediately raised 
constitutional and legal questions dissident historian roy 
medvedev told the associated press the action was clearly 
unconstitutional and illegal 
the soviet constitution gives citizens the right to 
selfdetermination but it requires a republics consent for any 
proposed changes in its boundaries nagornokarabakh has been an 
autonomous region of mostly moslem azerbaijan since 1923 even 
though more than threequarters of its residents are ethnic 
armenians who are predominantly christian armenians consider 
nagornokarabakh to be part of their ancestral homeland 
on feb 20 nagornokarabakhs legislature asked the azerbaijani 
and armenian governments to approve transfer to armenia armenias 
legislature agreed june 15 but azerbaijans said no two days later 
the nagornokarabakh legislature announced tuesday the area was 
being renamed the artsakh autonomous region of armenia 
armenians in nagornokarabakh and armenia have been striking and 
holding street rallies sporadically since february today tass 
said the nagornokarabakh legislature had asked residents to return 
to work but that in the regions main city stepanakert all 
industrial enterprises in the city remained idle on july 13 public 
and city transport did not function all shops selling manufactured 
goods were closed so were consumer service outlets 
a worker at the stepanakert radio station said the city was 
suffering as a result of the strike 
the food situation has become very critical said the worker 
in a telephone interview he refused to be identified we are 
producing our own bread and milk but other foodstuffs are lacking 
nothing is coming to us from azerbaijan 
he said troops were deployed on city streets and in other parts 
of nagornokarabakh 
in baku the azerbaijani capital a reporter for the republics 
official news agency said the dispute was being resolved according 
to the new policies of soviet communist party general secretary 
mikhail s gorbachev 
its being decided in a democratic way some people say one 
thing others say something else the reporter said in a 
telephone interview he spoke on condition of anonymity 
gorbachev has said more attention should be paid to the concerns 
of the soviet unions more than 100 national groups but that some 
are abusing the new openness of society

legislation expanding the discretion of 
judges in cases involving elderly and minor guardianships awaits 
action by gov henry bellmon 
the legislature passed the bill tuesday as it wrapped up the 
1988 session 
the measure would give judges more discretion in determining 
which wards need fulltime guardians it also brings into one 
statute all laws on guardianship 
rep don mccorkell said judges lawyers and advocates for the 
elderly had worked to develop a compromise that was fair to 
guardians and protected the rights of wards opponents in the house 
argued the bill was too complex and cumbersome 
oklahomas guardianship laws have not been substantially changed 
since the 1950s 
an associated press series examined guardianship laws nationwide 
in 1987 and found a network of overburdened courts that routinely 
fail to monitor wards under their jurisdiction

a farmer who dynamited his way into a 
private lake to get water for his bean crop said today he has 
stopped pumping from the lake 
gary bulzan said he turned off the pump tuesday shortly before 
a judge barred him from taking water from lake pleasant the 
pumping angered many of the 200 families who own homes around the 
lake 50 miles north of detroit 
bulzan blasted a hole last week near the 130acre lake allowed 
the crater to fill and began pumping water to a sprinkler that 
sprayed his adjacent 75acre field 
sgt tim burke of the department of natural resources said 
bulzan failed to apply for a permit to pump the water but probably 
would have received one if he had 
dorothy nadrowski whose home overlooks the lake said the pump 
ran constantly for three days one neighbor said the lake dropped 
more than an inch since the pumping began 
bulzans attorney emory clark said the farmer was just trying 
to save his crop from the drought 
if the water is up to your bellybutton now and it goes down an 
inch i cant see where that matters more than a farmer who is 
paying 100 an acre to farm the land and stands to lose his whole 
crop clark said

zubin mehta the conductor of the new 
york and israeli philharmonic orchestras said today he has 
appealed to soviet officials to release a woman denied permission 
to immigrate to israel for 14 years 
mehta told reporters he met the woman elena keisskuna of 
leningrad during a recent tour of the soviet union with the new 
york philharmonic 
he said he also asked secretary of state george p shultz and 
oil magnate armand hammer to intervene on mrs keisskunas behalf 
if anyone can gain her release those two people can mehta 
said at a news conference 
mrs keisskunas sister anna rosnovsky immigrated to israel 
14 years ago and is a violinist in the israeli philharmonic 
orchestra soviet authorities denied mrs keisskuna an exit visa

janes defense weekly today published a clearly 
detailed satellite photograph which it said shows the headquarters 
of the soviet northern fleet at severomorsk in the northwestern 
soviet union near northern finland 
the photograph in the respected military affairs weekly shows 
the main docking area for kiev class aircraft carriers and battle 
cruisers as well as the naval aviation airfield at severomorsk 
which lies on the kola peninsula near murmansk 
janes said severomorsk is the largest of nine main northern 
fleet surface vessel bases but is only a small fraction of the 
massive soviet military presence on the kola making the 
peninsula home for the densest gathering of military 
installations in the world 
it said the photo was taken by the french spot satellite and 
enhanced by computer techniques it did not say how it obtained the 
photograph or on what date it was taken 
the photo clearly shows an aircraft carriersized vessel docked 
in the bay and smaller warships berthed perpendicular to the 
coastline 
inland a 4000yard landing strip is visible surrounded by 
what janes described as a characteristic configuration of 
hardened aircraft shelters around the base

federal prosecutors today unsealed an indictment 
charging seven people including the brother of contra leader 
adolfo calero with illegally supplying mercenaries and weapons to 
the nicaraguan rebels 
the longawaited indictment did not mention any reagan 
administration officials or calero himself 
mario calero was accused of recruiting and paying for 
mercenaries with the help of a texas millionaire maco stewart and 
anticommunist cuban activists from the miami area adolfo caleros 
brother is based in new orleans 
also among those indicted were thomas posey head of 
alabamabased civilian materiel assistance and jack terrell a 
former mercenary who later blew the whistle on the alleged illegal 
operation 
all seven are accused of violating the us neutrality act 
which bars hostile actions against foreign governments from us 
soil 
according to the indictment defendants recruited soldiers in 
the united states to participate in military expeditions and 
enterprises against the government of nicaragua a statement from 
the us attorneys office said 
the indictment mentions two groups totaling 19 soldiers 
recruited in early 1985 with money provided from stewart to mario 
calero it gave no details on who the soldiers were 
in one case cited from 1985 terrell is accused of ordering his 
soldiers to help contra rebels destroy a bridge at sinsin 
nicaragua 
the indictment refers to others known and unknown to the grand 
jury but does not list the conspirators 
interim us attorney dexter lehtinen withdrew from the case 
because he had represented retired maj gen john singlaub while in 
private practice 
lehtinen emphasized that his former client a leader in private 
efforts to raise aid for contras wasnt directly involved in the 
case 
the prosecutor today refused to answer questions about any 
possible involvement by administration officials in the alleged 
scheme 
terrell and joe adams a former bodyguard of adolfo calero 
could face up to 33 years in prison on neutrality act violations 
and charges they transported firearms without a license 
jose coutin an anticommunist cuban activist and gun store 
owner faces 13 years on neutrality act violations and allowing 
someone to use his passport 
posey calero and stewart face up to eight years each in prison 
according to the us attorneys office alex martinez an 
anticastro miami cuban and account executive was also charged 
with violating the neutrality act 
posey and calero were the first to turn themselves in this 
morning before a us magistrate in fort lauderdale the other 
defendants also made arrangements to surrender today except for 
joe adams who will surrender later the us attorneys office 
said 
i have not broken any laws mario calero said tuesday night 
at his brothers house this is ironic and astonishing it must 
be a misunderstanding and i know it will be cleared up 
terrell who now opposes the antisandinista rebels said 
earlier he will turn his armssmuggling trial into a forum on the 
reagan adminstrations policy in nicaragua he and others say they 
were encouraged by the reagan administration in their efforts 
i will subpoena government officials at the highest level 
said terrell i will put the contra policy on trial 
terrell said it is unfair that he and other lowlevel smugglers 
were being indicted while those who ordered the weapons are free 
i have some news for this administration he said i wont 
take the fall for rob owen ollie north or ronald reagan owen 
was norths aide and liaison to the contra operations 
terrell was investigated by the fbi on norths orders when 
terrell began talking about contra supply operations 
terrell said the indictments were returned only because congress 
got wind that miamis thenus attorney leon kellner was trying to 
stop the investigation at the behest of attorney general edwin 
meese iii 
congress investigated charges that the probe was sidetracked but 
did not reach any conclusion kellner who resigned last month has 
strongly denied slowing the investigation 
terrell who most recently worked for a liberal policy group in 
washington became a vocal opponent of us policy in central 
america 
until he changed his mind on contra aid terrell helped civilian 
materiel assistance in its efforts to aid the rebels he reported 
participating in meetings with owen and contra leader adolfo 
calero among others to plan supply and other operations 
the arms shipment that sparked the investigation was flown out 
of fort lauderdale in march 1985 after contra supporters gathered 
20mm cannons m60 machine guns mortar shells automatic rifles 
and ammunition at various points around miami 
steven carr a cma member who later died of an apparent drug 
overdose in california told the associated press that the plane 
landed at ilopango air force base in el salvador the arms were 
stored there for several weeks he said then sent to contra troops 
in northern costa rica

two bombs blasted through a 
british army barracks early today tearing off part of the roof and 
injuring nine soldiers the irish republican army claimed 
responsibility 
police said the bombs were placed side by side near an outside 
wall of the soldiers living quarters and tore a 3by6foot hole 
in it 
police originally said the blast was caused by only one bomb 
but later announced two bombs had gone off 
at about the time of the explosion shots were fired from a 
passing automobile at a police car in the same area but no one was 
injured police said they said the passing automobile had dutch 
license plates 
in dublin the ira said in a statement circulated to the media 
that it carried out the bomb attack in west germany against crown 
forces it did not elaborate 
the ira which is waging a guerrilla campaign to drive the 
british out of northern ireland recently has stepped up attacks on 
british targets on the european continent 
a police statement said the bombs went off at about 3 am at 
the glamorgan barracks in duisburg about 30 miles north of cologne 
the building which british army officials say houses about 100 
soldiers is in a residential section of duisburg 
innocent sleeping soldiers were the targets this avoids the 
risk of confronting people who are awake said a spokesman for 
the british army in west germany who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
maj john wilkinson another british army spokesman said 
nine were hurt but none were hospitalized and all were treated 
at the scene 
after the blast a hole was found in a security fence protecting 
the barracks said duisburg police spokesman reinhard pape 
we suspect they cut a hole in the fence to get to the 
barracks pape said adding that police did not know whether 
there was a connection between the bomb blast and the shooting 
assailants fired a machine pistol or an automatic weapon at the 
police car but no one was injured he said 
he said police were searching for a yellow bmw with dutch 
license plates in connection with the shooting 
the soldiers targeted in the bomb attack belong to the 35th 
squadron of the royal corps transport a part of the 3rd armored 
division transport regiment said maj john wilkinson another 
spokesman for the british army at moenchengladbach 
this is a small barracks and not a major facility 
wilkinson said 
about 56000 british soldiers are stationed in west germany 
the mainly catholic ira seeks to unite the predominantly 
protestant province with the irish republic 
on march 6 in gibraltar british commandos killed three unarmed 
ira guerrillas 
ira terrorists on may 1 killed three british airmen in the 
netherlands in two separate attacks 
two days later a car bomb was found at a british military base 
in the central west german city of bielefeld the car bomb was 
disposed of before it could explode 
a march 1987 bombing of the british army of the rhine 
headquarters in the west german city of rheindahlen was the first 
ira attack in continental europe in about a decade that blast 
injured 31 people 
tuesday was the anniversary of the 1690 battle of boyne in 
which protestant king william iii defeated catholic king james ii 
throughout the british province on tuesday thousands of 
protestant loyalists marched to celebrate the victory

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
 
july 8 
the morning news tribune tacoma wash on the shooting down of 
an iranian airliner 
the investigation into the destruction of an iranian airliner 
seems headed toward two conclusions one is that there was no 
deliberate provocation on the part of the iranian government iran 
air flight 655 was within a recognized commercial flight corridor 
when it was shot down by the uss vincennes 
the second conclusion is that capt william c rogers apparently 
acted responsibly when he loosed two antiaircraft missiles against 
the approaching jet like other us commanders in the persian 
gulf rogers was under orders not to risk the kind of air attack 
that killed 37 sailors aboard the uss stark last year 
the two conclusions lead inescapably to a third if neither the 
pilot nor the skipper was at fault in the tragedy then the fault 
must lie with the decisions in washington dc that placed both 
the vincennes and the airliner at such extreme and unavoidable risk 
this disaster exposes the flaws of americas persian gulf 
policy in theory the us navy is acting as a neutral protector 
of international shipping threatened by the war between iran and 
iraq 
constantly under threat these warships are confined to a narrow 
body of water that provides little advance warning of approaching 
jets they have weapons that can destroy a plane long before it can 
be positively identified their nervous crews must instantly 
distinguish the occasional hitandrun attack from the constant 
traffic of civilian ships and aircraft 
its time to rethink the whole policy before this risky naval 
posture becomes institutionalized

topeka kan capitaljournal on the suggestion to divert water 
from the great lakes to the mississippi 
a proposal by a group of southern senators to increase the 
discharge from the great lakes to assist navigation on the 
mississippi river is reasonable a 100day increase in water 
release would lower the level of lakes huron and michigan by about 
an inch and increase the river level by about a foot at st louis 
and six inches at memphis 
the increased flow would greatly ease the barge traffic on the 
mississippi save thousands of hours of work in dredging channels 
in the river and lower the cost of transporting the nations grain 
crops to ports on the gulf of mexico

central maine morning sentinel waterville maine on closing 
unneeded military bases 
if you believe theres waste in the defense budget dont blame 
it all on the generals and the admirals or even the defense 
contract influence peddlers 
as walt kellys pogo might have put it the villain may be us 
the pentagon could save millions by closing down obsolete bases 
but every time it tries it is blocked by congress which fears the 
anger of voters in districts where bases are located 
thats why the closings can be accomplished only by the adoption 
of a politically neutral plan such as that proposed by rep dick 
armey a texas republican it would protect members from angry 
constituents by setting up a bipartisan commission to recommend 
which bases should be closed the secretary of defense would be 
authorized to close all or none he couldnt pick and choose that 
way there would be no room for political favoritism the whole plan 
would have to play out between election day in november and 
inauguration day in january thus taking the issue as far as 
possible out of politics

las cruces nm sunnews on the closing military bases 
congress has once again avoided one of the more sensitive issues 
it has had to face closing military bases the pentagon says are 
obsolete 
late last week the house tossed around the issue during a 
fourhour debate all the members could agree on was to postpone 
any final decision 
difficult or not its impossible to talk about cutting defense 
spending without talking about cutting back somewhere 
the united states faces the largest debt in its history it just 
seems to make sense to cut back in areas like the bases that have 
outlived their usefulness 
in the long run closing installations that no longer serve any 
purpose may be a positive step toward cutting defense spending at a 
point where it will do the least harm to our national security

the duluth minn newstribune on the state district judge 
protesting what he called prejudice in the judicial system 
alberto miera presents a truly troubling stain on minnesotas 
landscape 
miera is the suspended ramsey county district court judge who 
last week called an end to a hunger strike he said was intended to 
raise public awareness of unequal treatment accorded by the states 
judiciary to socially vulnerable minorities such as himself 
miera is a 37yearold hispanicamerican and selfprofessed 
bisexual he had been convicted of sexual harassment for forcibly 
kissing a male court clerk the state supreme court voted to 
suspend miera for one year without pay rather than remove him from 
the bench 
we are we admit suspicious of miera after all his plaints of 
racial bias were not raised until after he had been found guilty on 
the harassment charge and he has offered no specific incidents of 
alleged bias agaist anyone other than himself it seems he has 
sought to shift the focus of his protest from his deeds to some 
vague societal misdeeds 
yet repeated claims of racial and sexual bias are serious and 
disturbing they are particularly so here in minnesota where we 
pride ourselves and our state on our liberal attitudes and 
equitable legal standards for all our citizens

the miami herald on the impeachment proceedings against us 
district court judge alcee hastings 
alcee hastings worked long and hard to serve his community and 
especially the cause of black equality in that community if he 
wants to serve his community further rather than divide it and 
advance equality rather than retard it us district judge 
hastings should resign his only remaining defense is that a black 
judge need not meet the same high standard as other federal judges 
that defense makes a mockery of judge hastings long and 
distinguished civilrights career 
judge hastings can expect a trial in the senate that could 
remove him at best that trial would leave him on the bench but 
utterly bereft of the trust of prosecutors defense attorneys and 
fellow jurists and fellow attorneys trust a judge must have to 
operate effectively 
alcee hastings has too much intelligence wit and charisma to 
waste it in such a hollow role the community has other more 
constructive work for a man of his abilities

the journal providence ri on the shortage of tuba players 
we possess no statistics to bolster our impression but the word 
is out that america will soon be suffering from a serious shortage 
of tuba players 
the present situation is said to be influenced by a perceived 
decline in musical training among the young as well as the cost of 
the instrument which is measured in the thousands of dollars 
another obvious factor is sound the tuba sounds very much 
as it looks which is not especially elegant what the tuba does 
do well however is furnish a fullbodied sound to a band or 
orchestra a sound without which many major works are rendered 
simply shadows of themselves 
if tuba lovers want to demonstrate the importance of the 
survival of their instrument they need only play a sousa march 
first without then with the endangered tuba the difference is 
astounding

the sun bremerton wash on the resignation of attorney 
general meese 
the last crony is leaving months even years after propriety 
demanded it ed meese says hell resign sometime 
whatever conservative legacy he left the justice department and 
the courts is overshadowed by his cheapening of the office of 
attorney general and the chaos now paralyzing justice 
meese has managed to slip through the net in four 
investigations because the evidence against him always was 
circumstantial it just happened that cronies who did favors for 
meese soon ended up with lucrative government contracts or federal 
jobs or other special favors 
the best meeses investigators could find was impropriety not 
illegality yet the attorney general took the lack of charges as a 
ringing endorsement of his innocence 
meese is a dealmaker a hustler he never understood that the 
attorney general cant use his office to create a personal pork 
barrel 
does meese leave any legacy except sleaze 
he tried to weaken the miranda rule and abortion rights before a 
supreme court that was prepared to do neither he embarked on an 
antipornography crusade an odd priority for someone whose mission 
also includes fighting organized crime he botched the early stages 
of the irancontra probe perhaps deliberately 
yet meese has shown one thing an attorney generals politics 
are not as important as his credibility his honesty and his 
ability to lead after three years with a laughingstock for a 
leader justice needs an attorney general of high personal 
reputation but the department must wait for the next 
administration to provide one

kennebec journal augusta maine on the resignation of attorney 
general meese iii 
the remarks by outgoing attorney general edwin meese iii prove 
once again that he and others in the reagan administration have 
completely missed the point 
meese announced his resigtation not in washington but at a 
news conference on the west coast that followed the filing of an 
830page report from indpendent counsel james mckay which will 
apparently not bring any indictments against the 56yearold meese 
that says the nations highest law enforcement officer is a 
vindication that will allow him to leave office with allegations of 
wrongdoing behind him 
baloney this is the same idiotic assertion weve heard all 
along that it somehow would be morally wrong to quit the office 
until justice had run its course 
by staying as long as he did meese placed himself above the 
interests of the agency he managed and above the interests of 
national law enforcement 
his departure is great news for the nation which at least now 
has the chance to get a fully functional justice department that 
wasnt going to happen with ed meese aboard

the commercial appeal memphis tenn on the federal proposal 
for notice of plant closings 
polls show that most americans favor laws requiring companies to 
give advance notice before they close plants such as the bill 
passed by congress but vetoed by president reagan 
those americans should consider what one executive calls the 
industry with the most elaborate federally imposed 
advancenotification requirements the railroads 
under the interstate commerce act a railroad has to inform 
union officials months before it closes a line get their consent 
to an implementing agreement and guarantee generous severance 
payments to any employees laid off 
but from 1947 to the present railroad employment has dropped 
from 13 million to 230000 during that same period total us 
employment has soared 
one can hardly ask for a clearer demonstration it is not 
government regulation that keeps workers on the job but vigorous 
competition in the private sector

the chattanooga tenn times on congressional pay raises 
how much is your congressman or senator worth opinions vary 
but each year congress has a battle over whether to raise its 
salary 
recently the house voted a 4 percent increase for federal 
employees but exempted members of congress and other top officials 
now rep dan rostenkowski dill has come up with a plan that 
seems daffy but could be valuable members of congress would be 
able to choose a salary between the current 89500 and the 
135000 last recommended by the federal pay commission but could 
not keep any honoraria for speeches to trade associations and other 
groups 
voters would decide in the next election whether the congressman 
is worth it rep rostenkowski thinks the plan would eliminate much 
of the hypocrisy that accompanies the annual debate over salaries 
especially when votes are called on pay increases 
some congressmen are underpaid and others are overpaid the 
rostenkowski plan would let members judge the value of their 
service and then a few months thereafter allow constituents to 
cast the judgment that really counts makes sense to us

colored people when the massachusetts governor and the texas 
senator entered the crowded ballroom 
it was in marked contrast to the rousing scene tuesday night 
when jackson addressed the same group 
in fact the first burst of enthusiasm from the audience came as 
naacp executive director benjamin hooks who introduced dukakis 
turned to the governor and said you know knowing jesse has been 
good for you 
the audience applauded and dukakis smiled 
in his speech dukakis promised that as president his door is 
going to be open 
then he went on ive learned a lot from jesse and ive 
learned a lot from you 
bentsen followed dukakis to the podium and said there can be 
no question where a dukakisbentsen administration would stand on 
the important civil rights issues of the day 
mike dukakis and i are committed to making a difference for 
america bentsen said 
but once again the loudest applause came during hooks 
introduction of the senator when he referred to jackson hooks 
looked at bentsen and said he had a tough act to follow many 
of our delegates as you know wanted to see jesse in this 
position 
at that point delegates stood and cheered and applauded 
i sympathize with you said hooks 
before dukakis entered the room hooks told delegates to tear up 
handlettered signs many were carrying that read jesse is 
qualified and whats wrong with jesse 
those of you who brought those signs tear them up and act 
your age said hooks 
the signs reflected disappointment that dukakis had passed over 
jackson in his search for a running mate several delegates 
expressed disgruntlement less over the fact jackson wasnt chosen 
as over the fact dukakis did not notify him in advance of the 
selection of bentsen 
jackson first learned of the selection of bentsen from reporters 
when he flew in to washingtons national airport 
while the response at the naacp convention was tepid dukakis 
and bentsen got a rousing reception on capitol hill earlier today 
at a 45minute private meeting with house democrats 
he sent one single message said rep ron wyden dore he 
wants to work with us and reach out to us thats what the congress 
wants to hear 
among those greeting the two men as they arrived was rep bill 
gray dpa the budget committee chairman and a senior leader 
among black house members gray said he had been disappointed that 
jackson was not the choice for no 2 
but its been made and i plan to support the ticket gray 
said 
gray said the two men will have to begin talking about issues of 
concern to blacks if they want to unite minority voters behind the 
campaign we are going to be concerned about longterm policy 
civil rights human investment he said 
another member of the congressional black caucus which was to 
meet with dukakis and bentsen later in the day said he believed 
the ticket has its work cut out to try to repair damage 
i frankly think hes made life a lot more difficult for 
himself and will have to work a lot harder rep ron dellums 
dcalif said of dukakis 
at a news conference in boston on tuesday dukakis said his 
selection of bentsen would harken back to the 1960 election when 
massachusetts sen john f kennedy turned to texan lyndon b 
johnson 
but jackson who had said a day earlier that he would accept 
second spot on the ticket if it were offered sounded unmoved by 
such comparisons 
asked at a news conference if he were angry at being passed 
over jackson replied no im too controlled im too clear im 
too mature to be angry im focused on what we must do to keep hope 
alive 
jackson who spoke to the naacp tuesday night brought the crowd 
to its feet when he called his campaign a great success despite 
being passed over for the no 2 spot 
i may not be on the ticket but im qualified thats what i 
know qualified he shouted to cheers 
i will never surrender jackson said i will not stop 
because the end has not yet come i will run on and on 
the choice of bentsen less than a week before the start of the 
democratic national convention in atlanta was hailed by most 
democrats and even a few republicans

meeting with house democrats where dukakis promised to forge a

democratic officeholders from coast to coast to become involved in 
the campaign

carolyn benally a navajo employment 
officer got some action when she complained to a local paper about 
favoritism in tribal civil service hiring she was fired 
her lawyer john chapela offers little encouragement for 
redress he is only in private practice because he was dismissed as 
head of the navajo housing authority for being he said in the 
wrong party 
civil rights attorneys say the navajos have perhaps the best of 
any tribal court system but they point to a recent scandal and 
allegations of civil rights abuses as evidence that individual 
navajos face discrimination by tribal leaders 
chairman peter macdonald who spoke in an interview with charm 
and persuasion of his plans to restore navajo prosperity denied 
any wrongdoing he has never been indicted much less convicted 
but even close associates acknowledge that recent developments 
provide cause for raised eyebrows 
a major scandal is bogate the tribes purchase of the big 
boquillas ranch near tuba city ariz a year ago 
middlemen paid tenneco west 262 million for it five minutes 
later the navajos bought the ranch for 334 million 
macdonald in an interview said the navajos paid a fair price 
and did not know what the intermediary purchasers had paid a 
commission to the middlemen was normal he said adding thats 
partly how business is done in america 
but a principal middleman was an old associate who had raised 
money for macdonalds campaigns the ranch had been on the market 
20 years 
shortly after the tribal council approved the purchase coconino 
county records show macdonald paid off the loan on his retirement 
home 
the circumstances prompted separate investigations by the 
inspectorgeneral of the interior department the internal revenue 
service and the fbi all are still under way 
more recently macdonald sought to assert tribal control over 
the navajo education and scholarship foundation regarded as a 
sinecure for his arch rival peterson zah the former chairman 
zah locked out of his office got a court order barring anyone 
from evicting him the tribe found another judge after a judicial 
tugofwar police shut down the whole building leaving 80 other 
employees in the street 
the integrity of the navajo nation law has been reduced to 
this game of musical doorknobs observed duane beyal zahs 
spokesman 
shortly after a group of workers marched to macdonalds office 
to ask for alternate quarters two participants were fired 
although the tribe gave other reasons for their dismissal 
dissent has been rare since macdonald shut down the 
independentminded navajo times daily in 1986 expelling editors 
before they could produce the next mornings edition macdonald 
said the tribeowned paper was losing money 
nevertheless the tribe spends 2 million a year on public 
relations firms and washington lobbyists macdonald acknowledged 
chapela who is collecting signatures for a recall that can take 
place only with approval from macdonalds handpicked council 
said his goal is to bankrupt the navajo nation to finance his 
goldplated retirement 
other sources speak to visitors in whispered asides or through 
notes passed at the navajo nation motor inn the focal point of 
this windswept capital city in northern arizona 
but warned a nonindian lawyer with long experience on the 
reservation allegations are not proof if macdonald is a 
crook he said he is a smart one to protect himself the 
lawyer insisted on anonymity

the state board of education today voted 
to take control of the finances of the debtridden pike county 
school system citing widespread nepotism in kentuckys 
thirdlargest district 
the action means that the 15250student school system cannot 
make purchases or hire anyone without written approval from state 
school superintendent john brock 
the board acted after receiving a consultants report detailing 
dozens of management problems within the states easternmost 
county a coalmining area with 87000 residents 
beyond what we see in writing there are unique political 
problems in pike county at the present time brock said 
the requirement that brock approve all personnel actions will 
relieve the fivemember local board of political pressure to hire 
friends and relatives of influential county residents the state 
superintendent said 
increased layoffs in the coal industry the consultants said 
had resulted in greater pressure on local board members to hire 
more people in the schools 
in some schools twothirds to threequarters of employees are 
related by blood or marriage 
the consultants report said the district would begin a third 
straight school year with a deficit budget the districts debt 
which was about 2000000 is now about 500000 
the report said the district needs to control spending close 
several schools reduce nonteaching staff and make an effort to 
collect delinquent taxes 
in may the new jersey education commissioner announced the 
state intends to take over jersey citys 32000student district 
under fire for a high dropout rate political hiring and firing and 
questionable finances 
besides kentucky and new jersey south carolina texas and new 
mexico have laws allowing state takeovers of failing school 
districts 
laws in illinois and arkansas let the state eliminate deficient 
districts an ohio law allows the state to revoke a troubled 
districts charter georgia officials may impose heavy financial 
penalties on such districts

michael dukakis told black leaders today that running mate lloyd 
bentsen has been a civil rights advocate since way back when in 
the 1940s while a disappointed jesse jackson was described as 
flabbergasted at the way he has been treated by the democratic 
nomineetobe 
jackson convention manager ron brown said negotiations with the 
dukakis campaign have been halted 
it is now up to michael dukakis to make it a unity 
convention brown said in an interview in atlanta 
brown said jackson and his aides could not understand what they 
felt was a deliberate dukakis snub of jackson who learned from 
reporters that bentsen was the vice presidential choice 
basically we were flabbergasted by the way this was handled 
brown said 
at the annual meeting of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people in washington dukakis sought black 
support in a speech that was mostly a straight campaign talk 
naacp president benjamin hooks told dukakis you know knowing 
jesse has been good for you 
and dukakis replied yes ben i learned a lot from jesse and 
ive learned a lot from youand im still learning 
as dukakis and bentsen wrestled with how to unify the party in 
advance of nest weeks convention in atlanta most democrats sang a 
chorus of praise for the 67yearold texas senator after his formal 
introduction as dukakis running mate at bostons faneuil hall 
hopeful refrains citing the parallels with the 1960 kennedyjohnson 
ticket were heard again and again 
hes a terrific guy hes very tough very smart oregon 
gov neil goldschmidt said of bentsen 
former vice president walter f mondale the 1984 democratic 
presidential nominee said bentsen has been a source of good 
sense moderation and decency throughout his years of public life 
he knows how to beat george bush said sen barbara 
mikulski dmd he did just that in 1970 when bentsen 
defeated bush for the first of three terms in the senate 
bush the republican nomineetobe called dukakis choice of 
the senate finance committee chairman interesting but refused 
to say more 
bushs supporters were quick to argue that democrats still wont 
carry the state bush calls home and its 29 electoral votes in 
the november balloting 
he is desperate he knows he cant win without carrying 
texas texas gov bill clements said of dukakis it aint going 
to work 
but the jackson problem loomed as the major stumbling block 
between dukakis and seamlessly positive four days in atlanta 
at the naacp dukakis referred to bentsens long committment to 
civil rights 
he was committed to civil rights and equal opportunities way 
back then way back then in the 1940s dukakis said 
bentsen then addressed the meeting with an admonition from 
hooks 
you may as well know youve got a hard act today so do your 
best hooks said many of our delegates wanted to see jesse in 
this position 
former party chief and jackson adviser john white echoed those 
sentiments about his fellow texan hes got one of the best civil 
rights records in the senate he voted against the poll tax when he 
was in the congress back in the 50s 
it was clear that the democratic ticket needed to calm some 
angry jackson backers 
i did think he was very rude not to let jesse know 
beforehand said beulah c wright of main line pa a naacp 
delegate 
i frankly think hes made life a lot more difficult for 
himself and will have to work a lot harder said rep ron 
dellums a jackson supporter from california 
jackson spoke to naacp tuesday night delivering an emotional 
speech that drew cheers from the overflow crowd 
i may not be on the ticket but im qualified thats what i 
know qualified jackson shouted i will never surrender 
the civil rights leader promised that he would press his stands 
on the issues at the convention that opens monday 
we go to atlanta not to smile and style and profile but to 
deliberate and debate our nations priorities jackson said 
ann lewis a top jackson adviser said today that the 
presidential hopeful will strike a positive tone at the convention 
youre going to see a jesse jackson who is forward looking 
whos talking about the fall whos talking about the issues she 
said on cbs this morning 
earlier tuesday at a news conference jackson insisted he was 
not angry at the dukakis decision 
no im too controlled im too clear im too mature to be 
angry im focused on what we must do to keep hope alive he said 
earlier jackson had clearly been upset that he learned of 
dukakis choice from reporters rather than from the massachusetts 
governor directly 
bush spoke to the naacp ahead of all the democrats addressing 
them early on tuesday he didnt mention bentsen but he did praise 
jackson 
i salute him for running the race for being heard and he 
deserves a salute from us the vice president said 
late tuesday on the way to baseballs allstar game in 
cincinnati bush had only a brief remark on the choice of bentsen 
thats interesting thats what i think about it 
dukakis often compares himself to the last president from 
massachusetts john f kennedy and invited more comparisons of 
his decision for bentsen with kennedys selection of texas sen 
lyndon b johnson in 1960 
bentsen put it this way the massachusetts and the texas axis 
was good for the country and good for the democratic party in 1960 
and its going to be a real winner in november of 88 
theres something lucky about a massachusettstexas 
connection said north carolina lt gov bob jordan 
the bostonaustin axis is reborn applauded rep richard a 
gephardt of missouri a former contender for the democratic 
nomination 
he will help the ticket in the south and all over the 
country added sen albert gore jr of tennessee another former 
hopeful for both the presidential and vice presidential nominations 
another former hopeful sen paul simon of illinois said 
when the american people get to know lloyd bentsen it will 
strengthen the ticket everywhere 
the preparations for mondays opening session in atlanta 
intensified as construction work in the convention hall was wrapped 
up the trickle of delegates party pros and news people arriving 
in the city turned to a steady flow 
polls in texas said bentsen would help dukakis there but 
nationally the polls said the voters knew little of the texan 
its like dropping a rock in a pond and having no ripples 
theyre both unknowns to californians said golden state pollster 
mervin field

a widely used blood pressure medicine appears to 
reduce progressive enlargement of the heart a common and hazardous 
complication of heart attacks according to a preliminary study 
heart enlargement can lead to congestive heart failure a 
condition that leaves victims exhausted and short of breath 
in their study doctors tested the effects of captopril one of 
a group of drugs known as angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors 
that are used to lower high blood pressure 
the study was not large enough to determine whether the 
treatment helps people live longer or should be widely used after 
heart attacks 
although our study suggests that there may be a longterm 
benefit to treating some patients before they develop symptoms 
captopril must be further evaluated before we can recommend its 
general use for postheart attack patients at risk for cardiac 
enlargement said dr marc a pfeffer 
pfeffers study conducted at brigham and womens hospital in 
boston was published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
the study was performed on 59 heart attack victims who were at 
high risk of heart enlargement during a year of followup further 
enlargement stopped in those who got captopril but not in a 
comparison group 
pfeffer and other researchers have begun a major study to see if 
the therapy saves lives and prevents heart failure the treatment 
will be studied in about 2200 patients at 41 hospitals over five 
years

lloyd bentsen retired from the house of 
representatives in 1954 at the age of 33 declaring he wanted to 
make some real money announcing for the senate 16 years later the 
new millionaire explained i want to be remembered for 
something other than my financial statement 
i think people are a little bit like ivy the texas democrat 
added they ought to be repotted once in a while 
at 67 bentsen is looking to be repotted once again as vice 
president likely democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
named bentsen as his running mate tuesday 
bentsen brings to the ticket more than a southwestern flavor and 
a chance for democrats to carry his big home state after 17 years 
in the senate 1 years as chairman of the finance committee and a 
stint as chief fundraiser for democratic senators he is as much a 
washington insider as dukakis is not a situation reminiscent of 
the cartermondale ticket in 1976 
bentsen is tall slim and dapper a millionaire with a patrician 
air he is also a highly decorated world war ii bomber pilot 
lawyer presbyterian and native texan who has close ties with 
business a strong record on civil rights and a history of 
supporting two of his home states biggest industries oil and the 
military like dukakis he speaks fluent spanish 
he is a forceful committee chairman who is seldom heard to raise 
his voice and who rarely seeks out the television cameras like 
dukakis he speaks fluent spanish although he flopped at his own 
try for the presidency in 1976 bentsen is credited with having the 
strongest texas political organization in in modern times it was 
he who denied george bush a seat in the senate in 1970 
publicly at least bentsen has done little in washington to 
ruffle feathers he admitted fault so quickly in his only hint at 
personal scandal that he almost turned it into a plus 
that came in january 1987 immediately after he took over as 
finance committee chairman when he solicited lobbyists to have 
breakfast with him once a month for a 10000 campaign 
contribution once the story broke and critics raised the specter 
of a powerful lawmaker offering himself for sale it took bentsen 
only a couple days to back down 
im not known to make many mistakes but when i do its a 
doozy he said in a statement and in forming that breakfast 
club i really blew it the last thing i want is anything that 
would reflect on my integrity 
until taking over the finance committee bentsen was little 
known outside washington 
he had had a stint in the late 1970s as chairman of the joint 
economic committee a panel that does not write legislation and 
used the post to advocate tax cuts to spur investment and savings 
long before president reagan came to power with promises of such a 
program 
by the time sen russell b long dla retired as chairman of 
the finance committee in 1986 giving bentsen a chance to push his 
own ideas reagans plan had been written into law 
bentsen often is described as a centrist in 1986 a 
conservative rating group gave him a 50 for his senate votes a 
liberal group rated him at 45 he supported democratic partyline 
votes 46 percent of the time and opposed them 50 percent of the 
time 
as chairman of the finance committee bentsen is wellplaced to 
put his mark on legislation dealing with taxes trade welfare 
health insurance and social security as chairman he seems to push 
for the middle ground as often as he was pulled toward a consensus 
in earlier days on the committee 
thus in an effort to get a trade bill that president reagan 
would sign bentsen accepted several house provisions especially 
those aimed at protecting us workers and at retaliating against 
unfair trade practices that were less than he wanted 
republicans controlled the finance committee when the massive 
1986 tax overhaul was enacted and bentsen faced the prospect of 
voting to repeal major provisions including the investment credit 
and capitalgains preferences that he had supported in the end 
he voted for repeal in order to pay for a significant rate 
reduction for most individuals and corporations but he was never 
enthusiastic about the package 
the texan has fought feverishly to retain special tax treatment 
for the oil industry especially the independent companies not 
affiliated with the giant major firms his biggest battle over the 
1986 bill was a losing effort to soften the bite on real estate 
developers although he had called for some change on grounds the 
old law was far too generous 
under bentsens leadership the finance committee this year has 
cranked out landmark bills overhauling the welfare system and 
expanding medicare to cover some costs of catastrophic illness 
bentsen who served briefly as a county judge used his familys 
considerable wealth to win election to the house for the first time 
in 1948 he retired after three terms to run his own lucrative 
insurance and financial services business 
he won election to the senate in 1970 by unseating liberal sen 
ralph yarborough in the democratic primary he defeated bush in 
november with 54 percent of the votes and was reelected in 1976 
with 57 percent and in 1982 with 59 percent 
bentsen has been married for 44 years to beryl ann bentsen 
known as ba a former fashion model they have three grown 
children

jesse jackson has halted all preconvention 
negotiations with the campaign of michael dukakis after the 
handling of the vice presidential announcement left the jackson 
forces flabbergasted his convention manager said today 
ron brown one of jacksons closest advisers said jackson was 
incredulous that dukakis did not call him as jackson had been told 
would happen before the vice presidential decision was announced 
jackson said he learned of the lloyd bentsen selection from 
reporters about an hour before receiving a call from dukakis 
basically we were flabbergasted by the way this was handled 
brown said 
looking ahead to next weeks party convention here the jackson 
forces are on hold regarding the ongoing platform and issues 
discussions they were holding with dukakis people he said 
he said the ball is in dukakis court to undo the damage by 
reaching out to jackson and he said the jackson campaigns 
demeanor at the convention depends on that 
the campaign is keeping its options open for convention floor 
fights he said declining to elaborate 
it is now up to michael dukakis to make it a unity 
convention brown said 
as to the delay in telling jackson about the bentsen selection 
brown said it seems unlikely it was an oversight 
it seems like too big a mistake that politically astute people 
would make brown said 
when dukakis finally called him tuesday morning to inform him 
rather than consult with him jackson kept the conversation short 
there was no explanation there was nothing else to say

the state department formally asked the 
organization of american states today to approve the expulsion of 
nicaraguas ambassador to the united states who also serves as oas 
ambassador 
richard mccormack the us ambassador to the international 
body delivered a note to ambassador eladio knipping of the 
dominican republic who is also president of the oas permament 
council 
if you are in violation of your diplomatic status in the 
united states article 3 of the oas privileges and immunity 
agreement does not exempt you from expulsion said russell 
wapensky a state department official 
meanwhile richard melton the us ambassador to nicaragua who 
was expelled by the sandinista government along with seven 
colleagues said today he believes nicaragua took the action in 
order to intimidate the opposition 
melton told a white house news conference that the sandinistas 
wanted to demonstrate to the opposition that they are alone and 
isolated with nowhere to turn 
he noted that one of the functions of those expelled was to deal 
with opposition leaders he flatly denied that the embassy was 
involved in organizing and financing the opposition 
on capitol hill senators angered by meltons expulsion and the 
shutting down of the newspaper la prensa and the catholic radio 
station prepared to introduce legislation condemning the sandinista 
government and providing further economic and perhaps military 
assistance to the contras 
we are moving now because the sandinista goons have been in 
the streets of managua again because the light of freedom has 
been nearly snuffed out again said senate republican leader bob 
dole of kansas 
house speaker jim wright of texas said a bipartisan group of 
lawmakers is drafting a house resolution that will call upon the 
nicaraguan government to reopen the organs of free expression and 
repeal the law that permits the response they made 
members of the senate intelligence committee attempted to hold a 
public hearing to question melton on the reasons behind his 
expulsion but were blocked by an objection lodged by sen 
christopher dodd dconn an opponent of contra aid 
chairman david boren dokla told reporters that he and other 
committee members had questioned melton privately and found no 
indication that either he or any of his fellow diplomats were 
engaged in espionage or other acts that might have justified their 
expulsion 
earlier nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann said he would 
consult with his government on whether to challenge the legality of 
the us decision to order him out of the country 
deputy secretary of state john whitehead said today on nbctvs 
today that the united states has no plans to cut diplomatic 
ties with managua despite the titfortat ambassadorial expulsions 
its important for us to maintain contact in some kind of 
relations even with government that we have very little respect 
for whitehead said 
he said managuas actions including the closing down of an 
opposition newspaper and radio station show that the last 
vestiges of freedom in nicaragua seem to be disappearing 
the state department after formally notifying tunnermann of the 
expulsion order said tuesday night that the envoy and military 
attache major pedro sampson mendoza had engaged in abuses which 
warrant their expulsion six other nicaraguan diplomats were also 
ordered expelled 
at issue in whether tunnermann can be expelled is his dual role 
as both ambassador to the united states and to the oas an 
international body whose diplomats are protected from retaliation 
under its charter 
we need to prove that each state of the organization of 
american states has the right to appoint its ambassador to the oas 
that is the problem which is now under question tunnermann told 
reporters after he met with under secretary of state michael 
armacost 
hours earlier president reagan said he was ordering tunnermann 
and seven of his diplomatic colleagues out of the country in 
retaliation for nicaraguas expulsion of eight american diplomats 
including ambassador richard melton 
were going to do to him president daniel ortega what he did 
to us reagan said 
but by leaving the clear impression that the expulsion order was 
purely retaliatory he left an opening for a challenge to the 
legality of the move because of tunnermanns role as oas 
ambassador hence the state departments statement later that he 
was being expelled for unspecified abuses 
the oas is a 32member regional body which attempts to solve 
diplomatic disputes and to promote hemispheric cooperation 
tunnermann said he had discussed by telephone with government 
officials in managua the possibility of defying the us expulsion 
order but that no decision had been reached he said the current 
case was the first of its kind in the history of the oas whose 
origins date back 99 years 
state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
tunnermann and his colleagues were given until friday to leave the 
united states the 72hour period is the same that was given to 
us diplomats in managua to depart 
nicaraguan foreign minister miguel descoto said monday that 
melton and seven us embassy aides were ordered to leave the 
country because they were engaged in activities complementary to 
the state terrorism the administration of us president ronald 
reagan is carrying out against nicaragua 
mrs oakley called the charges false and said they are not 
worthy of further comment she added that the sandinista action 
follows a virulent propaganda campaign directed at subduing and 
intimidating the people of nicaragua and suppressing any dissent 
responding to questions from reporters mrs oakley said the 
nicaraguan envoys were being expelled not only as retaliation but 
in the cases of tunnermann and sampson for abuse of their 
privileges of residence in the united states she did not 
elaborate 
she said that other measures against nicaragua are being 
considered but she gave no details reagan raised the possibility 
of a break in relations but other officials said that step was 
unlikely 
tunnermann spoke with indignation to reporters in describing his 
session with armacost he denied ever having violated the rules 
governing his stay here

if michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen head out on 
the campaign trail singing vaya con dios to one another it 
will be understandable the language at least if not the singing 
part 
while neither of the reserved politicians is known for bursting 
into song both are known to speak fluent spanish 
thus the democrats have a twosome that should be able to 
communicate well with voters in the southwest and other 
heavilyhispanic regions 
bentsen grew up in south texas just a few miles from the mexican 
border a bicultural region where spanish is widely spoken 
dukakis honed his spanish many years ago while studying in peru 
he made effective use in california and texas primaries of a 
spanishlanguage ad in which he spoke directly to voters rather 
than using spanish voiceover as is commonly done

a twoyear study found that minority 
children often fall behind in math skills as early as the third 
grade 
the 125000 study described as one of the nations most 
extensive examination of math education looked at 28000 students 
from kindergarten through the 12th grade in montgomery county 
outside washington 
it consisted of anaylses of various tests and interviews with 
students parents principals and counselors 
according to the study funded by the national science 
foundation about 8 percent of the asians and whites in the third 
grade performed below grade level compared to 15 percent for 
hispanics and 20 percent for blacks 
when the students reached sixth grade the percentage of 
students working below grade level climbed to 16 percent for 
asians 22 percent for whites 39 percent for hispanics and 51 
percent for blacks the study found 
the study also uncovered subtle differences in the math 
accomplishments of boys and girls 
until the last years of high school girls take as many math 
courses as boys and do as well or better however by the junior 
and senior years boys take more sophisticated math courses such 
as advanced algebra and calculus 
boys also tend to do better that girls on the math portion of 
college entrance exams the study found 
educators speculated that the reasons for the disparities could 
include lower expectations of black and hispanic students less 
preparation among minorities before they begin school and 
different views among female and minority students of their own 
abilities and future careers 
the demographic data is quite clear bassam shakhasheri 
assistant director for science and engineering education at the 
foundation said at a news conference tuesday 
before very long around the year 2000 85 percent of those 
entering the work force will be minorities and women the nation 
requires both a good cadre of scientists and engineers and a 
citizenry that understands the benefits of science and the 
potential risks of technological advances 
that is a fairly typical finding all the way through said 
elizabeth fennema professor of curriculum and instruction at the 
university of wisconsin at madison 
she noted that the racial disparities were similar to those 
detected in the recent national assessment of educational progress 
and that several studies have found that girls do less well than 
boys in highorder math skills

an engineer investigating the collapse 
of a texas department store that killed 14 people said today that 
important building records are missing 
gary g nichols and glenn j winslow civil engineers with 
birminghambased southern building code congress international 
inc are the primary investigators of the collapse last week of 
the amigo store in brownsville 
weve been told that the building department has moved two or 
three times over the period of time when the building was built and 
some of the records may have been involved in a flood nichols 
said wednesday 
he said the city is still going through its records which were 
stored in several different places in search of construction plans 
for the building 
the engineers said their investigation has been hampered by 
sketchy information from witnesses and the absence of records 
including specifications 
the two were in brownsville saturday through monday searching 
for clues to the july 7 collapse of the threestory building during 
a heavy rainstorm 
right now we dont know why it happened winslow said 
tuesday we may not ever know what caused it 
a preliminary report on the collapse should be complete late 
this week he said adding that a complete report will take months 
to complete 
nichols said he and winslow are looking into the possibility 
that the rain may have caused the collapse if the buildings drain 
pipes were clogged water could have backed up and its weight 
triggered the fall he said 
nichols and winslow work for a nonprofit agency that writes 
building codes for governments 
its engineers examine building materials and write 
recommendations on how they should be used in construction and 
examine structures that have fallen 
nearly 2000 city county and state building departments are 
served by the organization

an fbi official testified wednesday that 
criticism of the bureaus library awareness program has been 
overblown and that agents making official visits to libraries 
are interested solely in the activities of soviet spies 
james h geer assistant directorintelligence division told a 
house panel that the program is narrowly focused principally on 
scientific and technical libraries in the new york city area 
geer said the fbi made 21 contacts with greater new york 
libraries between late 1985 and 1987 most visits simply alerted 
librarians to use of their facilities by soviet agents engaged in 
recruiting and informationgathering he said 
visits to libraries outside new york were not part of any 
program but resulted from leads in specific counterintelligence 
cases geer told the house judiciary subcommittee on civil rights 
organizations of librarians and civil liberties groups have 
asserted there is a pattern of fbi interest in libraries across the 
country and have accused the bureau of intimidating library 
employees 
they said the bureau was trying to to enlist library personnel 
as spies to identify patrons who might be gathering information 
for foreign powers librarians they said were given broad 
requests to monitor patrons with russian or easterneuropean 
sounding names 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the subcommittee said 
some of the nations most respected librarians are scared to 
death of the program 
geer tried to assure edwards that this isnt any kind of a 
massive program i dont expect any great return edwards replied 
that there has been a massive public reaction against the 
program 
the fbi official testified our library contacts seek to 
inform selected librarians that they and their libraries are and 
have historically been significant sis soviet intelligence 
services targets for intelligence activities and recruitment 
suitable scenarios have been developed by the sis to approach 
students librarians scientists and engineers to secure their 
cooperation payments or other inducements have been offered he 
said 
geer said lists of patrons with foreignsounding names or 
accents are not of interest or concern to the bureau 
he also denied that the fbi has used physical or electronic 
surveillance in libraries contacted under the awareness program 
nor has it asked employees to circumvent confidentiality rules or 
laws he said

the democratic national convention next week is 
expected to cost the city of atlanta about 15 million with the 
georgia legislature and a few local banks already taking care of 
much of the fundraising 
in new orleans site of the republican convention on aug 1518 
the city has struggled to come up with the funds to pay for 
security measures 5000 upholstered chairs and the lighting and 
sound systems for the superdome 
the two host cities faced with expensive convention pricetags 
have taken different paths toward raising the money to pay the 
bills 
in atlanta the total cost for the fourday convention is 24 
million with the democratic party picking up 9 million of the tab 
the remaining cost will be raised from a 2cent hotelmotel tax in 
effect in the city and fulton county through july 1990 
last year the state legislature passed a bill increasing the 
tax and earmarking the money for the atlanta 88 committee inc a 
nonprofit corporation created by the city county and state to 
plan and stage the convention 
we have a nice cushion built in in what we need to borrow and 
what our interest revenues are going to be said atlanta 88 
president bobby kahn there would have to be a virtual depression 
in the convention industry for our revenue projections not to be 
met 
two atlanta banks also agreed in late may to provide a loan of 
up to 9 million to help cover the costs until atlanta 88 receives 
those revenues 
in new orleans early fundraising was slow and complaints by 
the greater new orleans convention fund that big companies were 
failing to contribute forced mayor sidney barthelemy to appoint 
another committee 
the second committee formed on may 12 immediately launched an 
intensified campaign that came up with cash and commitments of more 
than 250000 
hotels have pledged 10 percent of the money they receive from 
rooms in use during the convention an estimated 15 million 
i think were going to be on target said ron jones who is 
heading the new orleans fundraising effort this has always been 
a town that gets its big hits late 
jones president of louisiana cocacola bottling co and 
chairman of the business council of new orleans said that in an 
effort to raise money special perks will be added for people who 
give 1000 or more including tickets to the convention admission 
to parks and museums and invitations to receptions with the mayor 
and governor 
atlanta 88 which was organized immediately after atlanta was 
awarded the democratic convention in february 1987 has not faced 
the same financial problems although it must pay some high costs 
among the expenses are 13 million for rental of the omni 
coliseum which began may 28 875000 for rental of the georgia 
world congress center and parking which began july 1 and 2 
million for construction of among other things lighting grids a 
sound system seat removal and podium construction said ruth 
berry press secretary for the democratic national convention

a proud and defiant jesse jackson is vowing to 
keep fighting to atlanta for the presidential nomination and the 
causes he believes in when the air clears he says i no doubt 
will support the ticket that the convention elects next week 
several supporters said today that despite his disappointment 
with being passed over by michael dukakis for the vice presidential 
spot jackson already is looking ahead to next weeks convention 
hes going to talk about why we need a democratic victory in 
november a key adviser ann lewis told cbs this morning she 
said she had spoken at length with jackson and that in atlanta 
youre going to see a jesse jackson who is forwardlooking whos 
talking about the fall whos talking about the issues 
rep charles rangel dny reflecting the wariness of many 
jackson supporters said of jackson it was disappointing to be 
interviewed for the high office of vice president one evening and 
then the next morning to be notified by newspaper reporters that a 
decision has been made 
ron brown one of jacksons closest advisers said jackson was 
incredulous that dukakis did not call him before he learned of the 
selection of sen lloyd bentsen of texas basically we were 
flabbergasted by the way this was handled brown said 
he said jackson has halted all preconvention negotiations on 
platform and other issues with the dukakis campaign he said it is 
up to dukakis to undo the damage by reaching out to jackson and he 
said the jackson campaigns demeanor at the convention depends on 
that 
it is now up to michael dukakis to make it a unity 
convention brown said 
jackson arrived back home in chicago today after a day in the 
capital that began with a public humiliation and ended with a 
throng of 2500 people at an naacp convention on its feet cheering 
in adulation as jackson vowed 
i may or may not be on the ticket but im qualified thats 
what i know qualified hold on til morning comes qualified 
and he added pointedly this year weve earned a spot on the 
ticket 
michael dukakis was addressing the civil rights organizations 
convention today vice president george bush also spoke to the 
naacp tuesday 
jackson told reporters earlier tuesday im too controlled im 
too clear im too mature to be angry at being passed over for 
the ticket 
but he was clearly stung by the fact that he learned of 
dukakiss selection of bentsen from reporters tuesday morning when 
his campaign jet landed in washington 
bentsen was in the same airport terminal preparing to board a 
private jet to boston but he and jackson did not come face to 
face dukakis called jackson an hour later before the official 
announcement but after word had already gotten out 
maxine waters a california cochair of jacksons campaign was 
indignant about the dukakis camps handling of the matter 
something was wrong with that she said in an interview 
tuesday night not only people who are jackson supporters but 
people who are dukakis supporters think it was an awful 
treatment 
jackson said it would be inappropriate for me to comment 
upon the selection of the texas senator since he had had no 
opportunity for indepth discussion with senator bentsen and no 
prior discussion with governor dukakis about bentsens selection 
but his emotional address to the naacp was a clear repudiation 
of any notion emanating from the dukakis camp that it is time for 
jackson to admit he has been vanquished 
i will never surrender he shouted i will not stop 
because the end has not yet come im running because this 
struggle for justice is both ancient and endless 
jackson turned his attention to next weeks convention saying 
it is not time for show business 
waters raised the idea that jacksons name might be entered into 
nomination for the vice presidency which goes beyond anything 
jackson himself has said 
we havent developed a strategy she said i havent had a 
chance to look at it closelyits an idea that we will make a 
determination about in the next few days 
jackson however was talking about the presidential nomination 
not the no 2 spot 
when my name goes in nomination our struggle is being 
vindicated he said we go to atlanta not to smile and style 
and profile but to deliberate and debate our nations priorities 
they say well you shouldnt do that youre taking up our 
primetime network time weve got drums to roll and trombones to 
blow and weve got paegantry and you cant win you are fighting 
against the odds dont you know 
well dont they know i was born against the odds i survived 
against the odds im an oddsbreaker and a dreammaker and i 
will never surrender said jackson 
asked at his news conference earlier tuesday if he would 
encourage supporters to enthusiastically back the dukakisbentsen 
ticket jackson said we can only address that after the 
nomination is over on wednesday night 
but he added i no doubt will support the ticket that the 
convention elects next week

heavy rain deluged some droughthit areas as congress began 
working on a package of relief for americas farmers and farmers 
in kentucky today greeted the arrival of the first shipment of hay 
airlifted free from oregon 
everything looks so good with a bit of rain over the past 24 
hours farmer herman krone said tuesday at his 2800acre farm in 
southern illinois which president reagan plans to visit thursday 
during a tour of the droughtstricken area 
however krone said almost onethird of his 1200 acres of corn 
already have been lost 
marth wilkinson wife of kentucky gov wallace wilkinson and 
business manager of the familys farm was at louisvilles 
standiford field today for the arrival of the first hay shipment 
from portland ore united parcel service plans to ship free of 
charge 20 to 30 tons of hay from portland to louisville each day 
for the next two weeks 
the agriculture department meanwhile issued a report 
predicting severe damage to the harvest from the drought it 
estimated for example that corn output this year would shrivel to 
52 billion bushels down from 706 billion last year 
the dry weather is the largest drought that our nation has 
ever experienced agriculture secretary richard e lyng told 
legislators i think history will show that its truly more 
mammoth than any of us has ever experienced 
extremely heavy rain fell tuesday in sections of texas 
louisiana oklahoma and arkansas 
in texas more than 6 inches fell in 75 minutes in mesquite 
washing a pickup truck and several cars into a creek and leaving 
some homes 8 inches deep in water water was up to the tops of cars 
in garland and street flooding was reported in heath nearly 6 
inches fell in dequeen ark 
showers and thunderstorms were widespread over the middle 
atlantic states the tennessee valley and the gulf coast states 
thunderstorms boomed today over the dakotas and minnesota 
in washington the house and senate agriculture committees began 
working on wideranging legislation that would provide payments of 
up to 100000 each to farmers whose crops have been wiped out by 
the dry spell 
house agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza 
dtexas called for final action on the measure by midaugust 
the drought has dried up pastures forcing livestock farmers to 
go far afield for hay 
the hay that arrived in kentuky today will be stored at a 
fairgrounds and distributed next week by lottery to farmers who 
will pay for the hay officials said 
it seems like everyone in the state wants this hay state 
department of agriculture spokesman roger nesbitt said tuesday 
the delay has angered some farmers such as bernetta smith who 
expects to run out of hay for her 147 beef cows in one to two days 
i dont see any sense in storing it because people need this hay 
i dont understand it she said 
at least 50 truckloads of hay gathered from the carolinas and 
virginia are being shipped to ohio on thursday in a drive organized 
by the charlotte motor speedway and the national association for 
stock car auto racing 
despite the recent rain communities with driedup water 
supplies continue to restrict water use 
until the drought ends the 650 residents of vintondale pa 
about 50 miles east of pittsburgh will have to do without running 
water from 7 pm to 7 am every day mayor michael palovich said 
tuesday palovich said he was trying to arrange for an emergency 
supply to be trucked in

nevada area the state board of wildlife commissioners removed the 
limit on catches at rye patch and lahontan reservoirs because the 
reservoirs are expected to be dry by the end of summer leaving

house republicans called wednesday for rep 
vic fazio dcalif to step aside from the ethics committees 
conflictofinterest case against speaker jim wright because he 
enlisted wrights help for a california political fundraiser 
the action came in a resolution unanimously approved in a 
closeddoor session of the house republican conference the 
organization of all gop house members said johanna schneider 
spokeswoman for minority leader robert michel rill 
the resolution also included a call for the ethics panel 
formally known as the committee on standards of official conduct 
to appoint an independent counsel to aid in the wright 
investigation that matter is still under consideration by the 
panel which opened its probe june 9 
the resolution came just four days before the democrats open 
their national convention with wright as chairman in atlanta 
wright has been accused by republicans of improperly intervening 
with federal regulators on behalf of texas businesses and of 
collecting unduly high royalties on a book he wrote which was 
published by a wright campaign contractor copies of the book were 
sold to specialinterest groups and an aide on wrights 
congressional payroll helped prepare it 
the speaker contends the charges are politically motivated 
fazio a member of the ethics panel helped arrange for wright 
to be the featured speaker at a 500aplate political luncheon in 
sacramento in june less than two weeks after the committee opened 
its wright probe 
republicans maintain fazio cannot appear to be a fair judge in 
the wright case if the speaker agrees to help him raise money for 
party causes fazio said there was nothing wrong with the 
arrangement and that political fund raising by the house speaker 
is a routine matter 
neither fazio nor wright directly benefited from the luncheon 
which was to raise money to help elect democrats to the house and 
for a program called impact 2000 aimed at helping elect democrats 
to state legislative seats to help increase the partys influence 
over redistricting 
the resolution stated that to maintain the ethics panels 
integrity any member faced with a situation that might appear to 
be a conflict should voluntarily excuse him or herself from those 
deliberations a temporary replacement could then be named to 
maintain the 6to6 party balance on the committee it said 
the document which has no binding force but is simply an 
expression of opinion by the conference did not mention fazio by 
name earlier versions had included his name but the language was 
toned down at the urging of gop members of the ethics committee 
said rep jerry lewis rcalif chairman of the republican policy 
committee 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash said the resolution 
was part of an obvious attempt to politicize this wright 
investigation and its most unfortunate he said fazios ability 
to be an impartial member of the panel had not been affected by the 
fundraiser

years made their latest debut last march 30 their eightweek run

previously written special material comedy acts and music 
the smothers brothers show had been one of the most popular

ingbrit kack a swedish clerk on 
holiday was on the deck of the city of poros admiring the sunset 
when a handsome young man 10 feet away pulled a submachine gun from 
his backpack and started shooting 
it was 7 pm monday july 11 the ship was bound for its home 
dock at the trocadero marina with 417 foreign tourists and 22 crew 
members after a daycruise through the greek islands 
what the brochure called a once in a lifetime cruise 
suddenly became a hell of gunfire grenade explosions and raging 
flames the attack took four minutes when it was over nine people 
were dead and 98 wounded 
mrs kack spoke from her hospital bed tuesday of the young man 
who fired first 
he was sitting about three meters away from me i saw him go 
over to a storage compartment put his backpack on it and i 
remember the clicking sound he made as he fumbled around inside it 
reminded me of a roulette wheel he was obviously loading his 
weapon then 
at least two other terrorists opened fire and hurled grenades 
setting fire to the ship the sun deck collapsed onto passengers in 
the lounge below some terrified passengers jumped into the saronic 
gulf to escape 
the terrorists got away in a waiting speedboat or by jumping 
off the ship with pasengers according to conflicting reports 
security officials said they believe the attackers intended to 
hijack the ship and demand the release of a palestinian jailed in 
athens who is accused of bombing a pan am jet six years ago 
it was a hot and sunny day perfect for a cruise as the city of 
poros left the trocadero marina at 830 am passed the peace and 
friendship sports stadium and steamed for the rocky island of hydra 
the ship docked at hydra at 1130 am most passengers got off 
for a stroll through the picturesque town built of sandstone 
then the liner was off for poros the island for which it is 
named it arrived at 215 pm a french passengers description of 
the scene contrasts with the horror that was less than five hours 
away 
some had lunch on board others got off and ate in poros 
people chatted laughed played cards it couldnt have been a 
nicer day 
while the vacationers were bound for poros a rented car blew up 
near the trocadero marina and the two men in it were blown to bits 
police said the car was rented by a lebanese man identified as 
hamoud abdul hamid 36 and was packed with weapons and explosives 
they theorized that the car was part of a plot to hijack the city 
of poros 
officers examined the remnants of the car as the ship made its 
way to the island of aegina the last call before heading in 
passengers had about two hours to shop or go swimming harbor 
authorities said the terrorists apparently boarded the ship during 
that carefree time at 630 pm 
they struck 30 minutes later as the ship was 16 miles from home 
and hundreds of passengers enjoyed the last rays of sun on the deck 
or a drink in the lounge below 
karen vigle a 17yearold student from france said she and 
some school friends had been admiring the good looks of a young 
man not knowing he would try to kill them a few minutes later 
and then 
it was like a bad dream i heard people screaming and the 
ratatat of machine gun fire i just lay face downwards on the 
deck and waited for it all to end many people panicked grabbed 
life jackets and jumped overboard 
she was shot in the leg and burned in a hospital bed nearby a 
critically injured friend screamed in pain as nurses changed the 
dressings on her wounds 
during the attack one of mrs kacks travel companions ulf 
johanson shouted for gods sake dont move 
those words saved my life they didnt save my 
sisterinlaws though said mrs kack who had shrapnel wounds 
and burns 
the sisterinlaw irene kack 55 was among hundreds of 
panicstricken passengers who ran when the gunfire started a 
bullet in the back killed her 
another swedish tourist 66yearold greta nilsson was chatting 
with friends when there was this huge blast and i saw my husband 
rolling down the stairway 
we were talking about getting our money back because our guide 
hadnt shown up for the trip when there was this terrific flash 
i really thought i was going to die she said mrs nilsson 
was hospitalized with shock and her husband karlevic 66 suffered 
head injuries 
one of six guides for 40 french school children who asked that 
his name not be used said he put life jackets on all of them and 
prepared them to jump overboard but a tugboat pulled alongside and 
they slid down ropes to its deck 
it was strange but there was suddenly complete silence he 
said the gunmen were nowhere to be seen there was just lots of 
thick black smoke and several boats coming to our rescue

a us diplomat said wednesday the united 
states may be trying to play down the latest usiran skirmish in 
the persian gulf out of sensitivity over the navys destruction of 
an iranian jetliner 
there was virtually no new information released about a clash 
tuesday night between three us helicopters and several iranian 
boats in the northern gulf 
us military officials said they had no further information 
about whether an iranian speedboat was damaged in the encounter 
they said they couldnt say if the navy had conducted a search for 
debris or survivors 
such searches have been routine after previous clashes involving 
irans small armed boats and us helicopters 
one us officer speaking on condition of anonymity said a 
search would depend in part on the risk involved 
a us diplomat who is knowledgeable about official us policy 
in the gulf said us authorities were providing very little 
information possibly because of the downing of the jetliner 
we just dont want to be killing any more iranians he said 
on the other hand we dont want our people to be killed either 
the diplomat was referring to the shooting down of an iran air 
a300 airbus by the us missile cruiser vincennes on july 3 all 
290 aboard died when the warship destroyed the jetliner navy 
officials said the vincennes crew mistook the jet for an f14 
fighter 
officials said tuesdays skirmish occurred about dusk after the 
us missile frigate nicholas off the saudi arabian coast heard a 
mayday message from the universal monarch a panamanianflag tanker 
the tanker reported it was under attack by small armed boats 15 
miles west of farsi island a military base long used by irans 
revolutionary guards for attacks on shipping 
the pentagon said the nicholas sh60b seahawk helicopter and 
two attack helicopters responded to the distress signal and drew 
fire from the iranian boats 
the attack aircraft retaliated with rockets and rapidfiring 
gatling guns possibly damaging one of the boats according to the 
pilots us officials said they said the helicopters were not hit 
and there were no us casualties 
maj barry willey a spokesman at us central command 
headquarters in tampa fla said on wednesday there was no 
further assessment of damage to the iranian boats beyond the 
initial report 
us officials who spoke on condtion of anonymity said the 
pilots identified the attackers as boston whalertype boats 
flatbottomed glass fiberhulled craft powered by outboard motors 
and commonly used by the revolutionary guards especially around 
farsi 
the universal monarch managed by a hong kong company suffered 
no casualties in the attack but briefly caught fire and its engine 
room was flooded according to gulfbased shipping executives who 
spoke on condition of anonymity and lloyds shipping intelligence 
unit in london 
the ship was towed to bahrain overnight

in a region where concern about terrorism 
is high and the profile of american military personnel low us 
experts investigating the shooting down of an iranian airliner are 
silent and nearly invisible 
their daily travels between a manama hotel and two us warships 
anchored off bahrain are quick and discreet they wear civilian 
clothes while ashore as do other us military personnel in the 
securityconscious arab countries of the persian gulf 
the sixman team arrived july 5 on a special us military 
aircraft two days after the iran air airbus a300 was shot down by 
the missile cruiser uss vincennes which mistook it for an iranian 
f14 fighter all 290 people aboard were killed 
a 15day period allowed for completion of the report is more 
than half gone but officials at us central command headquarters 
in tampa fla say it can be extended if rear adm william m 
fogarty the team leader decides more time is needed 
the investigators received an analysis of the vincennes computer 
tapes tuesday but us officials would not say what the analysis 
revealed about the performance of the billiondollar cruisers 
aegis airdefense system 
britain said wednesday its tapes of distress frequencies were 
being provided the americans were understood to have requested 
similar data from the italians who like the british had a warship 
in the area and from air traffic control in dubai the destination 
of iran air flight 655 
one us official said the team is trying to collect anything 
and everything that might help reconstruct the incident 
beginning with a skirmish between the vincennes and iranian 
speedboats less than an hour earlier 
fogarty 52 is a former battleship commander who now is 
director of plans and policy at central command the administrative 
headquarters for us military activities in the middle east and 
the gulf region 
navy spokesmen have refused to identify the others citing 
security considerations except to say one is a lawyer and the rest 
are technical experts they are seen only rarely and ignore all 
questions 
one member of the team capt john j kieley iii even refused 
at first to acknowledge two journalists he knew months ago while 
serving a tour in the gulf as skipper of the missile frigate reuben 
james 
he exchanged brief pleasantries with the two a day later but 
said nothing about the investigation he now is a pentagon staff 
officer 
navy spokesmen will say only that the investigation is 
continuing 
the teams first action was to take depositions from capt will 
c rogers iii commander of the vincennes and other officers of 
the three us warships that were in the area when the iranian 
plane was shot down 
one us military official said the actions of ships officers 
at the scene might be easily explained and the mystery of the 
destruction of iran air flight 655 probably lies mainly in the 
technical data including the black box fight recorder iran 
says it has not been found 
us officials in washington said the combat information center 
on the vincennes received a confusing mixture of identification 
signals on both military and civilian channels indicating the 
airbus was an iranian f14 fighter 
they say rogers fired his missiles at virtually the last 
possible moment after failing repeatedly to establish radio 
contact with the aircraft on both military and civilian frequencies 
most of the investigation has been conducted on the navys gulf 
flagship the coronado and on the vincennes the 9600ton missile 
cruiser has been anchored off bahrain for a week barely visible 
from shore in the haze 
an american who visited the vincennes last week said nobody 
talks about the airbus at least when outsiders are aboard 
the other two ships in the area at the time the frigate elmer 
montgomery and the missile frigate john h sides were in port in 
manama for the first few days of the investigation but have 
returned to duty 
both ships are said to have evidence indicating the jetliner was 
at about 12000 feet and possibly climbing rather than descending 
from 9000 to 7800 feet as the vincennes believed 
officials refused to say wednesday whether there had been 
contact between the united states and iran in connection with the 
investigation if that was deemed appropriate it would be done 
through appropriate channels a central command spokesman said

a 40ton rocket carrying a research 
satellite plunged into the sea minutes after takeoff wednesday 
scientists said it was indias second launch failure in 15 months 
the rockets firststage motor apparently malfuctioned shortly 
after the rocket the augmented satellite launch vehicle aslv 
blasted off at 228 pm from sriharikota island 1100 miles 
southeast of new delhi according to a scientist at the launch site 
the scientist who spoke on condition of anomymity said contact 
with the rocket was lost 1 minute and 15 seconds after takeoff the 
united news of india news agency said the rocket crashed into the 
indian ocean 4 minutes and 10 seconds after the launch 
the chairman of the indian space research organization in new 
delhi ur rao was quoted as saying the exact cause of the launch 
failure had not been determined 
it was the second failed indian space mission since another 
rocket from the same aslv series plunged into the bay of bengal in 
march 1987 when its firststage motor failed to ignite minutes 
after launching 
the scientist at the launch site said the firststage motor in 
wednesdays launch ignited but something went wrong after that 
the rocket carried a 330pound satellite designed to take 
threedimensional photographs of earth and conduct experiments on 
the origins of gamma rays the satellite was to enter an orbit 240 
miles above earth scientists said 
the failure of the mission comes amid reports that india could 
develop the aslv rocket as a launch vehicle for nuclear weapons 
according to anthony h cordesman a us military analyst the 
rocket with the addition of a heat shield and a guidance system 
could deploy intermediaterange ballistic missiles or irbm 
the indians themselves have estimated that they could have an 
operational nucleararmed irbm by 1989 cordesman said in a 
published report 
india exploded an atomic device in 1974 but the government says 
its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes 
india last successfully launched a satellite on april 17 1983 
since 1980 it has launched two other satellites while three 
other missions failed including the first aslv launch 
six indianmade satellites have been sent into orbit by space 
agencies in the soviet union united states and europe 
on tuesday the soviet union successfully launched the second of 
two space probes to explore mars and help prepare for a manned 
flight to the red planet

mcdonalds is opening restaurants in 
hospitals in what one doctor suggests is an invitation to a big mac 
heart attack but a hospital spokesman argues the food hasnt 
killed anyone yet 
the fast food chain has opened eight such restaurants 
nationwide one more is under construction at dayton childrens 
hospital in ohio and four are under contract said steven roth 
mcdonalds manager of hospital development 
dr michael goldblatt mcdonalds staff nutritionist said the 
restaurants supplement hospitals regular food services and are 
aimed at staff and visitors not patients 
yeah the sodium is high in some of the food but they also 
have salads and saltfree french fries its not going to kill you 
it hasnt killed anyone yet said john head spokesman at denver 
general hospital where a mcdonalds opened last month 
mcdonalds spokesman john onoda said the hospital restaurants 
are no different than the chains setups in museums airports and 
train stations burger king and wendys also have opened 
restaurants in hospitals 
mcdonalds will open up where people go where people are 
he said monday in an interview at the chains headquarters in oak 
brook a chicago suburb 
the whole idea is ridiculous said dr sidney wolfe of the 
public citizen health research group a washingtonbased consumer 
advocacy group 
what better way to create new patients than to sell food which 
significantly increases the risk of coronary artery disease and 
heart attacks he wrote in a group newsletter in an article 
headlined big mac heart attack 
it is not unlike in my view the idea of hospitals selling 
cigarettes wolfe said monday 
the american hospital association and the american medical 
association declined comment a spokesman for american heart 
association took issue with the practice 
we feel hospitals should provide leadership in health care 
said spokesman howard lewis theyre not giving the leadership 
with this move to mcdonalds because of the image of mcdonalds 
and other fast food companies the image of food that is high in 
cholesterol high in fat and high in salt which are three areas 
were very concerned about 
the heart associations guidelines urge people to limit intake 
of fats especially saturated fats sodium and cholesterol 
in announcing those guidelines in 1986 dr w virgil brown a 
former chairman of the committee that drafted them said 
hamburgers are far and away the no 1 cholesterol problem in the 
country 
as far as quality goes mcdonalds uses the finestquality 
ingredients goldblatt said our food is really no different 
than the kind of food you consume at home 
our hamburgers contain no more than 225 percent fat the 
restaurants offer food from the four food groups even with the 
addition of salads he said its possible to get a very light 
nutritious meal as well 
wendys international inc opened a restaurant in 1985 at the 
miami valley hospital in dayton ohio said spokeswoman sue willis 
burger king corp last summer opened restaurants at jewish 
hospital in louisville ky and harris county hospital in fort 
worth texas said a spokesman tim hermeling 
the field of nontraditional sites like hospitals is 
something burger king is very interested in he said 
for hospitals sagging revenue from regular inhouse restaurants 
led some to turn to big macs other said they needed a food carrier 
that could handle high volume quickly and efficiently 
onoda would not discuss revenues from the restaurants except to 
say they are doing very well denver general said it expects 
the restaurant to bring the hospital 150000 a year in rent and a 
percentage of the receipts 
in minneapolis john najarian a nationally known transplant 
physician surprised some nutritionists by opening a fastfood 
restaurant tuesday featuring fried foods that have been linked to 
heart disease 
it wouldnt be like backing a cigarette company or something 
like that said najarian today the important thing is to get 
away from beef and red meat so what we stress as physicians is 
chicken and fish its a heck of a lot better than burger king 
or wendys

a previously unknown group linked with 
palestinians said wednesday it was behind the terrorist raid on a 
greek cruise ship at the same time the plo strongly condemned the 
attack 
a statement signed the organization of the martyrs of the 
popular revolution in palestine claimed responsibility for 
mondays attack on the city of poros cruise ship in a separate 
statement the group said it also blew up a car in port hours 
before the ship attack 
the statements delivered to a western news agency in west 
beirut were typewritten in arabic on paper that carried no 
letterhead unlike the usual communiques from palestinian groups 
there was no way to authenticate the claims 
meanwhile in baghdad iraq bassam abu sharif spokesman for 
plo chief yasser arafat declared 
the palestine liberation organization and the palestinian 
people being themselves victims of stateorganized terrorism 
strongly condemn this criminal attack on the greek ship and the car 
bombing 
greece is a country known for its friendly attitudes toward 
the palestinian cause and we cannot but condemn such attacks he 
added 
one statement signed by the organization of the martyrs of the 
popular revolution in palestine said the attack on the ship in 
which nine people died was carried out in retaliation for the 
escalation in the operations of murder and extermination by the 
murderous zionistamerican gangs in palestine lebanon the gulf

the government today ordered an immediate 
trial for a palestinian wanted in the united states whose detention 
may have provoked a cruise ship massacre 
mohammed rashid 34 was taken from korydallos prison to the 
athens misdemeanors court for trial on charges of entering greece 
on a forged passport he is wanted in the united states for 
allegedly planting a bomb on a pan am jetliner in 1982 that killed 
one person and injured 15 
justice minister agamemnon koutsogiorgas overruled a decision 
for a twoweek postponement of the hearing but the court ordered 
the hearing postponed until thursday because the defense lawyer and 
the interpreter were unavailable 
rashid told reporters he wasnt involved in the pan am bombing 
the americans can say what they like i had nothing to do with 
it im a palestinian fighter but the palestinians are only 
fighting inside the occupied territories not everywhere he said 
in court before the delay was announced 
the palestinian surrounded by police officers armed with 
automatic weapons claimed the cruise ship attack was an american 
operationto distract attention from the shooting down of the 
iranian plane and the palestinian uprising 
they also want to provide trouble for greece he said before 
being returned to jail 
greek authorities say they believe the terrorists who attacked 
the city of poros cruise ship on monday may have intended to hijack 
the vessel and force rashids release 
a coroner said today nine people died when terrorists opened 
fire with automatic weapons and exploded hand grenades on the greek 
ship ninetyeight people were injured 
government spokesman telemachos hytiris said greece intends to 
go ahead immediately with the procedures for the rashid trial 
regardless of the strike the hearing was initially postponed 
because of a strike by prison guards 
hytiris said rashid would have to serve his greek sentence 
before he can be extradited to the united states rashid 34 was 
arrested june 1 at athens airport after a tip from the us embassy 
security sources said the ship attack may have been a bungled 
attempt by proiranian arabs to hijack the city of poros which was 
carrying 471 tourists on a oneday cruise through the greek islands 
iran denied involvement in the attack in which the terrorists 
opened fire with automatic weapons and hurled grenades starting a 
fire that brought the ships sun deck crashing down on passengers 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack 
this morning radio franceinter in paris reported an anonymous 
caller said in a rambling conversation that the proiranian group 
islamic jihad carried out the attack to avenge the us downing of 
an iranian passenger plane 
radio franceinter said the man spoke french with a lebanese 
accent and said he was calling from cairo the claim could not be 
authenticated the radio said islamic jihad a shiite moslem group 
that holds foreign hostages in lebanon previously has 
authenticated its statements with a photograph of a hostage 
also today a previously unknown group the organization of the 
martyrs of the popular revolution in palestine said it was behind 
the ship attack the claim which could not be authenticated was 
made in a statement delivered to a news agency in beirut at the 
same time the palestine liberation organization issued a statement 
condemning the attack on the ship 
public order minister anastasios sehiotis on tuesday released 
photographs of three men and a woman he said were involved in the 
attack he linked the group with an explosion that killed two men 
in a car near the liners home dock about six hours before the ship 
attack 
police speculated that automatic weapons grenades and 
explosives found in the car were intended for hijacking the cruise 
ship 
we think they the terrorists found out about the car 
explosion and decided to shoot up the ship said a harbor officer 
sehiotis said two lebanese men were being sought by police in 
connection with the car explosion he identified them as hamoud 
abdul hamid 36 the man who rented the car and mohammed zozad 
21 recognized by survivors as one of the terrorists aboard the 
ship 
coroner manolis nonas said nine people died in the attack on the 
ship earlier reports said up to 11 people were killed nonas said 
only three had been identified they were antonis demaizis the 
ships first mate klaus johan grabas 33 a danish tourist and 
irene kack 55 a swedish tourist 
greek staterun tv and radio said an american identified 
phonetically as either carl johns or charles dome was killed but 
the us embassy said it was unaware of any such person 
the merchant marine ministry said 98 people were wounded 
a health ministry official said 18 foreigners were still in 
athens hospitals he said they were 12 french citizens two swedes 
two danes one described as scandinavian and a 5yearold egyptian 
girl 
several injured french tourists were flown to france for 
treatment 
initial police reports based on fragmentary witness accounts 
said the terrorists escaped in a waiting speedboat 
but the harbor officer and several survivors said the terrorists 
jumped off the burning ship into the sea and were picked up by 
rescue boats that rushed to the scene 
some survivors said the commando team consisted of two men and 
two women others said there were two men and one woman 
the senior harbor officer said authorities believe there were 
two women one with a moroccan passport and the other with a french 
passport

paul brountas confidant and adviser to 
democratic nomineetobe michael dukakis likes to tell a story 
about his three brothers all of them onetime mayors of bangor 
maine 
the local newspaper once photographed the three mayors brountas 
and ran this caption beneath they also have a brother paul 
paul p brountas has gained a little stature of his own since 
then 
the prominent boston lawyer led dukakis search for a vice 
presidential running mate and dukakis thanked him publicly on 
tuesday and recalled their days in law school with paul sarbanes 
now a us senator from maryland 
little could the greek troika in the class of 1960 at harvard 
law school possibly imagine that dukakis would be the democratic 
nominee for president sarbanes would be a democrat from maryland 
in the us senate and our counselor and adviser and friend would 
not only be the chairman of our cmapaign committee but the person 
who managed this wonderful process which has brought us lloyd 
bentsen dukakis told a news conference in boston 
brountas 56 is confidant and gray eminence aboard dukakis 
campaign plane and many believe the most likely candidate for 
attorney general or white house counselor should dukakis win in 
november 
i really havent allowed myself to think about it brountas 
says of that talk theres a lot of attraction to it but theres 
also a lot of attraction to what i have been doing 
i havent even thought about it thats the most dangerous 
thing you can do 
it was brountas who conducted final interviews with jesse 
jackson and other potential vice presidential candidates and 
presented background findings to dukakis in a latenight meeting 
monday at dukakis home brountas recommended the selection of 
bentsen and dukakis agreed 
brountas 56 a partner in the large and successful law firm of 
hale and dorr is like dukakis in many ways not the least of which 
is his careful closetothevest demeanor 
like the massachusetts governor brountas is the son of greek 
immigrants he grew up in bangor maine where his father ran a 
small restaurant he graduated from bowdoin college and attended 
oxford as a marshall scholar before entering harvard 
i was kind of a hick from maine brountas said i hadnt 
been out of the state much 
but brountas has pursued politics in his own quiet and 
successful way 
comfortable in his law practice brountas watched the chaotic 
1968 democratic national convention that nominated hubert humphrey 
for president and maine sen edmund muskie as vice president on a 
whim brountas wrote a letter to muskie volunteering his help 
i did something fairly impulsive for me and said if nobody 
else is going to help i would brountas recalled in a recent 
interview i never expected to hear from him 
but he did muskie invited him on a campaign trip and soon he 
was a senior adviser to the vice presidential nominee four years 
later he was an adviser for muskies illfated presidential 
campaign 
brountas has been involved in all of dukakis major campaigns 
usually as chairman including the 1978 democratic primary when 
dukakis lost to ed king a setback that brountas says helped 
dukakis in the longrun by teaching him to listen 
the two became friends at harvard after graduating and taking 
their bar exams the two loaded up brountas volkswagen karmann 
ghia and headed to los angeles where john f kennedy was nominated 
for the presidency 
we were fairly straight guys but we would look for the 
attractive young ladies to have drinks with brountas said 
they stopped in las vegas where they slept in a park and 
dukakis reluctantly played the slot machines he won a 30 jackpot 
on his first try then quit they went to san francisco and mexico 
as well 
we talked a lot about what we were going to do brountas 
recalled i was going to go to maine and run for governor 
but brountas plans changed he found he liked practicing law 
and it occurred to him that predominantly republican maine might 
not elect him 
i thought i can get involved at a different level he said 
in boston brountas developed a practice specializing in the 
emerging hightechnology and computer companies that have led the 
regions economic boom he provides business as well as legal 
advice sometimes representing companies and sometimes the venture 
capitalists and has guided them through rapid growth mergers 
acquisitions and the sometimes hugely profitable initial public 
stock offerings 
its very satisfying because you grow with the companies 
brountas said 
he has also been an important link for dukakis to business 
leaders in the state 
brountas is fond of saying he has quit practicing law now that 
his time is fully occupied by dukakis presidential bid 
it was brountas who quided the selection of susan estrich as 
campaign manager when dukakis trusted aide john sasso was forced 
to resign in controversy over the seeming sabatoge of rival joseph 
bidens campaign

a federal task force will study why such a low 
percentage of women hold jobs in the construction and aerospace 
industries us labor secretary ann mclaughlin said wednesday 
the problems women may have in securing jobs traditionally 
held by men is an issue of great interest to me ms mclaughlin 
said at a news conference 
the task force is to begin its review by the end of the month 
and complete it within a few months she said the panel will 
determine female representation in the two industries and whether 
there are overt or subtle pressures against hiring or promoting 
women ms mclaughlin said 
women filled about 12 percent of construction jobs in 1980 
according to census figures that year when government and industry 
set goals to increase the proportion to 69 percent over the next 
few years said labor department aide jerry blakemore so far he 
said womens representation in contruction jobs has improved only 
to about 2 percent 
the female proportion of aerospace workers has been higher 
about 19 percent to 26 percent he said but labor officials 
consider it still too low 
according to ms mclaughlin if we find there are problems we 
will enforce the prohibition against sex discrimination by 
government contractors and the requirements that they take 
affirmative action 
in addition we will see whether we can improve the labor 
departments compliance and review procedures and we will develop 
recommendations on how to increase opportunities for women in these 
nontraditional jobs she said 
ms mclaughlin was in chicago to attend a briefing with business 
and government leaders concerned about affordable child care for 
working mothers 
serving on the task force will be representatives of the 
solicitors office of the labor department the office of federal 
contract compliance which administers federal antidiscrimination 
guidelines for government contractors and the federal bureau of 
apprenticeship and training ms mclaughlin said

the prime minister of kuwait said wednesday 
that secretary of state george p shultz will make a fifth trip to 
the middle east this year to push his plan for arabisraeli 
negotiations 
sheik saad alabdullah alsabah wished shultz well and joined 
egyptian president hosni mubarak as the only arab leaders to openly 
endorse the plan 
however the prime minister called also for establishment of a 
palestinian state and for participation of the palestine liberation 
organization in the negotiations 
sheik saad who is also crown prince of the persian gulf 
country said the continued uprising of palestinian arabs on 
the israeliheld west bank and in gaza was a strong exhibition of 
the determination of the palestinians to regain their freedom 
about 200 palestinians and four israelis have been killed in 
clashes since last december 
shultzs plan does not call for a palestinian state nor for plo 
participation in the talks unless it recognizes israels right to 
exist and disavows terrorism 
he has made four trips to the middle east this year to try to 
promote negotiations between israel and a mixed delegation of 
jordanians and palestinians and run into resistance from israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir king hussein of jordan and the plo 
shamir refused to participate in a peace conference held partly 
under soviet auspices hussein wanted a guarantee that israel would 
relinquish the west bank and gaza and the plo barred palestinians 
from meeting with shultz 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said she knew of 
no plans for shultz to return to the region and yet she 
recalled the secretary has always said that he would be available 
to return to the middle east if it would be useful in pursuit of 
the peace initiative 
sheik saad on a weeklong visit here met on tuesday with 
president reagan and on monday with defense secretary frank c 
carlucci and deputy secretary of state john c whitehead 
shultz is o a trip to the far east he plans to go to central 
america and south america in early august attend the republican 
national convention in midmonth and take a vacation before labor 
day he would then have until january to try to his hand at 
shuttle diplomacy again 
sheik saad in a speech and a press conference renewed kuwaits 
request for us airtoground maverick missiles as part of a 18 
billion arms purchase from the united states that would include 40 
f18 jet fighter planes 
the senate has voted to block the mavericks viewing them as a 
potential threat to israels security sheik saad said kuwait was 
a peaceloving country and wanted the arms for selfdefense 
it doesnt mean we intend to invade any other country the 
arab leader said 
over the weekend kuwait annouced an arms deal with the soviet 
union so sheik saad said dont be surprised when you read 
tomorrow or next week or next month that kuwait also has bought 
military equipment from moscow or britain or france 
he scheduled meetings with members of the senate foreign 
relations committee to try to reverse the opposition to the 
mavericks

vice president george bush promising to 
defend the honor of the united states will present the us 
case when the un security council meets thursday to debate the 
american destruction of an iranian airliner carrying 290 people 
the white house said wednesday that president reagans selection 
of bush reflects the importance of the issues at stake 
it also guarantees a highprofile platform for bush who is 
certain to be the republican presidential nominee at a time when 
the democrats are preparing to install michael dukakis as their 
presidential candidate 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater insisted that political 
factors were not involved in the choice of bush 
iran which has boycotted the security council since the 
iraniraq war began in 1980 is coming back to the world 
organization to seek a resolution that would condemn or at least 
deplore the downing of the iranian civilian airliner over the 
persian gulf by the us cruiser vincennes 
the vice president at a political appearance before a farm 
group said i cant wait to get up there to defend the policy of 
the united states government 
bush was us ambassador to the united nations from 1971 to 
1973 and this is believed to be his first un speech since then 
un officials said that no us vice president had addressed the 
council in recent memory 
previewing his remarks bush said its the free worlds case 
and the efforts to secondguess the captain of that ship will be 
rebuffed and what im going to say is a matter that concerns all 
americans whatever line of work you engage in 
the honor of the united states bush continued to see 
this secondguessing going on to suggest that the united states 
was wrong that this captain was wrong his ship under fire seven 
warnings and him trying to protect the lives of these american 
kids 
the us ship under attack by iranian speedboats at the time 
claimed it mistook the airliner for an iranian f14 fighter 
discussing bushs role white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said the vice president will demonstrate to the security council 
and the world the us concern on this matter the seriousness with 
which we take it and our dedication to steps to try to end the 
iraniraq war 
that is our motivation 
denying any political motivation in bushs assignment fitzwater 
said lets deal with the real question here the issue is that 
we believe that this is a matter of the highest importance to the 
united states and to the world 
that is our motivation in the sense that the vice president 
can make these points forcefully and dramatically he said the 
vice president does not normally appear before the united nations 
security council and in this way we can again highlight our 
previously stated position 
iranian foreign minister aliakbar velayati will be the first 
speaker before the security council and bush is expected to be the 
second 
diplomatic observers at the un said bushs appearance would be 
a major political gesture of goodwill and sincerity they said his 
presence and his statements also could signal to iran that the 
united states is receptive to a dialogue between the two 
governments which have no diplomatic ties 
the council meeting originally set for tuesday was postponed 
until thursday because iran was unable to get a majority on the 
15member council to condemn the united states and demand its 
withdrawal from the persian gulf 
but diplomatic sources also said the us announcement of 
compensation and its expression of regret had preempted iran 
which had sought to use the forum to denounce the united states 
the united states was expected to veto any resolution condemning 
the us navy in the persian gulf

the number of officers investigating the case of 
the green river killer who is blamed for the deaths of up to 48 
women will be reduced if no new developments arise within the next 
year an official said wednesday 
king county executive tim hill said the 19 officers on the green 
river task force will remain at least until the current fiscal year 
ends in june 1989 
there is not going to be a reduction this year hill said 
the serial killer is officially blamed for the deaths of as many 
as 48 young women many of them prostitutes between the summer of 
1982 and early 1984 four victims were found in oregon but the 
killer has operated primarily in the puget sound area 
forty are known dead and the task force had blamed the killer 
for the disappearances of eight missing women 
sheriff james montgomery said 13 million has been spent since 
the task force was formed after the first bodies were found the 
budget for the current fiscal year for the officers and four staff 
members is about 1 million 
the force at one time numbered nearly 60 
montgomery also said police are investigating similarities 
between the green river deaths and a case in san diego calif in 
which 32 young women have been killed those killings started 
shortly after the seattlearea slayings ended in early 1984 
in a june 30 memo to hill montgomery said the timing of the 
killings in the two cases was very significant and called the 
slayings in the two states almost a mirror image of each other 
he told reporters wednesday there also were many differences 
hill and montgomery said the king county task force would 
cooperate fully with san diego authorities

the designated democratic ticket of michael 
dukakis and lloyd bentsen got a cool reception today from the 
naacp many of whose members had hoped the vicepresidential 
nomination would go to jesse jackson 
there was only scattered applause from delegates to the annual 
convention of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people when the massachusetts governor and the texas 
senator entered the crowded ballroom 
it was in marked contrast to the rousing scene tuesday night 
when jackson addressed the same group 
in fact the first burst of enthusiasm from the audience came as 
naacp executive director benjamin hooks who introduced dukakis 
turned to the governor and said you know knowing jesse has been 
good for you 
the audience applauded and dukakis smiled 
in his speech dukakis promised that as president his door is 
going to be open 
then he went on ive learned a lot from jesse and ive 
learned a lot from you 
bentsen followed dukakis to the podium and said there can be 
no question where a dukakisbentsen administration would stand on 
the important civil rights issues of the day 
mike dukakis and i are committed to making a difference for 
america bentsen said 
some delegates booed when dukakis turned the microphone over to 
bentsen and hooks jumped in to ask the delegates for a warmer 
welcome once again the loudest applause came when hooks referred 
to jackson hooks looked at bentsen and said he had a tough act 
to follow many of our delegates a you know wanted to see 
jesse in this position 
at that point delegates stood and cheered and applauded 
i sympathize with you said hooks 
before dukakis entered the room hooks told delegates to tear up 
handlettered signs many were carrying that read jesse is 
qualified and whats wrong with jesse 
those of you who brought those signs tear them up and act 
your age said hooks 
the signs reflected disappointment that dukakis had passed over 
jackson in his search for a running mate several delegates 
expressed disgruntlement less over the fact jackson wasnt chosen 
as over the fact dukakis did not notify him in advance of te 
selection of bentsen 
jackson first learned of the selection of bentsen from reporters 
when he flew in to washingtons national airport 
at a news conference this afternoon dukakis explained that he 
had tried to reach jackson by telephone to tell him of bentsens 
selection but couldnt reach him at first when he did reach 
jackson dukakis said he told jackson he was sorry to have missed 
him on the first call 
in any case dukakis said i made my choice and im very happy 
with that choice and i think most democrats across the country 
are 
as for jackson dukakis said i want jesse jackson to be 
deeply involved in this campaign as a party leader 
while the response at the naacp convention was tepid dukakis 
and bentsen got a somewhat better welcome today before the 
congressional black caucus and a rousing reception at a separate 
session of house democrats 
he sent one single message said rep ron wyden dore he 
wants to work with us and reach out to us thats what the congress 
wants to hear 
among those greeting the two men as they arrived for a private 
meeting with house democrats was rep bill gray dpa the budget 
commitee chairman and a senior leader among black house members 
gray said he had been disappointed that jackson was not the choice 
for no 2 
but its been made and i plan to support the ticket gray 
said 
gray said the two men will have to begin talking about issues of 
concern to blacks if they want to unite minority voters behind the 
campaign we are going to be concerned about longterm policy 
civil rights human investment he said 
dukakis and bentsen also met for about 45 minutes with members 
of the congressional black caucus it went well bentsen said 
as he emerged and the comments of black house members generally 
reflected that assessment 
lots of fences have been mended said caucus chairman rep 
mervyn dymally dcalif we had a very fruitful discussion about 
the convention the campaign and the presidency 
its a strong ticket its a winning ticket said rep john 
lewis dga adding it was very friendly in the room 
members said they still planned to remain committed to jackson 
on the first ballot at next weeks convention in atlanta 
another member of the caucus said he believed the ticket has its 
work cut out to try to repair damage 
i frankly think hes made life a lot more difficult for 
himself and will have to work a lot harder rep ron dellums 
dcalif said of dukakis 
asked at a news conference tuesday if he were angry at being 
passed over jackson replied no im too controlled im too 
clear im too mature to be angry im focused on what we must do 
to keep hope alive 
jackson who spokeby availability of workforce unionization 
workers compensation insurance levels and productivity 
education finishing in the no 15 spot was the highestranked 
among the socalled qualityoflife factors cost of living 
health care and transportation occupied the bottom three places on 
the manufacturers lists 
this is a costoriented study make no mistake about it 
said selwyn price the grant thornton partner in charge of the 
study obviously to compete in a global environment costs have 
to be contained 
the competition is no longer between new hampshire and south 
dakota its between new hampshire and taiwan and south dakota and 
taiwan he added 
states where total employment in manufacturing exceeded the 
national average of 17 percent or where manufacturing shipments 
exceeded the national average in dollar terms were considered 
intensive 
ranked behind new hampshire among the 27 larger or 
manufacturingintensive states were missouri north carolina 
delaware and florida 
heading the list of 21 states with a lighter concentration of 
manufacturing was south dakota followed by north dakota nebraska 
nevada and kansas 
new hampshires strong showing was built on a blend of economic 
and social qualities the manufacturers found attractive 
its state and local fiscal policies were topranked because new 
hampshire has no sales or state income tax low unemployment 
insurance and workers compensation costs and offers generous 
incentive packages to manufacturers 
but states like north dakota and north carolina despite 
consistently good rankings during much of the time grant thornton 
has conducted the study have not become manufacturing giants to 
challenge traditional powers california ranked 19th this year 
new york 17 pennsylvania 21 and michigan 26 
if we look at the movement of manufacturing in this country 
we certainly see some leaving the highcost states like michigan 
and heading somewhat for the southern nonunion states said 
professor gary eppen of the university of chicagos graduate school 
of business 
you dont see an explosion of manufacturing in the dakotas 
for instance because most of growth in the economy has not been in 
manufacturing he added 
and even that growth which has occurred tends to be more 
hightech in which unionization and wages dont play as big a 
role plus people obviously arent giving the same weight in 
making actual decisions than they are in answering 
questionnaires he continued 
while welcoming the survey new hampshire gov john sununu 
complained that his state would have finished even further in front 
had the studys educational component been weighted to reflect 
performance rather than spending 
sometimes it mystifies me what they give credit for said 
sununu 
south dakotas no 1 rating among lessintensive manufacturing 
states followed from its ranking as lowest among the 48 states in 
terms of overall labor costs 
according to the study south dakota is the least unionized 
state in the nation with only 31 percent of its workers belonging 
to unions compared with a national average of almost 20 percent 
in other categories 
north carolina ranked first in terms of stateregulated 
employment costs 
kansas ranked first in terms of availability and productivity 
of resources 
north dakota ranked first in terms of quality of life concerns 
alaska and hawaii were not included in the survey because it 
would be difficult to compare them with other states due to their 
substantially different economies grant thornton stated

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told 
congress wednesday that the central bank stands ready to push 
interest rates higher to stem inflation 
and the risks of a new wageprice spiral are sufficiently 
great that the fed should err on the side of squeezing credit 
rather than stimulating the economy he said 
greenspan delivering his midyear report on monetary policy 
noted that the fed already has made a series of small 
credittightening steps from late march through late june allowing 
short term interest rates to rise 
nevertheless inflationary pressures including tight labor 
markets high factory operating rates and droughtcaused increases 
in grain prices remain and must be curbed now rather than later 
he said 
as the experience of the last two decades has clearly shown 
accelerating wages and prices would have to be countered later by 
quite restrictive policies with unavoidably adverse implications 
for production and employment greenspan told the senate banking 
committee he referred to the doubledigit inflation that led to 
the 198182 recession 
when greenspan last reported to congress in february the 
situation was quite different many analysts were still worried 
that the shock of the october stock market crash would tumble the 
country into a recession in late january the central bank had 
pushed shortterm interest rates down a notch to stimulate economic 
activity 
however greenspan said the economy proved remarkable 
resilient and now the longrun costs of a return to higher 
inflation and the risks of this occurring under current 
circumstances are sufficiently great that federal reserve policy at 
this juncture might be well advised to err more on the side of 
restrictiveness rather than of stimulus 
he said a leveling in the unemployment rate which hit a 14year 
low of 53 percent last month and in factory operating rates 
which are at eightyear highs is essential if more intense 
inflationary pressures are to be avoided in the period ahead 
the committee briefly interrupted greenspans testimony to 
recommend by unanimous voice vote that the full senate confirm 
boston banker john p lawares appointment to a vacant seat on the 
sevenmember federal reserve board 
on another subject greenspan said the federal reserve and other 
central banks would continue to work for stable international 
exchange rates he said he saw no evidence the growth of us 
exports has been affected by the appreciation of the dollar from 
threeyear lows at the end of last year 
credit markets rallied briefly in response to the testimony 
with bond prices edging up and interest rates falling slightly 
greenspans antiinflation message which analysts found a bit 
tougher than expected spurred sens james sasser dten and phil 
gramm rtexas to plead with the central bank chairman not to 
overreact 
i would come down on the side of avoiding a recession almost 
at all costs sasser said i do hope the fed would not be 
hypersensitive to signs real or imagined of inflation 
david wyss chief financial economist of data resources inc a 
forecasting firm in lexington mass said i think greenspans 
attitude can best be expressed by saying i dont think we need a 
recession but were not going to fight so hard against a recession 
that we risk inflation in other words well take a little 
recession in order to avoid inflation 
despite greenspans relatively tough rhetoric wyss said the 
federal reserve would keep its head low during the election 
campaign and will avoid its strongest tightening move an 
increase in the discount rate it charges on the money it loans to 
member banks 
the central bank has nudged the federal funds rate the amount 
banks charge each other for overnight loans up by about a 
percentage point so far this year to 75 percent but it has not 
raised the discount rate since september when it was set at 6 
percent 
greenspan acknowledged that the spread between the two rates has 
widened but said it is the judgment of fed policymakers to date 
that current relationships are satisfactory 
in the midyear report greenspan said the fed was boosting 
slightly its forecast for economic growth this year he said it was 
looking for the gross national product to expand at an annual rate 
of between 275 percent to 3 percent in february the fed had a 
lower gnp growth forecast of between 2 percent and 25 percent 
greenspan also warned that it is essential that congress make 
more progress in reducing the huge federal budget deficits he said 
such a cut would be the single most important thing government 
could do to reduce the countrys huge foreign borrowing needs he 
urged congress to aim ultimately for budget surpluses sometime in 
the 1990s

for 5 months young people who want a 
motorcycle license in florida will be able to get one without 
training thanks to a glitch in a new law meant to toughen 
instruction requirements 
i guess if i were a young rider id try to get my license 
before january said state rep everett a kelly who helped 
draft the law 
on jan 1 every motorcyclist 21 or younger will have to enroll 
in at least six hours of oncycle training and six hours of 
classroom training to get a license 
since october a fourhour training course had been required 
but when the new law took effect friday it repealed last years 
law without making any provision for the interim 
we spent hours and hours drafting this legislation and 
apparently it got by our attorneys our staff people and everyone 
else said kelly sometimes these things get through 
motorcyclists still must pass the written driving and eye exams

blacks and whites on many 
commuter trains rode together wednesday for the first time and a 
parliament member urged the government to extend integration to 
buses and intercity trains 
the whites only signs on firstclass train coaches started 
coming down tuesday in the johannesburg and durban metropolitan 
areas but many riders did not learn of the change until wednesday 
commuter trains in the cape town area were desegregated last 
month 
from now on segregation will be based only on economic 
principles said jc van der merwe railroad manager in 
transvaal province for the staterun south african transport 
services 
some blacks who rode the newly integrated firstclass cars 
wednesday reported some unfriendly looks from white passengers but 
there were no reports of serious incidents 
one white woman who spoke on condition of anonymity said a 
black man sat beside her during her morning ride into johannesburg 
and asked if she would be back on the train the next day when she 
replied affirmatively the man inquired are you going to learn 
xhosa 
xhosa is one of the four main african languages in south africa 
the transport service began integrating restrooms waiting 
areas railroad cafeterias and other amenities at train stations in 
1985 most coaches continued to be segregated according to race 
although a few firstclass trains were declared open to all 
firstclass tickets cost about twice as much as thirdclass 
tickets there is no secondclass service 
ebrahim abramjee a member of the asian chamber of parliament 
praised the integration of commuter trains but condemned 
authorities for maintaining segregation on longdistance train 
routes and on buses in several major cities 
he said whites only benches at bus stops in pretoria were 
also an embarrassment 
nothing can change overnight we still have partial 
segregation on the intercity trains but it is being looked at 
we have to see what is practical said leon els a spokesman for 
transport minister eli louw referring to continued segregation on 
the 120 intercity trains 
els said one of the factors that has prevented integration of 
intercity trains is the fact that they are overnight trains and 
people sleep in the compartments people would be sleeping in a 
compartment together 
an exception is the luxury longdistance blue train that 
travels between johannesburg and cape town which is designated as 
an international service and has always been desegregated

an increase in the suns activity early in the 
1990s will thin out the 7000 pieces of manmade space junk orbiting 
near earth a congressional subcommittee was told wednesday 
but there was a warning too that nations with space programs 
had better clean up their act 
nicholas l johnson an expert in space debris said the 
socalled solar maximum will present a unique opportunity to 
affect noticeably the safety of future space travelers because 
it will substantially cleanse the environment below 400 miles 
altitude 
the solar maximum a phenomenon that last occurred in 1980 is 
expected to be above average in intensity when it peaks in 1990 
its effect is to heat the atmosphere and cause it to expand 
causing a wider area of debris to plunge toward earth and burn up 
during the mid1990s two great space stations one built by 
nasa and its international partners and one constructed by the 
soviet union will be deployed at altitudes near 300 miles said 
johnson an advisory scientist with teledyne brown engineering in 
colorado 
actions taken by the us space industry and government and by 
other foreign space users can ensure that we do not unnecessarily 
repopulate the region of nearearth space below 500 miles 
johnson and others testified before the house space science 
subcommittee the panels chairman rep bill nelson dfla said 
we have to figure out what to do about this problem before we 
have a catastrophe 
on a table in the hearing room were samples of objects that had 
been in space and were hit by manmade debris one piece was a 
section of a space shuttle window gouged by a paint flake from a 
spent delta rocket 
johnson said debris does not pose a serious hazard to space 
operations now but might when space activities increase in the next 
decade 
the national aeronautics and space administration already is 
adding 12000 pounds of protective shielding to the proposed space 
station 
today more than 7000 objects with a diameter of 10 
centimeters 4 inches or more are known to be in orbit about our 
planet said johnson at collision velocities of 8 to 10 
kilometers per second these satellites carry explosivelike 
energy 
donald kessler a debris expert at nasas johnson space center 
in houston estimated that five times as many pieces of manmade 
junk are in orbit near the earth than can be tracked by radar 
the experts said only 5 percent of the identified objects 
spinning around earth represent operational satellites fully half 
come from satellites that exploded either deliberately or 
accidentally 
since the first known satellite breakup in june 1961 johnson 
said nearly 100 satellites have broken up in orbit with debris 
spreading out and encircling most of the globe 
onethird of the debris is spent rocket bodies and dead 
payloads he said 
the rest is operational debris objects intentionally discarded 
during satellite delivery they include such things as lens caps 
empty propellant tanks or objects thrown away or dropped outside a 
spacecraft during manned activity

the brother of contra leader adolfo calero was 
among seven men who allegedly broke us neutrality laws by sending 
mercenaries into combat in nicaragua according to an indictment 
unsealed wednesday 
one group of mercenaries tried unsuccessfully to blow up a 
bridge in sinsin nicaragua in 1985 but was forced out of the 
country said assistant us attorney mark schnapp 
the longawaited federal indictment which at one point was 
investigated by congress on charges that thenattorney general 
edwin meese iii tried to sidetrack the probe did not mention any 
reagan administration officials 
when reporters asked interim us attorney dexter lehtinen about 
claims by some defendants that former national security council 
aide oliver north and robert owen his liaison to contra 
operations approved their operations lehtinen referred all 
questions to the irancontra independent counsel 
the special prosecutors office cannot comment on current 
investigations said washington spokesman jim wiethart 
adolfo caleros brother mario calero of new orleans who has 
been active in supplying the contras is accused of helping to 
equip the mercenaries to battle the sandinistas in nicaragua 
i shall wear this as one more badge to show that i am proud to 
be a contra mario calero said wednesday when he appeared before 
a us magistrate in fort lauderdale 
his brother one of the contras five directors did not answer 
calls to his miami home wednesday 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros said mario calero was in charge 
of the largest rebel groups procurement in new orleans during the 
198485 period the indictment covers 
we were very aware of the neutrality law said matamoros 
i think all these questions will be clarified as for the 
others indicted he said only that many people in the past 
provided help 
also appearing before the magistrate wednesday was thomas posey 
head of the alabamabased civilian materiel assistance which 
allegedly hired many of the mercenaries 
his attorney called the indictment a farce its phenomenal 
that after three years this is all they could come up with 
everybody knew what these people were doing rob owen the 
national security council doug jones said 
the others indicted were maco stewart a wealthy former 
assistant state attorney general and a 19601963 state 
representative in texas jack terrell a former mercenary who 
turned against us contra policy and has cooperated with the fbi 
and the congress jose coutin a gun store owner currently at a 
halfway house on unrelated charges and a former civilian materiel 
assistance liaison alex martinez a conservative miami 
stockbroker and joe adams a former bodyguard to adolfo calero 
stewart who now lives in france was ordered released on a 5 
million personal bond and allowed to return to europe the rest 
received 25000 bonds except for adams who was to surrender 
later of the six who appeared wednesday all pleaded innocent 
except martinez and terrell who lacked permanent counsel 
the indictment accuses the seven of violating the us 
neutrality act which prohibits mounting operations against foreign 
governments from us soil adams and terrell are also accused of 
buying a manlicher boltaction 308 caliber rifle to be used as a 
sniper weapon in nicaragua they could face up to 33 years in 
prison coutin faces 13 years because he allegedly gave his 
passport to a mercenary while the rest face a maxmimum of eight 
years on the two neutrality act violations 
critics of the investigation ridiculed the indictment saying it 
caught only the small fishes 
where are the policymakers that put together this network 
said john mattes a federal public defender whose investigation of 
a clients case led to accusations that the us attorneys office 
tried to sidetrack the probe 
he said it was a joke that with all the illegal contra aid 
shipped to the contras the only weapon mentioned was a boltaction 
rifle 
this is the reward you get for bucking administration 
policy a bitter terrell said wednesday it doesnt pay to be a 
whistleblower in the united states 
the twoyear investigation was the subject of charges a year ago 
that meese attempted to delay the probe to keep the 
administrations illegal contra supply operations from being 
exposed congress investigated but issued an inconclusive report

michael dukakis mended fences with black leaders on wednesday 
and said he and his newly minted running mate lloyd bentsen 
hope and expect that jesse jackson will support the democratic 
ticket this fall 
an angry jackson broke off negotiations on the platform and 
other convention issues and aides said he was flabbergasted 
over a perceived snub in dukakis handling of his vice presidential 
selection it is now up to michael dukakis to make it a unity 
convention said ron brown jacksons convention manager 
george bushs search for a running mate was getting under way in 
earnest campaign sources said the vice president likely will make 
use of private polling to guage the votedrawing appeal of various 
potential ticket combinations and a spokeswoman said bush has no 
intentions of parading people around for auditions 
meanwhile the white house announced that bush would travel to 
the united nations on thursday to present the us explanation on 
destruction of an iranian airliner bush said he cant wait to 
argue the free worlds case before the security council 
with the democratic convention just five days off dukakis and 
bentsen made their campaign rounds in washington and at an 
afternoon news conference dukakis was peppered with questions about 
jackson 
at first he tried to make light of the issue saying i 
havent talked to michael jackson in months he went on to say 
i want jesse jackson to be deeply involved in this campaign as a 
party leader 
we want his support the massachusetts governor said we 
hope and expect he will be very much involved with us in the 
campaign and afterwards 
some black leaders urged reconciliation including the chairman 
of the congressional black caucus lots of fences have been 
mended rep mervyn dymally of california said after a closed 
door session with dukakis and bentsen 
rep bill gray dpa a senior black house member said he had 
been disappointed that jackson was not the choice for no 2 but 
its been made and i plan to support the ticket gray said 
but not all of jacksons backers were persuaded atlanta city 
councilman hosea williams a nationally known civil rights activist 
but not always an ally of jackson announced plans for a protest 
march to the convention next monday its not that they turned 
jesse jackson down its how they did it he said 
two democratic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
jackson was told privately monday afternoon that he would not be 
picked one source said dukakis emissary paul brountas told jackson 
he would bring the ticket down if nominated for vice president 
jackson didnt learn of bentsens selection until reporters 
asked him for a comment tuesday morning and the perceived snub had 
jackson and his followers still seething on wednesday 
at his news conferencein washington dukakis said he had tried 
to notify jackson by telephone of his selection of bentsen but 
failed to reach him before word leaked out when the two men 
finally spoke dukakis said i said i was sorry that i missed him 
on the first call 
bentsen said he had spoken with jackson by phone earlier in the 
day jesse jackson is a friend of mine and he is a very able 
gentleman said the texan 
but not all of jacksons supporters sounded ready for 
reconciliation 
i resented being talked to by the runt of the democratic 
political litter who did not have the courtesy to consult jackson 
to let him know prior to the time the public knew said vera 
baugh a delegate to the naacp convention where dukakis and bentsen 
spoke 
to me that was a slap in my face and i am going to write in 
jesses name i will not vote for dukakis she said jackson for 
his part had said he planned to support the ticket but would have 
his name placed in nomination for president 
dukakis sought throughout the day to soothe any hurt feelings 
with only occasional success 
he linked arms with members of the naacp and sang we shall 
overcome and told the organizations convention in washington 
that the democratic party had opened up the door of opportunity 
to a couple of guys named dukakis and jackson the top two 
candidates for the presidency 
when naacp president benjanim hooks told the democratic 
nomineeinwaiting that knowing jesse has been good for you 
the massachusetts governor replied ive learned a lot from jesse 
and ive learned a lot from you 
dukakis said bentsen had been a civil rights advocate since 
way back in the 40s but some in the audience booed when the 
texas senator took the microphone to speak 
hooks appealed for a warmer welcome then turned the jeers to 
laughter in saying i empathize with you ive been preaching 
when they wanted somebody else to preach one said we aint going 
to say amen one time they didnt 
many of our delegates as you know wanted to see jesse in 
this position he said at that mention of jacksons name the 
audience erupted in cheers and applause 
the democratic convention city was beginning to fill up with the 
advance wave of party officials and journalists construction 
continued inside the smallish omni hall where some seats afforded 
no view of the proceedings on the floor but party officials said 
all would be ready by the time the opening gavel fell next monday 
ready perhaps but not necessarily peaceful 
dukakis and bentsen received a rousing reception from house 
democrats when they met early in the day he sent one single 
message said rep ron wyden dore he wants to work with us 
and reach out to us thats what the congress wants to hear 
others were finding their disappointment harder to overcome 
jackson said nothing publicly during the day about dukakis 
choice of the 67yearold bentsen to be his vice presidential 
candidate 
but campaign aide brown spread the word that the runnerup in 
the primary campaign was incredulous that dukakis had not consulted 
him over the choice of bentsen and had not informed him before the 
word was made public 
it seems like too big a mistake that politically astute people 
would make said brown 
he said negotiations over platform disagreements have been 
suspended at least temporarily 
privately some were urging jackson not to overreact to the 
perceived snub i dont think its in jesses interest to get 
into a fight about protocol and have his constituents talking 
about no respect no respect said one influential black 
politician 
what if dukakis loses and people can point to this episode as 
one of the reasons then jesse has just kicked over his pail of 
milk

federal criminal investigators are looking 
into allegations of contract fraud at the armys main missile 
headquarters including alleged overcharges favoritism and phony 
bills a congressional agency revealed wednesday 
in one instance a 45minute job was inflated to show 23 hours 
of work and on another occasion two workers painted stripes in a 
parking lot while eight others simply watched the general 
accounting office said 
the armys criminal investigative division cid is looking at 
the allegations which involve contracts at the redstone arsenal in 
huntsville ala said david c williams of the gaos office of 
special investigations 
williams revealed the investigation by the cid and fbi along 
with other criminal investigations at the redstone facility in 
testimony before the house government operations national security 
subcommittee 
the redstone investigations are not related to the onging 
pentagon bribery investigation that investigation is focused on 
allegations that defense contractors and their consultants bribed 
pentagon officials for inside information that could have been 
vital in bidding for contracts most of them with the navy worth 
billions of dollars no charges have been filed 
williams said one of the gao investigations involved a 
fiveyear 250 million contract between the army missile command 
and the holmes and narver corp of orange calif and the 
morrisonknudsen corp of boise idaho the contract was for base 
support activities including maintenance food service and 
equipment repair 
the gao investigation was coordinated with the army cid 
williams said and it revealed evidence of a pattern of abuse by 
the contractor and its subcontractors including illegal 
activities currently being investigated by the army cid 
williams said 
in some cases time sheets were falsified to overstate hours 
including the inflated 23hour job and the parking lot paint job 
williams said idle workers often were told to hide from government 
inspectors 
building supplies were given away to workers and government 
employees in an effort to cover for inflated and falsified labor 
charges paint was thrown away and in some cases dumped into the 
tennessee river williams said 
a review of maintenance records for army vehicles focusing 
only on oil changes and lube jobs showed the army was overcharged 
by 262 percent 
in another case williams said the gradwell co of huntsville 
charged the government for wages for employees who did not show up 
these noshow employees not only did not work at redstone 
arsenal but they did not work anywhere in the state of 
alabama williams said gradwell also billed the government 
86000 for nonexistent repair parts he said 
officials at redstone or officials at gradwell holmes and 
narver and morrisonknudsen did not immediately return telephone 
calls seeking comment 
williams also said the gao looked at contract awards for small 
businesses at redstone and found criminal activity within the 
system which he said is being investigated by the army cid 
for example he said there appeared to be improprieties in the 
awarding of timeandmaterial contracts 
in 263 of the those contracts studied last year 45 of them 
showed that contractor bid proposals were within 1 percent of the 
governments cost estimates suggesting that there might have been 
unauthorized releases of government estimates or that contractors 
themselves prepared the governments cost estimates williams 
said 
he cited three examples including one 49000 job in which a 
contractor submitted a proposal only 3 off the governments 
estimate another 650000 job where a bid came in that was only 
760 off the government estimate and a 13 million bid only 323 
off the governments estimate 
williams detailed another case which said revealed apparent 
favoritism in two contract awards by army lt gen john wall 
commander of the army strategic defense command toward bdm 
international inc of mclean va 
in one case the gao said wall directed that bdm be made the 
interim contractor for a major research initiative in another 
case according to williams bdm lost out to teledyne brown 
engineering on a 500 million contract but wall ordered that 
240000 hours of support work be shifted from teledyne to bdm 
since bdm charges 15 per hour more than teledyne williams 
said this could result in an expected increase in cost of 
approximately 36 million 
wall was investigated by the army cid was reprimanded two 
months ago and retired in june williams said 
bdm officials did not immediately return telephone calls seeking 
comment on williams statement attempts to locate wall were not 
immediately successful

a special thanks to dr hooks dr gibson and the good people who 
met with me in boston last week we had a good meeting and i hope

going to be listening to each other yes ben ive learned a lot 
from jesse and ive learned a lot from you and i continue to 
learn and thats going to continue and grow stronger and stronger 
as time goes on 
may i make just a few very special introductions if i can 
first im very proud today to be with the woman who has been my 
lifes partner for over a quarter of a century i want you all to

our youth were going to be grandparents in january the babys

your help its going to be quite a january ladies and gentlemen 
the first lady of the commonwealth of massachusetts shes going 
to be a great first lady of the united states of america kitty 
dukakis im going to save the second introduction for the end of 
my speech 
in 1954 a young man from massachusetts who was then a senior at 
swarthmore college a small coeducational school as many of you 
know just outside of philadelphia came to this city as a student 
in the washington semester program at american university those 
were difficult and troubled times they were a time when this city 
was a segregated city and it was our capital city it was the fall 
of 1954 when a senator from wisconsin named joseph r mccarthy was 
being censured by the united states senate im not sure i could 
have possibly believed that fall of 1954 in this capital city of 
ours that i would be here today in front of this great 
organization that has given so much to this country and has so much 
more to give now and in the future speaking to you as a candidate 
for the presidency of the united states 
dr hooks said something which i want to repeat it would have 
been inconceivable as all of you and and all of us know in 1954 
or for that matter in 1984 that the two leading and final 
candidates for the democratic nomination for the presidency of the 
united states would be this son of greek immigrants from 
massachusetts and a black man who grew up poor in south carolina 
ladies and gentlemen it happened and it happened in the 
democratic party im proud of that im proud of that im proud 
of the fact that it was my party that has opened up the door of 
opportunity to all of our citizens and im proud of the fact that 
im here today with kitty with senator and mrs bentsen and with 
all of you 
im not sure when we met a year ago in new york city that 
evening when so many of you were good enough to stick around when 
i was late and i had just arrived im not sure i could possibly 
have imagined even then that i would be here today and im sure i 
dont have to tell any of you how seriously i take the 
responsibilities of the presidency the responsibilities of 
leadership the responsibility to be a president of all the people 
and that is what i want to talk to you about for just a few minutes 
this morning 
twentynine years ago right here in washington dc dr 
martin luther king jr concluded his remarks to a gathering of some 
26000 high school and college students with these words he said 
make a career of humanity make a career of humanity commit 
yourself to the noble struggle for equal rights and you will make 
a greater person of yourself a greater nation of your country and 
a finer world in which to live make a career of humanity thats 
what dr martin luther king said that day 
i dont know if any of you were there that day to hear him 
speak but i do know that im proud to be here this morning because 
the naacp has made a career of humanity has made a career of 
humanity from roy wilkins courageous fight for antilynching laws 
in the 1930s to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s to 
the battle we all wage today to bring down the barriers of 
opportunity to citizens in this country your leadership in 
communities all over america has made this a better and a greater 
nation and i commend you for it and im proud and honored to be 
here today as your guest

the governing nationalist party ended a 
weeklong congress wednesday after removing many older leaders from 
the chiang kaishek era and promising to expand contacts with china 
delegates to the 13th nationalist congress elected president lee 
tenghui as party chairman the first native taiwanese to hold the 
post 
they also replaced threefifths of the partys central committee 
with new members whose average age dropped from 70 to 59 
the nationalist party or kuomintang has exercised oneparty 
rule in taiwan since 1949 when chiang kaishek and his followers 
fled from mainland china after losing a civil war to the communists 
premier yu kuohwa a 74yearold member of the old guard who 
heads the cabinet was chosen 35th among 360 candidates for the 
180member central committee 
yu viewed as the most powerful holdover from the chiang 
kaishek era received fewer votes than many younger taiwanborn 
candidates 
for the first time in the partys 94year history many 
delegates were not handpicked by nationalist officials 
but the extent of the changes in leadership will not be clear 
until the new members of the central standing committee the 
policymaking organ of the party are named thursday a cabinet 
reshuffle also is expected soon 
taiwans economic prosperity in recent years has increased the 
pressure for democratization before he died in january president 
chiang chingkuo eldest son of chiang kaishek lifted martial law 
and the ban on opposition parties 
the pace of further liberalization however will depend on the 
personnel changes in the cabinet and central standing committee 
the congress has demonstrated that our party delegates can 
reflect public opinion and are full of vitality said lee 
shengfung a reformminded nationalist legislator 
but we are not certain of our new leadership yet he said 
i hope we can have a new leadership that can keep the social 
trend in its grasp and make good use of this vitality 
native taiwanese representation in the newlychosen central 
committee increased from 17 percent to about 40 percent about 85 
percent of the islands nearly 20 million people are native 
taiwanese ethnic chinese whose families lived in taiwan before 
the nationalists arrived from the mainland 
lee closed the congress in suburban taipei by reiterating his 
partys traditional claim to have the sole right to govern china 
he also emphasized taiwans policy never to negotiate with the 
communist government in beijing 
but the nationalists onceresolute policy of having no contacts 
with china continued to crumble at the congress 
chiang chingkuo last october ended a ban on travel to the 
mainland for family reunions and more than 100000 taiwan 
residents have since made the trip 
the nationalists also eased a ban on visits to taiwan by 
mainland china residents under the new policy the chinese can 
come to the island if close relatives are ill or have died some 
intellectuals and students also will be permitted to visit 
in addition the nationalists say they want to extend taiwans 
economic contacts with china although all business activity must 
be negotiated through third parties

michael dukakis a week away from receiving 
the democratic presidential nomination brushed aside wednesday 
complaints that he was tardy notifying jesse jackson of his vice 
presidential selection and said he wanted jackson to be deeply 
involved in this campaign as a party leader 
with his designated running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
at his side dukakis told a news conference on capitol hill that he 
was unable to reach jackson by telephone tuesday morning to notify 
him of his vice presidential decision 
as a result jackson did not learn of the choice until asked 
about it by reporters when he arrived at washingtons national 
airport 
in atlanta where democrats were making final preparations for 
the opening of the partys national convention on monday jackson 
convention manager ron brown said he was flabbergasted by the 
failure to notify jackson and said he had broken off negotiations 
aimed at settling differences over platform issues 
thats okay said dukakis when asked about the halt in 
negotiations if people want to debate certain issues they have 
a perfect right to 
earlier in the day dukakis and bentsen received a cool 
reception from delegates to the annual convention of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
i thought it was terrific said the massachusetts governor 
i understand many of the people in the room were actively 
involved in the jesse jackson campaign and they were disappointed 
he said jackson would have received a similar response had he 
gone before a greekamerican group after defeating dukakis in a 
fight for the presidential nomination 
i want jesse jackson to be actively involved in this campaign 
as a party leader said dukakis i hope and expect he will be 
bentsen said he had talked to jackson by telephone wednesday 
morning to establish communications he gave no further details 
of the conversation 
there were scattered boos when dukakis introduced bentsen to the 
naacp convention and many delegates sat silently when dukakis 
first entered the room and was introduced by naacp executive 
director benjamin hooks 
a little more than 12 hours earlier the same hotel ballroom was 
packed with delegates who leapt to their feet repeatedly to cheer 
and applaud jackson 
the massachusetts governor flew to the capital with bentsen for 
a day of joint appearances before members of congress as well as 
the speech to the naacp 
the pair met for abou 45 minutes with members of the 
congressional black caucus it went well bentsen said as he 
emerged and the comments of black house members generally 
reflected that assessment 
lots of fences have been mended said caucus chairman rep 
mervyn dymally dcalif we had a very fruitful discussion about 
the convention the campaign and the presidency 
its a strong ticket its a winning ticket said rep john 
lewis dga adding it was very friendly in the room 
dymally said dukakis offered an explanation for why jackson was 
not notified of his selection of bentsen as vice presidential 
running mate before it was made public on tuesday saying he sought 
to call jackson first but was unable to reach him because jackson 
had left his hotel 
but for some members it wasnt enough 
i was disappointed said rep major owens dny who said 
he had hoped for some specific commitment to at least symbolically 
show that jackson would be a special third member of the ticket 
the way jackson learned of the no 2 choice was a 
demonstration of disrespect owens said and dukakis account 
was a lame explanation 
after the designated democratic ticket met with house democrats 
speaker jim wright of texas said the session evoked real 
enthusiasm 
i think dukakis and bentsen together can deliver texas said 
wright 
the session was closed as were later meetings with senate 
democrats and the congressional black caucus 
dukakis was returning to boston wednesday night where he still 
was looking for about 100 million in spending cuts to bring his 
state budget into balance 
current plans called for the massachusetts governor to fly to 
houston texas on sunday for a rally with bentsen after which the 
two would fly together to atlanta where the democratic national 
convention will nominate them for president and vice president 
the roll call for the presidential nomination with dukakis and 
jackson as the only names before the convention will take place 
wednesday night the following night the convention will be asked 
to ratify dukakis choice of bentsen as the vice presidential 
nominee 
many delegates at the naacp convention said they were angry over 
the fact dukakis did not notify jackson of his decision on the vice 
presidency before it was made public 
beulah c wright of main line pa said dukakis had been very 
rude to jackson asked if she would vote for the dukakisbentsen 
ticket she replied im going to have to think about that when 
you put him against bush i probably will 
to me that was a slap in the face said vera baugh of 
pasadena calif i am going to write in jesses name i will not 
vote for dukakis 
in atlanta jackson convention manager ron brown said we were 
flabbergasted by the way this was handled he said it is now 
up to michael dukakis to make this a unity convention 
after dukakis entered the room to subdued applause the first 
burst of enthusiasm came when hooks turned to the governor and 
said you know knowing jesse has been good for you 
ive learned a lot from jesse said dukakis and ive 
learned a lot from you

four weeks ago i too had the privilege of addressing an 
audience of mostly young people although it was a much smaller one 
than dr king spoke to in 1959 it included the members of the 
first graduating class at the new campus of the roxbury community 
college in the city of boston a sumbol to all of us in my state of 
educational opportunity of economic opportunity of the future for 
young people in our city and in our state and there i felt not 
only the sense of pride and accomplishment of those young 
graduates i felt the pride of an entire community and i was very 
proud to have been a part of building that campus and making that 
opportunity available to those young people and to their community 
i felt the pride of mothers and fathers who had worked so hard for 
years so that children would have a chance to wear a cap and gown 
i saw the pride of youngsters who would now have to look no further 
than to their older brothers and sisters for the inspiration to 
work hard and to stay in school i could feel the pride of teachers 
who had helped to unlock the door of opportunity for a generation 
of their communitys young i could sense all around me pride of 
the people of roxbury about that beautiful new college campus it 
could call its own and i thought to myself that morning this is 
what its all about this is what public service is all about this 
is what leadership is all about this is what all of us are all 
about expanding the circle of opportunity deepening the sense of 
community building pride making a real difference in the lives of 
real people this is how you create a new world and this is how 
were going to make the american dream come true for every single 
citizen in this country no matter who they are or where they come 
from or what the color of their skin and this my friends is what 
the election of 1988 is all about 
over the past 16 months ive campaigned from one end of this 
country to another campaigned with many of you ive met you ive 
sat down with you weve talked together and i know and you know 
that some neighborhoods and some communities in this country of 
ours are doing very very well but opportunity for some isnt the 
goal we set for america and maintaining the status quo running in 
place standing still isnt the kind of future we want for our 
country we want to grow we want to keep growing and we want to 
grow together we want to grow together as one nation one 
community one family 
this fall the american people will be asked to choose between 
two very different styles of leadership between two very different 
records of public achievement between two very different ideas of 
how to build the best america my friends some people say we need 
star wars i say we need star schools thats what we need for the 
youngsters of this country some people want to overthrow 
governments in central america i want to create jobs in middle 
america thats what this election is all about 
some candidates are worried about where we went to college i 
care about whether our children will have the chance to go to 
college and can afford the tuition some people say we cant create 
opportunity for all americans and build a strong national economy 
at the same time i say nonsense to that opportunity for all and a 
healthy and growing economy go hand in hand 
ive been my states chief executive for 10 years ive been in 
public service for a quarter of a century and let me say im proud 
of it im proud of the fact that my vocation is public service 
and i hope i can encourage thousands and thousands of young people 
in this country to go into public service as president of the 
united states

sen chic hecht rnev said wednesday he 
owes his life to a democratic colleague working for his 
reelection defeat who saved him from choking on an apple slice 
that rendered him blue and unconscious 
sen john f kerry dmass who stepped out of a capitol 
elevator and found hecht in istress tuesday dislodged the food 
after applying the heimlich maneuver four times witnesses said 
i had the good fortune that john was there hecht said my 
wife and children are forever grateful as am i he saved my 
life the senator said his wife called kerry on wednesday to 
thank him personally and his children and sister are writing kerry 
it was clear to me i couldnt breathe said the 59yearold 
lawmaker its a sensation that i never had before its a 
horrible sensation 
hecht said he was seated at the republican senators weekly 
luncheon tuesday and had the first bite of a fruit salad when a 
small apple slice caught in his throat 
hecht said he went out to the hall gasping for air he said 
sen christopher bond rmo slapped hecht on the back but 
without effect 
at that point kerry stepped out of an elevator with his press 
secretary larry carpman saw hecht was in trouble and applied the 
heimlich maneuver 
hes a strong guy and im not too tall about 55 he picked 
me right up and knew just what to do said hecht 
carpman and hecht said it took four thrusts to dislodge the 
apple enough to allow the senator to breathe again but hecht said 
the food was not removed for another 30 to 45 minutes by capitol 
physicians 
the realization is hitting me today how serious it was i just 
came back down from seeing the doctor my throat is very very 
sore hecht said he said he probably wont eat solid food for a 
few days 
ironically kerry as chairman of the democratic senatorial 
campaign committee has targeted hecht in his reelection bid 
you know that says something about america said hecht 
thats the difference between america and another country hes 
targeted me as no 1 to defeat yet he saved my life thats the 
story of america 
hecht is regularly rated as one of the most conservative members 
of the senate while kerry is one of the most liberal 
kerry had never used the lifesaving maneuver before carpman 
said he did not know where kerry learned the procedure adding 
he just seemed to act very instinctively 
kerry played down the incident and instructed his aides not to 
publicize it 
i think dr heimlich deserves the credit he said while 
appearing on nbctvs today show to discuss presidential 
politics

for george bush the search for a republican 
running mate began in earnest on wednesday as he planned to meet 
with key advisers to discuss the selection process a spokeswoman 
said bush has no intention of parading people around 
bush campaign sources said the vice president likely will use 
private polling to gauge the votedrawing appeal of various ticket 
combinations as he moves toward a decision 
meanwhile bush decided to keep a low profile during most of the 
democratic convention next week he extended a planned threeday 
fishing trip with treasury secretary james a baker iii to five 
days 
he will spend saturday through wednesday at a remote location 
near cody wyo aides said campaign sources said bush would use 
the time to discuss broad campaign strategy as well as potential 
running mates with baker 
baker a longtime friend who managed bushs failed 1980 
presidential campaign and oversaw president reagans 1984 
reelection campaign is expected to resign his treasury post later 
this summer to become bushs campaign chairman 
bush plans to actively campaign from late wednesday through the 
following weekend aides said 
meanwhile bush goes to new york on thursday to argue the us 
case before the united nations security council which is 
considering a resolution condemning the united states for the 
shooting down of an iranian jetliner 
efforts to second guess the the captain of that ship will be 
rebuffed bush said in a speech to the american farm bureau 
federation i cant wait to get up there to defend the policy of 
the united states government 
the completion of the democratic ticket on tuesday with michael 
dukakis selection of sen lloyd bentsen dtexas as his running 
mate started up bushs own search for a running mate campaign 
aides said 
hell decide on his process and then very privately carry it 
out hes not parading people around at all what youll hear is a 
lot of conjecture but none of it will be from him said bushs 
press secretary shelia tate 
ms tate said bush expected to work on the selection process in 
meetings in washington before he leaves for his fishing trip 
bush still intends to disclose his choice at the republican 
national convention in new orleans in midaugust she said he 
smiles and laughs and says he wants to see if he can hold it until 
then she said 
the six key bush advisers who are overseeing his campaign 
campaign chairman lee atwater chief of staff craig fuller 
strategist robert teeter media consultant roger ailes new york 
investment banker nicholas brady and texas oilman robert mosbacher 
met on tuesday to discuss the bentsen nomination said campaign 
sources 
campaign sources said teeter would recommend targeted polling to 
determine which potential gop vice presidential choice might have 
the best votedrawing ability 
bush in the past has said geographical concerns are important in 
balancing the ticket but not the prime concern 
furthermore the vice president has said he wants to make sure 
he uses a different method than president reagan did in naming 
him to the no 2 spot on the ticket in 1980 he was an 11th hour 
compromise at the 1980 convention after a chaotic few days during 
which reagan toyed with the idea of sharing the ticket with former 
president gerald ford 
political analysts continued to speculate on what the bentsen 
choice might mean for the makeup of the gop ticket 
there are two tracks going on said norman ornstein an 
analyst with the conservative american enterprise institute he 
can now counter bentsen with kansas sen bob dole pick the 
washington insider the veteran who knows how to make things work 
in the senate that would be the safe choice 
the other theory is that he will go for a young face someone 
like south carolina gov carroll campbell former tennessee 
gov lamar alexander or new jersey gov thomas kean 
ornstein said he did not think bush would pick a woman running 
mate because that would be a gamble and george bush is not a 
gambler 
eddie mahe a gop consultant and a campaign adviser to bush 
said he thinks bush should reinforce the conservative side it is 
the activistoriented conservative side where some reinforcement is 
needed 
mahe suggested supreme court justice sandra day oconnor or sen 
william armstrong of colorado but added hell probably end up 
with new york rep 
jack kemp because kemp might help in his native california

and i know that if were going to take on and beat our foreign 
competition if were going to make the label made in america 
once again the hallmark of quality and value and durability if 
were going to be the no 1 and stay no 1 were going to need all 
of our people 
that means that the children who enter school in this fall in 
philadelphia in birmingham and detroit and in towns and cities 
all over america must be the best prepared the best skilled and 
the best educated in the world it means that weve got to give 
those citizens of ours who happen to be on public assistance real 
training for real jobs and quality day care for their children if 
were going to help them to lift themselves out of poverty and to 
become independent and selfsufficient and senator bentsen is one 
of the leaders in the congress that is right now attempting to do 
that 
it means weve got to do for the nation what im proud to say we 
have already done in my state last april i became the first 
governor in the history of this country to sign legislation that 
will guarantee basic health insurance to every single citizen in my 
state and if one state can do it ladies and gentlement we should 
be able to do it for the entire united states of america we have 
40 million americans most of them members of working families who 
dont have a dime of health insurance 40 years after harry truman 
in this city said that basic health insurance and basic heath 
security should be the birthright of every american and were 
going to work hard beginning in january of 1989 with you and with 
the congress of the united states to make good on that commitment 
that president truman made some 40 years ago

members of a house panel examining health 
hazards caused by lead in drinkingwater coolers accused an 
illinois manufacturer on wednesday of stonewalling their 
investigation 
reps henry waxman dcalif and gerry sikorski dminn said 
halsey taylor of freeport ill should quit denying in the face of 
contradictory evidence that it made coolers containing lead and 
recall any of its products which might be contaminated 
the demands came at a hearing of the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on health and the environment which waxman chairs on 
sikorskis bill to eradicate lead from school drinkingwater 
supplies 
lead is a poison that damages the brain kidneys and other 
organs it is particularly hazardous to growing children 
we have never intentionally manufactured any cooler with a 
lead lining or lead materials inside the tank robin g munden 
the companys lawyer told the subcommittee we have carefully 
examined manufacturing records going back to 1920 and there is not 
a single mention of lead materials or lead lining on any of those 
tanks 
however waxman said that in tests last year of 20 coolers used 
by the navy the environmental protection agency found eight of 12 
halsey taylor units had tanks lined with leadbased solder 
he said water from one halsey taylor cooler tested was 
contaminated with lead at concentrations of 2000 parts per 
billion 40 times the current federal drinkingwater standard and 
100 times the standard epa is expected to adopt later this year 
we havent yet been able to confirm that the epa tests were 
accurate munden said assuming they were we dont know what 
the source of the lead in those tanks was when weve had an 
opportunity to confirm that then well have an explanation 
he said halsey taylor a subsidiary of household international 
inc and one of the nations largest manufacturers of water 
coolers will act responsibly if independent tests showed the 
company was at fault 
how do you take responsibility if you deny responsibility in 
the face of evidence waxman said during an exchange with munden 
how are you taking responsibility simply by stonewalling a 
committee of congress when the facts have been established by the 
environmental protection agency 
we have not deliberately or indirectly misled this 
committee the lawyer replied we believe halsey taylor tanks 
are safe 
holding up half a tank from a halsey taylor cooler sikorski 
said it had a uniform lead lining which could not have come from 
what the company suggested might be a pinhole leak caused by 
manufacturing error and demanded they come clean 
letting your kid drink from one of these is like handing her a 
glass of lead koolaid he said until they clean up their act 
i wont drink a drop of water from a halsey taylor cooler 
sikorski said his bill would require the immediate 
identification and recall of all leadcontaminated coolers and 
would hold the manufacturer responsible for all costs

socialist premier michel rocards government 
approved two bills wednesday that would tax the rich to guarantee 
the poor a minimum income 
the solidarity wealth tax would take between 05 percent and 
09 percent annually from someones net worth if it exceeds four 
million francs about 645000 the tax would finance a guaranteed 
minimum income for citizens and foreign residents without means 
this tax is explained by the need for the most favored people 
to perhaps participate more than others in this effort of 
solidarity said government spokesman claude evin who also is 
minister of solidarity health and social protection 
the bills approved by the cabinet will go to the national 
assembly during its autumn session they were among the top 
priorities set by president francois mitterrand in his successful 
campaign for election earlier this year 
a controversial wealth tax imposed by a socialist government in 
1982 prompted some french citizens to move large portions of their 
money out of the country that tax assessed on worth of three 
million francs or more was abolished in 1986 when the conservative 
government of premier jacques chirac came to power for two years 
about 110000 households would be affected by the new tax the 
same number as previously but the tax rates are lower than in the 
previous case exemptions are nearly identical including 
familyowned businesses art works and forest land 
the tax is expected to produce about 645 million a year to help 
about 500000 people who would have to agree to take part in 
jobsearech programs individuals would get the equivalent of at 
least 323 a month to live on and couples would get 484

a lebanese man on trial for the 
1985 hijacking of a twa airliner to beirut testified wednesday that 
he fought with a moslem militia in lebanon and smuggled explosives 
into west germany 
in his first statement to a frankfurt court mohammed ali hamadi 
said he fought for two years with the shiite amal militia in beirut 
but he denied belonging to the radical proiranian moslem group 
hezbollah or party of god which is believed to be the umbrella 
group for kidnappers holding western hostages in lebanon 
hamadi a lebanese shiite is charged with murder and air piracy 
in the june 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner on an athenstorome 
flight 
us navy diver robert stethem of waldorf md was shot and 
killed after the hijackers forced the plane to land in beirut 
thirtynine americans were held hostage during the 17day ordeal 
one of hamadis brothers abdulhadi hamadi is chief of 
security for hezbollah in beirut another brother abbas ali 
hamadi was convicted in april of kidnapping two west germans in 
lebanon in an attempt to win freedom for mohammed hamadi he was 
sentenced to 13 years in prison by a duesseldort court 
during wednesdays session mohammed hamadi refused to answer 
questions relating to the hijacking or to his brother abdulhadi 
i am not a member of the hezbollah hamadi said in arabic 
his comments were translated into german by a courtappointed 
interpreter 
hamadi told the court he had smuggled liquid explosives into 
west germany twice contradicting a statement he made to police 
after his january 1987 arrest at frankfurt airport at the time 
hamadi told police he thought the bottles were filled with alcohol 
and denied knowing they contained explosives 
he insisted he was not told why the explosives were being 
smuggled into west germany a certain person asked me to smuggle 
them in and hide them hamadi said i did it twice the second 
time i was arrested 
i dont know the reason why the explosives were brought in 
he said i was not told 
hamadi said his statements to police after his arrest were made 
under duress he alleged that west german interrogators threatened 
him with extradition to the united states if he did not cooperate 
west germanys refusal to extradite hamadi later led to 
temporarily strained relations between bonn and washington 
hamadi also contended he was one or two years younger than 
official documents indicate 
the court is trying to determine hamadis age at the time the 
hijacking was being planned to determine whether he will be tried 
as a juvenile a young adult or an adult depending on the 
classification he could receive from 15 years to life in prison if 
convicted 
the passport which i had when i came to west germany in 1982 
listed the year of my birth as 1964 hamadi told the court but 
that date is false i am one or two years younger but i cant give 
an exact date 
he said he believed his father had altered his birth date to get 
additional child support from the lebanese goverment 
hamadi said he was an amal militiaman between 1980 and 1982 but 
left after becoming disillusioned with the groups leadership 
hamadis testimony about his past with amal would make him a 
teenage street fighter in wartorn beirut according to hamadi he 
would have been 14 or 15 when he joined amal official court 
documents have him as 16 
i was forced by cirumstances to carry weapons hamadi 
said i wanted to fight against israel he said he did not know 
if he killed anyone 
hamadi is being tried under heavy security in a specially 
constructed prison courtroom officials have scheduled court days 
into december and say more could be added 
one of the hostages hamadis brother was convicted of 
kidnapping engineer alfred schmidt was released in september 
1987 the second rudolf cordes a businessman is still being held 
in beirut 
the longestheld foreign hostage in lebanon is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985

nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann who 
is being expelled by the reagan administration has served here 3 
years but he was not the sandinista governments first choice for 
the post 
initially nicaragua had intended to appoint deputy foreign 
minister nora astorga as ambassador but the reagan administration 
refused to accept her because of her role in the 1978 slaying of a 
highranking officer in the national guard of deposed president 
anastasio somoza 
the sandinistas then decided send tunnermann who was education 
minister at the time to the embassy in washington two previous 
sandinista ambassadors to washington had defected but tunnermann 
54 has worked tirelessly in support of his leftist government 
initially he was plagued by his limited knowledge of english but 
he has largely overcome that problem 
he also is nicaraguas ambassador to the organization of 
american states here 
before becoming education minister tunnermann was rector of the 
university of nicaragua for two years and an official in colombia 
with the united nations educational scientific and cultural 
organization 
he is married and the father of eight children the family has 
lived in a fashionable area of suburban maryland 
short in stature with an amiable manner tunnermann pressed hard 
for an improvement in usnicaraguan relations but the reagan 
administration insisted that a clear demonstration of sandinista 
interest in democracy must come first as a result tunnermann 
seldom has had an opportunity to deal on matters of substance with 
administration officials 
last december at a state department christmas party adolfo 
calero a leader of the nicaraguan contra rebels extended his hand 
in friendship to tunnermann but the envoy rejected the gesture 
he urged calero to take up the nicaraguan governments offer of 
amnesty to the rebels then walked away 
tunnermann has been ordered to leave the united states by friday 
as a result of state department claims that he engaged in 
abuses during his stay here 
the administration has refused to provide details tunnermann 
has denied any wrongdoing 
the decision to oust tunnermann and seven colleagues came after 
the sandinistas expelled us ambassador richard melton and seven 
of his aides from nicaragua

jesse jackson his 1988 presidential campaign 
winding down takes to the road thursday en route to the democratic 
national convention while angry supporters search for a signal of 
how he will end his remarkable effort 
the possibilities range from unity to confrontation 
jacksons words and actions as he finally acknowledges michael 
dukakis victory and lloyd bentsen spot on the ticket will not 
only shape the tone of the democratic national convention here 
starting monday they will also mold the enthusiasm that his 
supporters give to the democratic ticket in the fall 
will jackson push floor fights on the platform on tuesday night 
at the convention will he push on to the presidential nomination 
rollcall on wednesday or will he condone supporters suggestions 
that his name be on the vice presidential rollcall as well 
im not suggesting that i will compete for a place on the 
ticket but the floor is wide open on thursday night when the vice 
presidential recommendation is made jackson said in chicago on 
wednesday 
thats as much of a sign as jackson has delivered in the 24 
hours after jackson was embarrassed by dukakis failure to reach 
him before word circulated of the selection of lloyd bentsen as the 
vice presidential nominee 
jackson learned of the bentsen selection from a reporter tuesday 
morning publicly his aides have said they were flabbergasted by 
the major miscalculation and on wednesday they spread the word 
to suspend all convention negotiations between the dukakis and 
jackson campaigns 
you can assume we have the wherewithal to make our presence 
felt on everything that happens at the convention said jackson 
convention manager ron brown 
it is clear that it is not clear what jackson will do 
it is clear his supporters are upset 
they still expect him to be a good old boy and get out the 
vote well respect that good old boy said melinease hutchinson 
of norfolk va dukakis should have given jesse the respect of 
making certain he personally informed him 
its not that they turned jesse jackson down its how they 
did it said atlanta city councilman hosea williams said 
accusing dukakis of an unamerican racial injustice 
perpetrated upon millions of american voters who voted for 
jackson for president 
williams plans a march monday outside the convention hall to 
protest 
jackson himself has put up only veiled cues as to his plans 
in an emotional speech to the annual meeting of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people in washington on 
tuesday jackson reached a peak of intensity by declaring over and 
over again his effort will culminate in the presidential roll call 
when my name goes in nomination our struggle is being 
vindicated he said we go to atlanta not to smile and style 
and profile but to deliberate and debate our nations priorities 
but one jackson aide warned against reading too much into any 
general jackson rhetoric 
this aide said that jackson himself is still deciding on 
tactics decisions he will work through on the threeday bus trip 
starting thursday in chicago and ending saturday in atlanta 
as jackson pondered dukakis and bentsen moved wednesday to try 
to minimize the squabble 
dukakis the democratic nomineeinwaiting denied wednesday 
that any insult had been intended by the communications foulup 
and he said he apologized when he did talk to jackson 
i told him how sorry i was i hadnt been able to get through 
to him dukakis told a capitol hill news conference 
one jackson aide speaking on the condition of anonymity said 
there is an emotional reaction within the campaign that the slight 
was intentional but this aide said jackson believes dukakis 
decided to lump him in with all the other alsorans for the vice 
presidency setting up the current furor 
it is also true that some of the public anger is public 
posturing on the part of shrewd politicians looking for advantage 
in the endgame of the democratic nomination process 
hes probably allowing some of his people to beat up on the 
phone call issue because hes still negotiating on some other 
issues said one jackson adviser would not be quoted by name 
the current furor however interesting for the political 
insiders has to be put in the perspective of jacksons entire 
1988 campaign 
he has run a professional disciplined effort aimed at building 
his own coalition and the party at the same time the divisive 
rhetoric of his 1984 effort has not been heard in 1988 
it is unlikely that jackson would tear down the respect he has 
earned from many inside the party with a final angry gesture that 
could hurt the democratic chances in the fall 
we go down to a convention where democrats get together to put 
their ticket together thats going to be a positive act and jesse 
jacksons going to be a positive leader said jackson adviser ann 
lewis on wednesday again youre going to see a jesse jackson 
who is forwardlooking whos talking about the fall whos talking 
about the issues thats whats important and thats whats at 
stake

angola cuba and south africa agreed that 
cuban troops will withdraw from angola and south africa will end 
its 73year rule over namibia officials announced today 
the parties did not agree on a timetable for the cuban 
withdrawal at this weeks private meetings assistant secretary of 
state chester a crocker said during a news conference at the us 
mission to the united nations 
earlier today angolas defense minister accused south africa of 
duplicity by participating in the peace talks even as it staged 
attacks in southern angola according to a report by the official 
angolan news agency angop 
officials from angola cuba south africa and the united states 
met in private today at a hotel near the united nations 
private talks were held monday and tuesday under tight security 
at the us coast guard base on governors island in new york harbor 
cuba has an estimated 50000 troops fighting alongside angolan 
government forces against usbacked anticommunist rebels south 
africa has demanded that the cuban troops leave angola before it 
accepts a un security council resolution calling for independence 
for southwest africa or namibia 
the four parties first met in london in early may and then 
reconvened late last month in cairo egypt south african and 
angolan officials held a separate meeting in may in brazzaville 
congo 
the timetable for the withdrawal of the cubans is probably the 
most difficult unresolved issue us officials have said 
the us goal is a full cuban troop withdrawal in one year the 
same time span that the un resolution sets for granting 
independence to namibia 
angola and cuba have insisted that the cuban withdrawal should 
take place over four years but the us officials believe that is 
an opening bargaining position that is subject to change as peace 
talks proceed 
angola has been convulsed by civil war since it gained 
independence from portugal in 1975 
south africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border from 
namibia into angola to support the rebel forces known as unita or 
national union for the total independence of angola in their 
clashes with cuban and angolan forces

the white house has asked to be consulted 
before any attempt by the justice department to obtain an 
indictment of former philippines president ferdinand marcos a 
spokesman said wednesday 
marlin fitzwater said he could not confirm a published report 
that us attorney rudolph giuliani recommended a grand jury 
indictment of marcos and his wife imelda in connection with their 
new york real estate holdings 
fitzwater did say however we have told the justice 
department that before indictments are issued the white house does 
want to review the matter 
fitzwater said there was nothing irregular or unusual about the 
practice of giving the white house some consultation before seeking 
an indictment which could have foreign policy overtones or 
consequences 
the spokesman acknowledged that the white house doesnt have 
veto power over a justice department decision to seek an 
indictment 
however this is a matter that has foreign policy 
implications the spokesman said we want to review it for that 
reason and we certainly would make our views known to the justice 
department 
fitzwater would not specify why the white house thought the 
indictment of the deposed philippines president would be sensitive 
but he did say it is a matter that as you know the 
circumstances in which he left the philippines that he has been 
given certain assurances by the united states in regard to that 
departure 
and he also still has influence and contacts in that part of 
the world fitzwater added so there are any number of foreign 
policy issues that need to be considered 
asked whether marcos had been assured by us officials that he 
would not be indicted in this country when he fled the philippines 
in 1986 the spokesman replied i dont know what assurances he 
was given 
i think this is a routine request and not a specific one 
fitzwater said 
he told a reporter that one reason the white house was seeking 
consultations with the justice department is that president reagan 
and top officials were blindsided by the indictments handed up by 
federal grand juries in tampa and miami fla against panamanian 
gen manuel antonio noriega 
its mostly an internal thing the spokesman said fitzwater 
said that staff members of the national security council had been 
aware of the plan to indict noriega but had not made this known to 
superiors 
it was clear that we needed to strengthen the process to make 
sure those kinds of things are brought to the full attention of the 
nsc which reagan heads 
the village voice said wednesday giuliani recommended that 
marcos and his wife be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in 
connection with owning prime manhattan real estate 
the justice department is expected to ask the president to 
approve the indictment this week the weekly newspaper reported 
noting that a fiveyear statute of limitations on some charges is 
due to expire on july 18 
giulianis office declined to comment on the report 
the associated press reported last month that federal 
prosecutors were reviewing proposed charges that marcos and his 
wife imelda conspired to loot the philippines government over two 
decades 
the charges reportedly sought by giuliani stem from marcos 
oncesecret ownership of the crown building the herald center 
shopping mall and an office building at 40 wall street among 
others 
sources told the voice that the case also will involve charges 
that saudi arabian arms dealer adnan khashoggi assisted in a 
fraudulent transaction designed to conceal the fact that marcos 
owned the property 
if indicted the marcoses now living in hawaii would face 
criminal charges in us courts for the first time and if 
convicted they and other defendants could face substantial prison 
sentences and large fines 
marcos spokesman gemmo trinidad said tuesday evening that marcos 
had not been told of the village voice report 
this thing is purely legal and i would like to consult the 
president before commenting on it trinidad said 
the marcoses previously have denied any wrongdoing in connection 
with the new york properties

it means my friends that weve got to end the disgrace and the 
shame of homelessness in the united states of america and were 
going to do that were going to do that we know why we have 
homeless people in this country today and we didnt have them 10 
years ago because weve cut back by 90 percent on our commitment 
of affordable housing for families of low and moderate income and 
nobodys going to tell me that a nation as wealthy as this a 
nation as affluent as this a nation fundamentally as caring as 
this cannot build decent and affordable housing for all of our 
citizens 
it means that were going to need beginning in january of 1989 
an attorney general of the united states who is determined to end 
racism and sexism and discrimination in america and i mean end it 
once and for all an attorney general who believes in enforcing 
the voting rights act and the civil rights restoration act and the 
fair housing act amendments of 1988 an attorney general that you 
and i can be proud of 
and it means that weve got to elect a president of the united 
states who knows how to balance a budget and build a strong economy 
and create those good jobs and has done it a president knows how 
to create jobs and to save jobs and has done it a president who 
will work with the congress and the governors and mayors and 
community leaders and all of you all across america to build a 
future of good jobs and full employment for all of our citizens 
and i mean full employment a good job at decent wages for every 
adult citizen whos ready and willing to work a president with the 
strength and the vision and the values to get this nation moving 
again and dont let anyone tell you that we cant do it ive 
balanced nine budgets in a row im in the process of balancing a 
tenth my state has one of the hottest economies in the country 
and unemployment for minority citizens in my state has dropped by 
50 percent in the past four years and yes while im proud of the 
fact that my state has a minority unemployment rate of 55 percent 
my friends i am not going to be satisfied until there is no 
minority unemployment rate in my state and in the united states of 
america none whatsoever 
now weve accomplished this not only because weve worked hard 
and invested weve accomplished it because weve involved people 
and im proud of the way weve made that progress by doubling 
minority representation in state government by being one of the 
few states in the country that has a minority setaside program 
whose goals are not only being met were exceeding them by 
establishing a permanent commission on minority business 
development above all you may applaud if you would like above 
all weve made progress by working together white and black and 
brown business and labor educators and public officials and 
community leaders and just plain citizens sharing responsibility 
sharing progress building a sense of community and of teamwork and 
confidence about the future 
isnt it about time we had that kind of partnership in the white 
house i think it is i think it is isnt it about time we 
stopped waiting for opportunity to trickle down from a few 
privileged neighborhoods into our urban centers and small towns of 
rural america isnt it about time we told the sharp operators and 
the inside traders and the dishonest contractors that their day in 
the sun is over and that a new day in this country is about to 
begin i think so and so do you and isnt it about time that we 
restored in this country and in our government decency and 
principle respect for the law of the highest offices of our land 
you know my friends respect for the law is the most basic the 
most conservative and the most important principle of our 
democratic society and it must begin at the top in the white 
house in the defense department and in the justice department of 
the united states of america

some people are complaining that jennifer 
schaffer is allowed to clean her horses despite a water shortage 
at the main street coinoperated car wash 
but mayor charles hardy says the horsewashing is legal 
provided that ms schaffer pays for the privilege 
in my thinking as long as they pay to use the meter they can 
wash their dishes there hardy said i just want them to pick 
up any residue the horses may leave behind 
last week because of the drought hardy ordered residents to 
stop watering lawns washing their cars at home and filling pools 
but his mandate allowed the car wash to continue operating in this 
southern ohio village of 1000 about 50 miles south of columbus 
hardy said those who complained didnt realize that its 
perfectly legal for her ms shaffer to do this 
ms schaffer said she decided to wash the familys prize quarter 
horses at the car wash because of convenience it costs 150 to 
225 each time she washes a horse 
its easier i dont have to drag out the equipment she 
said 
the horsewashing has raised eyebrows among some area residents 
in the face of the water use restrictions imposed last week 
looks like theres a loophole said neil mccalla who lives 
just outside the village limits nobody ever said anything about 
washing horses 
ginny allison said the wash should be for cars only 
theres a water shortage some people here dont have enough 
water its a waste she said 
but marcine daughtery who was washing her clothes at the 
village coinoperated laundry said the idea has its merits 
i just might bring my 200 hogs id herd them through and then 
go through myself she said

drought and burning heat have already squeezed 
livestock producers and could hurt them further if conditions 
persist much longer the agriculture department said wednesday 
rising costs brought on by drought are affecting livestock and 
poultry producers returns the departments economic research 
service said also poor pasture and range conditions are 
reducing forage supplies for cattle and lamb producers 
the report added if the drought continues hog and cattle 
slaughter may be boosted adding to alreadyrecord red meat and 
poultry supplies 
market prices of cattle dropped in june following record high 
levels during the spring and likely resulted in part from large 
meat supplies the report said 
feeder cattle prices weakened in response to lower fed cattle 
prices and rising feed costs it said while lower feeder 
cattle prices reduce returns to cowcalf producers the more 
immediate problem is poor pasture and water conditions 
although hay cut from land idled under federal programs has 
helped there will be more pressure to reduce the cattle inventory 
if pastures continue to deteriorate the report said 
total production of red meat and poultry in 1988 is expected to 
rise 3 percent to a record 599 billion pounds but all of the gain 
will be from pork lamb and mutton and poultry 
beef production this year was forecast at 229 billion pounds 
down 2 percent from last year

recent staff additions at the national 
institutes of health have reduced the chance that potentially 
helpful new aids drugs could be overlooked a top health official 
told congress wednesday 
dr anthony s fauci coordinator of aids research for all of 
the federal institutes said we feel we will be able to mount a 
good effort with the staff now available 
fauci who also heads the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases had acknowledged under congressional 
questioning in spring that reviews of some requests for approval of 
drug studies was delayed by staff shortages 
vice president george bush quoted fauci last month as saying 
money approved for aids research activities at the institutes is 
about right 
which is right demanded sen edward m kennedy chairman of 
the senate labor and human resources committee 
fauci replied that both were that he received additional hiring 
authority soon after the spring hiring that has allowed him to 
recruit 20 additional reseachers for the remainder of the current 
budget year and allow him to add 19 more during the fiscal year 
that starts oct 1 
but even with additional manpower to handle more research fauci 
cautioned against raising expectations for substantial advances on 
aids treatment drugs or vaccines 
he agreed with food and drug commissioner frank young who 
testified earlier that the overwhelming majority of potential 
drugs that someone might consider useful are ruled out in the 
preliminary stages of actual testing 
young for example noted that the late actor rock hudson who 
died of aids went to france to obtain an unapproved drug that many 
people with the disease believed effective 
that drug is not looked at now as a promising drug young 
said pointing out that preliminary tests in the united states 
demonstrated that it was not really effective 
fauci said researchers walk a thin line between exploring every 
avenue for an effective drug and giving proper time to those that 
are most promising he told kennedy that nih researchers give 
consideration to approving studies if there is even a reasonable 
chance the drug will prove safe and effective 
but he said many get touted in newspapers that do not meet 
that standard 
the public might get misled when it reads in newspapers that a 
drug is promising said fauci 
the nih is responsible for approving clinical testing of new 
drugs where federal money is involved and works with the fda in 
developing testing protocals the fda has final authority on 
whether to approve a new drug for marketing or for widespread 
distribution just short of full market approval 
although nearly 40 drugs or combinations of possible aids drugs 
are in various stages of study none has shown enough promise to 
warrant their developers to apply to the fda for market approval

perhaps it was a case of just not 
wanting to take it anymore that caused the sandinista government to 
take its most dramatic diplomatic move against the united states 
or maybe as an opposition group suggests it was simply the 
return to a repressive rule that had eased following the signing of 
a regional peace plan 
either explanation was possible for the sandinistas surprise 
move monday ordering the expulsion of ambassador richard melton and 
seven us embassy diplomats the reagan administration responded 
in kind 
the sandinista order came a day after one of the most massive 
antigovernment demonstrations in nicaragua since the sandinistas 
came to power it ended with security forces beating civilians and 
hurling canisters of tear gas police said they detained 43 
opposition figures 
the government accused the american diplomats of being behind 
the demonstration and of inciting unrest 
the expulsion order also came after a week of steppedup rebel 
attacks that violate an almost 4monthold ceasefire 
the sandinistas expressed their outrage at the raids by the 
usbacked rebels which killed at least eight civilians and 
several dozen soldiers 
in a clear reversal of recent democratic reforms the 
sandinistas also shut down the roman catholic radio station on 
monday and suspended the only opposition newspaper la prensa for 
15 days 
the democratic coordinate an umbrella group of antigovernment 
organizations and political parties claimed security agents were 
rounding up dissidents in various nicaraguan cities 
the antisandinista group charged the government was 
developing a wave of repression 
relations between nicaragua and the united states have been 
strained at least since 1981 almost two years after the 
sandinistas came to power 
the reagan administration has financed the rebels or contras 
in the war to overthrow the sandinistas the cia mined nicaraguan 
harbors american planes fly reconnaisance and rebel resupply 
flights in nicaraguan territory and the us government ignored a 
1986 world court decision to reimburse nicaragua for damages 
the united states cut off aid to nicaragua in 1981 blocked 
loans and enacted a trade embargo in 1985 bilateral talks to 
resolve the problems were last held in 1984 despite repeated 
requests for renewal by the sandinistas 
washington claims the marxistled sandinistas represent a threat 
to us national security interests by serving as a beachhead for 
communism and aiding the marxist rebels fighting the usbacked 
government in el salvador 
nonetheless the two nations maintain weak diplomatic relations 
the us embassy in nicaragua frequently entertains opposition 
figures and handles visa applications 
almost a year ago in a move that took washington off guard the 
nations in the region nicaragua el salvador guatemala honduras 
and costa rica signed a plan designed to end civil wars and 
hostilities among the central american nations 
nicaragua moved quickly to comply but critics said it had the 
furthest to go 
the sandinistas also had the most to gain a us congressional 
refusal to continue funding the contras 
the government in nicaragua authorized the return of three 
exiled priests permitted several media outlets to reopen 
including radio catolica and la prensa in january the government 
lifted the state of emergency that barred many basic freedoms 
the sandinista government also backed down on its position to 
never hold talks with the contras three days of facetoface 
meetings in march ended with a ceasefire agreement a series of 
talks held amid mutual mistrust broke off june 9 but each side 
vowed to maintain the truce 
the sandinistas say they want the talks to continue almost 
seven years of war have claimed more than 26000 lives and 
shattered the economy 
opposition groups began holding marches all with prior 
government approval as required after the state of emergency was 
lifted most of the demonstrations were against measures to repair 
the battered economy 
none of the earlier demonstrations was quashed with the violence 
used sunday 
opposition figures were refused permission to hold a hunger 
march on saturday two days before the sandinistas mark their 
ninth anniversary with a huge celebration in juigalpa 85 miles 
east of the capital the government said the opposition march could 
take place july 24 
but by closing the opposition newspaper for 15 days the 
government is preventing la prensa from covering the july 19 
anniversary or the antigovernment demonstration

surgeons divided the liver of one child and 
transplanted it into two infants in the first double liver 
transplant performed in the united states a hospital spokesman 
said wednesday 
in the two transplants spanning about 12 hours tuesday the 
liver of a 1yearold illinois youngster who had died in an 
accident was divided and transplanted into a 7 monthold girl and a 
12weekold boy said university of chicago medical center 
spokesman john easton 
it worked out well the two segments that came from the one 
donated liver worked well for the two people who needed them he 
said 
the infants were in critical and stable condition wednesday 
double liver transplants have been performed previously in 
europe involving adult donors but no double liver transplants 
have been done previously in the united states he said 
the 12weekold boy joseph kovach of geneva ill weighs only 
42 pounds and is the smallest infant ever to get a liver 
transplant easton said 
he was born with neonatal cirrhosis a type of liver damage that 
exists at birth from an unknown cause easton said 
the girl jaclyn manrose of crystal lake ill had a 
hereditary defect called alpha1antitrypsin deficiency a 
deficiency of an enzyme that can lead to hepatitis or cirrhosis 
easton said 
kovach was the more urgent of the two he said 
his operation was performed by dr christoff broelsch professor 
of surgery and head of liver transplantation at the medical center 
easton said dr jean emond assistant professor of surgery 
operated on manrose 
they the doctors got the liver about 1045 monday night 
easton said surgery bagan around 730 the next morning emond 
did the transplant on manrose during the early stages of that 
broelsch separated the liver while emond was completing his 
operation broelsh did the transplant on kovach 
at a news conference wednesday kathleen and bob manrose said 
they had no qualms about approving the experimental surgery for 
their daughter who has a 5yearold brother and a twin sister and 
were just glad a donor organ was available 
megan wants her sister back mrs manrose said 
the other set of parents patty and donald kovach did not 
attend the news conference because their son went back to surgery 
wednesday afternoon to correct a bleeding problem easton said 
kovach has some other medical complications easton said 
he has already had openheart surgery in additon to needing a 
liver 
donor livers are in short supply in the united states where an 
estimated 475 people are awaiting liver transplants many of them 
children who will die without new organs 
broelsch has previously done transplants in which he pared down 
an adult liver for a child a procedure that other experts have 
said could help offset the shortage for youngsters

about 2500 workers went on strike 
wednesday at yugoslavias largest steel mill to protest drastic 
wage cuts and other government austerity measures the official 
news agency tanjug reported 
employees working at blast furnaces walked out in the early 
morning hours in protest of low pay in july tanjug said it gave 
no details 
communist party leaders worried about increasing social 
tensions also warned protesters not to demand radical change in 
the political system 
the steel mill employs about 18000 workers in this central 
yugoslav town it was built after world war ii and served as a 
symbol of communist industrial development until it began losing 
money in recent years 
many strikes have taken place since the government introduced an 
economic program in may that combined substantial price hikes and 
pay reductions the austerity measures spurred a further decline in 
living standards which have fallen by at least onethird since 
1980 
austerity plans worked out with the international monetary fund 
are intend to curb annual inflation of 175 percent and help 
yugoslavia repay its 21 billion foreign debt by making the economy 
more marketoriented 
the communist party presidium said the country has no 
alternative but to continue the austerity program despite 
widespread protests workers discontent does not have only a 
social background but also a very visible political component 
said a statement carried wednesday by official media 
it also warned against increasingly open clashes between 
leaderships of different yugoslav republics and provinces and the 
resulting public demonstrations the presidium said workers 
problems should be solved within their factories rather than in the 
streets 
workers have held several protest marches to air airing their 
grievances about the austerity measures and alleged corruption in 
the leadership they have chanted such slogans as down with 
communism and down with the government 
they also have demanded free elections independent trade unions 
and the curbing of privileges accorded party officials 
thousands of workers from a large shoe factory stormed the 
parliament building in belgrade last week 
yugoslavia had a record 1600 strikes last year involving 
300000 workers

the head of united technologies corp on 
wednesday said the defense contractor has absolutely no 
knowledge of alleged bribes paid to consultant melvyn r paisley 
a key figure in the pentagon procurement investigation 
robert f daniell chairman and chief executive officer of the 
hartford conn defense giant said in a letter sent to utc 
employees that the company remains reluctant to comment on 
specific allegations until the investigations are completed and all 
the facts are known 
but daniell told employees that it is important to respond to 
press reports on court documents suggesting that paisley received 
bribes from pratt amp whittney officials while he was a highranking 
navy official 
court documents released late last week said government agents 
believed unnamed pratt amp whitney officials paid paisley bribes 
during his tenure as assistant navy secretary pratt amp whitney a 
major builder of military and commercial jet engines is an 
operating unit of united technologies 
while our own internal investigation is still in progress i 
can tell you that we know of no improper payment by the corporation 
or its employees directly or indirectly to any government 
employee daniell wrote 
utc has absolutely no knowledge of payments of any kind by the 
corporation or any of its employees to mr paisley or his wife 
except under the terms of a written consulting agreement properly 
entered into after he left government service daniell said 
paisley was hired by utc and other defense contractors last year 
after he retired from the navy 
federal investigators are looking into allegations that 
consultants and defense contractors bribed defense department 
officials for contracting information to help win lucrative 
military contracts

investigation the only other public comment was a june 22 letter 
to employees denying knowledge of any wrongdoing

search pratt amp whitneys corporate headquarters in washington the 
document said that agents believed pratt amp whitney possessed copies 
of sensitive contract proposal information from general electric 
co on engine contracts for the f18 fighter bomber and the v22 
tiltrotor aircraft 
a warrant used to search paisleys mclean va home disclosed 
last week went further saying agents believed paisley received 
bribes from pratt amp whitney in connection with the v22 engine 
contract 
utc spokesman larry bingaman said corporate executives felt we 
should speak out and set the record straight on the paisleybribe 
allegations but that their policy of not discussing the 
investigation would remain in place

us officials in hanoi accepted what 
are believed to be the remains of 25 americans killed in vietnam 
and the caskets were put on a military plane for the trip to the 
united states the us embassy said 
it was one of the largest returns of remains us forces left 
vietnam in 1973 after losing 58000 soldiers in combat and the war 
ended with a communist victory in april 1975 
in the north vietnamese capital american officials were to 
begin talks thursday on the possible resettlement in the united 
states of thousands of vietnamese political prisoners who helped 
the united states during the war 
honor guards loaded the 25 caskets each topped with a folded 
american flag onto a c141 transport plane at noi bai airport 
after a 25minute ceremony the plane left for honolulu where army 
experts will try to confirm vietnams preliminary identifications 
the embassy said 
us officials said the vietnamese provided a list of 25 names 
some of which are on the official list of 1761 americans still 
listed as missing in action vietnam also gave other information 
related to the servicemen many of whom were shot down while 
bombing missions 
vietnamese officials entrusted the remains to a 23member team 
from the joint casualty resolution center and the army central 
identification laboratory both based in honolulu 
retired gen john w vessey a special presidential envoy 
negotiated an agreement in august 1987 under which vietnam pledged 
to speed its accounting of the missing americans 
the vietnamese hgave returned more than 150 containers of 
remains since the war ended the largest return was april 6 the 
remains of what were believed to have been 27 americans and those 
of three ethnic asians who might have been missing americans 
in exchange for vietnams cooperation washington has encouraged 
private humanitarian agencies to help the former enemy with medical 
problems including rehabilitation of veterans disabled in the war 
with the united states 
washington has no diplomatic relations with hanoi 
robert l funseth a deputy assistant secretary of state for 
refugee programs went to hanoi on wednesday to persuade vietnam to 
allow the emigration of some of the 900000 former us government 
employees or officials of the south vietnam government who were 
interned in reeducation camps most of the political prisoners 
were detained for their us ties state department spokeswoman 
phyllis oakley said in washington 
vietnam freed hundreds of former south vietnamese officials in 
mass amnesties in september 1987 and last february phan quang the 
vice minister of information has said only 150 former officials 
still are held and they may be freed soon 
foreign minister nguyen co thach said the former prisoners could 
emigrate only with a guarantee that they would not engage in 
antivietnam activities us officials have said this was not 
possible because the us government cannot dictate individual

the us merit systems protection board has 
upheld the firing of an fbi agent who was dismissed for refusing to 
investigate a group opposed to the reagan administrations foreign 
and military policies 
the merit board on tuesday ruled without comment in favor of the 
fbi in its case against john c jack ryan 
i guess i wasnt really surprised ryan said wednesday i 
would have been shocked if the decision had gone the other way 
ryan 50 was appealing the feb 2 decision of administrative 
judge t christopher heavrin who rejected his claim that the 
firing was unfair and constituted religious discrimination 
a 21year fbi veteran ryan lost his 50000ayear job just 10 
months before he was eligible for retirement with full pension 
benefits 
the fbi fired ryan last september after he refused to 
investigate a group suspected of vandalizing 11 military recruiting 
offices in the chicago area in october 1986 in an antiwar protest 
ryan a devout roman catholic says he became a pacifist for 
religious reasons in 1985 and now would never carry a firearm or 
kill even in self defense he denounces the administrations 
policies in central america as immoral activities 
his refusal to carry a gun is a key reason the appeal was 
rejected ryan said 
the fbi offered to reinstate him in december on the condition he 
never speak about the case he signed an agreement and mailed it to 
fbi headquarters but the deal later collapsed 
fbi spokesman gregory jones said the bureau had no comment on 
the merit boards decision 
ryan said he is considering taking the case to federal court but 
legal costs might prevent the move 
id like to pursue it because i think its a winnable case 
he said its certainly a major issue

were going to have a foreign policy that reflects the values of 
the american people applause were going to stop the shooting 
war in central america and were going to lead a war against 
poverty and in justice and exploitation throughout this hemisphere 
and my friends on the security council of the united nations were 
not going to veto international sanctions against south africa 
were going to sponsor them thats what were going to do thats 
what were going to do 
were not going to sell arms to terrorists were going to 
crack down on terrorists whether they live in beirut or tehran or 
johannesburg and were not going to cut deals with a 
dopepeddling gunrunning panamanian dictator and funnel aid to 
the contras through convicted drug dealers were going to say 
no to noriega and were going to wage a real war and not a 
phony war against drugs and drug abuse in this country because 
were going to have a president in the white house who understands 
that the greatest threat to our national security in this 
hemisphere is not the sandinistas its this avalance of drugs 
thats pouring into our communities and poisoning our kids 
and youre going to have a president whos done more than just 
talk about crime and drugs youre going to have a president whos 
been working for years with parents and students and educators and 
law enforcement officials to cut the demand for drugs and ladies 
and gentlemen we can do all the enforcing in the world and we must 
do a tough enforcement job and as any drug enforcement officers 
will tell you if we dont do something about the demand for drugs 
in this country were going to lose this war we have five percent 
of the worlds population in the united states of america were 
consuming 50 percent of the worlds cocaine five percent of the 
worlds population and 50 percent of the worlds cocaine 
so yes we going to be enforcing the law both here and abroad 
and were going to be doing something about drug trafficking but 
we have to set as our goal in this country drugfree schools in the 
1990s in every community in america and i mean it and i mean it 
in my own state weve been working for the past four years brining 
drug education and prevention into the early elementary grades in 
every community in my state and we have already made an enormous 
impact on drug use and abuse among young people but that drug 
education has to begin in the first second and third grade and i 
mean it in every elementary school in america and i personally 
want to lead that fight with your help and with your support 
and when i say these things to you i say these to you not as 
somebody who just talks about these things im proud to say to you 
that im the governor of a state that has had the second biggest 
drop in crime of any state in this country in the past five years 
and the lowest homicide rate of any industrial state in america 
were not going to have more rhetoric or photo opportunities in the 
war against drugs beginning in january of 1989 were going to get 
results thats a commitment and i promise it to you 
many of you will recall that in june of 1966 just two years to 
the day before his assassination robert kennedy also stood in 
front of an audience of eager young students some 15000 strong 
the site was a university the city was cape town south africa 
and his message was the same as dr kings in this city some 29 
years ago and this is what he said he said few of us will have 
the opportunity to bend history itself but each of us can work to 
change a small portion of events and the total of all those acts 
will be written in the history of this generation each time a man 
or woman stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of 
others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny 
ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different 
centers of energy and of daring those ripples build a current 
which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and of 
resistance my friends the future of america doesnt depend on 
some nameless outside force and it certainly doesnt depend on 
the alignment of the stars the future depends on us the future 
depends on us 
the future depends on us thats what democracy is all about 
thats what this country is all about thats what the naacp is all 
about and thats what this presidential campaign is all about a 
lot has happened since i addressed this same convention last year 
i know that ive learned a great deal about myself and about the

the dreams of those who came before us that we had the energy and 
the daring to make our own dreams come true and that we had the 
wisdom and the foresight and the compassion to open up the door of 
opportunity to our children and our grandchildren in generations 
yet to come 
im very proud this morning to be joined by two people who 
themselves have given their lives to public service lloyd bentsen 
at the age of 25 challenged a political machine in south texas and 
beat them and became a county judge two years later he challenged 
that machine again and was elected to the congress of the united 
states the youngest member at that time to be elected to the 
congress he was committed to civil rights and equal opportunity 
way back then way back then in the 40s and all of you know him 
today as the distinguished and able and very effective chairman of 
the senate finance committee 
and my friends this year this man has hit a legislative grand 
slam under his leadership with a narrow democratic majority in 
the senate and with an administration that doesnt support any of 
these things he has successfully gotten us a responsible trade 
bill which i hope and expect the president is going to sign 
finally he has just steered a plant closing law through the senate 
of the united states by an overwhelming majority and this time i 
hope the president signs it 60 days notice to american workers 
and their families before theyre thrown out of work from an 
administration that was willing to give noriega 120 days notice i 
must say i find it ironic and senator bentsen finds it ironic 
that last week the attorney general of the united states gave 
himself 30 days notice yet the president doesnt seem to want to 
give honest hardworking american workers 60 days notice before 
theyre thrown out in the street 
he has successfully steered the passage a sweeping welfare 
reform act which will help hundreds of thousands of american 
families to lift themselves out of poverty and he was the person 
who led the successful fight for a catastrophic health insurance 
bill which will now make it possible for senior citizens in this 
country to enjoy a measure of security without wondering whether or 
not illness is going to bankrupt them and he has done all of that 
in one year he has done all of that in one year those of you 
from texas know him youve elected him and reelected him you 
admire and respect him he is here with his lovely wife b a 
bentsen and kitty and i have had a wonderful time this past day or 
day and a half getting to know her and we have heard about her 
from so many people who admire and respect her here and in texas 
so may i introduce to you a distinguished united states senator 
from the state of texas a man who i hope you will be working for 
for the vice presidency and man i hope to serve with in a new 
administration in january of 1989 senator lloyd bentsen of texas

azerbaijan quashed a territorys attempt to secede 
and join armenia tass reported wednesday creating another 
stalemate in an ethnic dispute that has caused months of turmoil in 
the two southern republics 
the official news agency said the presidium or executive 
committee of azerbaijans parliament met tuesday night and 
declared null and void the declaration of secession that the 
nagornokarabakh legislature passed tuesday 
threequarters of nagornokarabakhs 160000 residents are 
ethnic armenians but the enclave was made part of azerbaijan in 
1923 the argument over it became public in february and the two 
neighboring caucasus republics have been disrupted by riots 
strikes and huge demonstrations 
tass quoted the azerbaijan presidiums resolution as saying the 
territorys legislature failed to secure strict compliance with 
principles of legality and openly encroached on the 
nationalstate composition of the republic 
it said only 101 of the 150 legislators were present when 
secession was voted reporters for the radio station in the 
territorial capital stepanakert said tuesday the vote was 
unanimous except for one abstention 
vladimir v vaselenko prosecutor of nagornokarabakh said in 
an interview broadcast by soviet television wednesday that the 
legislatures action violated the constitutions and laws of 
azerbaijan and the entire nation he said one deputy who spoke at 
tuesdays session admitted that but then voted for secession 
the soviet evening television news program vremya reported 
wednesday that militiamen in nagornokarabakh had confiscated 
grenades pistols revolvers sawedoff shotguns and ammunition 
from residents in the past month 
the declaration of secession challenging central authority all 
the way up to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev was the first 
such action in the soviet unions 70 years 
armenians most of whom are christians consider the mountain 
enclave part of their ancestral homeland azerbaijan is 
predominantly moslem 
legislators of nagornokarabakh which is slightly smaller than 
delaware said in their declaration tuesday it was being renamed 
the artsakh autonomous region of armenia 
it also called for an end to strikes but tass said they 
persisted wednesday in stepanakert 
all industrial enterprises remained idle on july 13 
public and city transport did not function all shops selling 
manufactured goods were closed so were consumer service outlets 
the agency said 
a worker at the stepanakert radio station said in a telephone 
interview the food situation has become very critical we are 
producing our own bread and milk but other foodstuffs are lacking 
nothing is coming to us from azerbaijan 
he said speaking on condition of anonymity that soldiers were 
in the city streets and in other parts of nagornokarabakh 
in yerevan capital of armenia 120000 people rallied to demand 
the central government in moscow approve the transfer of 
nagornokarabakh to armenia a reporter for the republics official 
news agency said he said a general strike continued and quoted 
speakers at a rally as saying we have no other means of protest 
than strikes 
the dispute over nagornokarabakh has brought it into direct 
confrontation with central authorities in moscow as well as with 
azerbaijan 
in february the dispute led to riots in the sumgait 
azerbaijan in which at least 32 people were reported killed 26 of 
them ethnic armenians 
the soviet constitution gives citizens the right of 
selfdetermination but requires a republics consent for any 
changes in its boundaries 
on feb 20 nagornokarabakhs legislature asked the azerbaijani 
and armenian governments to approve transfer of the region to 
armenia the armenian legislature agreed june 15 but azerbaijan 
said no two days later 
in baku the capital of azerbaijan a reporter for the 
republics official news agency said the dispute was being resolved 
in accordance with gorbachevs policies of glasnost or 
openness 
its being decided in a democratic way some people say one 
thing others say something else the reporter said in a 
telephone interview on condition his name not be used 
gorbachev has said more attention should be paid to concerns of 
the soviet unions more than 100 national groups but that some are 
abusing glasnost

the chief of the drug enforcement 
administration said wednesday the government will use paraquat and 
other herbicides in a steppedup campaign to eradicate domestically 
grown marijuana 
at a news conference dea director john lawn said paraquat 
which was banned from use on national forests in 1983 because of 
environmental concerns would be one of three herbicides used in 
the program operation stop crop 1988 
a dea spokesman cornelius dougherty subsequently said that 
paraquat would be used in spraying for marijuana eradication on 
private land not on public property in light of the court ruling 
the other two herbicides cited by lawn 2 4 d and glyphosate 
are not involved in the 1983 federal court decision and could be 
used in spraying on public lands dea spokesman said 
the other two chemicals dont have the same restrictions but 
while that may be complying with the letter of the law it is 
violating the principles that protect national lands to ensure the 
protection of wildlife habitats and recreation areas said jay 
feldman coordinator of the national coalition against the misuse 
of pesticides 
paraquat which is used in agriculture to clear fields before 
planting and after harvest is highly toxic and can cause serious 
harm when inhaled or absorbed by human beings or animals 
lawn said the government must prepare an environmental impact 
statement when eradication is contemplated and that at that 
point the determination is made by environmentalists by law 
enforcement which chemical will be most effective 
attorney general edwin meese iii said the real environmental 
damage is not from the herbicides but rather from what is being 
done by the illegal growers of marijuana he said the traffickers 
are cutting down trees damming streams and pouring pesticides 
and fertilizer into streams from which water is pumped for 
irrigation of the marijuana crop 
meese said operation stop crop is designed to rid the country of 
marijuanagrowing efforts by drug traffickers who have in many 
cases dispersed their operations into national forests and other 
remote areas to avoid detection 
rather than run the risk of losing their privately owned land 
through asset forfeiture to authorities once they are caught 
marijuana growers have moved to land owned either by the federal or 
state governments 
not only are they violating the law by producing illegal drugs 
on publicly owned land they often pose a serious threat to the 
safety and even lives of innocent people hiking through parks or 
forests only to stumble into the deadly booby traps set up to 
protect marijuana patches said meese 
large growing plots were once common but were easily spotted 
from the ground and air so the trend has been to have smaller 
plots according to a report by the national drug policy board a 
cabinetlevel group chaired by meese 
stop crop 1988 the first year of a longterm plan is a 
cooperative effort of the drug enforcement administration and the 
departments of justice agriculture interior and agencies 
including the bureau of land management and the fish and wildlife 
service 
the national guard which has provided support for knocking out 
marijuana growing operations since 1983 also will provide support 
state and local governments also are cooperating 
the national narcotics intelligence consumers committee has 
estimated that domestically cultivated marijuana constituted some 
278 percent of the total us supply in 1987 a fourfold increase 
from the 7 percent share reported in 1980 
law enforcement officials say domestic growth has risen in the 
face of increasingly effective eradication efforts overseas plus 
improved interdiction efforts by us authorities at the border

stung by michael dukakis failure to consult him 
on the selection of his running mate jesse jackson has halted 
preconvention platform negotiations between their campaigns and 
is looking to dukakis to repair the damage to their relationship a 
top adviser said wednesday 
the jackson forces were really incredulous at what they 
consider the snub by dukakis who did not consult jackson before 
naming sen lloyd bentsen said jacksons convention manager ron 
brown 
basically we were flabbergasted by the way this was handled 
brown said it seems totally contrary to the kinds of open lines 
of communication we were developing 
brown said later wednesday that he had spoken on three occasions 
with dukakis campaign manager susan estrich and that she 
apologized for what she said was not a deliberate foulup 
if she says it i believe it he said but added there 
needs to be some direct contact between michael dukakis and jesse 
jackson to get things back on a positive footing 
the turn of events has the jackson camp weighing options for its 
convention demeanor some supporters independently have raised the 
possibility of fighting the bentsen nomination by running jackson 
for vice president 
jackson himself may have fueled that talk on wednesday when he 
said in chicago im not suggesting that i will compete for a 
place on the ticket but the floor is wide open on thursday night 
when the recommendation is made for the vice presidential spot 
and there is no chance jackson will embrace the ticket 
before wednesdays formal vote in which jacksons name will be put 
in nomination against dukakis for the presidential nod said brown 
key jackson backers are not expressing dissatisfaction with 
bentsen himself but rather with the way the choice was presented to 
jackson as a fait accompli 
brown said dukakis official paul brountas had assured him early 
on that dukakis would run his selection by jackson but instead 
jackson learned of the choice from reporters when his plane landed 
in washington on tuesday he received a telephone call from dukakis 
informing him of the news about an hour later jackson said 
bert lance the former carter administration official who is 
close to jackson said he would find it incredible if the slight 
was intentional 
if that was intentional it was the biggest mistake they will 
make he said in a telephone interview 
brown and the two advisers who attended jacksons meeting monday 
with brountas former democratic national committee chairman john 
white and howard university political scientist ron walters said 
brountas clearly indicated jackson was still being actively 
considered for the second spot on the ticket 
but two other sources said brountas told jackson that day that 
he was not to be chosen although the running mate had not yet been 
decided 
at a news conference in washington wednesday dukakis said he 
apologized to jackson on tuesday for not reaching him with a 
personal phone call about the vice presidential choice before a 
reporter revealed the decision to jackson 
i told him how sorry i was i hadnt been able to get through 
to him dukakis said he said he failed to reach another 
alsoran ohio sen john glenn before the news got out 
rep major owens dny a member of the black congressional 
caucus that met with dukakis and bentsen on wednesday said the way 
jackson learned of the no 2 choice was a demonstration of 
disrespect 
but some of jacksons congressional backers appeared eager for a 
harmonious convention and made a point of describing bentsen as a 
good choice 
lots of fences have been mended said rep mervyn dymally 
dcalif chairman of the caucus following the meeting with dukakis 
and bentsen we have a very fruitful discussion about the 
convention the campaign and the presidency 
rep bill gray dpa one of the highest ranking black in 
congress as the chairman of the house budget committee urged 
jackson supporters to rally around the dukakisbentsen ticket 
gray said american blacks face four more years of civil rights 
retrenchment if vice president george bush wins the presidency 
and urged jackson supporters to keep their eyes on the prize 
i believe most black americans understand the choice is 
between dukakis and bush that they are far more sophisticated than 
some people give them credit for gray said 
and even owens urged dukakis to reach out to jackson 
wed like to see a troika a demonstration symbolically 
for american television to understand that jesse jackson is the 
third man on this team hes not willing to make jesse jackson a 
special third person on that team he made that clear 
jacksons cochairman in california assemblywoman maxine 
waters raised the possibility of entering jacksons name for the 
vice presidential slot although brown said that is not anything 
we are encouraging 
he declined to say what jackson would do if that happened 
he said decisions are up in the air about jacksons convention 
strategy and that a lot depends on whether dukakis tries to make 
amends 
you can assume we have the wherewithal to make our presence 
felt on everything that happens at the convention he added 
jackson officials had been working out compromises on platform 
issues in private negotiations but those have been halted brown 
said 
its now up to michael dukakis to make it a unity 
convention by reaching out to jackson jackson on tuesday 
repeated his earlier vow to support the democratic ticket but was 
noncommittal on how much he would press is supporters to work for 
the ticket in november saying he would wait to see how the 
convention turned out 
later in the day he emphasized 
it just seems to us that it would have been an absolute 
priority on a matter this important and this sensitive for there to 
have been direct contact with jesse jackson and his campaign prior 
to any information being disseminated

some 500 descendants of william rittenhouse 
who came to the new world in 1688 are gathering this weekend to 
celebrate being part of a family that boasts famous scientists 
doctors and businessmen 
harold rittenhouse a 10th generation direct descendant and 
chairman of the rittenhouse tricentennial reunion said his 
forefather the first mennonite minister in america would be 
taken aback by the celebration 
being a simple person it would have been a little bit 
overwhelming for him to come to a reunion like this rittenhouse 
said 
family members from 26 states and canada are expected to attend 
william rittenhouse was born wilhelm rettinghaus in germany in 
1644 he went to holland where he may have learned his trade of 
papermaking before coming to america in part to escape religious 
prejudice in europe 
he built whats recognized as the first paper mill in america in 
1690 as part of a colonial village called rittenhousetown in what 
is now fairmount park in philadelphia 
he became a mennonite minister preaching from a church in 
germantown 
he had three children two daughters and son before he died 
crippled from the backbreaking labor of working the mill in 1708 
the family spans 12 generations and claims as many as 40000 
members including admirals governors senators and judges 
david rittenhouse a greatgrandson was a leading astronomer 
mathematician and clockmaker in colonial times a philadelphian who 
knew thomas jefferson and benjamin franklin he became the first 
director of the united states mint in 1792 
other descendants include maj gen william crawford gorgas a 
physician who helped conquer yellow fever and raymond rubicam one 
of the fathers of modern advertising 
the rittenhouse story is documented in the last family history 
written in 1893 also the year of the last large reunion 
the possibility of updating or redoing our family history is a 
strong inducement for me rittenhouse said people say they 
have family memorabilia 
weve had people say something like we have a deed from 
rittenhousetown he said one person from texas said they have 
a grand piano that has been in the rittenhouse family 
rittenhouse began planning for the reunion in 1987 and sent out 
more than 2000 invitations he was pleased with the expected 
turnout of about 500 family members 
being the 300yearreunion is a drawing card on its own just 
being part of something like that he said

state regulators filed formal charges of 
misrepresentation wednesday against an insurance company that sold 
1500 iowa farmers policies covering this years drought 
insurance commissioner william hager said farmers paid an 
average of 1000 each when they applied for the coverage but the 
company issued only four of the policies he did not estimate the 
total value of the policies 
hager said he would try to force the company federal insurance 
co to live up to the terms of the policies it sold or force it 
to return double the premiums farmers paid he added that he might 
seek civil penalties which could range up to 50000 
insurance commissioners in minnesota indiana and ohio have said 
theyre investigating the drought insurance policies the company a 
subsidiary of the chubb group insurance cos of warren nj wrote 
this year 
officials in minnesota and indiana warned that chubb could lose 
its license to do business in those states if if did not provide 
the coverage 
a group of 42 neighboring farmers in tennessee and kentucky 
demanded on tuesday that the company honor 3 million in drought 
policies that they bought 
chubb group spokeswoman mary lu korkuch said wednesday the 
company is working with state insurance commissioners to develop 
solutions 
the company she said had set aside 30 million to cover the 
drought policies and had reached that amount of coverage before the 
june 15 cutoff date for purchase of the insurance 
chubb officials met wednesday with michigan insurance bureau 
officials in lansing to explain that one of federals agents had 
violated his authority and with the help of unlicensed agents 
sold at least 9000 policies thousands more than the company had 
approved 
its one of the most bizarre scenarios ive ever seen 
its like science fiction said eric nordman director of 
property and liability for the michigan bureau 
it seems that one agent who developed a computer program for 
weather predictions went amok and had lots of unlicensed people 
selling insurance on his behalf nordman said 
the drought insurance policies designed to pay damages for 
abnormally low rainfall were advertised in iowa in early june when 
this years drought was worsening 
its pretty predictable they would have a significant number 
of applications hager said im not sure fraud is part of this 
situation i doubt whether there was a clear understanding of the 
level of interest in these policies 
the company hager said directed its agents to solicit as many 
policies as possible when it it knew or should have known that 
the company lacked adequate financial resources and reinsurance to 
write all of the coverage solicited 
the insurance coverage was marketed as drought insurance but 
the product in question is actually a weather policy whereby 
benefits are based solely on the amount of rainfall in a given 
area between june 1 and aug 31 
it has nothing to do with crop yields hager said 
a hearing on the administrative charges has been set for july 
25 hager said regulators in indiana have set a hearing for the 
following day

the government wednesday pressed ahead 
with the trial of a palestinian whose detention may have provoked a 
cruise ship massacre and said it would not allow greece to become 
an arena for terrorist battles 
a previously unknown group linked with palestinians claimed 
responsibility for mondays attack on the city of poros cruise 
ship the organization of the martyrs of the popular revolution in 
palestine took responsibility in a statement delivered wednesday 
to a western news agency in west beirut 
radio franceinter in paris meanwhile reported that an 
anonymous caller said in a rambling conversation that the 
proiranian group islamic jihad carried out the attack to avenge 
the us downing of an iranian passenger plane 
there was no way to authenticate either claim 
the plo has condemned the attack on the city of poros 
tourists were sunbathing and strolling on the ships deck monday 
when several terrorists pulled machine guns and began shooting and 
throwing hand grenades nine people were killed and 98 were 
wounded 
merchant marine minister evangelos yiannopoulos told parliament 
wednesday that the terrorists returned to shore in rescue boats and 
had not escaped in a waiting speedboat as police initially 
reported many vessels rushed to the ships aid and rescued 
panicked passengers who had jumped overboard to escape the attack 
an athens radio station reported that one of the terrorists was 
a woman who received treatment in the hospital for a foot injury 
after the attack 
the station identified her as aysal lampsalmi a moroccan 
passportholder and said she checked out of the tzanneion hospital 
in piraeus on monday night with other survivors who sustained 
slight injuries 
greek authorities believe the guerrillas who carried out the 
attack may have intended to hijack the ship to win freedom for 
mohammed rashid a palestinian 
rashid is wanted by the us government for allegedly planting a 
bomb on a pan am jet in 1982 that killed one person and injured 15 
he is charged in greece with entering the country on a forged 
passport his trial had been delayed until the end of july but 
justice minister agamemnon koutsogiorgas overruled that decision 
wednesday and ordered proceedings to begin 
rashid told reporters at the courthouse that he was not a 
terrorist and claimed the ship attack was an american operation 
to distract attention from the shooting down of the iranian 
plane and the palestinian uprising against israels occupation of 
the west bank and gaza strip 
the americans can say what they like i had nothing to do 
with anything he said 
rashids trial was held over until thursday because his lawyer 
and interpreter were unavailable 
the deputy minister for tourism nikos skoulas said greece was 
determined not to become an arena for different groups or 
factions to settle their differences 
we are not soft or weak on anyone that accusation has been 
leveled at us he added referring to past criticism by the 
united states for laxity in combating terrorism 
skoulas said security officers were being posted on the oneday 
greek island cruises operated by the city of poros and other 
vessels 
confusing and sometimes contradictory information obscured many 
details about the attack 
the statement signed by the organization of the martyrs of the 
popular revolution in palestine said the attack was in 
retaliation for the escalation in the operations of murder and 
extermination by the murderous zionistamerican gangs in palestine 
lebanon the gulf and all over the world 
it also claimed responsibility for a car bomb that killed two 
men near the liners home dock of piraeus about six hours before 
the ship attack 
police speculated that automatic weapons grenades and 
explosives found in the car were intended for hijacking the ship 
in baghdad iraq bassam abu sharif spokesman for plo chief 
yasser arafat declared the palestine liberation organization 
and the palestinian people being themselves victims of 
stateorganized terrorism strongly condemn this criminal attack on 
the greek ship and the car bombing 
security police backtracked on an earlier claim that a young 
woman with a french passport was among the terrorists but they 
said a woman was still believed to be among the terrorists 
it remained unclear how many terrorists were involved most 
accounts by survivors and authorities varied between three and four 
the death toll has also varied the harbor authority initially 
said 11 people died and the coroner said there were 10 bodies on 
wednesday the government finally said the official death count was 
nine it said confusion apparently arose because bodies were badly 
charred and some were dismembered

western governments could bring 
apartheid much nearer its death by imposing stiff economic 
sanctions on south africa british opposition leader neil kinnock 
said wednesday 
the labor party leader mentioned no names but since his arrival 
in southern africa last friday he has attacked prime minister 
margaret thatcher and president reagan for opposing sanctions 
reagan and mrs thatcher argue that south african blacks and 
neighboring blackruled states would suffer most from such measures 
kinnock is on a fournation tour and met on wednesday with 
president quett masire at the end of a threeday visit to botswana 
which borders south africa 
i am greatly impressed by the progress in this peaceful 
prosperous democracy he said of botswana which has held regular 
elections and built one of africas fastestgrowing economies in 21 
years of independence 
he praised botswana for demonstrating immense bravery by 
taking a strong stand against south africa and its apartheid 
policies but acknowledged it would be economic suicide for the 
landlocked country to impose sanctions on its southern neighbor 
he added however if faraway nations that are much stronger 
and much less tied to south africa showed the same bravery 
including the imposition of sanctions then apartheid would be 
much nearer its death 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
kinnock also condemned south africas recent military raids into 
botswana and repeated a call for more western military aid to 
neighboring states 
south africa says its purpose in raiding botswana is to strike 
bases of the african national congress the main guerrilla movement 
seeking to end white domination of south africa

locally heavy rain provided some drought relief to parts of the 
tennessee and lower ohio valleys and gave a slight lift to the 
mississippi river on wednesday

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said 
wednesday that socialist leaders must share their experiences in 
order to avoid making costly political errors as they overhaul 
their economic systems 
one must not panic because of single failures gorbachev 
said in a pep talk for perestroika his campaign to reform 
soviet economy and society we have started such a great cause 
he who is persevering will win 
the soviet leader midway through a sixday visit to poland 
noted that the polish government headed by wojciech jaruzelski is 
embarked on a similar reform campaign known as socialist 
renewal 
we find many useful things in your experiences also for 
ourselves we wish to display more ability competence and 
the ability to avoid errors specifically political errors at the 
sharp turns of our history 
it is not one collective city or province that pays for 
political errors frequently it is the whole nation country that 
pays for these errors he told about 3000 shipyard workers at a 
rally in this port city 
polands attempt to restructure its economy was dealt a setback 
this year with the failure of a program that was aimed at 
overhauling the retail price structure trimming government 
subsidies and bringing prices more in line with actual costs 
the government raised prices an average of 40 percent almost 
immediately touching off inflation that hit 60 percent and is 
expected to go higher 
polish leaders have admitted the reform effort was a failure and 
needs a new approach 
we are analyzing now the polish experiences to find out what 
elements we could use and to avoid your errors or the things you 
consider erroneous the soviet foreign affairs spokesman gennady 
gerasimov told a polish reporter after gorbachevs speech 
gorbachev told delegates to the communist party national 
conference last month that a realistic price structure and 
elimination of heavy government subsidies particularly for many 
foods is vital if the soviet union is to eliminate shortages and 
produce highquality goods 
he has given no indication how the program will be implemented 
gorbachevs speech was greeted with polite applause but little 
outward enthusiasm by the workers admitted by invitations they 
received at their workplaces many came from enterprises elsewhere 
in the city perhaps a third were among the shipyards 8300 
employees 
the shipyard was among the first major factories to go on strike 
in august 1980 to support solidarity the soviet blocs first and 
only independent trade movement the shipyard no longer plays a 
leading role in the activities of solidarity now outlawed 
jaruzelski the military general who came to power after the 
labor unrest and imposed martial law referred to szczecins 
tumultous past 
in this city eight years ago the voice of protest rose 
against distortions defying the essense of socialism he said 
but he added that everything creative and valuable from that 
time is being preserved while the socialist government seeks new 
solutions to the nations continuing economic problem 
those were stormy times jaruzelski said it was bringing 
along some solidarity and set working people at variance there 
were roads but pathless tracts too it has already become 
history 
meanwhile a group of solidarity members at a steel and defense 
plant in southeastern poland said their oneday strike won job 
reinstatement wednesday for seven fired activists the seven had 
been dismissed for leading a strike at the plant april 2930 
government spokesman jerzy urban in szczecin said there was an 
attempt by a small group of people to start a strike at the 
stalowa wola steel mill but he said they failed 
the plant 120 miles southeast of warsaw is offlimits to 
reporters and there was no way to independently verify either 
sides statements 
late wednesday one of the dismissed workers liwak wladyslaw 
said in a telephone call to warsaw that he and the other six were 
promised in writing they would be rehired he said the agreement 
cme after six hours of talks with management 
there was considerable pressure on us wladyslaw said the 
situation in poland connected with gorbachevs visit forced a 
possibly quick solution here in stalowa wola 
gorbachev returned to warsaw later wednesday 
gorbachevs visit highlighted the szczecin shipyards links to 
the soviet union which helped build the yard on territory captured 
from germany during world war ii the soviet union buys about half 
the ships built at the yard about 200 vessels built in the 
szczecin yard sail under the soviet flag 
the official shipyard workers union presented gorbachev and his 
wife raisa with a model of a cruise ship they lived aboard during 
the 1986 ussoviet summit at reykjavik iceland

the board of the federal home loan mortgage 
corp voted wednesday to lift ownership restrictions on its 
preferred stock a move expected to bring a windfall of more than 
1 billion to the savings and loan industry 
the corporation known as freddie mac is a congressionally 
created corporation that buys home mortgages from savings 
institutions and other lenders and packages them into securities 
for resale to investors thus making more money available for home 
buyers 
freddie mac voting stock is owned by the federal home loan bank 
system which in turn is owned by the nations savings 
institutions its preferred stock with no voting power is 
currently owned directly by savings institutions 
the senate banking committee has been considering legislation 
sponsored by sen alfonse damato rny to allow sampls to sell 
their preferred stock to public investors thus creating a wider 
market for the stock and driving its price up 
analysts estimate the move would bring a profit of between 1 
billion and 15 billion to savings institutions which are badly 
in need of new capital the industry posted a postdepression 
record loss of 76 billion last year and lost another 38 billion 
in the first three months of this year 
however much of the preferred stock is owned by the healthier 
segment of the industry and sen william proxmire dwis chairman 
of the senate banking committee was pushing for a measure that 
through a transfer fee on sale of the stock would have pumped 
about 375 million of the windfall into the federal savings and 
loan insurance corp the ailing fund that insures sampl deposits up 
to 100000 
however freddie macs board which is the same as the 
threemember federal home loan bank board the regulator of 
federally insured sampls preempted congress by acting on its own to 
remove ownership restrictions 
the plan approved by the board in principle would lift 
ownership restrictions on about 15 million shares of stock savings 
institutions will be permitted until nov 30 on payment of a 
7ashare fee to freddie mac to exchange restricted shares for 
shares which public investors will be permitted to buy after jan 
1 any preferred shares not exchanged by nov 30 will continue to 
carry the ownership restrictions 
that formula if all the shares were exchanged would bring 
about 105 million to freddie mac rather than the 375 million to 
fslic as envisioned by proxmire 
kenneth mclean staff director of the senate banking committee 
said congress was unlikely to pass any legislation including 
proxmires proposal because of stiff opposition from the industry 
and the bank board 
the us league of savings institutions the industrys largest 
trade group issued a statement late wednesday hailing the boards 
decision as a welcome and sensible move 
the freddie mac board also voted to lift the limits gradually on 
the number of shares a single stockholder may own the current 
limit of 150000 shares was raised to 300000 immediately and will 
rise to 450000 effective oct 1 and 600000 effective jan 1 
ownership restrictions on the 100000 outstanding shares of 
voting stock are unaffected by the plan and remain in place 
meanwhile karl hoyle a spokesman for the bank board said a 
new rule will take effect immediately requiring institutions with 
less than the required level of capital to get approval of federal 
regulators before selling their stock the purpose is to allow 
regulators to monitor stock sales by ailing institutions

communist party leaders discussed plans 
for economic reform wednesday in the soviet blocs first central 
committee meeting to which a journalist was admitted 
in a departure from the traditional secrecy of party 
proceedings a correspondent of state radio was allowed to attend 
and gave hourly reports from the chamber in which the 108 central 
committee members conferred 
committee secretary miklos nemeth said the economy was in a 
critical situation and further delays in implementing necessary 
reforms would erode public confidence in the leadership 
nemeth said the economy and society should be open and 
authorities should demolish the barriers that provide 
overprotection for the economy 
he said all subsidies to moneylosing enterprises should end 
and only those making profits should be granted possibilities for 
development 
true commodity money capital and labor markets should be 
established and companies freed from unnecessary restrictions 
enabling them to react as they see best nemeth declared 
the radio broadcast 20 minutes of excerpts from nemeths speech 
during a news program at noon 
past practice has been to give information on such meetings in 
communiques often vague issued when they were over and rarely 
indicating disagreement 
on wednesday however the radio said 20 central committee 
members asked to speak after nemeths report on measures necessary 
to curb the 18 billion debt and stimulate the stagnating economy 
premier karoly grosz who also became party chief at the end of 
may has repeatedly sought public support of unpopular but 
necessary austerity measures 
he took over as party leader from janos kadar who now has the 
honorary post of party president official media said he was on 
vacation and did not attend the meeting wednesday 
grosz asked the public in a television interview tuesday to 
understand the need for reforms which he said would require 
sacrifices for the sake of the future and might need 1015 
years to show results 
wednesdays broadcasts could help him soften any potential party 
resistance to economic reform by taking debate on them direct to 
the public 
nemeth said the reform program must be implemented as a package 
taking any one of the elements out of its context may inevitably 
lead to confusion and failure he said 
he presented two alternative plans one of introducing radical 
reforms that might bring social tension and higher unemployment 
and a second that would bring change more gradually hungarys 
leaders have said the saecond course might mean lagging behind 
competing nations

officials may never know why a texas 
department store collapsed killing 14 people but a preliminary 
report will be available this week an engineer investigating the 
accident said wednesday 
i dont think were going to be able to pinpoint a cause 
garry g nichols said were working on it now 
he said the investigation has been hampered by the 
unavailability of important building records and sketchy witness 
accounts 
nichols and glenn j winslow civil engineers with 
birminghambased southern building code congress international 
inc are the primary investigators of the collapse of the 
threestory amigo store in brownsville they spent three days there 
after the july 7 accident 
weve been told that the city building department has moved 
two or three times and some of the records may have been 
involved in a flood nichols said 
he said the city is still searching its records which were 
stored in several locations for the construction plans nichols 
said one brownsville building official said they may have been lost 
nichols said officials had not found the architect or engineer 
of the building the city contacted the contractor but he had no 
copy of the construction specifications 
the store was built in 1969 the third floor was added about 
1975 he said 
witnesses said lightning struck either an electrical transformer 
or utility poles near the building said nichols he said there is 
speculation the poles might have fallen on the building causing 
the collapse 
the engineers are also looking into the possibility that the 
heavy rain falling that afternoon may have caused the cavein more 
than 2 inches of rain fell in a 30minute period just before the 
collapse nichols said if the buildings drainage pipes were 
clogged water could have backed up and its weight then could have 
triggered the fall 
nichols and winslow work for a nonprofit agency that writes 
building code laws for governments to adopt nearly 2000 city 
county and state building departments are served by the 
organization 
a complete report on the brownsville collapse will be issued in 
several months

negotiators for angola cuba and south 
africa agreed that cuban troops will leave angola and south africa 
will end its 73year rule over namibia assistant us secretary of 
state chester a crocker said wednesday 
the countries military and political negotiators agreed on a 
statement of principles that now must be approved by their 
respective governments another meeting was scheduled for early 
august 
the angolans cubans and south africans were able to reach 
agreement on a set of principles which constitute the essential 
elements of a political settlement in southwestern africa said 
crocker 
the parties did not agree on a timetable for the cuban 
withdrawal at this weeks private meetings crocker said during a 
news conference at the us mission to the united nations 
an estimated 50000 cuban troops back the marxist angolan 
government in its fight against rebels supported by the united 
states and south africa namibia also known as southwest africa 
lies between angola and south africa and has been ruled by the 
whiteminority south african government since 1915 
crocker said that if the peace process catches fire a 
detailed settlement could be finalized in two or three more 
rounds of talks 
private talks began monday among the americans led by crocker 
south africans led by neil van heerden that countrys 
directorgeneral of foreign affairs and a joint angolancuban 
delegation 
the talks took place under tight security at the us coast 
guard station on governors island in new york harbor and concluded 
wednesday morning at the negotiators hotel across from the united 
nations building 
discussion of the mechanics of south africas withdrawal from 
namibia would begin at the august meeting a venue has not yet been 
set but americans close to the process said that geneva and rio de 
janiero had been suggested 
crocker said implementation of any ultimate settlement would 
involve un civil and military administrators moving into namibia 
to replace withdrawing south african troops in compliance with 
un resolution 435 
details of the set of principles which crocker said were a 
couple of pages long will not be released until the governments 
have approved them 
there are some large gaps that remain crocker added for 
example the existing gap on the timing of the cuban troop 
withdrawal from angola is a major issue i think the parties agreed 
that this was not the time to come to grips with that issue and we 
agree with that judgment 
but they do recognize that theres going to have to be a 
compromise that theres going to have to be no losers that its 
going to have to be something that can be verified to the 
satisfaction of everybody crocker said 
earlier wednesday afternoon the head of the angolan delegation 
to the talks was asked if a final settlement was possible by 
september and he replied that the date is very close this is 
the wish of everyone 
lt gen antonio dos santos franca who leads angolas armed 
forces and is known by his nomdeguerre of gen ndalu added 
my government is waiting to discuss the withdrawal of the cuban 
troops 
south africa had said it will accept a un security council 
resolution calling for namibias independence under black majority 
rule once the cuban troops withdraw from angola 
van heerden had told reporters in the last two days that 
negotiators were talking turkey and the peace process was on 
track 
the four parties to the talks first met in london in early may 
and then reconvened last month in cairo egypt south african and 
angolan officials held a separate meeting in may in brazzaville 
the congo 
the us goal is a full cuban troop withdrawal in one year the 
same time span the un resolution sets for granting independence 
to namibia angola and cuba have insisted the cuban withdrawal 
should take place over four years 
the united states is a party to the talks because it has been 
supporting the anticommunist rebel group unita or national union 
for the total independence of angola with money and weapons since 
1985 a civil war has been under way in angola since it gained 
independence from portugal in 1975 
south africa captured namibia from germany in 1915 during world 
war i and governed it under a mandate from the now defunct league 
of nations the united nations abrogated that mandate more than 20 
years ago 
in 1971 the world court declared south africas continued rule 
over namibia illegal but the court a branch of the united nations 
has no enforcement power 
 
south africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border from 
namibia into angola to support the unita rebels against cuban and 
angolan forces 
last fall cuba increased its troop strength in angola from 
35000 to 50000 us officials have said adding they believe the 
buildup was intended to strengthen havanas bargaining position in 
the negotiations

the house was urged wednesday to improve its 
protection against terrorist attack by installing bomb detectors 
and requiring use of computerized identity cards to gain access to 
capitol office buildings 
an estimated 2450000 in interim security measures were 
recommended by house sergeant at arms jack russ who said that 
our system today can be defeated and wed like to make it 
tougher 
russ told a house administration subcommittee that installing 14 
bomb detectors in the capitol and at heavily used entrances to 
house office buildings would help counter a major security threat 
posed by plastic explosives 
he said plastic explosives can pass undiscovered through the 
current system of airportstyle metal detectors used in the capitol 
and adjacent office buildings 
russ estimated that conversion to computerized access cards for 
house members and employees entering office buildings from 
underground parking garages would cost an initial 2 million he 
proposed an eventual extension of the pass system to all 
congressional offices at an additional cost of 10 million 
the bomb detectors would cost an estimated 450000 and could be 
combined with existing metal detectors to screen one person every 
six seconds he said 
the subcommittee told russ to proceed immediately with another 
plan to switch from special license plates to automobile bumper 
stickers for house members and staff aides but deferred action on 
his other proposals 
rep joseph m gaydos dpa questioned the wisdom of making 
piecemeal improvements to the capitols security system and said 
the house should hire a team of outside experts to do a 
comprehensive study of security requirements 
russ responded that several such studies already had been 
conducted but that congressional leaders have rejected many 
recommendations such as erecting a wrought iron fence around the 
capitol grounds in the interest of maintaining easy access by 
visitors 
this is not like the kremlin agreed rep leon panetta 
dcalif the panel chairman the capitol of the united states 
and its offices represent a free democratic society and there are 
those who believe we cant turn the capitol into a fort 
russ said most of his proposals wednesday could be financed from 
13 million in unused funds previously appropriated by the house 
for security precautions 
several subcommittee members expressed doubts about improving 
security in the house without cooperation from the senate the 
senate side is like a different city russ replied if we 
waited for the senate to catch up with us wed never get anything 
done they march to a different drummer than we do 
the proposals russ advanced wednesday are the first step toward 
a more ambitious 185 million security plan that house leaders 
are still studying that plan also includes an emergency telephone 
system for alerting members immediately to any terrorist attack 
bombproof glass shields in the house visitors gallery and 
strengthening floor seats in the chamber to protect them against 
bomb blasts

specialized medical teams should be placed in 
every veterans administration hospital to treat former soldiers 
suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder three house 
democrats said wednesday 
rep sam gejdenson dconn said he introduced legislation 
requiring a specialized ptsd unit at all 172 veterans 
administration hospitals nationwide because even highly trained 
professionals may not recognize the illness 
it is unacceptable that a veteran is not able to go to the va 
hospital in his own state and be guaranteed adequate treatment for 
an illness which is linked to military service gejdenson said 
gejdenson along with reps lane evans dill and jim jontz 
dind said the bill would require two teams consisting of 
fulltime psychologists or psychiatrists specially trained in 
treating posttraumatic stress disorder 
similar teams exist at 15 va hospitals and there are 13 
intensive care facilities available for the disorder 
the measure would cost about 22 million a year to cover the 
costs of added salaries 
the cost of treatment is much less expensive than the cost of 
the problem gejdenson said 
the bill also would direct the veterans administration to set 
standards for diagnosis and treatment of the illness and establish 
criteria for training and education of counselors 
posttraumatic stress disorder is a psychological illness tied 
to veterans who were involved in battle the veterans 
administration has diagnosed 176000 cases since 1980 and 
gejdenson said an estimated 100000 may suffer from some symptoms 
of the disorder most of the victims are from the vietnam war era 
weve waited all too long in not recognizing the damage thats 
done and the sooner we start the better our chances are of 
success gejdenson said at a capitol hill news conference 
having gotten what you need from the veterans do you now just 
discard them gejdenson asked they ought not to be forgotten 
the connecticut congressman became involved in the ptsd issue 
after a veteran looking for his estranged wife shot and seriously 
injured her boss and then killed himself in february the incident 
occurred just one week after his release from a local va center and 
a day after he visited gejdensons local office 
initial police reports said the man suffered from the disorder 
he apparently did not but gejdenson remained interested in the 
issue and developed the proposed legislation according to aide 
chip partner

a house committee voted unanimously wednesday 
to abandon an investigation of the administration of nonlethal 
us aid to nicaraguas contra rebels after being told there were 
few if any problems with it now 
the investigation had been requested by rep leon panetta 
dcalif who headed a 1986 inquiry that determined that more than 
half of an earlier 27 million package of aid for the contras had 
ended up in private hands 
but panetta told the house foreign affairs committee that the 
agency for international development which oversees the latest 
479 million contra aid fund is doing a good job overall in 
administering the program 
the previous economic aid to the contras was administered by 
other us agencies 
panetta said aid voluntarily had provided all of the data he had 
requested 
it is clear from the documentation requested that aid has 
implemented this entire program in a spirit of openness allowing 
for close public scrutiny and review panetta said before the 
committee voted to drop the investigation 
the agency should be commended for how it has handled the 
administration of this program in the difficult political climate 
surrounding the issue of humanitarian aid panetta said 
he said the aid agency has established safeguards to make sure 
assistance funds went to their intended recipients and that the 
money was spent in accord with the law 
he said the agencys operations also were monitored by the 
general accounting office along with aids own inspector general 
and the private accounting firm of price waterhouse 
panetta said he remains concerned however that price 
waterhouse accountants were not able to document adequately a 1 
million expenditure for socalled family assistance in which 
monthly payments are made to senior contra personnel living in 
costa rica honduras and miami 
the payments range from 25 to 2750 a month with the payments 
being made in miami to 34 to 41 people he said 
he said none of the three monitoring agencies could document how 
these payments were used 
price waterhouse reported panetta said that the recipients are 
designated by enrique bermudez commander of the contra military 
forces who provides a list of beneficiaries and payment amounts 
including his own with no formal criteria for designating or 
removing beneficiaries 
he also noted that price waterhouse found certain cases of 
apparent abuse including the sale of supplied food by contra 
members in honduras to hondurans and other nicaraguan refugees 
it is important that aid improve ways of verifying how family 
assistance funds are used panetta said 
the state department recently had expressed concern that 
panettas investigation appeared to challenge the integrity of the 
administration of the contra aid fund even after precautions had 
been taken to assure that integrity 
this inquiry has uncovered no significant accountability 
problem with aids administration of this assistance deputy 
secretary of state john c whitehead said in a letter to the 
panels chairman rep dante fascell dfla 
panetta said 119 million of the aid fund has been spent to 
date including 67 million for food clothing and medical care 
385000 on communications equipment 15 million for a childrens 
surgical fund and 18 million for transportation

iran asked the worlds governing body for civil 
aviation wednesday to condemn the united states for downing an iran 
air jetliner where 290 people died saying it was a flagrant 
violation of international law 
the united states welcomed calls for the international civil 
aviation organization to investigate the july 3 tragedy over the 
persian gulf however it said fairminded countries should 
conclude that the captain of the us warship vincennes acted 
reasonably under the circumstances 
us officials said the missile cruiser vincennes mistook iran 
air flight 655 for an iranian f14 jet fighter during combat with 
four iranian gunboats 
the 159member aviation organization is a united nations agency 
most of its 33nation council meeting in special session favored 
an investigation but refrained from condemning the united states 
the council was expected to reconvene thursday 
soviet delegate ivan vasin repeated his countrys condemnation 
of the disaster calling it a grievous international offense for 
which the united states bears full responsibility 
the czechoslovakian delegate said my government strongly 
condemns this tragic and unjustified act 
many speakers urged ratification of a 1984 organization protocol 
stating that weapons should never under any circumstances be used 
against civilian aircraft so far 48 members have ratified it to 
take effect it needs approval from 102 members 
west germany and other nations urged the body to review 
provisions for coordinating military and civilian air traffic 
especially in war zones 
after a minute of silence for the victims the council heard 
first from iranian spokesman hassan shafty who accused the united 
states of evading responsibility by claiming it acted in 
selfdefense 
the use of force against civil aircraft cannot be justified 
under any circumstances and is a flagrant violation of 
international law shafty said 
the plane was ascending after taking off from bandar abbas 
iran on a 28minute flight to dubai and was transmitting normal 
civilian airline signals he said his statement contradicted us 
claims that the plane was descending and sending both military and 
civilian signals 
shafty accused the united states of hypocrisy since in past 
cases it has categorically rejected the selfdefense argument his 
comment was an apparent reference to the soviet explanation for 
shooting down a korean air lines jet that strayed over soviet 
territory in 1983 
in addition to an inquiry iran demanded that the aviation 
organization call for an end to present obstacles restrictions 
threats and use of force in iranian air space and that of other 
states bordering the persian gulf it also urged condemnation of 
the united states and recognition that it bears responsibility for 
the criminal actions of its officials 
outside the meeting chamber iranian official seirous naseri 
acknowledged that iran might fail to win a condemnation 
but he said the un security council which was scheduled to 
discuss the matter thursday may issue sterner language thats 
where politics comes into the scene naseri said 
iran belongs to the aviation body but not its council 
earlier us permanent representative edmund stohr told the 
associated press that iran would never get a condemnation because 
the united states had many allies on the council 
the us delegation was led by richard williamson assistant 
secretary of state for international organization affairs 
he said the payments that president reagan has offered the 
victims families were voluntary not on the basis of any legal 
liability or obligation 
williamson also said the united states would share with aviation 
body the results of its own investigation except for sensitive 
military information 
he blamed the eightyear war between iran and iraq for creating 
the circumstances that led to the disaster 
some degree of responsibility must be taken by iran for 
putting its aircraft in this vulnerable position the innocent 
victims of iran air 655 are just the latest among the hundreds of 
thousands of casualties in a needless war which should have ended 
long ago 
he said the war has jeopardized the safety of naval and air 
traffic in the gulf and us forces are deployed to contain the 
threat 
williamson suggested restructuring civil air routes away from 
dangerous areas and imposing new minimum altitudes he also 
recommended changes to aircraft transponders so that signals are 
unambiguous and better radio communications to ensure all warnings 
are received

cbs announced a management shakeup wednesday 
that has the president of cbs news becoming president of the 
broadcast group and for the first time in cbs history brings in an 
outsider to head the news division 
effective aug 1 abc news vice president david burke takes 
over cbs news cbs news president howard stringer becomes president 
of the cbs broadcast group replacing gene jankowski who becomes 
broadcast group chairman 
cbs broadcast division has struggled during the past season 
with its entertainment schedule lagging in third place behind nbc 
and abc for the first time ever the cbs evening news has been 
no 1 among the three major networks nightly news program in 
recent weeks after trailing abc during the second quarter of the 
year 
william s paley chairman of the cbs board of directors and 
laurence a tisch the companys president and chief executive 
officer announced the changes in a statement 
tisch later opened a news conference on the changes by saying 
today we start a new era 
financial analysts suggested the changes were an inevitable 
result of tischs efforts to place his stamp on the company which 
he has headed since the fall of 1986 
larrys putting his man in charge and gene is probably taking 
the first step out the door said edward atorino who follows the 
media business for the investment firm smith barney harris upham amp 
co 
stringer has been with cbs for 23 years the last 22 months as 
president of cbs news jankowski has served 11 years as president 
of the cbs broadcast group 
it was stringer who steered the beleaguered news division 
through the controversial and highly publicized layoffs and budget 
cuts that prompted even cbs notables such as anchor dan rather to 
criticize network management 
despite the cutbacks the division under stringer managed to 
launch a new news show 48 hours and with a little help from 
the writers guild strike prompting the need for primetime 
programming not subject to its delays kept three primetime news 
hours on the fall schedule compared to one for abc and none for 
nbc 
phil jones general manager of kctv in kansas city mo and 
immediate past chairman of the cbs affiliates board called 
stringers appointment magnificent 
he is peoplesensitive programmingsensitive and has the 
background in news that i think is the real foundation of cbs he 
will bring those qualities to the job and will be good person to do 
business with jones said 
jankowski moved up through the cbs sales division to become head 
of the broadcast group overseeing the finances of the network 
during his tenure cbs primetime schedule fell victim to nbcs 
rise and last year embarrassed the network by placing a miserable 
third kim lemasters became a midseason replacement for cbs 
entertainment president bud grant and will be tested when his first 
fullseason schedule finally gets on the air in 198889 
paley said jankowski has been an outstanding president and 
said he was delighted jankowski will continue as a key member of 
cbs senior management 
tisch said jankowski had told him that with the completion of 
this years program development cycle it was an appropriate time 
for an orderly transition in the management of the broadcast 
group 
stringer was the obvious candidate to assume leadership of the 
broadcast group tisch said 
burke who once served on the staff of us sen edward kennedy 
joined abc 11 years ago as a business and policy adviser to abc 
news president roone arledge stringer said burke has established 
a remarkable record as a news executive through program 
innovation and management strength 
i am confident that cbs news under his leadership will 
maintain the highest professional standards while finding creative 
new ways to provide news programming and information to the 
american people stringer said 
arledge who successfully turned abc news into a contender in 
his decade there is not expected to step down anytime soon he 
responded to burkes impending departure by saying he richly 
deserves this recognition which is a compliment both to him and to 
abc news we all wish him the absolute best

the plo spokesman who called last month for 
direct negotiations with israel said wednesday that two private 
groups have invited him to the united states to discuss peace in 
the middle east 
bassam abu sharif an adviser to palestine liberation 
organization chief yasser arafat said he was prepared to visit 
washington to elaborate further on my paper he said the state 
department had not yet granted him a visa 
in an interview with the associated press in baghdad abu sharif 
said the invitations were from the brookings institution and the 
national press club both in washington the brookings institution 
is a liberal think tank dealing with economic and foreign policy 
issues 
abu sharif a writer and former journalist published an article 
last month in the londonbased newsletter mideast mirror calling 
for negotiations between the plo and israel in connection with a 
unsponsored international peace conference 
arab radicals viewed the proposal as an implicit recognition of 
israel 
both israel and the united states have refused to deal directly 
with the plo but the americans have said they would review the 
position if the plo recognized israels right to exist the plo 
insists on simultaneous mutual recognition 
us and israeli officials have responded favorably to abu 
sharifs article but demand that arafat endorse it although the 
plo chief has made no public comment it is unlikely abu sharif 
would have published the article without his consent 
abu sharif said wednesday the plo executive committee the 
organizations 15man ruling body discussed his paper last week 
and approved it on the basis it did not contradict the condition of 
mutual simultanous recognition 
he said the 11man central committee that runs fatah the plos 
largest guerrilla faction also had no objections to the position

the state board of education voted 
wednesday to require emergency exit windows on new school buses 
the first design changes ordered since a fiery bus crash killed 27 
people in may 
the board also voted to require new buses to be powered by 
diesel fuel which is considered safer and less combustible than 
gasoline officials said that change had been proposed as an 
economy measure before the may 14 crash of the bus owned by the 
radcliff first assembly of god church which was gaspowered 
in addition to the changes the board ordered studies of other 
safety devices including roof exits additional side doors extra 
fire extinguishers and fireretardant seat covers 
the decisions followed the recommendations of a standing 
advisory committee that annually reviews the states bus safety 
standards 
sam jackson the state education departments representative on 
the advisory committee stressed that better training of drivers 
and evacuation training for school children may do more than the 
design measures 
pushout windows or any emergency exit are not worth a darn 
unless you develop some plan of evacuation jackson said 
but he added we definitely feel pushout windows will not 
hurt 
about twothirds of kentuckys school buses are gaspowered 
said byron watkins a committee member and assistant superintendent 
of hopkins county schools 
the state board also recommended that local districts 
restrict seating to two children per bench seat on buses making 
extracurricular trips and use separate vehicles to transport cargo 
such as band instruments and sports equipment children were 
sitting three abreast on the radcliff bus a capacity for which the 
bus was built 
step up busdriver training programs in defensive driving bus 
cleanliness evacuation and use of emergency equipment 
the radcliff churchs 1977 model bus exploded in flames when it 
was struck headon by a pickup truck driven in the wrong direction 
on interstate 71 near carrollton 
the victims who included 24 children were returning from an 
outing at the kings island amusement park near cincinnati the 
state medical examiner said all died of smoke inhalation not from 
crash injuries 
like school buses commonly in use in kentucky the church bus 
had a single emergency exit at the rear safety officials have said 
that was insufficient to evacuate a large numbers of passengers 
under the new rule the largest school buses those built for 
65 to 71 passengers must have two window exits on each side 
buses built for 35 to 53 passengers must have one window exit on 
each side 
buses equipped for the handicapped would need one window exit on 
35passenger models and two window exits on 65passenger models 
no additional exits would be required on any bus carrying 21 or 
fewer passengers 
the board also recommended but did not require that school 
systems install exit windows on existing buses that are used for 
trips outside local school districts 
kentucky has about 7500 school buses of which 1047 were built 
before 1978 when stricter federal safety standards went into 
effect said jackson those federal standards require a steel cage 
around the fuel tank a feature the radcliff bus lacked

the senate in an overwhelming 914 vote 
condemned nicaraguas sandinista government wednesday for 
dramatic new steps in brutality and warned that further human 
rights violations could trigger renewed us military aid to the 
contra rebels 
in what some senators called a carrot and stick policy the 
senate also said it was ready to extend economic aid to nicaragua 
if the sandinistas fully comply with commitments made a year ago 
and proceed to permit the establishment of a democratic system 
although the sense of the senate resolution is not binding the 
wide bipartisan coalition which swung behind it was intended to 
emphasize the anger and concern caused by recent sandinista actions 
to suppress dissent 
these include the closing of the opposition newspaper la prensa 
and nicaraguas catholic radio station the suppression of a 
nonviolent demonstration in managua the arrest of 40 opposition 
political leaders and the expulsion of us ambassador richard 
melton and seven other us diplomats 
you can say its only a sense of the senate resolution but in 
my view it means a great deal said senate republican leader bob 
dole of kansas 
dole told the senate we are moving now because the sandinista 
goons have been in the streets of managua again because the 
sandinista jails are filling up with new prisoners because what 
little independent media there has ever been in nicaragua is being 
closed down again and because the light of freedom in nicaragua 
has been nearly snuffed out again 
the resolution states the sandinistas should understand that 
blatant violations of last years peace agreement and the human 
rights of the nicaraguan people could cause congress to consider 
the provision of additional humanitarian and other appropriate 
assistance including military aid if conditions should so 
warrant 
originally drafted by dole but modified by senate majority 
leader robert c byrd of west virginia the resolution also 
supported president reagans action in expelling nicaraguan 
diplomats from the united states as an appropriate response to 
the unjustified expulsion of us diplomats from managua 
now for the first time we have a broadbased bipartisan 
policy toward nicaragua said sen pete v domenici rnm for 
the first time the united states senate is blaming only the 
sandinista communists for what is going on there 
were saying loud and clear daniel ortega you and your 
regime are violating the peace plan violating the human rights of 
your people he said 
the four senators voting against the resolution were sens brock 
adams dwash mark hatfield rore spark matsunaga dhawaii 
and william proxmire dwis those not voting were sens joseph r 
biden ddel jesse helms rnc larry pressler rsd john 
stennis dmiss and strom thurmond rsc 
meanwhile the senate intelligence committee questioned 
ambassador richard melton privately and members said later they 
found no evidence he was in engaged in espionage or any other acts 
that would justify his expulsion or that of seven other us 
diplomats 
and 37 republican senators appealed to house speaker jim wright 
dtexas to permit house members to vote on legislation which would 
not only condemn the sandinista regime but would continue economic 
aid to the contras and keep open the option of resuming military 
aid if sandinista repression continues 
we hope that this new and blatant proof of sandinista tyranny 
violations of human rights and bad faith will lead you to support 
our legislation or at a minimum permit the members of the house 
of representatives the opportunity to make their own judgment on 
its merits the senators said in their letter to wright 
while not responding directly wright told reporters that a 
bipartisan group of house members was drafting an alternative 
resolution which will call upon the nicaraguan government to 
reopen the organs of free expression and repeal the law that 
permits the response they made 
dole told his colleagues that the central american peace process 
has broken down and that the sandinistas freed of the pressure 
represented by contra military action have no incentive to live up 
to their commitments to embrace democratic reforms 
sen alan cranston dcalif a leader of efforts to cut off 
contra aid told reporters he continues to believe the united 
states should use diplomatic rather than military pressure to bring 
democratic change in nicaragua 
cranston said the sandinistas recent action makes him no more 
sympathetic than before to the contra cause 
but it doesnt make me any more sympathetic to the sandinistas 
either he said 
melton answered questions before a private session of the 
intelligence committee but objections by sen christopher j dodd 
dconn blocked the committee from continuing the session in 
public 
committee chairman david boren dokla said he will try to 
question melton in public on thursday

delayed construction of a warhead parts factory 
for us trident nuclear missiles threatens to slow modernization 
of britains nuclear arsenal a parliamentary committee said 
wednesday 
we believe that warhead production is a major risk area to the 
trident program the house of commons influential public 
accounts committee said in a report 
the committee headed by a legislator in the governing 
conservative party robert sheldon accused the defense ministry of 
inadequate management and control of the building program adding 
we are dismayed and concerned 
the potent trident missiles may not be in service on schedule 
because of a delay in construction work on a facility to make 
warhead components in berkshire west of london the committee said 
completion of the facility has fallen four years behind 
schedule the buildings at the atomic weapons establishment at 
aldermaston 50 miles from london will not be ready until 1992 and 
deployment of the missiles was planned for the mid1990s 
under a 15 billion program 16 trident missiles and four 
trident submarines are to replace the same numbers of polaris 
missiles and subs which date from 1969 
the longrange trident missiles are to increase british nuclear 
firepower eightfold 
the committee said the delay meant vital work on trident 
components will have to be done on old premises used to build 
warheads for britains aging fleet of submarinelaunched polaris 
missiles 
defense ministry officials testified to the committee that they 
still expect the billion trident system to come into service on 
schedule they argued there was a better chance of keeping on 
schedule by using the old facilities provided they did not break 
down than simply not doing the work 
however there is clearly some risk of breakdown and we are 
concerned at the extent of reliance on the use of aging facilities 
which need to be replaced said the report 
the 17 billion new building known as a90 at aldermaston was 
too complex for the atomic weapons facility to handle and private 
consultants had to be called in the report said 
plutonium and uranium components for the warheads are to be 
assembled at aldermaston while the rest will be usmade the 
submarines are being built in britain 
in january a london newspaper the independent reported that 
warhead shortages threatened the trident program the defense 
ministry at first denied this but later acknowleged slippages 
in the program 
the independent reported that mistakes in building the 
aldermaston facility meant having to tear out piping wiring and 
fittings from buidlings designed before it was known what equipment 
they were to house 
the newspaper said that extending the life of the polaris 
weapons if trident is not ready will cost about 425 million for 
each of the four submarines 
the polaris submarines carry fewer warheads and are more 
vulnerable to soviet attack than the new trident system

a jury was selected wednesday in the 
trial of a lutheran minister and a journalist accused of smuggling 
two pregnant salvadoran women into the united states and attorneys 
began arguing over what evidence should be admitted 
the defense asked us district judge john conway to bar 
statements allegedly made by a salvadoran attorney luis arturo 
venturarivas who was indicted dec 10 along with the rev glen 
remerthamert and freelance journalist demetria martinez 
venturarivas remains in el salvador and is not currently on 
trial 
conway delayed ruling on the motion to exclude evidence saying 
he wanted to study the matter he told attorneys to be ready with 
opening statements thursday morning 
remerthamert 44 was indicted on nine counts of conspiracy 
transporting and harboring illegal aliens and mail fraud the 
latter charge in connection with the adoption of one of the 
salvadoran womens babies ms martinez 28 was charged with four 
counts of transporting and inducing illegal aliens 
conway said he was concerned about admitting into evidence a 
letter allegedly written by venturarivas in november 1986 and 
delivered by remerthamert to one of the salvadoran women in 
albuquerque conway noted the indictment charges the defendants 
with a conspiracy that ended aug 28 1986 but the letter was 
written months later 
he also said he had problems extending any alleged conspiracy 
between remerthamert and venturarivas to include ms martinez 
us attorney william lutz argued that statements from 
venturarivas should be allowed because they could be corroborated 
with other evidence but defense attorney karen snell of san 
francisco called that evidence hearsay 
the only person to testify at the threehour hearing was mike 
murphy a us immigration and naturalization service investigator 
who described what the salvadoran women told him about their trip 
into the united states in august 1986 
the women cecelia eliasalegria and inez camposanzora were 
not in court wednesday although they remain in the united states 
and are expected to be called as prosecution witnesses

secretary of state george p shultz will try to 
persuade chinas leaders to stop selling missiles in the middle 
east because they are destabilizing the region a senior state 
department source said wednesday 
the chinese already have sold css2 intermediaterange missiles 
to saudi arabia and may be marketing another missile in the middle 
east still being tested in china said the source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the ballistic missiles are being introduced into one of 
the most volatile areas of the world the source said they 
have introduced a new weapons system that had not been in the 
middle east before 
the source said shultz would try to convince the chinese 
leadership the weapons flow is destabilizing the middle east a 
process neither in chinas interest nor that of the united states 
shultz left for beijing on thursday for a visit that includes 
meetings with senior chinese leader deng xiaoping communist party 
general secretary zhao ziyang premier li peng and foreign minister 
qian qichen 
it will be the sixth stop on a ninenation asian and pacific 
tour 
shultz arrived in hong kong on wednesday for a oneday stopover 
before proceeding to china south korea japan and the marshall 
islands he has already visited thailand malaysia indonesia and 
the philippines 
recent news reports have quoted israeli officials as saying the 
chinese may be selling m9 missiles to syria the state department 
source said the chinese have denied the reports and have said the 
css2s sold to saudi arabia were nonnuclear and defensive in 
nature 
the united states believes the m9 with an estimated range of 
375 miles is still being tested but that marketing may have begun 
the source said 
china has not been a major player in the middle east but its 
emergence as a major arms suppliers in the area has changed that 
the source said so the question of how our interests interplay 
in the middle east has become more significant over the last year 
and a half 
in hong kong shultz discussed the problem of the vietnamese 
refugee flow with the colonys governor sir david wilson 
the governor told shultz hong kong was enforcing a monthold 
policy of deterring the vietnamese from leaving their homeland and 
hoped to establish a repatriation program with vietnam a senior 
us administration source said 
a political adviser to the governor is to leave for hanoi next 
week for talks with the vietnamese on the refugee problem which 
escalated this year 
about 20000 refugees are in hong kong including more than 
3000 who arrived since the new policy was announced

the city council wednesday unanimously approved a 
resolution condemning cbs for favorably depicting drug use by 
broadcasting a mighty mouse cartoon in which the caped superhero 
sniffs a lightcolored substance 
what else do people snort up their noses but cocaine said 
council member charles tandy an anethesiologist i know of only 
one other thing and thats a type of medicine for asthma but i 
dont think this was that 
tandy who introduced the resolution said his attention was 
drawn to the cartoon while he was attending a medical convention in 
chicago three weeks ago 
cbs officials previously have denied that the cartoon character 
was shown using drugs in an april 23 episode of mighty mouse the 
new adventure 
a woman answering the phone at cbs in new york said late 
wednesday afternoon that no one was available to comment on the 
dallas councils resolution 
the resolution which will be forwarded to cbs and the federal 
communications commission urged that cbs immediately begin running 
antidrug public service announcements aimed at children 
tandy showed council members reproductions of cartoon cells in 
which mighty mouse sits around a campfire listening to friends 
stories then produces a powdery substance from inside his cape and 
snorts it 
officials of the american family association first accused 
mighty mouse of overt drug use last month 
cbs responded with a letter to the group saying the character 
was enjoying a pink mass of crushed stems tomatoes and flowers 
that a former girlfriend had given him the network said there was 
no change of mood or behavior after the flowers reached his nose 
tandy said he hopes to hear cbs response to the councils 
resolution 
in my opinion the no 1 problem that faces dallas and this 
country is the drug problem tandy said the only thing that 
im trying to do is raise peoples consciousness to this problem

the us embassy temporarily stopped 
issuing tourist visas to nicaraguans a spokeswoman announced 
wednesday after the two countries ordered several of each others 
diplomats expelled 
also wednesday the leftist sandinista government expropriated 
nicaraguas largest sugar and rum production company according to 
official radio sandino 
us embassy spokeswoman jan hartman said the embassy was forced 
to stop issuing the tourist visas because it lacked personnel after 
nicaragua expelled eight diplomats we just dont have enough 
bodies she said 
ms hartman did not say when the embassy would begin processing 
the visas again 
the government on monday ordered us ambassador richard melton 
and seven other diplomats to leave the sandinistas accused the 
american diplomats of encouraging domestic dissent and unspecified 
criminal acts against the nicaraguan people 
melton left tuesday for washington and the others were due to 
leave by thursday 
washington retaliated by ordering out nicaraguas ambassador and 
seven other diplomats 
ms hartman said the embassys consular section will continue 
handling problems involving americans 
she said the embassy in recent months has handled 250 requests 
for tourist visas daily 
a leading businessman meanwhile attacked the governments move 
to take over ingenio san antonio nicaraguas oldest and largest 
sugar mill gilberto cuadro vice president of the opposition 
superior council of private enterprise called the expropriation 
the end of a mixed economy in nicaragua 
president daniel ortega announced in june steps to move the 
government away from marxist wage and price control in order to 
surmount the economic damages caused by seven years of war against 
the ussupported rebels known as contras 
ortega said last month that the government did not plan to 
abolish private enterprise because there would be political 
pluralistic demonstrations against the revolution 
radio sandino said wednesday the government expropriated the 
mill because the wealthy pellas family that owned it had not been 
investing money in it since 1981 
the mill and accompanying enterprises including the rum 
distillery flor de cana are near chichigalpa a city 79 miles west 
of the capital 
since the sandinistas seized power in july 1979 overthrowing 
the rightist proamerican regime of president anastasio somoza 
they have taken over many privately owned companies 
the radio said the government will appoint a special commission 
to compensate the mill owners

an indignant jesse jackson hinted broadly 
wednesday at a possible convention fight in atlanta next week 
saying the floor was wide open when the no 2 spot on the 
democratic ticket is decided 
jackson rebuffed in his bid for the spot that likely democratic 
nominee michael dukakis gave to sen lloyd bentsen returned to 
chicago to plan his convention strategy and to prepare for the bus 
caravan that will take him and his supporters to atlanta 
aides said he was flabbergasted at the way the announcement 
of bentsen was handled jackson heard from reporters tuesday that 
he had not been chosen although dukakis said at a news conference 
wednesday that he had tried unsuccessfully to reached jackson 
before the news got out 
two democratic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
jackson was told privately monday afternoon that he would not be 
picked one source said dukakis emissary paul brountas told jackson 
he would bring the ticket down if nominated for vice president 
after yesterday many people have a sense of indignation and a 
sense of insult jackson said at a news conference 
as to whether that feeling would result in a bitter fight in 
atlanta next thursday when the vice presidential nomination is 
taken up jackson took a waitandsee approach and stopped short of 
saying he would engineer a dispute 
he confirmed that his supporters planned to put his name in 
nomination for the presidential spot on the ticket but would not 
say whether they would do so for the vice presidential spot as well 
at this point im not in the partnership he said adding 
im not suggesting that i will compete for a place on the ticket 
but the floor is wide open on thursday night when the 
recommendation is made 
jackson said that so long as we stay within the rules and 
follow the process the possibility of such a fight was there 
dukakis told of jacksons hint of a fight over the vice 
presidential nomination said im confident well have a united 
convention 
later addressing operation push the civil rights group he 
founded jackson criticized power brokers who have sat in small 
rooms with closed doors and made great decisions 
we must be a part of this process when they sit around these 
tables the key investors in our party are not in the group he 
said 
at his news conference jackson said he spoke briefly with 
bentsen earlier wednesday describing the conversation as a 
courtesy call that i appreciated very much 
but he said that the choice of bentsen was a blow to the 
progressive democrats who had helped bring the party back to 
life 
the conservative wing is now in the equation they have 
someone recommended for the ticket subject to ratification at 
the convention jackson said at a news conference 
he said his supporters have earned a place in the democratic 
equation but so far no talks have taken place along that line 
jackson said he would leave thursday on the rainbow express 
bus caravan that will stop in indianapolis ind louisville ky 
nashville tenn and chattanooga tenn on the way to atlanta 
at each stop he will be registering people to vote and raising 
money for a political action committee keep hope alive 
our objective is simply this to achieve within our party a 
partnership to be a part of the equation to share responsibility 
were the future of the party said jackson 
jackson said he was not given the nod by dukakis yet he will be 
asked to deliver votes 
in reality im being asked to in spite of inadequate 
communication and not being recommended for the ticket to motivate 
more people and deliver more votes and pour out more energy at 
greater risk and danger than any governor or any senator 
so with that responsibility and with those obligations must 
go the ability to satisfy the legitimate and reasonable requests of 
those constituents those who do in fact invest in a democratic 
party victory must get a fair return on their investment

the chairman of the panama canal commission 
said wednesday that panamas boycott of a meeting here interferes 
with the waterways operation and threatens a smooth transition to 
panamanian ownership 
board chairman william gianelli said the panamanian government 
ordered its four members of the ninemember board not to attend the 
meeting because of us sanctions against panamanian leader gen 
manuel noriega he added that noriega who has been indicted on 
drugrelated charges in florida also was upset when the canal 
board canceled a meeting to be held in panama in april 
panamanian officials say they will continue to boycott the 
meetings until the united states normalizes relations with 
panama whatever that means gianelli said 
the reagan administration which appointed the panama canal 
commissions five us board members is seeking noriegas ouster 
and supporting a president whom the general removed in february 
the board meeting privately without its panamanian members 
voted to suspend its regulations calling for at least two of its 
four annual meetings to be held in panama spokesman michael rhode 
said 
panama has said it will not recognize any action taken by the 
canal board members here 
gianelli said panama is interfering with the operation of the 
canal through which about 12000 ships pass each year by not 
allowing administrative staff members to attend meetings 
the commission is supposed to manage the canal until dec 31 
1999 when panama is to assume full responsibility under a treaty 
between the two countries 
gianelli said tension between the united states and panama is 
not yet affecting the operation of the canal but could do so 
we are still moving ships through the canal but it is hurting 
morale for the 8500 employees of the commission gianelli said 
the situation is not the healthiest thing

the army corps of engineers wednesday began 
shipping fresh water from new orleans to plaquemines parish at the 
southern tip of the mississippi delta where river water has become 
too salty to drink 
salty gulf of mexico water has been creeping up the mississippi 
for weeks because the drought has reduced the rivers southern flow 
drastically 
the corps is drawing fresh water from the river at new orleans 
and shipping it on barges to pointe a la hache and other 
plaquemines communities corps spokesman bruce sossaman said the 
first barges should reach pointe a la hache by early thursday 
morning 
we anticipate delivering about 3 million gallons of water a 
day said don clement acting director of operations for the 
corps new orleans district 
if the salt water wedge migrates up well provide the same 
type of a service to the other parishes as their salt content 
increases clement told a gathering of state and local officials 
here 
the corps also is constructing an underwater sill near myrtle 
grove in plaquemines parish to impede the flow of salt water 
upriver the salt water is heavier than fresh water and creeps 
along the river bottom 
at the plaquemines parish intakes salt concentrations have been 
reported at more than 1500 parts per million 
health officials say salt cannot be tasted in concentrations 
below 400 or 500 parts per million and doesnt pose a health threat 
until it reaches 1000 parts per million or more 
heavy rain in western tennessee lifted the shrunken mississippi 
seventenths of a foot higher than expected at memphis tenn 
according to james pendergrass a hydrologist with the army corps 
of engineers

this time of year and the coast guard said the slight rise had no 
effect on the rivers commercial traffic

misrepresentation wednesday against federal insurance co for 
selling drought insurance policies to 1500 iowa farmers and then 
failing to issue the policies 
insurance commissioner william hager said he would try to force 
federal a subsidiary of the chubb group insurance cos of warren 
nj to issue the policies or give farmers a double refund on 
premiums paid 
chubb officials said one of federals agents had violated his 
authority in selling thousands more policies than the company had 
approved and that they would offer double refunds to farmers at a 
cost of 15 million to 20 million 
ohio lt gov paul leonard asked three state agencies to draft 
proposals to combat the droughts impact and said the legislature 
might need to convene in a special session 
there isnt sufficient legislation on the books to address the 
drought he said adding that the state currently doesnt have 
authority to intervene in local water allocation disputes 
illinois treasurer jerry cosentino unveiled a program of loans 
for farmers at belowmarket interest rates

parliament passed a law wednesday giving 
conscientious objectors the right to choose alternative civilian 
work to avoid the military draft 
we consider it a success said jacek czaputowicz head of 
the outlawed peace group freedom and peace the organization has 
waged a threeyear campaign for the right to alternative service 
the government denied freedom and peace created any pressure for 
passing the law 
lawmakers in the sejm or parliament passed the measure as 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was midway through a sixday visit 
to poland 
under the new law young men may apply for alternative civilian 
service for reasons of moral or religious belief they would 
otherwise have to serve two years in the polish army or if 
college graduates one year 
a draft board of military and civilian members will decide if 
applicants are sincere in their beliefs if conscientious objector 
status is granted the men will serve three years in civilian 
service or two if they are university graduates 
the alternative service will take place in stateowned 
factories according to the staterun news service pap 
poland enacted the law in keeping with views expressed in the 
united nations and corresponding to international civil and 
political rights covenants ratified by poland pap said 
the sejm on june 17 also approved a change in the military oath 
removing a reference to serving beside the soviet army freedom and 
peace also demanded that change

szczecin on tuesday and wednesday after they applied for a permit 
to demonstrate during wednesdays visit to that baltic port city by 
gorbachev 
the group had proposed a banner reading ok gorby thanks for 
afghanistan when will you withdraw the troops from poland

the senate approved a 591 billion 
appropriation bill wednesday for the department of housing and 
urban development the national aeronautics and space 
administration and 15 other independent agencies 
the bill approved by a 8611 vote cuts off virtually all funds 
for the urban development block grant program created more than 10 
years ago to aid redevelopment of distressed cities the reagan 
administration has opposed the program for the past eight years 
sen john heinz rpa proposed an amendment to move 30 
million from the national aeronautics and space administration to 
udag but was defeated tuesday on 6422 vote 
the legislation increases the appropriation for fiscal 1989 
beginning oct 1 by 24 billion for all 17 agencies over the 
current year which ends sept 30 and is some 4097 million more 
than requested by president reagan 
however it is 6334 million less than the appropriation 
approved by the house earlier this year a senatehouse conference 
will iron out the differences before the measure is sent to the 
white house 
the legislation provides only about onefifth of the amount 
requested by the administration for a manned space station 
senior white house aides have said they would recommend that 
reagan veto the legislation since it provides only 200 million for 
a proposed manned space station 7674 million less than the 
administration requested 
nasa administrator james fletcher issued a statement saying 
we are disappointed at the senates action on funding for the 
space station if this is the ultimate outcome it is a setback for 
nasa and a blow to this countrys future in space 
i hope the conference committee will reverse this action and 
keep the space station on schedule fletcher said 
the senate appropriation is 702 million lower than the 
houseapproved amount for the space station the senate would use 
the money either to phase out the program or to continue it until 
the next administration determines its future 
other appropriations included in the measure are 
129 billion for hud 13 billion more than requested by the 
administration 
54 billion for the environmental protection agency 6118 
million more than requested 
101 billion nasa 14 billion less than asked 
19 billion for the national science foundation 170 million 
more than requested 
28 billion for the veterans administration 1127 million

the state took control of kentuckys 
thirdlargest school districts finances wednesday citing a budget 
deficit estimated by consultants to have been as high as 33 
million 
the action by the state board of education means state 
superintendent john brocks written approval will be needed for all 
hiring and purchases by the pike county district which has 15250 
students in 30 schools 
the board acted after two consultants it sent into the 
mountainous eastern kentucky district reported dozens of management 
problems 
beyond what we see in writing there are unique political 
problems in pike county at the present time brock said 
i think the state board would have to take some 
extraordinary action at this time i think they need some 
help brock said 
he said the state veto over local hiring would relieve the local 
board of some political pressure to dole out school jobs pressure 
that has increased as layoffs increase in the coal industry 
according to the report by consultants arnold oaken and james 
melton 
brock also said it would remove that temptation for school 
board candidates to promise jobs for votes three of the boards 
five members are up for reelection in november 
the chief reason for the state boards action however was pike 
countys third straight year of running a deficit budget 
on paper it has been cut from 33 million to about 300000 
but that is illusory melton and oaken told the board 
the district soon will have to borrow 600000 to keep 
operating increasing the debt to near 1 million again and the 
purchase of new school buses can be delayed no longer they said 
the local board has voted to close one elementary school but 
the report by oaken and melton said five should be closed with 780 
pupils redistributed in the past when the county has built new 
schools it has declined to close old ones melton said 
it was not immediately known how long the state would manage 
pike county schools finances under the seldomused statute it 
invoked the action is less severe than a declaration of academic 
bankruptcy by which the state would take over actual management 
of the school system 
brock said he would place a lieutenant in pike county to oversee 
the school systems finances brock said he had a former school 
superintendent whom he would not identify in mind for the job 
in pikeville school board chairman alvin newsome said he 
welcomed the state takeover and 18year board veteran gifford 
varney said he hoped the action marked a turning point for the 
district but two other members said they believed the takeover had 
been unnecessary 
if pike county voters were unhappy with board members they 
could elect someone else to do the job said board member carl 
biliter he said the state action surprised him but added we 
dont have no say over it because we were in debt

the state department said wednesday it expects 
nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann to comply with an order 
expelling him and seven colleagues and president reagan warned 
that hes going to get a big surprise if he doesnt 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley was asked about the 
possibility that tunnermann may claim he has the right to stay in 
washington on grounds that he also is nicaraguan ambassador to the 
organization of american states 
it would be unprecedented for a foreign envoy to refuse to 
comply with such an order as we have given to ambassador 
tunnermann she replied we expect him to comply with our 
order 
reagan who ordered tunnermanns expulsion on tuesday was asked 
wednesday what additional steps the united states could take to 
retaliate against nicaraguas expulsion of eight us diplomats 
weve taken away their visas and theyre going home he said 
when told that tunnermann was resisting the order the president 
called out to reporters hes going to get a big surprise 
at tunnermanns request the oas permanent council will hold a 
special meeting thursday afternoon to discuss his expulsion the 
meeting was described as informative in nature meaning that no 
resolution will be introduced a state department official said 
reagan was queried as he left a signing ceremony for a captive 
nations week resolution in the white house rose garden at which he 
reiterated his support for rebels fighting the leftist nicaraguan 
government 
i suggest to congress isnt it time we give freedom fighters 
in our own hemisphere the same consistent support we give to others 
in distant lands the president said 
earlier reagan met with the us ambassador to nicaragua 
richard melton who said he and his seven colleagues were expelled 
to intimidate opposition leaders with whom they had met in the 
normal course of their work 
melton at a news conference following a private meeting with 
reagan said the president told me other things are being 
considered as additional retaliation against nicaraguas 
sandinista government the ambassador declined to say what if any 
specific steps were discussed 
melton said the diplomats expelled from managua were selected 
with malice aforethought to reduce the effectiveness of the embassy 
in the performance of diplomatic functions 
he said the seven diplomats expelled with him had met with 
members of the opposition because seeing all sections of society 
is a normal function of an embassy 
i think the underlying purpose was to intimidate the 
opposition itself the ambassador said 
in other developments wednesday 
the state department formally asked the oas to approve 
tunnermanns expulsion richard mccormack the us ambassador to 
the international body delivered a note to ambassador eladio 
knipping of the dominican republic who also is president of the 
oas permament council 
tunnermann met with the ambassadors to the oas from mexico 
venezuela colombia brazil argentina uruguay and peru to discuss 
future strategy a state department official said tunnermann was 
seeking support for his position that each hemispheric country 
should have the absolute right to appoint oas envoys irrespective 
of us wishes 
but the state department official who spoke only on condition 
of anonymity said most of the ambassadors reacted cautiously to 
tunnermanns appeals and that some felt the sandinistas had made a 
big mistake in expelling melton and his seven colleagues 
on capitol hill senators angered by meltons expulsion and the 
shutting down of la prensa and the catholic radio station in 
managua overwhelmingly approved a resolution condemning the 
sandinista government for dramatic new steps in brutality the 
nonbinding sense of the senate resolution approved by a 914 
vote also warned that further human rights violations could 
trigger renewed us military aid to the contra rebels 
we are moving now because the sandinista goons have been in 
the streets of managua again because the light of freedom has 
been nearly snuffed out again said senate republican leader bob 
dole of kansas 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said a bipartisan group of 
lawmakers is drafting a house resolution that will call upon the 
nicaraguan government to reopen the organs of free expression and 
repeals the law that permits the response they made 
members of the senate intelligence committee attempted to hold 
a public hearing to question melton on the reasons behind his 
expulsion but were blocked by an objection lodged by sen 
christopher dodd dconn an opponent of us aid to the contras 
committee chairman david boren dokla told reporters that he 
and other committee members had questioned melton privately and 
found no indication that either he or any of his fellow diplomats 
were engaged in espionage or other acts thatmight have justified 
their expulsion 
federal prosecutors in miami unsealed an indictment charging 
seven people including the brother of contra leader adolfo calero 
with illegally supplying mercenaries and weapons to the contras 
mario calero of new orleans was accused of recruiting and paying 
for mercenaries with the help of a texas millionaire maco stewart 
and anticommunist cuban activists from the miami area 
also among those indicted were thomas posey head of 
alabamabased civilian materiel assistance and jack terrell a 
former mercenary who later blew the whistle on the alleged illegal 
operation all seven are accused of violating the us neutrality 
act which bars hostile actions against foreign governments from 
us soil 
at his news conference melton denied that the us diplomats 
were engaged in activities complementary to the state terrorism 
the administration of us president ronald reagan is carrying out 
against nicaragua as charged by nicaraguan foreign minister 
manuel descoto 
at the state department mrs oakley again refused to divulge 
the nature of the abuses tunnermann and others are alleged to

thrust last march at the time iran said that about 5000 kurdish 
rebels most of whom are backed by iran were killed and 7000 
wounded in iraqi chemical bomb attacks on halabja 
the iraqis began recapturing their lost territories in april 
they said they seized about 133 strategic heights in the northern 
region 
simultaneously they launched assaults in the south recapturing 
the southern faw peninsula in april and the shalamcheh and majnoon 
islands in may and june 
an iranian retreat from zubaidat in a fourhour battle tuesday 
capped these victories in the nearly eightyear war 
meanwhile in a letter released wednesday at the united nations 
iraq accused iran of barring visits by the red cross to at least 
30000 iraqi prisoners of war and of torturing and killing 
prisoners 
in a july 4 letter to un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar iraqs un ambassador ismat kittani quoted from a 
report by the international committee of the red cross to his 
government 
kittani also said that the iranian regime has subjected the 
prisoners to every atrocity from which a civilized human being 
would shrink 
these include killing prisoners who are bound by ropes 
cutting off their limbs and burying them alive 
in a followup note sent friday kittani said that when iraqi 
forces recaptured the mawat region in northeastern iraq near the 
iranian border they found the remains of considerable numbers of 
iraqi prisoners 
it is quite clear that the iranian regime killed them 
mutilated their corpses and burned them after tying up some of 
them with ropes kittani said in his note

one of the owners of the stalled seabrook 
nuclear power plant said wednesday it will pay an extra 2 million 
in maintenance to keep the project afloat until sept 1 and gain 
more time to secure financing for another year 
we decided that to allow seabrook to continue in an orderly 
fashion we had better do something said robert e busch senior 
vice president of finance for northeast utilities of connecticut 
the idea is to buy some breathing room to work something out 
for the longer term 
seabrook would have run out of cash in two weeks without the 
added funds 
we wouldnt have done this interim step if we didnt think a 
longterm arrangement was possible i think it will be a complex 
difficult job but doable busch said in a telephone interview 
from nu offices in berlin conn 
busch declined to elaborate on negotiations to get funding to 
keep seabrook alive for at least another year by which time plant 
officials hope to win a commercial operating license 
if a deal cant be reached then i think the seabrook project 
has some pretty severe problems busch said 
the 55 billion 1150megawatt seabrook reactor owned by 12 
new england utilities and holding companies was completed two 
years ago but remains idle for lack of federally approved 
evacuation plans 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis has refused to submit 
evacuation plans for six massachusetts communities within 
seabrooks 10mile emergency planning zone saying such plans would 
never work 
every months delay in licensing the plant adds about 50 
million to its price tag in maintenance financing and other costs 
officials have said 
seabrooks latest cash crunch began when directors of 
massachusetts municipal wholesale electric co voted in june to 
withhold its maintenance payment for july and try to sell its 116 
percent stake in seabrook they contended that rising costs made 
seabrook financially unattractive even if it were allowed to begin 
operation mmwec already has invested 875 million in seabrook on 
behalf of 28 utilities in massachusetts and eight in other states 
seabrooks other major owners have said they cannot assume 
mmwecs payments or buy its share of the reactor lead seabrook 
owner public service company of new hampshire is under bankruptcy 
protection and other key participants also face financial woes 
mmwec directors voted wednesday to withhold its august payment 
of about 2 million 
nu new englands largest electric utility owns 41 percent of 
seabrook through the connecticut light amp power co 
in return for covering mmwecs 2 million maintenance payment 
nu president bernard fox said public service and three other 
seabrook owners agreed to buy 250 megawatts of surplus power from 
nu during the next year 
busch said it was a remote possibility that nu would buy 
mmwecs seabrook share

an expert business witness in court cases states 
that the personnel files of many corporations are crammed with 
explosives so unstable they can blow up with little agitation 
such files says eugene jennings should be purged since those 
explosions are occurring with growing frequency and could be 
extremely costly in terms of dollars and reputations 
the files to which jennings refers are those containing 
evaluations of officers performances based on subjective and 
interpretive criteria rather than hard factual information 
increasingly he says officers are suing fellow officers for 
tortious a tort is a legal term for a wrongful or injurious civil 
act interference with their economic relationship to the employer 
as a confidential counselor to top executives and corporations 
jennings is most concerned about those instances in which officers 
make unfair improper or unreasonable judgments about another 
officers performance and career 
while complete data is difficult to come by partly because most 
suits are settled out of court jennings says that 26 such 
complaints were filed in new york state in 1986 and 15 in 
massachusetts last year 
for many years jennings a management professor at michigan 
state university has helped corporations set forth theories 
enabling them to defend themselves against such suits based on 
established criteria used by many companies 
but today he states such practices carry less weight no 
matter how commonly used this is especially so he says if the 
evaluation criteria are based on such interpretative and subjective 
items as common sense good judgment ambition and loyalty 
these are what jennings derisively calls uub an acronym for 
unintelligent undefinable babble 
nothing will cause a corporate case to fall apart than to use 
such undescriptive words as leadership motivation originality and 
style nobody defines them in the same way he says 
jennings says he is finding it more difficult to lay out a 
businesss defense in such suits 
he cites this actual example for nine years mr x an 
executive received all 10s on performance the result of 
subjective interpretive categories a new boss was named 
suddenly mr x received 9s and 8s and then 7s 
among other things lawyers for mr x learned on examination 
that the new boss interpreted leadership to mean discipline while 
the old boss held to the belief that it meant motivation on just 
what was mr x being rated 
the term motivation causes all sorts of trouble in a certain 
case one officerboss maintained that motivation meant making 
people work harder while another said it was to make them feel 
better 
so vague are the terms even to those using them says jennings 
that in another case corporate officers rehearsed consistent 
definitions prior to examination in court to their humiliation 
their ploy was uncovered 
in the past says jennings corporations believed that officers 
did not come under rules that apply to other employees 
particularly regarding discrmination and especially discrimination 
of women and minorities 
but says jennings all human beings come under a rule that 
nobody can interfere unreasonably and improperly with the economic 
relationship between an employee and employer 
he contends that when subjective criteria are used it is an 
invitation for ingrained conscious and unconscious biases to 
come into play even when applied without discriminatory intent 
for such reasons he says a trend is developing among 
corporations to clear up the evaluation process among other 
things it means getting rid of standard forms says jennings who 
is helping companies make changes 
a technique jennings recommends is to have a superior and 
subordinate agree at the start of each year what must be done in 
the job what reasonable resources must be utilized and what 
timeframe is needed for results 
at the end of the year says jennings the subordinate is 
evaluated strictly on these criteria thus making the performance 
evaluation detailed objective and activitybased 
he concedes that such a technique might not always be possible 
then he says it is far better that a performance evaluation be as 
general as possible as to the subordinate officers 
responsibilities 
it can be as general as this mr y is in charge of corporate 
public relations and so is expected to fulfill all the duties that 
normally are associated with this activity by reasonable and proper 
methods 
while it may not be as effective as the annual conferencetype 
evaluation jennings believes the general format is far less 
hurtful in a legal sense than if subjective interpretive critieria 
are used 
again he warns companies to beware of subjective criteria in 
selecting promoting or rewarding individuals he suggests that if 
they have been doing so they should purge their files and begin 
again

as the new president of the united methodist 
council of bishops bishop ernest t dixon jr says that no matter 
how impressive the institution or exalted the position hes 
regarded primarily as black 
thats what identifies you he says your blackness 
hes not brooding about it or critical but simply talking 
plainly about a seemingly intractable and restrictive reality 
a genial lanky man who laughs easily dixon first encountered 
that aberration in himself in reverse as a youth but says he 
outgrew it it still pigeonholes him though he says in its 
narrowlensed way 
youre considered first of all not a human being not a 
christian not a bishop but a black im not ashamed of it but it 
hurts sometimes 
its the ingrained slanted attitude toward blacks of a 
predominantly white society even though it ostensibly rejects 
racism dixon says and he notes that it comes up in all sorts of 
incidental ways 
even in my present position folks dont ever let you forget 
you are different he said in an interview at the denominations 
recent governing conference in st louis 
youre a black bishop people dont refer to white bishops 
as white but to black bishops as black i dont think its 
intentional but people come up and say oh youre one of our 
black bishops 
dixon 65 of san antonio texas chief ecclesiastical leader of 
the mainly white denomination of nearly 10 million for the 198889 
term has a special understanding of racial bias because he once 
shared some of it 
i gained some insight into white americanss stereotyping of 
black persons from experience in my early years he said a rangy 
man with whispyhaired balding head he squinted his eyes in 
reminiscence 
he said that in his youth in san antonio where he now heads the 
church mexicans used to be put down below blacks 
i used to hear my father and grandfather talk about mexican 
sharecroppers as shiftless and irresponsibile going off and 
leaving their crops 
i had some stereotypes myself i hadnt had the opportunity to 
associate with mexicans as my peers i hadnt reflected on how they 
were rejected then the kind of places they had to live how they 
were deprived of education 
not until you grow up does one break free of the baseless 
stereotyping dixon said your attitude changes at least it 
should he said although blacks still are often lumped as blacks 
rather than seen as individuals 
however among his churchs approximately 100 bishops over which 
he now presides he said i think we have achieved a degree of 
respect and collegiality that enables us to work together 
yet we constantly have to monitor each other to keep black 
bishops from being oversensitive and keep white bishops from being 
patronizing 
dixon succeeds bishop earl g hunt jr of lakeland fla 
asked what should be the main emphasis of a denomination that 
has lost nearly 2 million members in the last 22 years dixon said 
i would hope were moving in a new direction focused on our 
local congregations on equipping the saints our efforts must be 
to strengthen and revitalize the local church and also start new 
congregations 
he said a long sequence of events previously had absorbed 
denominational energies social justice causes and organizational 
restructuring 
the whole idea of evangelism became almost abandoned he 
said but its now in the forefront we need more biblical 
preaching more study of the bible in small groups 
congregations that are rooted in scripture with an 
opportunity to be involved in bible study those churches are 
growing at the same time we must also have christian outreach 
ministries of community service 
you cant preach jesus christ and him crucified without 
dealing with basic social issues of feeding the hungry and caring 
for the dispossessed 
dixon did his early church service under racial segregation he 
led small black congregations directed extension training of 
rural negro ministers at alabamas tuskeegee institute oversaw 
black christian education in texas 
afterward he worked for the national churchs local church 
division later headed philander smith college in little rock 
ark before joining the denominations program council in dayton 
ohio in 1969 
that was just one year after the denomination integrated its 
separate black jurisdiction with whites elected a bishop in 1972 
dixon served in topeka kan until 1980 when he shifted to san 
antonio

with all the savings and investment tax breaks 
that have been curtailed or rearranged in the past couple of years 
its nice to contemplate one that came through largely intact 
keogh plans for the selfemployed 
keoghs are sometimes thought of as the province of professionals 
on the upper rungs of the income ladder 
but in fact they can play a useful role in tax and retirement 
planning for anyone who has selfemployment income including 
moonlighters who are covered by a separate pension plan at their 
primary job 
the tax reform act of 1986 put limits on deductions for 
contributions to individual retirement accounts if you are covered 
by a pension plan but it set no such constraints for keoghs 
in many ways keoghs are very similar to iras both are accounts 
set up with a custodian that allow you to make annual contributions 
as the money grows the interest dividends or capital gains it 
earns can compound taxfree until withdrawals begin at age 59 or 
later if you want to avoid a 10 percent penalty tax 
but while ira contributions are limited to 2000 a year per 
person the maximum for keoghs can run as high as 30000 
keoghs originated in the early 1960s they are named for vincent 
keogh a new york congressman who sponsored the bill that created 
them 
nowadays they come in several forms one known as a money 
purchase plan permits you to contribute as much as 20 percent of 
your selfemployment income annually up to the 30000 ceiling 
for a second type known as a profitsharing plan the 
maximum percentage is 13043 again with the 30000 cap 
the difference in percentage limits naturally prompts many 
people to opt for a moneypurchase plan 
but there is another point to be considered in making the 
choice once you have set a given percentage contribution to a 
moneypurchase plan you are required to keep making that 
contribution each year 
your profitsharing contribution on the other hand is 
optional notes albert ellentuck at the accounting firm of 
laventhol amp horwath if you need your money for other purposes 
youre not obliged to contribute it 
adds michael leonetti a buffalo grove ill financial planner 
writing in the current edition of the american association of 
individual investors aaii journal this is a dramatic advantage 
over the money purchase arrangement because of its flexibility 
ellentuck notes that a compromise option known as a paired 
plan can be set up that is part money purchase and part 
profitsharing 
still another variation called a defined benefit plan can be 
set up to pay out a predetermined amount each year after you retire 
these are most likely to be a good choice for people fairly 
close to retirement leonetti says while younger savers usually 
will come out best with a plan covered by the annual contribution 
limits 
keoghs can be managed conservatively aggressively or somewhere 
in between in just about any kind of financial investment bank 
certificates of deposit mutual funds stocks and so forth 
you cannot however put your keogh money in collectibles such 
as rare coins or antiques the legislators wanted to keep 
taxpayers from using their retirement dollars to furnish their 
homes ellentuck observes 
if you are the sort that distrusts paper investments keogh 
savers are permitted to buy precious metals coins issued by the 
us government 
when it comes time to start withdrawing from a keogh account 
youll owe taxes on the money you take out even then though you 
can avail yourself of another break known as fiveyear forward 
averaging 
when you take out your funds in one lump sum you average your 
taxes over five years rather than pay one enormous tax on the full 
amount ellentuck points out thats a considerable tax break

sara was set in a law firm with geena davis the fly 
playing the title role maher was the pushy chauvinistic lawyer 
marty lang antagonist of a gay lawyer played by bronson pinchot 
who now stars on abcs perfect strangers the show was produced 
by gary david goldberg the creator of family ties 
i went to read for sara in gary goldbergs office maher 
said his baby was in a playpen in the office and the baby 
screamed all during my reading maybe thats where he got the idea 
for the kid in the show the kid belonged to saras neighbor 
sarad say martys here and the kid would say yeah the guy 
nobody likes 
the show was canceled at the end of its first season despite 
reasonably good ratings 
we were up against dynasty when dynasty was hot but the 
real reason is that it was my fault he joked i screwed up 
they never tell the actors why a show is canceled they dont 
even tell you when they cancel a show i went to new york to 
represent the show for the announcement of the new fall season i 
was at the waldorfastoria and 10 minutes before im supposed to 
go down i get a call dont go to the breakfast mr maher they 
didnt even tell me the show was canceled 
maher and tommy hinkley play goofy detectives in hard 
knocks we never spent much time on cases he said it was 
really a character comedy it was more like the odd couple 
maher grew up in bergen county nj across the hudson river 
from new york city his father is a retired radio news editor at 
nbc news 
he said the first time he was on lettermans show his father 
was still working at nbc 
i got bumped and i had to physically restrain my dad from 
going up and punching dave letterman i said dad those things 
happen 
maher recently completed work on a comedy feature film called 
the piranha women in the avocado jungle of death 
its a parody of heart of darkness which was adapted for 
apocalypse now he said the piranha women are a group of 
ultrafeminists led by adrienne barbeau shes kurtz shannon tweed

swaggering adventurer the piranha women are served by a group of

strange winds are blowing these days which 
prompts the advice that you hold onto your hat 
the winds arise not so much from the anomalies that are inherent 
in every survey whether it be in meteorology economics or popular 
music but from the tendency to extrapolate those anomalies to 
infinity 
the drought covering much of the nations agricultural areas has 
generated a spate of speculation about the greenhouse effect a 
situation in which the pollutants of society are trapping heat and 
raising the earths temperature 
in economics the odd convolutions over the past year have 
produced extreme forecasts of boom and bust inflation and 
deflation higher and lower interest rates a new level of 
prosperity and a return to the dirty dusty 1930s 
surveys served up daily show americans on a new level of 
affluence and poverty worse than ever consumers more confident 
than ever and more fearful too jobs going begging but 
unemployment never worse for some people 
in such times it is difficult almost impossible to maintain a 
historical perspective to avoid emotional involvement to keep a 
cold eye on the larger picture to step back a distance from the 
events 
each days statistics are projected beyond eternity and warnings 
issued but the statistics themselves might be revised in the 
meantime it happens all the time to jobless numbers retail sales 
corporate profits and more 
the strongest gusts seem to blow whenever things are not fully 
understood as when the stock market crashed or when an extreme of 
any sort is reached in prices interest rates crop statistics or 
commodity futures 
such events spur speculation and the speculation is good for at 
least a month or so or whenever the newer figures are reported or 
the old ones corrected in turn this sets off additional gusts 
from another quadrant 
in the recent past a newsletter writer howard ruff renamed his 
periodical the ruff times representing his retransformation to a 
bear robert prechter well known stock market optimist now 
preaches despair countless others who posed as bulls now shiver 
amid dismal echoes of the 1930s 
over a longer time frame these are some of the gusts that seem 
to have blown themselves out 
the stock market crash will cause a depression 
the dollar will continue to fall almost freely 
as the economys growth continues a rise of inflation is 
inevitable 
the same factors will push interest rates into the double 
digits 
us manufacturing cannot compete with foreigners 
social security will go broke 
determining which events are winds of economic storms destined 
to grow violent and which are meandering meaningless gusts that 
will spend themselves is a challenge today for ordinary folks and 
those who claim expertise 
winds events and perspective change the farmland drought isnt 
forever and neither perhaps are the big budget and trade 
deficits and other economic problems that have been projected into 
eternity

the biggest thing to hit south pond in 
the 97 years since george kittles grandfather built his camp there 
was the great blowdown of 1950 
it took three men three days to cut their way from the lake to 
the camp with chainsaws kittle recalled in a visit to the mossy 
old cabins 
the hemlocks have grown back tall around kittles rustic camp 
and south pond is much the same as it has been for generations a 
quiet wilderness lake welcoming loons ospreys and occasional 
canoeists 
but that may soon change kittle and others fear south pond and 
the rest of the 6millionacre adirondack park the biggest 
wilderness area east of the mississippi are about to be altered as 
dramatically as they were when that windstorm roared through the 
mountain passes and flattened a forest 
this time however the scars will be permanent 
within a few years canoeists may find condominiums clustered 
along favorite lakes and rivers and hikers may look down from high 
peaks to see the roofs of secondhome subdivisions 
millions of people will come to the adirondacks in the next 
generations said dick beamish a wilderness guide and spokesman 
for the adirondack council a preservation group they will find 
something degraded chopped up through the efforts of big 
developers unless we act quickly to preserve the last of our 
natural legacy 
unlike other parks in the united states which are publicly 
owned the adirondack park is about 40 percent state forest and 60 
percent private land 
the state land called the forest preserve is protected as 
forever wild but 35 million acres of private land are 
interpersed with that including more than 100 hamlets and 
villages yearround residents number 120000 the population 
swells by 90000 each summer 
land values rose and development surged in the late 1960s with 
construction of the adirondack northway a superhighway link 
between new york city and montreal 
by 1971 developers had proposed several 10000lot subdivisions 
in the adirondack outback the plans were scuttled in 1973 with 
creation of the adirondack park agency which controls development 
through some of the strictest zoning regulations in the nation 
conservationists hailed the apas creation but many locals 
denounced it as a blow to development in an economically depressed 
region where the jobless rate is sometimes several times the state 
average 
now it appears the apa might lack the power to prevent profound 
changes in the adirondack landscape 
we are seeing a surge in development said robert glennon 
counsel and acting director of the apa its not just hotels in 
the hamlets the backcountry is being subdivided as well 
developers now familiar with the complex apa law have learned 
to tailor their plans to slip through loopholes glennon said 
especially along the parks coveted crystalline lakes 
for example more than half the parks private land lies within 
the strictest apa zone requiring nearly 43 acres for each 
building yet beamish points out that if a developer leaves enough 
vacant land in the woods hundreds of houses could be clustered 
along a lake front 
it has become apparent that the apa isnt enough to protect 
the park said beamish we could still have halfamillion new 
houses in the adirondacks with that plan 
permit applications increased by more than onethird in 1987 
glennon said the 204 applications received in the first four 
months of this year include plans for townhouses condominiums 
housing developments motels marinas and sewage plants a dozen 
projects would include 30 to 150 housing units each 
much of the development is aimed at villages where apa powers 
are limited and zoning is left to local governments proposals 
include a 250unit hotel and convention complex with 100 condos in 
schroon lake 184 townhouses in speculator where the yearround 
population is 375 and a 95unit development in inlet a hamlet of 
200 
while the hamlets are seeing the most concentrated growth 
preservationists are more concerned about remote sections of the 
adirondacks where timber companies are starting to put tens of 
thousands of forested acres on the market 
thats where the battle really has to be fought if the 
character of the park is to be maintained said george davis a 
leading voice in the preservation movement and thats where the 
big subdividers are going 
the adirondack council has sharply criticized the state 
department of environmental conservations sluggishness in buying 
adirondack land of 250 million allocated in a 1986 bond act for 
land purchases around the state about 2 million has been spent 
for one 14000acre tract in that time a single developer bought 
13000 acres to subdivide said glennon

<TEXT>
robert bathrick director of lands and forests for the 
department countered that purchase time had been cut in half by 
streamlining the process but added well never be in the same 
position as private developers 
the adirondack council has identified about 300000 acres it 
says the state should buy or acquire easements on to consolidate 
fragmented wilderness areas and preserve panoramic vistas 
some preservationists fearing the state cannot compete with 
developers are looking for other ways to save the adirondacks 
i never thought id see the day when id go talk to a 
developer said davis but now ive begun to think thats the 
way well save the adirondack park along with getting the state 
to buy more land 
davis as apa staff ecologist and planning director helped 
draft the zoning plan and later worked as program director for the 
adirondack council now he is an independent consultant for the 
council and its spinoff organization the adirondack land trust a 
nonprofit group that preserves private land by holding 
conservation easements 
instead of trying to stop development davis is trying to get 
developers to tailor their projects to harmonize with the 
environment he is pleased by the response especially from patten 
corp whose aggressive subdividing angered wilderness advocates in 
new england and new yorks catskill mountains a few years ago 
we were ready to do battle when patten came up here two years 
ago said davis but the fellow who heads their adirondack 
office dan christmas is working in a way that takes into account 
the fact that this is a park hes talking to environmental groups 
and backing off or making changes in sensitive areas 
last fall patten gave the adirondack land trust a conservation 
easement protecting 322 acres along the oswegatchie river a 
popular canoe route although the apa map would allow 38 homes 
patten agreed to restrict future development to 19 homes 
kittle has turned to the adirondack council in hopes of 
persuading a developer on south pond to make similar concessions 
the milelong lake is surrounded by state forest and a few 
private tracts including one house and three camps 
kittle a retired schoolteacher who lives in connecticut has 
been coming to south pond since he was a child the camp his 
grandfather built in 1891 is a collection of oneroom cabins with 
no electricity no plumbing no phone no road kittle paddles out 
there in a canoe just big enough for him and his dog to spend a 
quiet week or two 
now hes afraid south pond wont be so quiet any more the 
finchpruyn paper co recently won town board approval for a 
subdivision with 14 150foot lots clustered across the lake from 
kittles camp 
the adirondack council wrote to finchpruyn hoping to convince 
the company it should revise its plans 
usually were on the side of preserving not developing 
said beamish but in this case we feel the salvation of that 
lake will be if the developer does it right 
rj carota president of finchpruyn said the company was 
considering the suggestions 
the zoning law would let us put in 14 lots but the adirondack 
council says five lots set back further with trees left along the 
lakefront would be better carota said that seems reasonable 
to us as it stands we have no immediate plans to proceed with any 
development 
im not opposed to development said kittle gazing over the 
lake as a misty rain obscured the opposite shore i think its 
inevitable but it has to be done in a sensitive way 
we have to ask whats going to happen to the loons and the 
osprey the deer and the beaver when all these houses are built 
are we going to destroy the very thing that weve worked so hard to 
preserve

director ingmar bergman is turning 70 
having reached what he calls the twilight of his career but basking 
in a run of theater successes 
bergman is quietly celebrating his july 14 birthday at his 
retreat at faro a rugged island of beaches and pine trees in the 
baltic sea with some of his eight children and his fifth wife 
ingrid 
associates describe his health as good although he suffers from 
a painful hip but gote eriksson planning director of the royal 
dramatic theater said bergman was in good form at the premier 
of his latest play in april and postponed a hip operation which 
had been scheuled for may 
bergman whose films probed emotions and relationships rarely 
touched by others says he has made his last movie that was his 
1982 triumph fanny and alexander which won four academy awards 
but he is hardly slowing down and has theater productions 
scheduled in sweden until 1991 
in april he scored a critical and box office sensation with his 
stage production of eugene oneills long days journey into 
night his autobiography lanterna magica was a swedish 
bestseller when it was published last year 
his swedishlanguage production of hamlet put in a modern 
setting was panned by some critics here but was a sensation in 
florence italy and won a critics prize last year in london it 
played in new york in may 
hamlet is on the top 10 list of really good performances 
bergman said in a radio interview it is the best i can do which 
means that i have reached quite far with it 
his next directing project will be shakespeares a winters 
tale at stockholms 200yearold royal dramatic theater 
bergman was not always the cultural hero in sweden that he is 
today his volcanic temper didnt help 
he used to refer to anyone who didnt throw furniture around 
as inhibited says gunnel lindblom one of his leading ladies 
in 1969 he was fined heavily for hitting a theater critic known 
for his sharp reviews 
and it was worth it bergman said 
today he says the critics dont bother him as much 
i dont even get angry he said in the radio interview of 
course when you were young you took it very hard and were very 
hurt but not after 45 years 
now he says everybody is very kind to me i suppose it 
is because i have become old and harmless 
his many love affairs often with women starring in his films 
drew more attention in sweden than his art but his latest marriage 
his fifth has lasted since the early 1970s 
in his memoirs he regrets what he describes as his earlier 
fickleness and attributes it to sexual obsession 
there were very many years of my life when i was so occupied 
with what i was doing that i forgot wives and children now since i 
am older it has been very nice and rewarding to get to know my 
children he said 
bergman was swedens youngest theater director at 26 when he was 
put in charge of the provincial helsingborg city theater in 
southern sweden the theatrical tradition he says has always been 
the real influence on his art 
he is best known for directing more than 50 films most of which 
he wrote himself he won three oscars for best foreign films the 
virgin spring in 1960 through a glass darkly in 1962 and 
fanny and alexander 
to mark the birthday the swedish film institute published a 
special englishlanguage edition of its magazine chaplin paying 
homage to the director who made his first film in 1944 and who 
launched the careers of such international stars as liv ulmann 
bibi andersson and max von sydow 
bergman is probably the greatest film artist all things 
considered since the invention of the motionpicture camera 
wrote woody allen one of a dozen international directors 
contributing to the 90page tribute 
sir richard attenborough the british director said bergman 
extended the medium of film in a manner unequalled by any of 
his contemporaries 
for some four decades bergman divided his time between theater 
and film likening the two forums to my wife and my mistress 
after fanny and alexander he said he was giving up his 
mistress and devoting himself to the stage since then he 
produced only one swedish television film in 1984 after the 
repetition 
fanny and alexander was a multilevelled story of a 
welltodo family at the turn of the century which appeared to 
have traces of bergmans own childhood with his clergyman father 
the film marked bergmans return to sweden after six years in 
selfimposed exile in west germany in 1976 he was hauled away by 
police during a rehearsal and accused of tax violations he was 
cleared but left the country in disgust 
he is now back at the royal dramatic theater where he saw his 
first play at the age of 12 and where he was the director from 1963 
to 1966

his baseball team is beating up on the 
new york yankees his classic car collection is growing and his 
quickdelivery pizza empire is pushing a billion dollars in annual 
sales 
to say that all is right in thomas s monaghans world these 
days is a bit of an understatement 
the 51yearold monaghan listed by forbes magazine as one of 
the 400 richest americans is a man of many passions and the money 
to pursue them thanks mainly to his pizza 
dominos pizza inc billed as the worlds largest pizza 
delivery company has grown from one ypsilanti pizza store in 1960 
to a 4279store operation with 8838 million in revenues last 
year 
monaghans share of the operation estimated by forbes at about 
300 million has given the onetime seminary student the dough to 
live out several of his youthful fantasies 
he never became an architect but the influence of his idol 
frank lloyd wright is apparent in the buildings at dominos 
300acre headquarters complex 
he wanted to be a baseball shortstop when he was a kid now he 
owns a team the detroit tigers that was leading the american 
leagues east division at midseason and boasts the leagues 
allstar shortstop alan trammell 
his devotion to architect wright also extends to a collection 
of classic cars two of which were once owned by wright in 
addition monaghan collects wrightdesigned furniture the crown 
jewel of which is a dining table and chairs purchased for 16 
million 
monaghan is even starting his own subdivision on the outskirts 
of ann arbor with a robert trent jones golf course and a 
requirement that houses be designed by architects from a list of 30 
drawn up for him by a panel of architectural experts 
the first house for himself wife marjorie and their four 
daughters will appropriately contain the very best of 
everything he says 
no regrets he said of his decision to pursue pizza over 
architecture some 30 years ago i think its more fun being a 
client a patron its a hobby rather than a vocation 
monaghans success has allowed him to do and buy almost 
anything he reportedly spent 53 million to buy the tigers in 
1983 and his car collection includes an 81 million bugatti 
royale among other gems 
it was the best car in the world he said it was in the 
rose bowl parade with gregory peck riding in it 
somehow he finds the time to keep expanding dominos the 
nations secondlargest pizza company after pizza hut and the 
largest delivery operation 
it all started when he and his brother james borrowed 500 to 
buy the little ypsilanti outfit still a freshman in college 
thomas soon decided to quit school and traded a volkswagen for his 
brothers share of the business the expansion began almost 
immediately 
dominos opens about 50 stores a month in the united states and 
eight foreign countries monaghan says sales are 7 percent ahead of 
last year and dominos accounts for half the pizzas delivered in 
the country 
despite the owners fancy tastes business at dominos stays 
pretty basic 
its the same old operation pizza only monaghan said 
but there are innovations such as mystery customers the 
company pays more than 8000 people two per store to 
anonymously buy a pizza a month and file detailed reports on the 
pizzas and the delivery service which is promised in 30 minutes 
from the time the order is taken 
many stores offer 3 off if the pizza is late 
with thousands of drivers delivering pizza to all kinds of areas 
day and night the business has its problems the biggest is 
security followed closely by driver safety 
the company has established a security force based in its 13 
regional offices that pursues investigations when company stores 
or drivers are robbed 
monaghan insists that speeding delivery drivers are not a 
problem contrary to some legal claims accusing them of causing 
accidents he said people tend to sue the company because of its 
deep pockets 
i found out when i first got in the business that driving over 
the speed limit doesnt help you get the pizzas there any faster 
youre just stepping on the gas and putting on the brakes at the 
next light he said 
dominos has its challengers such as companies promoting 
hamburger delivery but monaghan has already tried and given up on 
that idea 
its too small a ticket item for one thing and theres too 
much variety every orders different i just dont think you can 
do it profitably he said 
monaghan has learned many lessons the hard way he grew up as a 
foster child and was tossed out of seminary school in grand rapids 
for bad behavior 
they kicked me out of 10th grade for mischievousness they 
told me i didnt have a vocation he said 
he later went to live with an aunt in ann arbor graduated from 
st thomas high school there and enrolled briefly in ferris state 
college before leaving to join the marines after his time in the 
service he returned to ann arbor and enrolled in the university of 
michigan for a short time 
his hardknocks upbringing perhaps inspires some of the 
straightlaced rules at dominos which in addition to cracking 
down on the speed limit also requires male employees to keep their 
hair cut above the collar 
and monaghans religious roots still provide spiritual balance 
for his own fastlane approach to life he was instrumental in 
founding a growing international group of catholic corporate chief 
executives with at least 50 employees and 4 million in annual 
sales 
legatus latin for ambassador holds meetings that feature a 
dinner a speaker and a mass 
the purpose is to have the members be better catholics and 
more ethical business people said monaghan hinting at the 
strains of his considerable ambition 
the businessman who has a sizeable organization and hes the 
head of it he has a lot of unique problems and a certain kind of 
loneliness

elevating a woman to the office of bishop in the 
worldwide anglican communion would write a new page in christian 
history and it also could set off a religious storm 
both possibilities were in mind as anglican bishops including 
those of the us episcopal church gathered for the opening 
saturday of their onceadecade lambeth conference in canterbury 
england 
it is the global consultative forum for anglican leaders and 
while it has no direct legislative powers it has been strongly 
influential for that international body of 70 million christians 
among its 430 bishops from 28 regional and national branches 
including the us there are no women and none has ever been 
brought into that male line traced back 2000 years to the time of 
the apostles 
that historic succession also is maintained by roman catholicism 
and eastern orthodoxy which also reserve their priesthood to 
males protestant churches with bishops do not claim that ancient 
lineage 
several branches of the anglican communion now admit women to 
the priesthood and the prospect has arisen that they may soon 
somewhere gain election as bishop 
that has exacerbated an already tense issue 
the most rev robert runcie archbishop of canterbury and 
spiritual leader of the worldwide communion who will preside at 
the three week conference lasting to aug 7 has said 
until there is a decisive ecumenical christian answer to this 
question there will inevitably be the risk of broken or at least 
impaired communion between provinces of the anglican communion 
women have been admitted to the anglican priesthood in nine 
branches including the united states where there now are more 
than 900 women episcopal priests 
other branches ordaining women are canada new zealand hong 
kong brazil kenya cuba uganda and northern india but theyre 
still barred from the priesthood in the other 19 branches 
including the mother church of england 
consequently womens ordination itself remains a divisive 
issue rejected in much of the communion accepted elsewhere but 
the developing possibility of women bishops accentuated the 
conflict 
in several us dioceses recently choosing new bishops women 
have been among the nominees but havent won election if and when 
it happens us bishops have said they would uphold it 
but another ominous sort of note has come from some other 
bishops 
in an ash wednesday manifesto last february 54 anglican 
bishops including four active bishops in the united states 
declared that ordaining women as bishops could wreck the anglican 
communion 
a grave situation has already been created by ordination of 
women in some parts of the church preventing full mutual 
recognition and causing some schisms the statement said adding 
if women are ordained to the episcopate as bishops we do not 
see how that can do other than call in question the continuance of 
the anglican communion 
the manifesto published in newspaper ads around the country 
over the last six months emphasized the historic tradition of a 
male priesthood and with the upcoming lambeth conference in mind 
said 
both for the preservation of a commonly accepted ministry in 
thge anglican communion and for the wider unity of the church it 
is essential that the introduction of any major innovation be in 
accordance with the judgment of scripture and have a clear 
ecumenical consensus 
on the other side of the issue 141 anglican bishops issued a 
pentecost message last may declaring 
we believe that the ordination of women to all three orders of 
bishop priest and deacon is right 
men and women are created in the image of god and are baptized 
into equal and full membership of the body of christ the ordained 
ministry should be a sign of this fundamental truth 
the statement says womens ordination is vital to the mission 
of the church and a natural development for the churchs 
ministry 
while the lambeth conference lacks legisative power to lay down 
the law on the matter the status of women in the ministry was 
expected to get major attention with an attempt at some joint 
policy about it

demanded but a firm dedication to undergird and support 
international efforts under united nations auspices to achieve a 
peaceful lasting resolution of this war

democrats are favored to seize control of governors mansions in 
utah and indiana and are in close contests with gop incumbents in 
north carolina and west virginia as 12 states hold elections for 
their top office this year 
taxes and the economy dominate the campaign agenda in many of 
the states 
nationally the gubernatorial lineup is 27 democrats and 23 
republicans the roster established april 4 when democrat rose 
mofford automatically became governor of arizona upon the 
impeachment conviction of republican evan mecham 
incumbents will be on the ballot in nine of the 12 states with 
three of four democrats and six of eight republicans seeking 
reelection republican robert orr of indiana is barred from a 
third term and democrat ted schwinden of montana and republican 
john sununu of new hampshire are retiring 
another democratic governor may leave office at the end of the 
year michael dukakis of massachusetts who is his partys likely 
nominee for president should he win the election he would be 
succeeded by democratic lt gov evelyn murphy who would serve 
until his term expires in 1990 
the other states holding gubernatorial elections are delaware 
missouri north dakota rhode island washington and vermont 
the incumbent in most trouble is republican gov norm bangerter 
of utah whose bid for a second fouryear term is in grave danger 
despite a 2to1 gop edge in registration a recent poll had him 
trailing democrat ted wilson former mayor of salt lake city by 23 
points 
bangerters popularity plummeted after he prodded the 
legislature last year into passing a 166 million tax increase the 
biggest in utah history 
his problems have been deepened by the weak economy the failure 
of five savings institutions and the drought that made a mockery of 
his decision to spend 60 million to pump floodwaters from the 
great salt lake 
i believe its winnable but the governor has got to get his 
case to the people his record and what hes done its a good 
case but we may have passed the point in time where we could 
salvage the election said former gop state chairman charles 
akerlow 
another republican in some jeopardy is jim martin of north 
carolina only the second gop governor in the state this century 
he is locked in a close and colorful race with democratic lt gov 
bob jordan 
in a poll taken april 2326 by mason dixon opinion research inc 
and published by the greensboro news amp record martin was favored 
by 47 percent of the voters and jordan by 39 percent with 14 
percent undecided but after the may 3 primary a charlotte 
observer poll taken may 1826 showed jordan supported by 47 percent 
and martin supported by 46 percent 
martin has accused jordan of having a hidden agenda citing 
a jordan speech in which he told black newspaper executives that he 
agreed with them on some issues he would not discuss publicly for 
fear of alienating rednecks 
at a debate last month martin told an audience he wanted their 
votes regardless of your race creed or the color of your neck 
jordan a businessman and fourterm state senator has labeled 
martin the sitting governor with no comprehensive program 
democratic leaders playing on the theme last year sent martin a 
seat cushion for christmas 
with orr retiring in indiana democratic secretary of state evan 
bayh is hoping to capitalize on his famous name to defeat gop lt 
gov john m mutz 
both campaigns said polls give the 32yearold son of former 
us sen birch e bayh a lead of nearly 10 points but bayh 
predicted a tight race democrats win in indiana if at all by 
relatively small margins he said 
mutz who at 52 has almost 21 years of government experience 
has made bayhs youth and relative inexperience a central issue 
in west virginia republican arch moore faces a stiff challenge 
from insurance executive gaston caperton a political novice who 
spent more than 2 million mostly his own money to win a bitter 
sevenway democratic primary 
the combative 65yearold moore is serving an unprecedented 
third fouryear term he was governor from 1969 to 77 democrats 
outnumber republicans 2to1 
coal glass oil gas and steel backbone industries in west 
virginia are in a slump the legislature had to borrow 80 million 
this year to keep the state afloat and west virginia has one of 
the highest unemployment rates in the nation 
at 48 caperton advances himself as a new face with a 
businessoriented approach to government 
i think its going to be very close said priscilla haden 
moore campaign chairman were in a democratic state i think 
quite frankly the primary showed some definite antiarch moore vote 
out there 
here is a brief look at the other races 
delaware republican gov michael n castle faces lawyer and 
environmentalist jacob kreshtool a wry 69yearold who in getting 
the democratic nod admitted he has not been an active party member 
has no money and no staff 
missouri republican gov john ashcroft holds a commanding lead 
in fundraising and in the polls over state rep betty hearnes the 
likely democratic nominee her husband warren hearnes was 
governor from 1965 to 73 according tocampaign finance reports 
filed in june ashcroft had raised 24 million to mrs hearnes 
321000 of missourians contacted in one recent poll 60 percent 
favored ashcroft and 29 percent mrs hearnes 
montana democrat thomas judge is attempting a comeback in a 
campaign focusing on how to ignite a boom in the state which is 
beset by a slump in the farm and energy sectors judge governor 
from 1973 to 81 faces republican stan stephens a 16year member 
of the state senate the early gop favorite secretary of state jim 
waltermire was killed in a plane crash two months before the 
primary 
new hampshire democrat paul mceachern a lawyer and a fierce 
opponent of the stalled seabrook nuclear plant who nearly rode the 
issue to the statehouse against sununu two years ago is making 
another bid judd gregg a fourterm congressman whose father hugh 
gregg was governor from 1953 to 55 is considered the clear 
choice for the gop nomination by many top republicans 
north dakota democratic gov george sinner is heavily favored 
to win a second term over real estate broker leon mallberg despite 
a depressed economy and his advocacy of new taxes prompted by low 
oil and commodity prices 
rhode island twoterm republican gov edward d diprete holds a 
commanding lead against democrat bruce g sundlun who lost to 
diprete by a 2to1 margin in 1986 sundlun chairman of a company 
that owns several tv and radio stations has never held elective 
office 
vermont madeleine kunin the states first woman governor is 
favored to win a third twoyear term against house gop leader 
michael bernhardt who accuses her of taxing and spending too much 
and pursuing an agenda giving the state too much authority kunin 
has been helped by a rosy state economy unemployment is at a 
record low while the state has just generated two record 
surpluses each 60 million allowing her to earmark 20 million 
for land conservation and 75 million for a dairy subsidy 
washington democratic gov booth gardner a millionaire former 
businessman is strongly favored to win a second fouryear term he

the dream of home ownership which once 
seemed almost a right to most californians is slipping ever 
farther from firsttime buyers as prices explode far beyond the 
limits of the average pocketbook 
the states desirable climate and strong economy have long 
pushed housing demand and prices ahead of the national average but 
nowadays wouldbe home buyers are finding it difficult to come up 
with even a down payment 
statistics show why the median cost of a california home 
reached 160073 in may nearly double the national median of 
88600 and 134 percent higher than the median california home 
price a year ago 
just 28 percent of the states households could afford that 
averagepriced home in may according to figures provided by the 
california association of realtors nationally 48 percent of 
households can afford the median level home 
we really want to be in a house this year and were going to 
go into debt to our ears to do it said tim dressendorfer a 
locksmith who once thought he and his wife could find a reasonable 
starter home for 150000 in the long beach area 
after six months they are still searching and are now 
considering taking out a variableinterest loan rather than a 
fixedrate mortgage so they can borrow more money 
the latest state realtors figures show orange county with the 
highest median home price tag in the state 202760 the average 
30year mortgage with a 20percent down payment on that house would 
require monthly payments of 1565 the trade group says 
even in affluent orange county only 22 percent of households 
earn the 62611 a year needed to qualify for such a mortgage 
its just so hard to save as much money as you need so your 
payments arent ridiculous said michelle st john 26 who rents 
a home in riverside with her husband judd 
many people sacrifice typically with a longer commute 
commonly two to four hours round trip in the los angeles area to a 
home in distant suburbs where prices are lower 
the old option of asking mom and dad for help has been 
supplemented these days by brokers who match investors with 
potential home buyers who need a down payment the young couple 
live in the house and share the home title with their equity 
partner who shares any resale profits 
just how fast are prices rising in recent months buyers of 
homes in desirable sections and suburbs of los angeles have found 
themselves in bidding wars for their dream houses paying far above 
listed price 
carl mcmahan a 34yearold downtown los angeles lawyer put a 
349000 bid on a home near pasadenas rose bowl only to be outbid 
at 369000 40000 above the asking price the home was on the 
market only five hours 
mcmahan who grew up in fresno joked if i went to fresno and 
bought a home for 350000 they would name a street after me 
competition for homes is so fierce that customers frequently 
camp out in front of sales offices at new developments sleeping in 
motorhomes and cars sometimes for weeks to be among the first in 
line when sales open 
when pardee construction co recently opened phase 3 of its san 
remo tract in san diego 400 people were on the waiting list for 23 
homes priced at 198000 to 247000 
the states slowgrowth movement only adds to the dwindling 
supply of homes as the states swelling population pushes along 
demand 
many real estate brokers and economists warn that hard times for 
firsttime home buyers eventually will breed trouble throughout the 
states economy as a generation matures without the security of 
home ownership 
the only weakness in the market is the entry level and the 
entry level is absolutely crucial to the marketplace and to the 
longterm health of the state of california said joel singer 
chief economist for the california association of realtors 
i cant tell you how concerned we are about this he said 
its a very tough battle 
you talk to any psychologist and hell tell you people want 
food clothing and shelter said ira gribin of encino incoming 
president of the national association of realtors 
like many in the industry gribin believes the government should 
subsidize housing 
help is being considered sen alan cranston dcalif is 
working with sen alfonse damato rny on a national housing 
policy that would among other provisions allow money saved for a 
home down payment to be tax deductible 
in the california legislature sen marian bergeson has 
introduced a bill that would award lucrative state grants to cities 
whose plans encourage the building of affordable homes 
a study of 61 metropolitan areas by the national association of 
realtors found four california locations among the 10 most 
expensive areas for home buying in the first three months of 1988 
behind honolulu and new york came the northern orange county 
area of santa ana and anaheim ranking third with a median home 
price of 183380 for the first quarter followed by san francisco 
with 178800 los angeles was eighth at 159900 san diego ninth 
with 134400 
the riversidesan bernardino area considered affordable by 
ca parents were lincoln 
county residents but gave no further identification 
hospital officials declined to comment on whether the case might 
be related to an attempted abduction sunday of another baby born at 
the hospital but police said they suspected a connection between 
the cases 
in that case a woman told state police that after she delivered 
her baby she received a visit from a woman who told her she had 
recently lost a newborn baby the mother told state police the 
woman showed up later at her home in mingo county with a gift for 
the baby 
once inside police said the woman was allowed to hold the 
baby then brandished a knife and threatened to take the infant 
state police said the intruder fled when another person walked into 
the room

toyota made some additions to its camry line this 
model year but thank goodness the automaker didnt tamper with the 
camrys solid quality feel 
the test car a 1988 camry deluxe v6 sedan showed that even 
with a new powerplant the camry preserves its admirable 
reputation in a 1987 survey by the california research firm jd 
power amp associates the camry was rated no 1 in customer 
satisfaction in its market segment 
the survey was based on responses from owners of 1986 camry 
models in addition motor trend magazine gave the camry high marks 
last year saying in part what we loved best about the camry was 
the quality feel solid and wellengineered 
consumer reports also rated the car highly a survey showed 
198486 models performed much better than average when comparing 
repair reports the magazine also noted the camry has been one of 
our top compacts for several years 
that helps explain sales of 186633 camry cars last year up 23 
percent from 1986s 151767 toyota notes that 66 percent of us 
camry buyers choose the car for its dependability 
company spokesman edd snyder said toyota had no projections for 
1988 but the automaker has built a plant in georgetown ky to 
produce camry cars the first kentucky camry rolled off the line in 
may regular production starts this summer with 20000 expected to 
be built this calendar year the plants capacity however is 
200000 vehicles annually 
since their introduction in the 1983 model year camry models 
have been imported from japan buyers median age is 43 with 
median annual income of 48000 the auto company says 
seventysix percent of camry buyers are married 60 percent are 
college graduates and 58 percent are in managerial or other 
professional occupations according to toyota japans largest 
carmaker 
fiftyone percent of the buyers are male 
for 1988 toyota has added an optional v6 engine as well as an 
allwheeldrive model the lowestpriced camry starts at about 
11000 and has neither of those features 
toyota says among the camrys major competitors is the ford 
taurus which also comes with an optional v6 engine and is priced 
about the same as the camry deluxe v6 sedan 1500016000 when 
the same features are added in 
another competitor is the honda accord which resembles the 
camry on the outside except the camry does not have retractable 
headlights 
the 1988 camry deluxe v6 sedan test car was comfortable and 
comforting it was easy to slip into and drive off in there was 
nothing really surprising 
instead the ride just confirmed the camrys reputation as a 
solid pleasant allaround car the dashboard gauges were large 
and easy to read the suspension was stable but also afforded a 
cushioned ride 
the engine the first fourcamshaft 24valve v6 mounted 
transversely in a frontdrive car was superb especially in 
overdrive a driver could turn on the overdrive with a button on 
the gear selector and thereby boost fuel economy and get a 
smoother quiet ride 
the test car had a fourspeed automatic transmission cloth 
upholstery was neatly styled fit and finish outside was just as 
pleasing 
the trunk was spacious while the rear seats might be snug for 
three fullsized adults leg room in the back was adequate if the 
front seat was up nearly all the way and ok to cramped if the front 
seat was back all the way 
there was a pullout twocup holder below the frontseat ashtray 
that was a thoughtful touch the driver also could lock all the 
doors and turn off the power windows with switches on the driver 
door arm rest 
the only part of the camry that took some getting used to was 
the automatic shoulder belt system after a driver enters the car 
shuts the door and turns on the ignition the front seat shoulder 
belts automatically follow a track across the door and move to the 
body the belts allow free movement but retractors lock the belts 
automatically in a sudden stop or impact the belts also move back 
away from the body when the door is opened 
i got hung up in the belts a few times until i got used to 
them my purse got hung up among the belts a few more times and 
because of my size 5feet4 the belt rested annoyingly against 
my neck i pulled it down a bit to move it to a better position 
and even with the automatic shoulder belts front seat passengers 
have to manually put on their lap belts 
another problem in the camry also may have to do with my size i 
moved the driver seat up a ways to comfortably reach the pedals 
but then the remote trunk release and fuel filler door release 
buttons were nearly under the driver seat and difficult to reach 
still those are small complaints for an otherwise 
wellthoughtout pleasant car that seemed easy to live with

its the best medium for an actress who wants to have a family the 
hours for a primetime show are horrendous i wouldnt want to be 
running around the world on location i usually dont go in until 
noon im usually through by 6 oclock it works out very good for 
me 
although the soap has about 25 regular characters the main 
storyline follows nikki and her husband the story began about 2

shows as my three sons and ironside at 8 she played tippi 
hedrens daughter in marnie she was a regular on the tammy

it 
when she was in junior high school she read in a trade paper 
that director don siegel was looking for a chubby little girl 
to appear with clint eastwood and geraldine page in the 
beguiled she stuffed herself to gain weight then rented a civil 
war costume and auditioned for siegel she got the role and later

and put her in the movie 
she was also in posse with kirk douglas and such tv movies 
and miniseries as studs lonigan moviola and secrets 
she had a recurring role on the waltons 
scott appeared with john wayne in his last movie the 
shootist

fifteen years ago a young physically leaner 
spiritually meaner jesse louis jackson told a black audience his 
perception of a harsh truth i would not run for president of the 
united states he said because white people are incapable of 
appreciating me 
it was a statement that spoke volumes if not about the state of 
race relations at the time about the state of jesse jackson and 
what drove this selfstyled country preacher and prodigal 
lieutenant of the late martin luther king jr to change his mind 
now even in defeat he ranks as perhaps the most electrifying 
presidential candidate since robert f kennedy 
burning within him by the account of relatives childhood 
friends and not a few enemies is a nearly lifelong fear of 
rejection and thus an obsessive urge to test his worthiness some 
think it was borne only partly by the bitter shock of racial 
bigotry in his native greenville sc and perhaps more profoundly 
by his vivid memory of childhood taunts from white and black kids 
alike jessee aint got no daddee jessee aint got no 
daddee 
white america jackson acknowledges has matured since he 
uttered his cynical appraisal in 1973 of political and racial 
reality but so has jesse jackson step by tentative painful step 
from turtlenecks and bellbottoms to christian dior and pinstripes 
from street poetry in new york to delicate diplomacy in syria from 
the embrace of fidel castro to the tearful cradling of a young 
quadriplegic girl who cheered him in an allwhite community in 
oregon 
four years ago as others still insisted that no black could win 
the white house and especially not a black preacher with no prior 
political experience jackson claimed even in his most private 
candid moments that he could his formula was a rainbow 
coalition of new black voters in the south other minorities 
women of all races white liberals unemployed bluecollar workers 
and depressed farmers 
the rainbow never materialized and in 1984 jackson finished a 
distant third behind walter mondale and gary hart for the 
democratic nomination rarely pulling more than 3 percent of the 
white vote in any state even so it was the mst dramatic showing 
by any black in the history of presidential politics and all the 
more remarkable in light of his own misadventures 
he had his triumphs in that campaign to be sure not the least 
his mushrooming success in leading young people by the sheer power 
of his oratory from the temptation of drugs he negotiated the 
release from syria of navy lt robert goodman shot down in a raid 
over lebanon he enrolled upwards of 2 million new democratic 
voters making the difference by some accounts in the partys 
recapture of the senate in 1986 
but jacksons campaign organization was a shambles largely the 
result of his scattershot impulsive scheduling and his refusal to 
delegate authority raising questions about his ability to run a 
government and rekindling criticism of the administrative 
irregularities which marked his stewardship of earlier enterprises 
particularly operation push his chicagobased civil rights 
organization 
worse jackson alienated party professionals by whining about 
the delegateselection rules hinting as he often has when 
something goes against him that they were designed to shut him out 
because of race he infuriated americans jews by making a crack 
about hymies and hymietown and by his lessthandamning 
response to the behavior of campaign supporter louis farrakhan the 
black moslem leader who called adolf hitler wickedly great 
humbled by those mistakes though slow to admit them publicly 
jackson brought tears to the eyes of democratic convention 
delegates in san francisco in the 1984 when he intoned 
if in my low moments in word deed or attitude through some 
error of temper taste or tone i have caused anyone discomfort 
created pain or revived someones fears that was not my truest 
self i am not a perfect servant i am a public servant doing my 
best against the odds as i develop and serve be patient god is 
not finished with me yet 
he promised himself and his campaign loyalists that things 
would be different this year that he would be a positive force for 
the party that he would share authority with his staff and remain 
on the high road of human tolerance 
he has done all that winning high marks from even his 
staunchest opponents for grace on the campaign trail the effort 
was no more apparent than when jackson refused to be drawn into a 
bloodletting with new york mayor ed koch who endorsed sen albert 
gore jr of tennessee and declared jews would be crazy to vote 
for jackson 
for all his determination to give the country a more mature 
less contentious candidate this time jackson himself had no idea 
until a bitterly cold night in remotest iowa just how different 
things would be 
it was the night of the 1987 super bowl giants versus the 
broncos jackson was unhappy he figured everybody was settled in 
for the game so why was he being driven to greenfield 50 miles 
southwest of des moines in 15degree weather for a church 
appearance that surely should never have been scheduled 
on the edge of town jackson was dozing when the county sheriff 
stopped the car and shined his flashlight into jacksons face 
theyre here theyre here the officer shouted jackson was 
baffled the officer pointed to the cars parked at the side of the 
road more than a mile from the church an overflow crowd of 800 
people nearly all of them white had turned out 
it was a start of a new relationship with white america for 
jesse jackson one that took him from the coalmining hollows of 
kentucky to the coast of maine to the poolside chic of beverly 
hills to selma ala where the mayor acknowledged that he stood on 
the wrong side of the edmund pettus bridge on that bloody sunday 23 
years earlier and jackson could agree that it was time to forgive 
each other redeem each other and move on 
he would not sweep their votes but he made new friends reached 
new understandings he won half a dozen southern primaries 
caucuses in michigan and several other states and finished a 
respectable second in others including lilywhite maine vermont 
and minnesota not enough to wrest the nomination from 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis but enough to make himself the 
second strongest force to be reckoned with in the party enough to 
suggest though not demand that he be picked for the vice 
presidency 
with the presidential fight clearly over and the vice presidency 
out of his grasp jackson still stood proud and defiant 
i was born against the odds i survived against the odds 
im an oddsbreaker and a dreammaker and i will never surrender

certainly he was the most exciting candidate and the most 
enigmatic here was a fellow who has never held public office 
running for president never served in the military running for 
president a minister of the poor preaching the life of christ 
wearing designer suits pocketing a sixfigure income from 
appearance fees flying about in executive jets staying at the 
best hotels missing vast amounts of time from family yet 
sactifying family life and values an advocate of school busing and 
federal aid to public schools but who sent one son to one of the 
most exclusive private schools in washington a street poet who 
depending on the audience speaks ghetto gospel or ivy league 
like another powerful communicator ronald reagan jackson 
cloaks his ideas in anecdotes and aphorisms and has no trouble 
getting them on page 1 or the 6 oclock news some think there is 
more entertainer than intellectual in his rhymeandmime wizardry 
but he has an inventive mind and quickly synthesizes facts and 
figures then he smiles ive got to jesseize it 
thus a pitch for universal health insurance and day care comes 
out better day care and health care on the front side of life 
than jail care and welfare on the back side 
his agenda derives from three social movements civil rights 
peace and populism to which he adds as a preacher a strong dash 
of moralism on the subject of drugs and selfresponsibility a 
thousand times probably more he has brought audiences black and 
white to their feet by thundering 
brown black and white 
were all precious in gods sight 
i am somebody 
i am somebody 
the tone is one of moving on he says the era of racial violence 
has ended that now it is time to end economic violence and 
poverty he emphasizes comes in all colors to a group of 
distressed white farmers in the south he says to a roar of 
laughter and approval my friends when they foreclose on your 
farm and turn the lights out we all look amazingly alike in the 
dark 
it was only four years ago that jackson spun a different tune 
when he told audiences about what it was like growing up black in 
the south saturdays id sell peanuts and soft drinks at the 
stadium whites all around drinking liquor theyd say all kinds 
of vulgar things call me nigger try to shortchange me 
couldnt go to the front at the movies couldnt use the bathrooms 
it was humiliating 
and jacksons comfort or lack of it with whites has long 
been a source of concern with other black leaders including his 
mentor martin luther king even after king quickly elevated the 
bright young man who left theological school to join the southern 
christian leadership conference he didnt want jesse negotiating 
for him with white leaders giving that assignment instead to 
andrew young now mayor of atlanta 
to this day other black leaders from the sclc ranks regard 
jackson with some suspicion king himself complained about 
jacksons ego and at least once blew up over it in front of others 
at the root at least in part of jacksons problem with a 
number of other black leaders is the curious story he repeated time 
and again in the immediate wake of kings assassination perceived 
as an opportunistic and cynical attempt to leap over others to 
claim kings mantel 
after king was gunned down on the balcony of the lorraine motel 
in memphis in april 1968 jackson told reporters waiting at the 
hospital that he was the last man that king had talked to some 
reporters said that jackson also claimed he cradled the dying king 
in his arms that so incensed another king lieutenant hosea 
williams that williams physically attacked jackson on the hospital 
grounds i just jumped on jess because he was telling lies 
williams recalled in 1983 
making matters worse jackson left for chicago the night of the 
assassination wearing a turtleneck shirt stained with blood he 
told television viewers the blood was kings moreover he wore the 
same shirt for two more days and repeated the story on network 
interviews according to williams young and ralph david 
abernathy the story just wasnt true jesse was not on the 
balcony said young 
jackson now acknowledges he was not on the balcony and denies 
ever telling anyone differently as for being the last person to 
speak to king jackson says i was he was talking to me in the 
courtyard 
the harsh view is that he was and is a charlatan in pastors 
robes driven by ego flitting from one brushfire to another only 
long enough to get his face on the camera again even in high 
school his french teacher xanthene norris constantly lectured 
him about being an i person always an i person i am 
somebody thats jesse she said 
at the chicago theological seminary jackson nearly flunked 
preaching of all things because he wouldnt bother to write out 
his sermons in advance as the course required thats jesse 
said the rev victor obenhaus a retired professor who was 
jacksons faculty adviser 
but anyone who believes jacksons sole interest is 
selfaggrandizement likely hasnt spent much time with him his 
pace is simply too grueling takes him to too many backwaters too 
many slums and through too many sleepless nights to be explained 
away by ego alone he has the trait for sickle cell anemia yet 
pushes himself to the point that he has been hospitalized at least 
half a dozen times for exhaustion 
so what drives jesse jackson some say it is a true messianic 
fervor for the poor the minorities the locked out and some 
say it is a long underlying fear that he still isnt accepted 
being born out of wedlock bothered him disproportionatly to the 
way it did anyone else we grew up with said his halfbrother 
noah robinson humiliation thats the fuel that pushes jesse 
jackson says thats simplistic somebody elses romance of 
my life in an interview he said the discovery when he was 5 or 
6 years old that the father he was living with was not his natural 
father was interesting but it was not traumatic because i was 
never fatherless or an orphan 
yet when the adrenaline is running when he is in his pulpit 
jesse jackson has let it pour out in different terms to a 
different audience 
you are gods child when i was in my mothers belly i had no 
father to give me a name they called me bastard and rejected 
me you are somebody you are gods child

if ever there was a case of truthinadvertising 
by a political candidate it may have been the television 
commercial that michael s dukakis aired briefly last spring 
an irish union leader with a face that said he knew what he was 
talking about looked square into the camera and said dukakis is 
not your shot and a beer kind of guy 
dont expect a backslapper the ad basically said 
the commercial was a surprisingly frank attempt to meet headon 
the feeling of distance that many people get from this man who will 
become the democratic presidential nominee 
no michael dukakis 54 the governor of massachusetts the 
victor in a field of democratic presidential contenders once 
dismissed as the seven dwarfs is not a chummy sort 
cold and aloof his critics say even stiff a politician some 
believe seemingly without zest for people despite winning three 
terms as governor a student of the mechanics of government who 
would rather talk about an alphabet soup of programs than evoke a 
hearty laugh 
one magazine called him a league of women voters dream come 
true a walking talking boston globe editorial 
despite the critics dukakis succeeded in winning his partys 
nomination projecting a calm and pragmatic competence along with 
his coolness and an ability to lead by building consensus 
the impression that comes across is not particularly warm 
agrees his own pollster irwin tubby harrison its an able 
one 
i dont think its easy for him to go out there and stick his 
arm around everybody but i cant either he said i dont 
think it means you arent a warm person 
it is unfair perhaps that any politician faces comparison with 
jesse jackson as a campaigner but it was inevitable that running 
against him dukakis did 
where jackson loved to play a crowd and move it to its feet 
dukakis rarely raised his voice even let his voice trail off at 
the end his point sometimes escaping his audience 
jackson grabbed children in both arms and was rewarded with 
smiles and kisses and pictures on the front page dukakis 
approached children gingerly addressing one on nantucket island 
recently with a formal tell me who you are 
dukakis campaign style improved measurably as the nomination 
became his still he infrequently attempts jokes and gets mixed 
results when he does 
he sort of cringes internally when he has to do that said 
longtime friend richard giesser 
aides say he strikes out oneliners they write into his speech 
texts 
yet for all his limitations as a campaigner dukakis has led the 
life of a consummate politician 
he has dominated the politics of his oldmoney boston suburb 
brookline for three decades he has pursued politics 
singlemindedly for all his adult life seemingly pointing toward 
this moment

dukakis parents came to america from greece in their youth 
their own parents drawn by the promise of jobs in new england 
mills the story of each is exceptional 
panos his father arrived at age 16 he mastered the language 
and worked himself through college then harvard medical school he 
was the first greek immigrant to graduate from that school 
euterpe his mother arrived at age 9 her father preceded her 
and saved money to send for the family 
a school principal stanley gray saw a special spark in the 
young girl and became her mentor she graduated phi beta kappa from 
bates college in maine and became a teacher 
she and panos met briefly as youngsters but it was not until 
panos had established a medical practice that they courted and 
married 
dukakis father died in 1979 after a long and successful general 
practice in brookline mass he left trust funds amounting to more 
than 1 million for michael 
the thought that a family can move in one generation from ellis 
island to the white house is a powerful one dukakis invokes it 
often on the stump sometimes crediting the sacrifice and 
accomplishments of his parents that gave him the opportunity 
but his greek connection was not a particular strength in 
irishdominated massachusetts and dukakis did not stress his 
ethnic ties as a young politician 
during his first term as governor he took a trip to his parents 
homeland that is often described now as a personal awakening it 
was well covered by reporters who noted he climbed the acropolis in 
his wingtip shoes

dukakis was a studious achiever in high school in brookline a 
community of affluent families with high expectations for their 
children 
he was on the tennis crosscountry and basketball teams the 
latter despite his slight 5foot 8inch size 
an older brother stelian encouraged michaels athletic 
endeavors stelian suffered a breakdown while in college in 1951 
and led a disturbed life until a fatal accident in 1973 he was 
struck by a hitandrun driver while riding his bicycle 
dukakis got a taste of city politics while at swarthmore college 
in philadelphia in the early 1950s and by the time he was in 
harvard law school after an army stint in korea had made up his 
mind to make his career politics 
at harvard dukakis made a friendship that has endured with paul 
p brountas also the son of greek immigrants and now his campaign 
chairman 
after taking their bar exams the two hopped in brountas 
karmann ghia and drove to the west coast stopping in los angeles 
for the 1960 democratic convention where they saw john f kennedy 
also from brookline claim his partys nomination 
in a mostly straightlaced upbringing this trip has provided 
some of the few colorful annecdotes of dukakis youth 
together they stopped in las vegas where dukakis only 
reluctantly agreed to try the slot machines and won a 30 jackpot 
on his first try he quit after that win brountas recalls 
i said arent you going to play any more brountas said 
he said no thats when i knew hed be successful in politics 
youve got to have luck as well as skill 
they traveled to mexico hanging out around the pool of a fancy 
acapulco hotel while staying in 2 a night digs elsewhere 
that budgetconscious streak survives dukakis buys his suits at 
a boston department store filenes and boasts of it 
katherine kitty dickson was a few years behind him at 
brookline high school and they did not date until after dukakis 
had begun work in a boston law firm and was running for a state 
house seat they were married in 1963 
kitty had been married previously and had a young son john 
now 30 john took the dukakis name though he was never legally 
adopted two more children andrea and kara were born in 1965 and 
1968

dukakis is called mike in his ads but those close to him 
always use the more formal michael including his wife 
on their trip he and brountas talked about what they wanted to 
do next and hatched plans for a political reform movement 
he didnt want to practice law it wasnt his goal in life 
brountas said he wanted to go into politics 
dukakis created the reform group and in 1962 was elected to the 
state house himself 
he lost a bid for lieutenant governor in 1970 he gained 
television experience as moderator of a public television show the 
advocates in the interim and in 1974 ran for governor 
he won ousting the republican incumbent francis sargent 
in that campaign dukakis made the remark that later hanged him 
politically a lead pipe guarantee not to raise taxes 
once in office he found the size of massachusetts financial 
problem was staggering and the state bordered on insolvency 
reluctantly he agreed to both budget cuts and tax increases 
beyond the taxes his first term was characterized by political 
clumsiness his mr clean image faded into one of arrogance in 
pursuit of reform 
campaign workers found themselves unable to get state jobs 
allies turned on him and legislators were alienated nobody thought 
he listened 
he never sought any massaging from other politicians and 
therefore thought that it wasnt necessary to massage them 
brountas said 
his unpolitical style the taxes a lackluster reelection 
campaign it all combined for a 1978 primary loss to edward king 
dukakis was stunned 
friends say he learned from the loss including how to listen 
he spent the next years in exile at harvards kennedy school of 
government 
i think it was an absolutely critical event in his life 
says francis x meaney a boston lawyer who was a close ally of 
dukakis until a falling out a dozen years ago he learned yes 
youve got to march at the head of the army but youve got to make 
sure the army is behind you 
dukakis sought a rematch in 1982 and won aided by kings 
political stumbles 
he waved aside talk of a presidential bid until he won 
reelection in 1986 vindication in his own mind could come only 
by winning that which he had lost before a second consecutive term 
i dont think hed be running for president today if he hadnt 
lost brountas said 
what happened is he became an excellent politician says 
brountas he was not a good politician before

the dukakis in private is a lot like the dukakis you see in 
public friends say he values privacy but is comfortable with 
life in the public eye he always reserves the dinner hour for his 
family when he is in boston 
sunday was always paramount family day he said in an 
interview i make the pancakes about 10 oclock its one day a 
week we are together 
he likes to walk in the evening carrying hand weights often he 
collars top aide nick mitropolous to join him 
he refused secret service protection until after the new york 
primary and even with the bodyguards has slipped off at night to 
do grocery shopping at the neighborhood stop and shop 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after an arduous primary campaign dukakis has emerged atop a 
remarkably united democratic party in part through his ability to 
avoid the pitfalls of special interest politics 
yet he arrives at the nomination with many questions about him 
unanswered polls show an uncertainty over whether he is liberal or 
moderate and his own image largely undefined 
critics attribute this to vagueness in fact listening to 
dukakis can leave one wondering just how he intends to do what he 
says a favorite line that he never fails to invoke is a call for 
good jobs at good wages and i mean good wages 
he engages in what i think is dukakisspeak said michael j 
robinson a political scientist at georgetown university people 
are going to be talking about how incredibly bromidic he is 
whether he can keep his support as people begin to pay more 
attention to him remains open to question 
he has stressed creation of economic opportunity in the mold of 
massachusetts but without making clear how that will work in 
mississippi or montana 
rather than specifics what dukakis is selling is an impression 
of competence and consensusbuilding of good management of having 
the right priorities and hey well work out the details 
in fact dukakis sometimes sounds much like many other governors 
of the 1980s who stress economic development high technology and 
consensus politics and who often sound alike regardless of party 
affiliation 
thus this man first elected as a liberal reformer in what some 
regard as the most liberal of states a duespaying member of the 
american civil liberties union even tries on occasion to present 
himself as a conservative 
i was always taught that conservatives paid their bills 
dukakis said in that sense i guess im conservative 
his biggest applause lines come when he puts aside vague talk of 
privatepublic partnerships and programs and hones in on the 
reagan adminstration for mishandling the economy the war on drugs 
or supporting panamas strongman manuel noriega 
his crowds are always receptive and polite but it is when he 
goes before greek audiences and sometimes other ethnic groups 
that he evokes real emotion 
at astoria a heavily greek section of queens in new york 
thousands of greeks filled the streets and crushed frighteningly 
around him 
at a greek orthodox church in los angeles hundreds cheered him 
wildly and dukakis responded by joining in a traditional greek 
dance 
at a crumbling cuban and puerto rican community hall in the 
south bronx of new york the crowd sang and danced rhythmically to 
a salsa band that sang mike dukakis el presidente 
to the greeks he speaks in greek to the hispanics he speaks 
spanish to them clearly he represents more than a political 
candidate 
you can articulate a vision of the future and where the 
countrys going or you can symbolize it says gov bill clinton 
of arkansas an admirer of dukakis 
you can argue that he doesnt articulate it but i believe he 
symbolizes it

nhl devisinghes small rice paddy is 
180 miles from the battlefields where the sri lankan government is 
fighting tamil rebels but he a war victim nevertheless 
he has lost his son and his mud and thatched home has been 
burned down 
in sri lankas south where the 60yearold rice farmer lives a 
radical movement has sprung up among the countrys majority 
sinhalese to counter government efforts to finally make peace with 
the minority tamils in the north 
sri lanka the island formerly known as ceylon off southern 
india now faces two bloody insurgencies in place of the one that 
began in ethnic conflict five years ago 
as in the tamil struggle for independence in the north the 
victims in the south are often poor villagers like devisinghe 
sinhalese guerrillas came to his door in this tiny village 15 
miles inland from the coastal town of tangalle in june and accused 
his son of being a government spy 
they set fire to the hut later the headless body of his son 
30yearold gunasena was found in a field nearby 
the jvp did it devisinghe said in a whisper the jvp 
the jvp is the janata vimukti peramuna or peoples liberation 
front which has been accused of slaying more than 350 people in 
the past year 
the marxist front all but destroyed by government forces after 
an abortive coup attempt in 1971 is regrouping in the south by 
appealing to sinhalese nationalism 
under the slogan save our motherland the jvp has recruited 
students and the rural poor to launch a bloody campaign against 
president junius r jayewardene and his united national party 
its victims have included the partys president and general 
secretary as well as simple villagers jayewardene himself narrowly 
escaped assassination in a grenade attack in parliament last august 
the government has sent several thousand troops south to try to 
end the insurgency 
neither we nor in the end the people will tolerate their 
violence said lalith athulathmudali sri lankas national 
security minister 
ironically it is jayewardenes strategy for making peace with 
the tamils in the north that got him in trouble in the south 
on july 29 1987 jayewardene signed an accord with prime 
minister rajiv gandhi of india to end the tamil insurgency 
india whose own tamil minority of 60 million is sympathetic to 
the sri lankan revolt had been accused of supplying guns to the 
rebels its role under the peace pact is to guarantee the fighters 
give up their arms 
in exchange sri lanka is to give the tamils limited autonomy in 
their traditional northern territories while preserving the 
national unity that the majority sinhalese demand 
but the largest tamil rebel group the liberation tigers of 
tamil eelam has rejected the settlement and india has sent more 
than 50000 soldiers to the island to help put down the tigers 
rebellion 
sporadic clashes with the tigers persist but an indian diplomat 
said a final settlement appeared close 
the tigers are now virtually destroyed as a military force 
said the diplomat who insisted on anonymity it is just a 
question of time before they agree to return to the political 
mainstream 
both tamils and sinhalese are skeptical however that the 
indianenforced peace plan will end the bloodshed 
the tigers have never given up their call for an independent 
homeland to protect the tamil language and culture 
a chasm of distrust between the two ethnic communities also has 
been created by the long bloody conflict 
the tamil uprising began july 23 1983 with a rebel raid that 
killed 13 sinhalese soldiers and a week of revenge rioting by 
sinhalese that left at least 1000 tamils dead 
the attacks and counterattacks that followed wiped out entire 
villages of tamil peasants and sinhalese settlers in the north and 
east more than 8000 people have died 
s selvarajah a tamil whose stationery store in colombo the 
capital was burned down in the 1983 riots says he fears the 
indian plan cannot protect his people 
how can we trust anymore he asked we do not feel safe 
we worry it could happen again 
in the southern coastal town of matara sinhalese lawyer mahinda 
wijesekera has doubts too 
regardless of what they say the indians are trying to divide 
our island and people will rise up against that he said 
the tension between the two communities arises from differences 
in race religion and language that have simmered for centuries on 
this lush island of coconut palms tea and spices 
the sinhalese are descended from indian aryans who colonized sri 
lanka more than 2500 years ago they are buddhists who make up 
about 75 percent of the 16 million population and dominate the 
government 
darkerskinned dravidians invaded later also from india and 
overcame the sinhalese to found a kingdom in the islands north 
their tamil descendants mostly hindus make up 18 percent of the 
islands people 
through 400 years of portuguese dutch and british rule the two 
peoples each spoke their native tongues 
but in 1956 eight years after independence from britain the 
government declared sinhala the islands official language 
protests by the tamilspeaking minority were put down with force 
mohammed ashraf a moslem lawyer from the northeast dates much 
of the current troubles to the language law 
the polarization started then and hasnt stopped he said 
it has spread to the 1millionmember moslem community too the 
moslems descended from early arab traders are lobbying for their 
own ethnic district 
when the indianbrokered settlement goes into effect the tamils 
will elect a local council in the north and be given authority over 
education law enforcement and development 
neelan tiruchelvam a moderate tamil politician says the accord 
establishes a basic framework for sri lankan society to remain 
united 
the pact he says recognizes that the island is a pluralistic 
society not a sinhalesebuddhist domain 
but the jvp contends the accord really gives the tamils what 
they wanted a homeland 
its posters and pamphlets call on sinhalese to unite against the 
plan and threaten to kill those who support it 
the groups undeground leader is rohana wijeweera 45 a 
graduate of moscows patrice lumumba university through 
clandestine indoctrination classes and cassette tapes he 
emphasizes reclaiming the country for the sinhalese majority 
western diplomats said wijeweera has about 500 armed followers 
some believed to be army deserters and perhaps as many as 10000 
sympathizers 
the jvp has been accused of robbing banks and hijacking payrolls 
to fund its operations 
during the rice harvest in april jvp supporters went 
doortodoor in the south collecting rice taxes based on the 
size of each familys field 
some gave willingly said wilbert weerasekera a wetiya 
farmer some were unwilling but they also gave 
many southern schools have been closed by jvpbacked boycotts 
and school walls are covered with antigovernment slogans 
black paint scrawled on the stucco walls of the deserted school 
in tangalle hints of a long struggle 
first we must save our motherland it says then we will 
go to school

a leering demon with protruding 
tusks shares wall space in the museum here with snakebedecked evil 
spirits who spread diseases and benevolently smiling ones who 
provide the cures 
the brightly painted masks carved according to closely guarded 
family patterns are the products of a lively sri lankan cottage 
industry with roots in ancient times and today survives the 
nations ethnic conflicts 
few tourists come to sri lanka without carrying away at least 
one of the traditional masks but sales are off sharply these days 
because of the governments war with tamil guerrillas in the north 
many masks decorate sri lankan homes museums in colombo the 
capital 50 miles north of here and scattered southern villages 
preserve others for public viewing 
in this coastal town the wijesooriya clan has produced master 
mask carvers for six generations 
cataracts on both eyes prevent ariyapala wijesooriya the 
88yearold patriarch of the family from wielding mallet and 
chisel any longer 
but his son bandusena 48 and grandson rakmal 12 continue 
the carving tradition 
our masks are not just for show says bandusena from 
ancient times until now they are used in our festivals in our 
traditional dances and for healing 
pandula endagama an anthropologist at the colombo museum says 
references to mask dancers appear in sinhalese literature of more 
than 2300 years ago 
today he said the master carvers are concentrated in 
ambalangoda the town of matara on the southern coast and the town 
horana in the west 
curative dances are still performed including in the cities 
endagama said demons representing diseases ranging from fevers to 
coughs and blindness are brought in appeased by the family of the 
ill person with ritual offerings and then driven away 
colonial powers tried to suppress the tradition but it 
survived endagama said there is probably a scientific basis 
maybe a psychological one for it but no one has worked to find 
out what it is 
the masks of ambalangoda and elsewhere are made from the local 
kaduru tree which grows along rivers and on the edges of sri 
lankas ubiquitous rice paddy fields 
the better masks are seasoned near a villagers kitchen fire for 
three months or more before they are painted usually with enamel 
inexpensive masks can be found for 5 or less the wijesooriya 
familys famous 18demon mask which wards off 18 different 
sicknesses represented by a series of tiny evil faces sells for 
more than 100s 
bandusena wijesooriya says sales to tourists have fallen off by 
more than 80 percent since war broke out in the north of sri lanka 
five years ago and frightened many visitors away 
but he and his 25 carvers maintain their business with sales to 
museums mainly in europe and to foreign collectors he also runs 
a school to keep the ancient mask dancing art alive 
so too i hope will my son and his son and his son 
bandusena said

theres an old story about the western kansas 
farmer who claimed he had some of that 70mileanhour wheat 
and it looked pretty good despite a hard winter spring drought 
and grasshoppers 
of course the farmer meant that if you drove by the field at a 
fast clip the wheat didnt look all that bad 
in much of the nation today droughtdamaged fields dont look 
good at any speed even in places that recently had heavy rain 
stunted corn wont produce grain or even decent forage 
the agriculture department will issue another crop report on 
aug 11 based on information from onsite field surveys it will 
include peracre yield estimates and total production figures for 
the major crops including wheat corn soybeans cotton hay and 
sorghum 
last week in a special july edition the usda projected 
1988 production figures for a number of the major crops in the wake 
of the drought 
the projections were made to reflect conditions as of july 12 
the same day the report was issued and were said by officials to 
be highly tentative 
over the last seven years the average difference or error 
rate between july crop projections and final production has been 
wheat 19 percent rice 51 percent corn 124 percent sorghum 
154 percent oats 105 percent soybeans 66 percent and 
cotton 108 percent 
for corn the july projection has been below final production 
in four years and above in three the report said the average 
difference is 743 million bushels ranging from an underestimate of 
11 billion bushels in 1981 to an overestimate of 2 billion bushels 
for 1983 the last major drought year 
the july 12 projections indicated the corn crop at 52 billion 
bushels down 29 percent from predrought expectations and 26 
percent less than harvested in 1987 soybeans projected at 165 
billion bushels were down 12 percent from before the drought and 
13 percent below 1987 output 
a number of state and private experts said the usda numbers were 
too high that crop losses are greater than the projections 
indicated 
assistant secretary ewen m wilson the departments top 
economist told a meeting of the us agriculture communicators 
congress that the report represented the best information 
existing today on the crop situation 
wilson also explained that the projections were based on the 
assumption of normal weather from here on out during the the 
remainder of the 1988 crop growing season 
the projected corn output of 52 billion bushels this fall down 
from 706 billion harvested last year would be one of the biggest 
yeartoyear declines on record in 1983 drought and a huge 
federal acreageidling program designed to trim grain surpluses 
resulted in corn production of 417 billion bushels down from a 
record then of 824 billion in 1982 
wilson said red meat and poultry production this year is 
expected to be a record 599 billion pounds up nearly 3 percent 
from 1987 
high feed prices and lack of forage have forced some producers 
to sell breeding stock adding to meat supplies he said the 
dairy sector also has been affected by the drought 
although wilson cited the relatively large stockpiles of wheat 
and corn as buffers against shortages in 198889 prices are 
climbing and will add to the cost of producing meat poultry and 
dairy products 
the projections showed that corn prices could rise to an average

lowest point since late 1986 ended 6 cents lower at 1472 a

much as 40 cents a barrel lower than mondays close before

same fears that caused prices to tumble on monday 
however wholesale unleaded gasoline prices jumped 135 cents a

with oil prices falling toward the lowest point 
in nearly two years speculation has grown that influential arab 
opec producers are flooding the market for political motives that 
include crushing irans diehard war effort and preserving 
republican power in the white house 
some industry analysts believe saudi arabia kuwait and the 
united arab emirates have decided privately that cheap oil is one 
of their most effective and plentiful weapons to achieve these 
aims despite the enormous revenue losses they could endure 
together these oilrich persian gulf members of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries represent a 
staggering force that could easily inundate the fragile world 
energy markets with millions of excess barrels 
for saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter and most 
powerful opec member driving prices down could help achieve the 
multiple aim of seizing a greater market share and bankrupting 
moslemworld adversary iran which relies heavily on oil sales to 
finance its protracted persian gulf war against iraq 
the saudis are simply determined to basically starve the money 
flowing into the region as a means of ending the war said 
stephen smith a petroleum analyst with bear stearns cos in new 
york the saudis have deeper pockets than iran theyre just 
getting awfully tired of the risks in the region 
moreover some analysts reason the saudis and their arab allies 
want george bush to inherit the us presidency from ronald reagan 
because of the republicanled commitment to protect persian gulf 
shipping as well as fear that a democratic administration would 
reverse that policy 
by depressing oil prices they can artificially restrain 
american inflation and trade deficit figures helping preserve 
republican claims of a healthy us economy and blunting democratic 
criticism 
for example a 10 percent decline in crude oil prices means a 1 
percent drop in the us inflation rate according to some economic 
reckonings crude prices already have fallen nearly 22 percent in 
the last two months which could substantially reduce the 
governments preelection inflation figures 
perhaps more important cheap oil can shave the marketjolting 
monthly merchandise trade figures that have become such a 
politically sensitive issue for the republicans 
with the united states importing 7 million barrels of oil a day 
at prices of between 14 and 15 a barrel that represents a 
monthly bill of between 29 billion and 32 billion if crude 
prices fall to a twoyear low of 10 a barrel as some analysts 
predict the savings would be considerable 
while some market strategists say this argument is farfetched 
others say it is increasingly mentioned as a possible reason for 
the most recent declines in prices well below opecs target price 
of 18 
political analysts have told me it is a potentially motivating 
factor said morris greenberg an energy expert at the wefa 
group a forecasting firm in bala cynwyd pa apparently the 
leadership in those countries would find it in their interest to 
have continuity in the political situation here 
for one thing greenberg said gulf arab regimes favor stability 
in general secondly he said they look upon a new 
administration as taking a certain amount of time to get up to 
speed on the issues clearly bush has far more experience 
still some say the main reason that the saudis and their allies 
want to depress prices is economic cheaper oil discourages 
exploration by nonopec producers and gives the cartel greater 
power to raise prices in the future 
to maintain solidarity and cohesiveness in opec they have to 
move toward that 18 number said sanford margoshes oil analyst 
at shearson lehman hutton inc so i would say in terms of 
priorities the rumor that they are keeping prices down to elect 
bush is interesting but far down on the list 
others said saudi strategy probably has nothing to do with us 
politics they believe oil prices will rise rapidly once iran is 
driven by economic desperation to make peace as some predict it 
will do by yearend 
i think the saudis now feel they have iran on the ropes 
said george gaspar oil analyst at the milwaukee investment firm of 
robert w baird amp co after a ceasefire and negotiations the 
saudi position will shift theyll be looking for higher prices to 
accommodate iran and other opec countries

the smallerthanusual rebates being offered 
recently by the big three automakers probably signal that auto 
buyers are unlikely to get many yearend bargains on 1988 models 
analysts say 
because the automakers have been paring their previously bloated 
inventories of unsold vehicles buyers may have trouble finding 
dealers willing to slash prices to clear out 1988 cars at the end 
of the model year 
the latest incentive package announced tuesday by chrysler corp 
has no expiration date but general motors corps current campaign 
ends sept 28 and ford motor cos ends oct 5 after the normal 
augustseptember clearouts 
by then dealers probably will have few 1988 models left and gm 
ford and chrysler will have shipped thousands of new 1989 models to 
showrooms the 1988 model year ends sept 30 
furthermore rebates included in the automakers latest 
incentives have been reduced a bit from earlier amounts for many 
models 
consumers looking to get a good buy on an 1988 model in the 
third or fourth week of september are going to be out of luck 
said chris cedergren analyst with jd power and associates in 
agoura hills calif 
but the smaller rebates dont necessarily mean manufacturers are 
backing away from incentives entirely analysts said 
june was the best june in sales history theres a testing 
of the marketplace going on to see whether you can make a little 
more money while sales are strong and inventories are low said 
ronald glantz analyst with montgomery securities inc in san 
francisco 
industry car inventories were 13 percent lower at the end of 
june than a year earlier at a 56day supply according to wards 
automotive reports an inventort supply of 6065 days is considered 
normal 
rebates and heavily discounted loan financing rates are 
extremely costly for automakers but industry analysts and 
executives at all big three companies and many foreign makers have 
said they see little chance of ending the practice 
its just an attempt to make more money while demand is 
strong glantz said the only way to get rid of incentives is 
if all the companies did it at once and chrysler is clearly 
committed to incentives 
incentive offerings have shrunk substantially since 1986 when 
gm launched a round of rebates and low financing rates as a way of 
clearing bulging inventories since then gm and other makers have 
learned to better match production to sales reducing inventories 
and the likelihood of yearend fire sales 
but rebates and low loan rates will continue and cedergren 
predicted manufacturers will be forced to return to more generous 
incentives to sell their new 1989 models 
coupled with a low inventory of 1988 models the early end of 
1988 production means dealers may run out of old models but at a 
time that cedergren expects sales to begin slowing dealers will 
have far more new models than in past years 
the slowdown will be worsened by lack of sales to 
bargainhunters who usually flock to dealerships in early fall he 
said 
in announcing its new rebates on tuesday chrysler matched the 
new smaller offerings of its two larger rivals like ford 
chryslers package includes scaleddown rebates ranging from 300 
to 1000 
for example rebates were trimmed to 300 from 400 on 
ariesreliant to 300 from 500 on jeep comanche to 400 from 
500 on dodge daytona to 500 from 750 on dodge and plymouth colt 
vista to 600 from 750 on eagle premier lx and es 
chrysler also added several models to its incentive program 
such as the plymouth horizondodge omni chrysler lebaron sedan and 
wagon 1989 eagle medallion plymouth caravelledodge 600 and jeep 
grand wagoneer 
it increased rebates on chrysler lebaron gts and dodge lancer to 
1000 from 750 dropped from the incentive campaign were its 
standard vans and wagons and jeep wagoneer 
ford on monday trimmed rebates on three of its strongestselling 
models mustang with 23liter engine and manual transmission to 
500 from 750 ford taurusmercury sable to 500 from 600 and 
ford tempomercury topaz to 400 from 500 
gm earlier this month announced similar changes

instant photography pioneer polaroid 
corp plans to begin worldwide distribution of conventional color 
film as part of a reorganization that analysts say stems from 
takeover rumors and shareholder pressure 
the plan announced tuesday also includes the reduction by up to 
8 percent of polaroids domestic work force an employee stock 
ownership plan intended to acquire about 14 percent of the 
companys outstanding common shares and a 300 million stock 
buyback 
what they are doing is very close to the type of action an 
acquirer would take said eugene glazer an analyst at dean 
witter reynolds inc in new york they are cutting back on 
workers focusing more on core business and cutting back on 
research and development and riskier projects 
officials at polaroid would not provide details about the 
production or distribution of the new line of 35mm 126 and 110 
film which have been available in spain and portugal for about two 
years 
polaroid spokesman sam yanes said the company has not released 
sales figures for the film which will compete against industry 
leaders eastman kodak co agfagevaert and fuji photo film co ltd 
glazer said the conventional film project eliminates many of the 
uncertainties linked to new products by using polaroids 
established distribution network 
polaroid stock closed up 150 to 3125 a share tuesday on the 
new york stock exchange 
the restructuring moves estimated to save the company about 70 
million annually are in apparent response to pressure from 
shareholders to increase profitability and refocus on the 7 
billion annual conventional film business in the face of declining 
instant photography sales 
we have the worldwide name recognition quality franchise 
global distribution system and outstanding marketing capabilities 
that have enabled us to maintain our leadership position i 
macallister booth polaroids president and chief executive said 
in a news release 
we have designed this comprehensive plan of action to 
capitalize on those strengths while maximizing our internal 
efficiencies which we believe will dramatically improve our 
profitability in 1989 and beyond booth stated 
the cuts of 500 to 800 employees are planned to be completed by 
january through early retirement or severance programs a company 
statement said employees could receive up to one years salary 
through the severance plan 
the polaroid work force has dropped from about 20000 to 13000 
since 1978 said yanes about 10000 of the present employees are 
based in massachusetts 
pay for the remaining workers will be reduced 5 percent to 10 
percent under a employee stock ownership plan designed to purchase 
about 10 million shares the company issued last year all employees 
will be required to participate in the program with 10 percent of 
toplevel executives salary being converted into stock while the 
lowestpaid workers will receive stock without a cut in takehome 
pay said yanes 
no timetable or minimum price was announced for the 300 million 
stock repurchase plan 
polaroid and kodak are scheduled to appear in us district 
court in boston on jan 9 to begin the damage award trial in 
polaroids 57 billion patent infringement suit against kodak 
polaroid claims that rochester nybased kodak violated 
polaroid patents on instant photography and film from 1976 to 1986 
kodak has called the claim unreasonably inflated

a new management team is in place 
today at coleco industries inc and the company that brought 
cabbage patch kids to the marketplace is seeking protection from 
its creditors in bankruptcy court 
the west hartfordbased company on tuesday gave up a monthslong 
battle to reach an agreement to reorganize its debts with its banks 
and bondholders announcing it had filed for federal bankruptcy 
court protection from creditors 
coleco said it filed for chapter 11 protection late monday with 
us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the 
filing will permit the company to continue operating while it 
reorganizes its finances 
the coleco board appointed j brian clarke currently president 
and chief operating officer as president and chief executive 
officer 
clarke replaces morton e handel who is recovering from 
openheart surgery handel submitted his resignation as chief 
executive officer because of the companys need for a fulltime ceo 
during this period he will continue as chairman of the board 
the chapter 11 filing had been expected ever since coleco 
announced in march it suffered a 1054 million loss for all of 
1987 and would miss an april interest payment on its debentures 
coleco said the filing did not include the companys canadian and 
other foreign subsidiaries 
telephone calls seeking comment from company officials on 
tuesday were not returned 
coleco owes more than 100 million to a group of foreign and 
domestic lenders in march shortly after it announced a 474 
million loss for the first quarter the toymaker proposed a 335 
million debt restructuring plan 
but late last month coleco was forced to abandon the plan 
because it failed to win approval of the companys debtholders the 
company said tuesday it was no longer able to obtain working 
capital financing because of the failed plan and because some 
creditors had started to attach its assets 
over the past year the toymaker slashed its work force in an 
effort to cut costs it currently has fewer than 600 employees in 
the united states down from an average of 2500 last year 
it also has sold several of its product lines to raise cash 
what is going to emerge is going will be very different from 
what went in said analyst david leibowitz senior vice president 
of american securities corp 
five years ago coleco was on top of the toy world with its 
cabbage patch kids the company sold 1 billion worth of the dolls 
over two years 
the cabbage patch craze prompted coleco to expand its product 
lines and make acquisitions coleco bought the company that makes 
scrabble board games acquired the license to the popular trivial 
pursuit board game and bought the company that makes wrinkles 
stuffed animals 
but the cabbage patch fad abated and analysts said the company 
did not pare its costs soon enough when the toy industry slumped 
in 1987 coleco was hit particularly hard 
the company suffered losses in four of the past five years 
including 215 million over the last two years 
it recently lost the license to market trivial pursuit because 
of its precarious financial state 
but coleco said tuesday it managed to retain the license for the 
valuable cabbage patch line coleco said it had extended its 
license with original appalachian artworks inc until dec 31 1994

an investor group led by new york 
financier asher b edelman has reduced its stake in payless 
cashways inc leading analysts to speculate that the group may 
abandon efforts to acquire the building materials retailer 
the group sold about 500000 payless shares friday reducing its 
holding from 81 percent to 63 percent according to documents 
filed tuesday with the securities and exchange commission the 
group which now owns about 21 million shares remains the 
companys largest shareholder 
the group directed by edelman and sutherland lumbersouthwest 
inc of kansas city did not disclose why more shares had been 
sold perry sutherland a member of the group declined to comment 
on what the investors planned to do with their remaining shares 
analysts said the stock sale seemed to clear the way for a group 
of payless senior managers to buy the company for 27 a share or 
909 million their bid announced june 30 requires shareholder 
approval 
payless became the subject of takeover rumors more than three 
months ago when its stock soared in heavy trading in may the 
edelmansutherland group disclosed it had a large stake in payless 
and said that it might try to acquire the company the group later 
increased its position to 99 percent 
since then the group periodically has sold payless shares 
moreover the group has not made an offer for payless and recently 
the investors stopped commenting publicly on what they planned to 
do 
sutherland lumber is a competitor of payless and is also based 
in kansas city 
payless stock traded on the new york stock exchange fell 
tuesday to 2675 down 37 cents a share 
analysts said that because the edelmansutherland group had been 
selling payless shares since late may it appeared unlikely that 
that group or anyone else would make a competing offer 
id say the chances of another offer is about the same as the 
management deal not going through said richard pyle an 
analyst who follows payless at piper jaffray amp hopwood inc in 
minneapolis 
payless has 200 stores in 26 states and has about 15000 
employees it has 10 stores in the kansas city area where it 
employs 1400 people

general motors corp has discovered that 1987 
chevrolet astro and gmc safari vans with 43liter engines and 
overdrive transmissions might spew exhaust that smells like rotten 
eggs 
gm has issued a service bulletin to dealers with instructions on 
how to fix the problem among the recommendations is replacement of 
the onboard computer that monitors the fuel mix in the engine 
the computer is only used in vans with the overdrive

general motors corp will lay off about 
800 hourly workers at its doraville production plant for an 
indefinite period beginning friday company officials say 
the plant will be closing for a month to make a model change 
when the suburban atlanta facility reopens aug 16 only about 
4100 of the plants 4900 hourly workers will return to work said 
george j simms the plants personnel director 
the plant will be staffed then for production of 50 cars an 
hour according to simms since november it has been staffed with 
enough workers to make 75 an hour although that production has 
been frozen at 50 per hour or 800 a day since may 31 
the doraville plant is being equipped to make the 1989 
oldsmobile cutlass 
almost all of the plants production workers will be laid off 
temporarily during the model change simms said those who do not 
return next month will be eligible for jobs in training and other 
nonproduction areas 
neither simms nor jerry j hall president of the united auto 
workers local 10 could say how long the indefinite layoffs might 
last 
hall said he hoped many of the laidoff workers would be 
recalled by august 1989 when the plant begins building a fourdoor 
version of the cutlass currently the plant makes a twodoor model 
hall said he did not believe that gm froze production at 
doraville because of poor cutlass sales cutlass sales reportedly 
are on the increase after a slow start 
doraville is gms sole facility for the cutlass

the government says an asian investor it has 
implicated in a major insider trading case attempted to spirit 
millions of dollars out of the country in defiance of a court order 
us district judge richard owen slapped a new injunction 
tuesday on taiwanese businessman fred c lee but denied a 
securities and exchange commissions request to hold him in 
contempt for trying to transfer the money overseas earlier this 
month 
lee 38 was accused by the sec last month of making 19 million 
in stock profits by illegally trading on inside information he 
allegedly bought from stephen suikuan wang jr 24 a rookie 
analyst at morgan stanley amp co 
the sec got a temporary restraining order at the time freezing 
the assets of both men it has demanded the pair return the 19 
million plus triple damages for a total of 76 million the 
secondlargest insider trading case since the record 100 million 
ivan boesky scandal broke nearly two years ago 
in court filings this week the sec also provided new details 
about the case asserting lee maintained contact with several young 
analysts and tried unsuccessfully to recruit one at first boston 
co to join his alleged scheme 
the filings further asserted that lee talked with wang at least 
once daily by telephone and traded through dozens of accounts in 
other names including one in the name of lees zen buddhist priest 
sworn statements by six of wangs colleagues contained in the 
sec filings indicated he was intimately familiar with much of their 
work and sometimes may have pumped them for information 
in the court proceeding tuesday the sec claimed lee had 
attempted to withdraw several million dollars from accounts he 
has at standard chartered bank in lower manhattan 
lee was accused of sending a letter through his hong kong lawyer 
to standard charters hong kong branch last week in an attempt to 
transfer the funds 
owen granted the governments request for the preliminary 
injunction but did not find lee in contempt of court as the sec 
had requested he also extended for two weeks the temporary order 
freezing wangs assets 
lee who maintains residences in hong kong taiwan and the 
united states has indicated through his lawyer michael perlis he 
would fight the sec accusations wangs attorney ira lee sorkin 
has not divulged how his client would respond

corn and soybean futures prices soared their 
daily limits at the opening today on the chicago board of trade in 
reaction to a government report showing severe drought damage to 
those crops 
in a special report issued tuesday afternoon the agriculture 
department estimated this years corn production would fall more 
than 26 percent below last year to a 5year low based on current 
crop conditions the usda said soybean production probably would 
decline by at least 14 percent from last years 19 billion bushels 
many analysts had called the estimates conservative and were 
expecting a less dramatic reaction from traders 
i guess their enthusiasm picked up after they had a chance to 
sleep on it said jerry gidel an analyst in chicago with the 
trading firm gh miller amp co 
forecasts for a dry weekend in the corn belt followed by a 
return to 100degree temperatures gave prices an additional boost 
he said 
in early trading wheat was 6 cents to 8 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 390 a bushel corn was 3 cents 
to the limit 10 cents higher with the limitless july contract up 16 
cents at 322 a bushel oats were up the 10cent limit across the 
board except for the limitless july contract which was up 15 cents 
at 294 a bushel soybeans were locked up the 30cent limit with 
limitless july contract up 38 cents at 918 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 65 cent lower to 23 cent higher with august

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
confirmed today that the central bank has undertaken a series of 
steps to tighten credit in recent months and said the fed was ready 
to push interest rates even higher to dampen inflationary pressures 
greenspan warned of growing signs of price pressures stemming 
from such factors as the severe drought tight labor markets and 
high industry operating rates 
the costs to our economy and society of allowing a more 
intense inflationary process to become entrenched are serious 
greenspan said in testimony today before the senate banking 
committee 
as the experience of the last two decades has clearly shown 
accelerating wages and prices would have to be countered later by 
quite restrictive policies with unavoidably adverse implications 
for production and employment greenspan said 
that comment was an obvious reference to the severe 198182 
recession brought on by greenspans predecessor former fed 
chairman paul volcker as a way to fight the doubledigit inflation 
that plagued the country at the beginning of the decade 
greenspan gave no indication that the central bank was planning 
anything close to the tightmoney policies pursued by volcker but 
greenspan said that the fed did intend to err on the side of 
tighter credit conditions rather than worrying that fed policy 
could be too restrictive and thus harm longrun growth prospects 
the longrun costs of a return to higher inflation and the 
risks of this occurring under current circumstances are 
sufficiently great that federal reserve policy at this juncture 
might be well advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness 
rather than stimulus he said 
greenspans comments came in his midyear report to congress on 
the central banks conduct of monetary policy and its economic 
outlook 
the remarks were not considered a surprise financial markets 
have been expecting another slight tightening of credit conditions 
in coming weeks because of continuing evidence that the us 
economy is growing rapidly the latest such information came 
friday when the government reported that the jobless rate fell to 
a 14yearlow of 53 percent in june 
the tightening process has pushed a variety of interest rates 
including mortgage rates higher in recent months banks raised 
their prime lending rate which serves as a benchmark for many 
consumer loans to 9 percent in may and many economists are 
expecting another onehalf percentage point increase in the prime 
rate 
immediately following the oct 19 collapse of the stock market 
the fed began an aggressive crediteasing process to insure that 
the market turmoil would not topple the country into a recession 
when greenspan last appeared before congress in february to 
discuss monetary policy he said that the central bank was still 
easing credit conditions he said then that he believed the dangers 
of a recession or higher inflation were about equal 
but in todays report greenspan put the emphasis on fighting 
inflation he confirmed that the fed had taken a succession of 
restraining steps from late march through late june those moves 
have pushed shortterm interest rates up by one full percentage 
point greenspan said the moves were taken because the fed was 
well aware that it should not fall behind in resisting 
inflationary pressures 
in the midyear report greenspan said the fed was boosting 
slightly its forecast for economic growth this year saying it was 
looking for the gross national product to expand at an annual rate 
of between 275 percent to 3 percent in february the fed had a 
lower gnp growth forecast of between 2 percent and 25 percent 
the fed said it was leaving its targets for monetary growth 
unchanged for 1988 but narrowing the growth ranges in 1989 the 
target for one measure of the money supply known as m2 was 
shrunk to an increase of 3 percent to 7 percent instead of the 
growth of 4 percent to 8 percent being sought in 1988 
greenspan sounding very much like volcker warned that it was 
absolutely essential that congress make more progress in reducing 
the huge federal budget deficits he said such a cut would be the 
single most important thing government could do to reduce the 
countrys huge foreign borrowing needs 
greenspan said the deficit reduction targets established in the 
grammrudman budget balancing law were a good start but he urged 
congress to go even further and aim ultimately for budget surpluses 
sometime in the 1990s 
the country is enjoying a peacetime record of 67 continuous 
months of economic growth but some economists have expressed 
concerns that if the fed tightens credit too much the country 
could enter a recession next year 
most of the economic downturns the country has suffered since 
world war ii have come from fed actions to raise interest rates in 
an effort to head off inflation 
prominent economists testifying before the senate banking 
committee on tuesday disagreed over whether inflation now 
represents a threat to the economy 
rudiger dornbusch an economist at the massachusetts institute 
of technology said that unless congress and the new administration 
move to get control of the huge federal budget deficits the fed 
will have no choice but to push the country into a recession to 
cool an overheating economy 
inflation now is becoming too high and too firmly ingrained 
for the fed to ignore dornbusch said the longer the fed waits 
in initiating a fight against inflation the more massive the 
recession that needs to be created to beat inflation back down to 
the comfortable levels of the mid1980s 
however alan blinder an economist at princeton universtiy 
said he sees no signs that inflation is threatening to heat up 
despite the low unemployment rate and high operating rates in many 
industries 
the fed must not be swayed by the inflation hysteria that 
seems to sweep wall street about every two weeks he said the 
fed must ignore this insanity

airlines tough security policies spawn cottage industry 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the airlines have been getting tough on air 
piracy with some outside help 
the rise in international terrorism in recent years and the 
heightened threat of hijacking has spawned a cottage industry of 
security companies providing passenger screening and other services 
under contract with the airlines 
security in the air has taken on a new sense of urgency in 
recent days following the shooting down of an iran air jetliner by 
a us navy warship in the persian gulf the nations big airlines 
that fly overseas arent taking any chances on a retaliatory 
hijacking and have beefed up their already tight security measures 
although the big carriers have their own security divisions 
their mounting work loads have prompted them to call on outside 
companies for help in stemming the rise in air violence 
airline security is an undertaking of great magnitude its a 
difficult assignment said dick lally assistant vice president 
for security at the air transport association a washingtonbased 
trade group that represents the nations major carriers 
since the federal government mandated 100 percent screening 
of airline passengers at the beginning of 1973 lally noted the 
major airlines have stepped up their security and refined their 
techniques and equipment many carriers have security standards 
tougher than the governments 
each year us airline and contract security agents uncover and 
seize 3000 to 4000 firearms and make around 1500 related 
arrests according to the air transport group the metal detectors 
and xray equipment used in the screening are already into their 
fourth generation 
it has become more efficient and costeffective in many cases 
for airlines to farm out security work rather than training more 
of their own staff to handle it in departure gate areas shared by 
several airlines it makes sense for a common passenger checkpoint 
to be located in the concourse leading to a gate area instead of 
each airline having its own security setup at every gate 
one of the airlines using the gate area usually assumes 
responsibility for the concourse checkpoint contracting with an 
outside security company and splitting the costs of the contract 
with the other airlines in that section 
the granddaddy of security companies whose clients include 
airlines is wackenhut corp which works for nearly all the major 
us carriers 
wackenhut has a high profile last february armed guards from 
the company were mobilized at kennedy international airport in new 
york by beleaguered pan am corp after teamsters union leaders 
vowed guerrilla warfare against the airline in a wage dispute 
we do get called by companies if theres labor unrest said 
patrick cannan a spokesman for wackenhut at its headquarters in 
coral gables fla 
beefy wackenhut guards also were in evidence at giant texas air 
corps annual shareholders meeting last month in new york frank 
lorenzo texas airs chairman threatened publicly several times to 
have the guards eject angry shareholders if they persisted in 
asking him questions after he had requested they stop 
wackenhut a publicly owned company has 28000 fulltime 
employees and is wellknown nationally but the handful of other 
security firms catering to airlines globe security systems inc 
jj security inc and ogden allied services corp are either 
privately held or subsidiaries of other companies 
some of the big us airlines that carry passengers overseas 
also hire local security firms in foreign nations 
in this country many of the bigger betterknown security 
companies had unhappy experiences and got out of airline work 
leaving the field to the smaller firms 
that airline security was a segment of business we werent 
interested in participating in any longer said joe allen a 
spokesman for baker industries inc parent of both wells fargo and 
burns international security services 
the two security subsidiaries stopped doing airline work about 
two or three years ago allen said mainly because of liability 
problems that could result from hijackings being blamed on 
inadequate security provided by the companies 
allen explained that the decision to get out of airline security 
work was accelerated by litigation arising from the crash of an air 
india jumbo jet in june 1985 burns which provided the passenger 
screening for the flight was named as a defendant by families of 
the victims in a case still in the courts the crash off the coast 
of ireland which killed all 329 people aboard was blamed on a 
bomb planted by sikh terrorists 
cpppinkertons another security giant has shied away from 
airline work for the past four to five years 
wackenhuts cannan conceded that liability for poor security can 
be a problem he stressed however that each security contract 
with the airlines is different and many of them provide for joint 
liability 
the airlines are sensitive about security many of them admit 
that they hire outside contractors but refuse to discuss any 
details or to disclose how much they spend on security 
four of the nations airlines pan am twa american and 
northwest levy a special security charge of 5 per ticket 
pan am like twa is one of the most securityconscious us 
airlines in addition to its internal security division and 
contracts with wackenhut pan ams world services subsidiary sells 
security maintenance and other services to government agencies and 
other airlines

warner communications inc says it will 
vigorously defend itself against a lawsuit filed by chriscraft 
industries inc its largest shareholder to delay warners 118 
billion acquisition of lorimar telepictures corp 
chriscraft a broadcasting and manufacturing company filed the 
suit tuesday in new york state court 
in a statement issued wednesday warner denied chriscrafts 
claim that the merger with lorimar which owns six television 
stations would violate a 1984 agreement prohibiting warner from 
owning any tv station so long as it owns 25 percent or more of 
chriscrafts bhc inc broadcasting subsidiary 
warner has a 425 percent stake in bhc which it acquired from 
chriscraft in 1984 in exchange for a 23 percent interest in 
warners voting stock 
chriscrafts suit seeks to delay the completion of the merger 
until lorimar has sold its tv stations to an outside party or 
warner has transferred enough of its bhc stock so that it owns less 
than 25 percent of the unit 
warner has proposed putting the six lorimar stations in a voting 
trust but chriscraft maintained that would still violate the 1984 
agreement and cause injury to chriscraft 
warner said it intends to move forward to complete the merger 
which puts a value of about 14 on each of lorimars 47 million 
outstanding common shares for a total of around 630 million in 
addition warner plans to assume lorimars debt of about 550 
million 
chriscrafts four representatives on warners board of 
directors abstained from voting when the merger was approved by 
warner and lorimar in may chriscraft management is said to 
believe the lorimar stations are of inferior quality and shouldnt 
be purchased by warner

the last volkswagen made in america 
rolls off the assembly line thursday when the west german 
automaker closes its only us assembly plant in an area already 
hit hard by declining manufacturing 
ninetynine percent of the workers here had their heart in 
this place their heart and their soul said robert resides 47 
of derry everybody has in their mind why what did we do 
wrong 
resides began working at the plant when it opened 10 years ago 
amid rolling dairy farmland about 35 miles southeast of pittsburgh 
bringing the promise of prosperity and lifetime employment 
volkswagen says the workers did nothing wrong the company cited 
slumping sales and increased competition when it announced nov 20 
that it would close its westmoreland county plant dismissing 2500 
blue and whitecollar workers and ending its us manufacturing 
venture 
many workers blame trade policies not volkswagen for the 
shutdown 
this area was once the industrial base of the country said 
ronald dinsmore 45 of jeannette who also worked at the plant for 
10 years now the steel mills are gone the rubber companies are 
gone the glass factories are gone 
were getting beat by foreign competition he said 
layoffs began in march when production of the jetta model 
ended the last golf model rolls off the 15milelong assembly 
line thursday the last day of work for all but 700 to 800 
employees who will remain to help mothball the plant said vw 
spokesman chet bahn by midseptember about 150 employees will be 
left bahn said 
the volkswagen still will be sold in the united states jetta 
models will be imported from west germany and golf models from 
mexico bahn said 
gov robert casey has said finding a new occupant for the 
sprawling modern plant is a top priority but dinsmore shop 
chairman of united auto workers union local 2055 said that doesnt 
ease concern about finding jobs now 
the average vw worker earned 14 to 16 per hour a wage that is 
hard to match in the area said judy wilson supervisor of a jobs 
center in the plant 
what ive seen so far is you have to relocate to get a 
highpaying job walter smith 40 of trafford said id like 
to stay in the area my house is all paid for 
smith an electrician said he applied for benefits provided by 
the trade adjustment assistance program that would enable him to 
attend a community college to learn new electronics skills the 
program helps workers who lose their jobs because of foreign 
competition 
many laidoff workers fear finding good work may mean leaving 
the area where they grew up and hoped to spend their lives 
i dont know whether to move said edward prevenslik 46 of 
ruffsdale my biggest concern now is with my daughter and 
interfering with her in school 
prevenslik a maintenance man at the plant for 10 years has 
handed out resumes and studied want ads for about three months 
hes concerned about making ends meet 
in the fall when my kids start back at school its going to 
be a little close he said my girl clothes for her 
resides found work in early july three months after he was laid 
off his new job as a truck driver ends in october and requires 
some time spent on the road away from his family but hes still 
grateful for temporary work 
there are a lot of 350 an hour jobs that a person can grab 
onto but its not a liveable wage for anybody with a family he 
said

the house passed legislation today requiring 
companies to give workers and local officials 60 days advance 
notice of plant closings and large layoffs 
the vote was 286136 that was four more than the twothirds 
majority of those voting that would be required to override an 
expected veto by president reagan ten members of the house did not 
vote 
if all members voted 288 votes would be needed to override a 
veto 
fiftyfour republicans voted against the administration on the 
issue 
regan vetoed a massive trade bill in may saying the 
plantclosing provision was his main reason for doing so 
the aflcio threatened to withdraw its pivotal support from the 
trade measure which was to be acted on later today in the house 
if the layoff provisions were not enacted first 
democrats earlier had voted to give republican opponents only 
one opportunity to amend the bill but republican leaders decided 
against it at the last minute 
there are a lot of people in this country who have not been a 
part of this burgeoning economic miracle that some talk about 
said rep david bonior dmich nearly half of todays displaced 
workers had no notice whatosover 
house republicans complained they were being given only one 
chance to alter a bill that is not needed in the first place in 
view of the 5yearlong economic recovery the longest in the 
nations history 
why are we doing this house minority leader trent lott 
rmiss asked rhetorically job levels are at an alltime high 
unemployment is at a 14year low 
business groups made a lastditch effort to head off what would 
be organized labors biggest political victory this decade 
both sides have been waging a massive grassroots letter 
telegram and phone campaign the past week 
the house has voted on the issue only once before the provision 
was supported then by a 253vote majority far short of the 290 
votes that labor considers comfortable for sustaining a veto when 
republicans tried to strike it from a trade bill last spring 
reagan cited the mandated notices as his primary reason for 
vetoing a massive overhauling of the nations trade laws in may 
saying they were anticompetitive and would stifle new job creation 
vice president george bush who has wrapped up the republican 
nomination supported reagans veto saying he favors telling 
workers in advance they are about to be laid off but companies 
shouldnt be forced to do so 
when subsequent polls showed more than 80 percent voter support 
for requiring the notices democrats seized on the issue to attack 
reagan and bush on domestic economic issues 
if edwin meese can give himself 30 days notice the least we 
can do is give american workers 60 days notice before we lay them 
off democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis said 
tuesday 
meese announced his resignation as reagans attorney general 
last week giving no specific date when he will step down other 
than to say it will be in either late july or early august 
politics has the priority complained senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas it is not the working man or working 
woman were talking about it is who might win in november that 
has become the issue not the merits of this bill 
white house lobbyists pointed out after the senate vote that 
reagan has not definitely said he would veto the plant closing 
measure under the law he has 10 working days to sign the bill 
exercise a veto or allow it to become law without his signature 
but both sides still anticipate a veto regardless the margin of 
todays vote 
business groups fear a victory for the aflcio on the plant 
closing and layoff notices will open a pandoras box of other labor 
legislation such as mandated health benefits maternity leaves and 
measures making it easier for unions to organize workers

in addition to lowering its 1988 corn production estimate by 29 
percent the agriculture department estimated soybean plantings 
this year

those factors plus forecasts for a return to extremely hot dry 
weather in the midwest this weekend sent corn and soybean prices 
up their daily limits at the opening oats also locked limitup and 
wheat finished sharply higher 
scattered showers were predicted in the corn belt from wednesday 
night through friday morning but traders fixated on the weekend 
forecasts analysts said 
my weather people seem to feel the amounts in any rains 
anticipated tonight tomorrow and even friday morning will be a 
quarter to a halfinch and thats not significant enough moisture 
to break any drought particularly with the hot weather staring us 
in the face said jerry gidel grains analyst with the 
chicagobased trading company gh miller amp co 
at the close wheat was 7 cents to 13 cents higher with july at 
389 a bushel corn was the limit 10 cents higher across the 
board except for the limitless july contract which was up 28 cents 
at 334 a bushel oats were locked up the 10cent limit with

british aerospace plc said wednesday it was 
reconsidering its takeover bid for rover group plc after the 
european economic community ordered a large cut in the british 
governments planned cash injection into the stateowned automaker 
british aerospace had reached an agreement with the british 
government to acquire its 998 percent stake in rover for 150 
million pounds or about 254 million at current exchange rates at 
the same time the government had said it would inject 800 million 
pounds or around 135 billion into rover to reduce the 
automakers debt 
but the eecs executive commission which has the power to block 
deals that it considers harmful to competition in the 12nation 
trading bloc said earlier wednesday it approved a smaller british 
aid package of 469 million pounds 
because some regional aid also would be allowed the government 
subsidy effectively would be reduced to 547 million pounds british 
trade secretary lord young said 
british aerospace an aircraft manufacturer that was privatized 
by the conservative government said it requested more time to 
consider its proposed takeover in light of the commissions ordered 
reduction in british aid 
british aerospace also said that trading in its shares which 
was halted earlier wednesday pending the eec announcement would 
remain suspended 
negotiations between the government and british aerospace were 
continuing he said 
peter sutherland the eecs competition commissioner said in 
brussels belgium that the commission came to the conclusion 
that not all of the elements making up the 800 millionpound 
writeoff could be considered as rover debt 
he said that allowing the british government to write off all of 
rovers debt would have placed the automaker in an artificially 
favorable situation visavis competitors 
meanwhile rover said it swung into profit in the first half of 
its fiscal year helped by healthy operating profit at its austin 
rover car division and a strong recovery by its land rover unit 
after a pay dispute earlier this year the land rover is an 
allterrain vehicle 
rover reported aftertax profit of 5 million pounds or about 8 
million in the six months ended july 2 compared with an aftertax 
loss of 42 million pounds or 71 million in the same period a 
year earlier 
revenue rose to 155 billion pounds or 262 billion from 153 
billion pounds or 259 billion a year earlier

public utility companies raised their planned 
spending in the final quarter of 1987 signaling possible growth in 
the industry to meet future consumer demand the conference board 
said wednesday 
spending authorizations for plant and equipment reached 61 
billion in the final quarter of 1987 an increase of more than 11 
percent from the yearearlier period and an 187 percent rise from 
the previous quarter the report said 
this is the most positive sign weve had in quite some time 
that the utility industry is beginning to recognize the need for 
more capacity to meet future demand and to plan for it said 
kenneth goldstein an economist with the conference board a 
businessfinanced research organization 
goldstein said results of the quarterly survey represented a 
significant turnaround in utility spending which has been held 
down by sluggish demand and regulatory and competitive pressures 
an increase in utility spending probably will not affect 
consumers for several years when utilities begin expanding their 
current plants he said

president reagan on wednesday promised to do 
all he can to protect farmers from excessive losses during the 
drought that is afflicting large areas of the nation 
our administration is committed to taking whatever actions are 
necessary reagan told leaders of the american farm bureau 
federation gathered at the white house 
on the eve of his inspection tour of southern illinois drought 
areas he cautioned however we mustnt bust the budget 
nevertheless reagan signaled his support for a farranging 
relief bill agreed to on capitol hill on tuesday by democratic and 
republican leaders of the agriculture committees 
he told the heads of the state federations that while his 
administration has taken actions including helping to keep traffic 
moving on the mississippi river and other waterways needless to 
say much more needs to be done 
dean kleckner farm bureau president remarked about reagans 
trip to illinois and then presented the president with an umbrella 
saying lets hope that tomorrow youll have need of this 
just as i am leaving reagan quipped 
reagan said he had sought to make agricultural relief a 
bipartisan effort in washington and that so far im pleased by 
the cooperation weve received 
the droughtrelief bill promises payments of up to 100000 to 
keep farmers on the land despite the withering heat and lack of 
rain 
the legislation is expected to move quickly through congress 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng said that because of what he 
called the largest drought the nations history the administration 
would overlook minor flaws in the bill 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday that the 
president generally supports this legislation 
reagan speaking to some 50 american farm bureau federation 
leaders seated in the roosevelt room cited some elements he 
believes should be taken into account before the legislation is 
passed 
among them were 
relief should go to those who need it most creating 
windfalls for some will mean less for the truly deserving 
many of our farmers purchased federal crop insurance a sound 
business decision they should not be penalized relative to farmers 
who did not act with such prudence 
the legislation should not force farmers to do unreasonable 
things such as giving incentives for farmers to plow under their 
crops 
reagan also said that drought relief spending has to be 
considered in the context of our efforts to reduce the federal 
deficit 
the automatic budget sequestration cuts that overspending 
triggers would take back from farmers with one hand what were 
providing in drought relief with the other he said 
fitzwater said the relief bill likely would carry a price tag of 
about 55 billion 
the bill would be financed with money that would have been 
paid as subsidies to farmers in ordinary weather conditions he 
said because of higher cash prices congressional aides 
calculate the government farm programs could be as much as 8 
billion less than originally estimated 
there have been indications that the white house office of 
management and budget may be scrutinizing the surplus of federal 
dollars available under the crop acreage support program as a means 
of helping the government void mandatory budget cuts in midaugust 
under the grammrudman deficitreduction act 
asked about this fitzwater said there are some tradeoffs it 
is possible that the cost wont be quite as high as originally 
intended and that we certainly want to avoid a sequester and i 
think all parties want to do that

the us appetite for foreign oil increased 
sharply in the first half of the year while domestic crude 
production kept declining according to an industry report 
published wednesday 
the american petroleum institutes report showed us imports of 
crude oil and petroleum products jumped 141 percent in the first 
six months of the year from the same period in 1987 the nations 
total oil imports rose to an average 693 million barrels a day 
from 607 million barrels a year earlier 
a barrel is equivalent to 42 gallons 
the rising imports mean that 41 percent of the oil consumed in 
this country is now imported noted the monthly statistical report 
by the washingtonbased trade group 
the spike in imports in the first half was partly the result of 
differences in oil stocking between this year and 1987 the report 
said it nevertheless continues a very disturbing trend towards 
increased reliance on foreign sources of petroleum for our basic 
energy needs said edward h murphy director of the groups 
finance accounting and statistics department 
domestic crude production on the other hand slipped 23 
percent during the januaryjune period to an average 82 million 
barrels a day the report blamed the production decline largely on 
the fall in world oil prices since 1986 which it said has pushed 
crude prices 40 percent lower than before the slide 
the decline in crude output has been partly offset by a slow but 
steady increase in alaskan production as a result of projects 
planned many years ago coming onstream in the past two years

the dollar finished mostly higher wednesday 
despite reports of central bank intervention as investors 
interpreted comments by federal reserve officials as supportive of 
the currency 
gold prices rose 
traders said the dollar started to climb when federal reserve 
governor wayne angell began testifying before the senate banking 
committee 
speaking ahead of fed chairman alan greenspan angell said the 
dollar should be kept appropriately scarce at home and abroad 
angell started the ball rolling said james mcgroarty a 
vice president at discount corp and as the day wore on 
greenspans comments were equally constructive for the dollar 
delivering his midyear report on monetary policy greenspan said 
the fed and other central banks would continue to work for stable 
international exchange rates he said he saw no evidence the growth 
of us exports has been affected by the recent appreciation of the 
dollar 
despite the positive tone traders said the fed intervened twice 
to sell dollars as the currency tested barriers on the upside some 
market watchers speculated that the fed merely wanted to subdue the 
move in the dollar which had been gathering considerable upward 
momentum but finished off its highs 
trading was peppered by bursts of activity during the fed 
officials testimony 
dealers remain concerned about the upcoming report on the us 
trade deficit for may due friday im not sure if the dollars 
going to make another run up before the trade figures said 
earl johnson a vice president at the chicagobased harris trust 
and savings bank 
he said investors typically get nervous ahead of the report 
which in the past has sparked large swings in the currency 
the dollar finished mostly higher earlier in europe where 
traders interpreted greenspans testimony as mildly bullish

eastern airlines said wednesday it has made new 
conciliatory offers to its machinists and pilots union although 
the financially pressed carrier is still trying to slash overall 
labor costs 
thomas matthews easterns vice president for human resources 
said this week we put our best compromise on the table to get an 
agreement he noted that last week eastern and its unions made 
agreements on handling safety issues and worker complaints 
those meetings let us put the safety question behind us 
matthews was quoted as saying in wednesdays editions of the wall 
street journal now we are trying to put our other differences 
behind us 
the proposals made this month would save eastern an estimated 
229 million annually the airline said they would move it near a 
goal of around 30 percent in labor cost cuts set by president phil 
bakes in january 1987 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said managements proposal to 
the pilots includes protection of salaries days off and job 
security she said it also contains a fence agreement 
guaranteeing that eastern would remain separate from continental 
airlines by flying at least 217 aircraft and keeping the air line 
pilots association as the recognized representative of eastern 
pilots 
eastern and nonunion continental are both subsidiaries of 
houstonbased texas air corp the nations largest airline 
company union critics have accused texas air management of 
intending to strip easterns assets 
eastern has offered guarantees of no layoffs for any pilot hired 
before july 1 1984 and to maintain the pilots current wages and 
15 days off monthly ms ceremsak said 
changes in the pilots complex work rules would save the company 
69 million a year she said 
for the 12000 machinists at eastern ms ceremsak said eastern 
pledged job security for anyone hired before may 16 1984 
easterns overall offer to the machinists with whom its been 
in federal mediation for seven months would cut their costs to 
eastern by 160 million annually according to the airline the 
current machinists offer would add 50 million to annual costs 
ms ceremsak said 
the machinists refused to join the eastern pilots and flight 
attendants in accepting 20 percent wage cuts in february 1986 that 
preceded the sale of eastern to texas air 
ms ceremsak said eastern would largely protect the wages of the 
mechanics to recognize their marketplace value under the 
company proposal topscale mechanics wages would decline from 
1883 to 18 an hour she said 
the new eastern offer would reduce baggage handlers wages now 
at 1560 an hour for top scale to 10 hourly for the threeyear 
contract originally she said eastern proposed cutting the 
baggage handlers pay to 10 an hour the first year of the 
contract 9 the second year and 8 the third 
other cuts for machinists would involve their benefits packages 
she said bringing them in line with easterns other unions 
machinists local president charles e bryan said details of the 
negotiations are supposed to be secret he agreed that progress was 
being made but declined further comment 
bryan said eastern continues to push for release from federal 
mediation which would activate a 30day strike deadline

a member of the house agriculture committee 
said wednesday he will introduce legislation expanding the 
jurisdiction of the commodity futures trading commission to cover 
stock index options 
the measure being drafted by rep glenn english dokla would 
transfer authority to the cftc that is now held by the securities 
and exchange commission 
word of the proposal gave a new twist to congressional tinkering 
with the way the government oversees the nations financial 
markets it also illustrated the turf fights that have erupted in 
congress over the issue since the financial markets crash last 
october 
until now most of the attention on capitol hill has been 
focused on a bill introduced july 7 by rep edward markey dmass 
that would move things in the opposite direction markeys proposal 
would shift jurisdiction over stock index futures contracts from 
the cftc to the securities and exchange commission 
markey is chairman of the house telecommunications and finance 
subcommittee which oversees the sec the agency that regulates the 
nations stock exchanges and most options transactions many 
members of house and senate committees that oversee the sec have 
argued that to improve regulation of the nations financial 
markets the sec should be given expanded powers 
the agriculture committee oversees the cftc the regulator of 
the futures markets members of the house and senate agriculture 
panels have sought to defend the cftcs jurisdiction 
at a hearing of the house agriculture committee on wednesday 
english noted that after the october crash the sec received far 
more complaints from investors than did the cftc the sec has 
reported receiving 620 letters and 9360 telephone calls from 
midoctober thru late november with complaints while the cftc says 
it has logged three complaints about the crash 
you have one regulator doing a very good job and another 
where all the complaints occurred that hasnt appeared to be 
doning a very good job english said 
the lawmaker said that if regulatory powers are to be 
consolidated perhaps we ought to unify in the direction from 
which were getting the least public complaints

slump wednesday in response to the governments report of severe 
drought damage to crops and forecasts for more hot dry weather in 
the farm belt 
on other markets silver futures soared pulling the precious 
metals higher livestock and meat futures were mixed cotton 
plummeted energy futures sank and stockindex futures advanced 
analysts said tuesdays special crop report from the agriculture 
department was largely responsible for the leap in prices for 
future deliveries of grain and soybeans 
besides slashing its 1988 corn production estimate by 29 percent 
to a 5year low of 52 billion bushels the usda estimated soybean 
plantings this year at 5852 million acres a figure below the 
markets expectations analysts said 
the agency also lowered its soybean and wheat production 
estimates by 12 and 13 percent respectively and predicted overall 
grain production would be nearly 25 percent below last years level 
many traders had called the damage estimates conservative and 
some were predicting even minutes before the markets opened that 
soybean prices would rise only moderately on the data 
but within minutes of the opening bell traders had bid most 
corn contracts up the maximum of 10 cents a bushel and most soybean 
contracts were up their 30centsabushel limit the sharp advances 
halted trading in all but the july contracts on which limits have 
been removed pending their july 20 expiration 
jerry gidel an analyst in chicago with the trading firm gh 
miller amp co called the cropproduction numbers impressive and 
said most traders apparently came to the same conclusion after 
digesting the data 
i guess their enthusiasm picked up after they had a chance to 
sleep on it he said 
in addition to the crop report forecasts for a return to 
extremely hot dry weather in the midwest kept the buy orders 
coming gidel said unfilled buy orders for december deliveries of 
corn totaled more than 30 million bushels at the close of the 
session and unfilled buy orders for november soybeans totaled more 
than 6 million bushels 
scattered showers were predicted in the midwest from wednesday 
night through friday morning but traders fixated on forecasts for 
the weekend and beyond analysts said 
a national weather service 6to10day forecast issued after the 
close predicted abovenormal temperatures and belownormal rainfall 
for most growing areas during the middle and latter parts of next 
week 
the agencys 30day outlook called for continued hot and dry 
conditions in the midwest and great plains through midaugust

reports of a silver miners strike in peru sent silver futures 
prices soaring on the commodity exchange in new york 
but john oconnell metals analyst in new york with refco inc 
said abundant supplies of silver in the exchanges approved 
warehouses should temper any fears of shortages 
i think theres enough silver in comex warehouses to take care 
of everybody for a long time he said 
silver settled 191 cents to 206 cents higher with july at 
7165 a troy ounce gold was 310 to 390 higher with august at

report which boosted the prediction for the july 31 1989 surplus 
from 68 million bales to 74 million bales on the new york cotton 
exchange cotton settled 149 cents to 182 cents lower with 
october at 5758 cents a pound

complaints against a insurer selling drought 
insurance grew wednesday as a group of indiana farmers sued the 
company and iowa regulators filed charges against it for allegedly 
reneging on policies 
critics have accused federal insurance co a subsidiary of 
chubb group insurance cos of backing off on its promise to pay 
awards for lack of rain 
chubb says it was swamped with applications in the final days of 
the enrollment period which lasted from may 1 to june 17 and that 
applications exceeded the amount of coverage it wanted to provide 
the policy promises a payoff if rainfall falls below a set level 
because of the flood of requests from about 10 farm belt states 
chubb has promised to return premiums and said it is working with 
state insurance departments on the matter 
but 29 farmers in eastcentral indiana say the company is 
unfair and filed a lawsuit wednesday in jay circuit court alleging 
chubb acted in bad faith by reneging on 25 million worth of the 
insurance 
the suit seeks unspecified damages from federal and piogard 
agency of ohio inc based in des moines iowa the suit said 
piogard sold the policies on or about june 15 
earlier wednesday chubb spokeswoman mary lu korkuch said the 
company had a 108year history of being equitable and acting with 
integrity and said the company was hoping to settle the 
situation as soon as possible 
she did not return telephone calls later in the day seeking 
comment on the indiana lawsuit and iowa action 
on wednesday iowas state insurance commissioner held a news 
conference to announce charges of misrepresentation against 
federal which sold 1500 policies to iowa farmers 
commissioner william hager said only four of those policies had 
been put in force despite an average 1000 premium paid by each 
farmer 
iowa would seek to force the company to live up to the policies 
terms or return double the premiums paid said hager 
the commissioner charged federal with failing to file 
endorsements with state regulators until after ads were run to 
certify iowa sales agents and to issue more than four policies 
despite accepting 1500 applications 
an administrative hearing on charges in indiana is set for july 
26 
chubb returned premiums to an elkton ky agent who took out 
policies for 42 neighboring farmers in tennessee and kentucky but 
the farmers have voted to reject the refund the agent said 
agent bill knuckles said the farmers asked him at a meeting 
tuesday to send the checks back to chubb with a demand that the 
company provide coverage 
charges might be filed by michigan insurance officials against 
chubb unlicensed agents in michigan who sold the policy and the 
chubb agent that developed it based in jericho ny said an 
official of the state insurance bureau 
the official eric nordman director of property and liability 
said chubb officials have promised to contact michigan farmers and 
offer them twice their premiums as compensation

reserve board chairman alan greenspans renewed pledge to tighten 
credit to keep inflation under control

prices rose in addition to their nagging inflation fears bond 
traders also worried about a burgeoning supply of bonds later this 
summer 
william sullivan director of money market research for dean 
witter reynolds inc cited proposals aired in washington that

earlier there was no chance of more bonds at refunding

early in the day investors reacted positively to greenspans 
report to the senate banking committee that the federal reserve 
would continue to follow tight monetary policies and hold the 
dollar steady said mitchell held chief financial economist for

worries about inflation intensified last week when the labor 
department announced the lowest civilian unemployment rate in 14 
years as well as strong gains in employment 
greenspan also warned of growing signs of price pressures 
stemming from other factors such as the drought and high industry 
operating rates 
investors also remained cautious as they awaited fridays report 
from the commerce department on the trade deficit for may sullivan 
said 
analysts say if the trade deficit widens too much it would hurt 
the dollar and lead to further declines in bond prices 
the downturn last friday and this week are in anticipation of 
unfavorable reports sullivan said 
in april the merchandise trade deficit narrowed to 99 
billion its best showing in three years 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments were unchanged to 132 point higher intermediate 
maturities were up by between 132 point and 116 point and 20year 
issues rose 316 point according to the financial information 
service telerate inc

movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer fell 009 to 10869 the shearson lehman daily

an electionyear juggernaut to force employers 
to give workers 60 days notice before closing plants or ordering 
large layoffs cleared the house on a 286136 vote wednesday 
setting up a likely veto showdown with president reagan 
fiftyfour republicans abandoned the administration giving the 
white house nine fewer votes than the 145 or one third 
necessary to sustain a veto assuming all 432 members vote 
the legislation passed the senate by a vetoproof 7223 vote 
last week the house tally if repeated exactly also would be 
sufficient to override a veto but 10 members seven democrats 
including speaker jim wright of texas and three republicans did 
not vote a veto override would require 288 votes if all members 
voted 
i suspect the president will veto it said house minority 
leader robert michel rill the legislation is here to create an 
issue not because people are demanding it 
but former gop opponents of the bill immediately began sending 
signals to reagan and vice president george bush the partys sure 
presidential nominee not to press an issue that democrats can use 
in the november elections 
i dont think hell be able to sustain a veto said rep 
marge roukema rnj there are a lot more than 54 republicans 
who dont want him to veto it we fought every fight bush is going 
to have to handle the issue now 
later wednesday the house passed on a 37645 vote a massive 
overhauling of the nations trade laws that reagan vetoed in may 
primarily because the layoff notices then were a part of it senate 
leaders have said they do not anticipate acting on the trade bill 
until early next month 
with polls showing that more that 80 percent of voters support 
mandated layoff notices unions successfully persuaded democratic 
congressional leaders to attempt enacting the measure before 
considering a revived trade bill that reagan vetoed in may because 
it included the notices 
todays house vote coupled with last weeks overwhelming 
senate margin clearly gives the white house a strong message that 
this bill should be signed said aflcio president lane kirkland 
who called it an issue of fairness for workers 
business groups however said they are still counting on reagan 
for a veto 
if he vetoed the trade bill because of it i dont know why he 
would turn around now said renee reymond the national 
association of manufacturers chief lobbyist on the issue 
white house officials have pointed out that reagan has not said 
directly that he would veto layoff notices as a standalone bill 
although his senior advisers have said they would urge him to do so 
reagan cited the plantclosing language as his primary reason 
for vetoing the overhauling of the nations trade laws in may 
arguing that the notices would stifle competition by hamstringing 
businesses in moments requiring quick action 
these bills are linked because they have an effect on each 
other said rep david bonior dmich ive got 5000 workers 
in michigan whose trade readjustment assistance is running out this 
week there are a lot of people in this country who have not been a 
part of this burgeoning economic miracle that some talk about 
under the law the president has 10 days excluding sundays 
to sign the bill veto it or allow it to become law without his 
signature once it is delivered to the white house expected 
sometime next week 
bush supported reagans veto in may saying he favors telling 
workers in advance they are about to be laid off but that companies 
shouldnt be forced by the government to do so 
democrats have seized on the issue to attack reagan and bush on 
domestic economic issues 
if edwin meese can give himself 30 days notice the least we 
can do is give american workers 60 days notice before we lay them 
off democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis said 
tuesday 
meese announced last week he would resign as attorney general 
but said he wouldnt actually depart until late this month or early 
august 
rep silvio conte a liberal massachusetts republican and 
cosponsor of the measure cited a general accounting office study 
showing that the average layoff notice given workers in this 
country is seven days 
it takes two months to get a worker readjustment program going 
at a plant conte said most of the heartache of losing a job 
could be avoided if companies just give workers enough notice to 
readjust their lives 
layoff notices have been required in canada japan and most 
european countries for years and a 1986 study by the congressional 
office of technology assistance found little opposition to them in 
those foreign settings by subsidiaries of americanowned companies 
but business groups feared a victory for the aflcio on the 
plant closing and layoff notices will open a pandoras box of other 
labor legislation such as mandated health benefits maternity 
leaves and measures making it easier for unions to organize workers

the house passed 37645 on wednesday a 
revamped version of its massive trade bill now largely tailored to 
conditions set by president reagan when he vetoed the original in 
may 
the best protection for our economic future is this trade 
bill ways and means chairman dan rostenkowksi dill declared 
in a twohour debate 
only 41 republicans and four democrats held out against the 
1000page bill leaders of both parties said reagan will sign the 
bill if the senate passes it in its current form 
earlier in the afternoon the house passed 286136 a separate 
bill to force employers to give 60 days advance notice to workers 
of plant closings and major layoffs that was a feature of the 
initial trade bill and was cited by reagan as the basis for his 
veto 
even the severest critics of the trade legislation conceded it 
was headed for law rep william frenzel rminn declared he was 
not a fan of the measure but urged the house to go ahead and 
pass it rather than fooling around with trade when it should be 
focusing on the budget deficit 
before acting on the bill itself the house rejected 237183 an 
attempt to delete the measures provisions for dutyfree imports of 
ethanol produced at caribbean refineries from european and 
brazilian base products 
ethanol is fuel produced from a variety of farm products 
notably corn the provision came under attack from house minority 
leader robert h michel rill whose district includes huge corn 
refineries 
rep richard durbin dill said the measure punishes these 
droughtstricken farmers as much as the searing sun critics 
scoffed at the micheldurbin proposal as a delaying tactic rep 
robert matsui dcalif said the provision would help consumers by 
assuring a reliable supply of ethanol at reasonable prices 
unfortunately what you are hoping for is some excess profits 
out of it matsui said 
the plantclosings plan was but one part of the trade bill 
passed in may but president reagan singled it out for criticism in 
his veto he said it would rob managers of the flexibility to 
operate their companies at peak economic health sponsors say 
warning family breadwinners of impending layoffs is the decent and 
compassionate thing to do 
declaring their intent to meet reagans objections democratic 
leaders split off the plantlosings provision and reconstituted it 
as a separate bill they also dropped new curbs on exports of 
alaska oil 
the measures remain closely tied together however and came to 
the house floor under a rule that required the chamber to take up 
plant closings first and then go immediately to trade it reflected 
a move by congressional leaders to ease the concerns of union 
officials over separating the issues 
the trade bill was expected to come to the floor in the senate 
at an unspecified time after next weeks democratic national 
convention 
some democrats say gov michael dukakis choice of sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas as his running mate on the national democratic 
ticket provides all the more reason to push ahead with the trade 
bill 
bentsen is chief senate sponsor of the measure and placing the 
bill on reagans desk at the opening of the presidential campaign 
might be expected to lend a note of drama to the issue 
renewed congressional action on what house speaker jim wright 
dtexas described as the trade and jobs bill follows a june 
unemployment rate of 53 percent a 14year low and an april 
merchandise trade deficit of 99 billion the lowest since 
december 1984 
the administration has been hoping since september 1984 to pound 
a massive dent in the trade deficit by lowering the dollar thus 
raising the cost of imports while making it easier to sell us 
products overseas there is no way to forecast what may trade 
figures due friday will show but the red ink for february was 
144 billion and for march was 119 billion 
provisions of the bill would grant the administration authority 
to reach agreements in the current uruguay round of international 
trade talks and guarantee them speeded up consideration by congress 
with no amendments 
procedures under which the united states imposes import curbs to 
protect us industries and retaliate against trade violations 
would be streamlined under the measure other features range from 
repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil company earnings to as 
much as 2 billion in agricultural subsidies

second quarter climbed 40 percent from a year ago citing 
improvement by its broadcast group despite a sluggish advertising 
market a rise in interest income and the effects of costcutting

a measure to force employers to give workers 
60 days notice before closing plants or ordering large layoffs has

hewlettpackard co responding to apple 
computer incs copyright infringement suit filed a countersuit in 
a federal court wednesday alleging unfair business practices by 
apple and violation of the sherman antitrust act 
hewlettpackard based in palo alto calif denied all of 
apples allegations and asked the us district court in san jose 
to invalidate apples copyrights in the case and to dismiss its 
suit against hewlettpackard 
hewlettpackard is confident the court will agree apples 
suit has no merit said douglas c chance executive vice 
president of the companys business systems sector 
apple based in cupertino calif sued hewlettpackard and 
microsoft corp of redmond wash in march charging them with 
copyright infringement in two socalled operating environment 
programs microsofts windows and hewlettpackards newwave 
operating environment programs provide a visual desktop on 
the screen on which a computer user can view various symbols 
representing documents applications programs and places to store 
information 
apples suit shook software developers and computer makers 
throughout the industry because of its potential scope besides 
taking aim at hewlettpackard and microsoft apple also indirectly 
challenged its biggest rival international business machines 
corp which has been incorporating display graphics similar to 
apples 
apple was seen as essentially asking the court to preserve a 
technological edge it has enjoyed over its competitors just as the 
rivals were starting to close the gap 
in april microsoft submitted a response to the court in san 
jose charging that apple violated contracts acted in bad faith 
and damaged microsofts relations with other companies 
microsoft denied that its windows product infringed on apple 
copyrights by using images that too closely resembled the look 
and feel of apples popular macintosh computer 
hewlettpackard claimed in its countersuit that apple does not 
hold valid copyrights for the visual displays and images because 
apple did not originate them 
by claiming sole authorship of those displays and images 
apple misled the us copyright office in order to stifle 
competition and hamper hewlettpackard microsoft and others from 
entering a market graphical userinterface operating environments 
for personal computers that apple dominates hewlettpackard 
said in a statement 
hewlettpackard also said apple misled the court and the 
public by altering hewlettpackard screen images to create the 
false impression that they are similar to the apple macintosh 
hewlettpackard believes apples real concern is not that 
some features of newwave resemble those of the macintosh but that 
newwave delivers what apple itself has described as its vision of 
the future 
on monday the court granted hewlettpackards motion to 
disqualify the palo altobased law firm of fenwick davis and west 
from representing apple hewlettpackard claimed that the firm had 
previously worked for it and should not be allowed to participate 
in a suit between the companies

ltv corp announced wednesday that pension benefit 
guaranty corp will resume control of three of the dallasbased 
companys pension plans and their assets 
the plans have been the subject of dispute between the steel and 
energy company which is reorganizing under federal bankruptcy 
protection from creditors and the pbgc a government agency that 
insures pension benefits 
the pbgc took over ltvs steel company pension plans which were 
2 billion in debt in january 1987 after the company terminated 
them making the agnency ltvs biggest creditor 
but the agency attempted to restore ltvs responsibility for the 
plans the following september after a new ltv labor contract with 
the united steelworkers of america restored some benefits 
previously cut 
a federal judge on june 22 in manhattan refused to uphold pbgcs 
decision to force ltv to reassume the pension obligations stating 
that the agency had not presented a good enough case for the move 
ltv has contended since filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection two years ago that it can not successfully reorganize if 
it is held responsible for the 2 billion shortfall of the pension 
plans 
company officials said the resumption of pbgc responsibility 
should not affect ltv steel retirees or their benefits officials 
said they will work with the pbgc to assure payments continue 
during the transition period

general motors corp will install 
driverside air bags as standard equipment on 500000 cars a year 
by 1990 because they arent selling like hotcakes as costly 
options gms president said wednesday 
robert stempel said gm will not begin phasing in passengerside 
air bags until 1990 unlike some of its competitors and will not 
include them as standard equipment until 1992 because the 
technology still is being developed 
stempel also said gm would include rear lapandshoulder belts 
as standard equipment on all 1989 models he said automakers did 
not include rear shoulder belts previously because they had 
believed passengers were safer in the back seat than in the front 
seat and needed less restraint 
the federal government requires automakers to have passive 
restraints automatic shoulder belts or driverside air bags 
combined with manual shoulderlap belts by 1990 the regulation 
requires passive restraints on an increasing percentage of each 
makers vehicles each year until 1990 but leaves makers the 
discretion to offer them as standard equipment or as options 
chrysler corp has said it would include air bags as standard 
equipment on all its usproduced models by 1990 and will use 
automatic belts on its smaller imported models 
ford motor co and gm will use a more even mix of air bags and 
automatic belts than chrysler ford has had some success offering 
air bags as options but also will make them standard on many 
vehicles 
stempel spoke at the 20th anniversary of the gm research and 
development laboratory at gms 4000acre milford proving ground 
where vehicle research includes indepth safety studies that have 
produced such new devices as the selfaligning steering wheel 
the new safety steering wheel which is being introduced on the 
1989 chevrolet cavalier is a hollow hub on six metal tabs that 
collapse on impact to flatten the wheel against the drivers torso 
evenly distributing impact force across the entire wheel to reduce 
potential face and chest injuries 
the wheel developed by four gm engineers is effective but not 
costly and will be phased in on other cars not equipped with air 
bags primarily economy cars stempel said he believed buyers of 
cheaper cars were less likely to accept the added cost of an air 
bag 
he said gm will make air bags standard only on its middle and 
upperprice range vehicles because those buyers are more willing 
to shoulder the air bag cost but if they are given a choice they 
also tend to ignore the air bags he said 
oldsmobiles with air bags are not selling like hotcakes by 
themselves they dont seem to be a saleable feature stempel 
said most people dont buy a car thinking they are going to be 
in an accident 
well have to move toward standard installation of air bags to 
get them in there in any number 
for 1989 gm will offer driverside air bags on the oldsmobile 
delta 88 and 98 and the cadillac deville fleetwood and fleetwood 
60 special stempel said
