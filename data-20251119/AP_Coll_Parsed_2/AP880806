a cherokee indian reacted to 
reparations paid to japaneseamericans interned during world war ii 
by suing the federal government for uprooting his ancestors in the 
forced march known as the trail of tears 
ive always said if they pay the japanese they should pay 
us said woodrow w bussey who filed the lawsuit in us 
district court friday on his own behalf 
a day earlier the us house passed legislation to give 20000 
each to surviving japaneseamericans who were forced into 
internment camps following the attack on pearl harbor almost 47 
years ago president reagan has said he will sign the 12 billion 
bill 
bussey 71 of albuquerque said he is a cherokee medicine man 
author artist and inventor he said he has not yet found a lawyer 
to handle the case 
if they pay us what they pay the japanese well be happy 
he said in an interview hell i think id happy if they just 
apologized if theyd admit that we had rights and they just 
didnt treat us right 
the lawsuit says members of the cherokee nation were forcibly 
removed from their lands in eastern states and were herded like 
animals on what is now nationally known as the trail of tears 
in the fall of 1838 federal troops gathered tribal members from 
north and south carolina tennessee and georgia and forced them on 
a 116day march across the country to northeast oklahoma 
bussey said he does not oppose the payment to the 
japaneseamericans but believes indians are entitled to the same 
benefit 
they treated the japanese a whole lot better than my people 
although it was still a brutal thing to do he said they 
trucked them to their new houses built fences and fed them 
my aunt told me that they marched the cherokees across the 
country found the worst place they could and then pointed to a 
shady tree and said indian thats your new home 
bussey said he expects other tribe members and representatives 
of other tribes to join in the lawsuit which seeks damages of more 
than 10000 
wilma mankiller principal chief of the cherokee nation in 
oklahoma said friday she has not seen the lawsuit but confirmed 
that bussey was a tribe member she said she would not comment on 
the lawsuit until she could review it

secretary of state george shultz 
returns to central america monday for the third time in little more 
than a month in yet another effort to put a us stamp on a 
yearold peace initiative 
he is not likely to do any better this time 
shultzs latest visit comes a year and a day after the 
presidents of nicaragua guatemala honduras el salvador and costa 
rica signed a peace plan that has done little to end the regions 
bloody conflicts 
it also comes a week after shultz failed to get a strong 
condemnation of nicaraguas leftist sandinista government from the 
other four countries during a meeting with their foreign ministers 
costa ricas foreign minister rodrigo madrigal nieto signaled 
the reason for shultzs failure at a news conference following 
mondays meeting in guatemala city 
the leadership of central america will not be abandoned will 
not be given up madrigal said we are very interested in 
having the central american countries retain their leadership in 
this entire effort for peace and democracy 
shultz also visited the region in june 
the peace plan was designed by costa ricas president oscar 
arias it earned him last years nobel peace prize and he has made 
it clear he does not want to see it fall into washingtons hands 
after several months of relatively little diplomatic activity 
arias appears to be planning a new initiative of his own 
in a meeting with foreign reporters friday arias hinted he will 
seek latin american support this week for political and economic 
sanctions against nicaragua for its failure to comply with his plan 
the plan calls for ceasefires in civil conflicts in nicaragua 
el salvador guatemala and honduras amnesty decrees in all four 
countries democratization and the lifting of emergency or martial 
laws 
it also calls for an end to all outside aid to the regions 
insurgents and an end to use of any countrys territory by those 
seeking overthrow of a neighboring nation 
el salvador is still gripped by a bloody civil war a fragile 
ceasefire in nicaragua is broken almost daily and leftist 
insurgencies still trouble honduras and guatemala 
shultz will meet with arias upon his arrival here monday from 
bolivia the secretary flies tuesday to honduras and el salvador to 
meet presidents of those countries and on wednesday both he and 
arias go to ecuador for the inauguration of presidentelect rodrigo 
borja 
in ecuador arias will discuss a new initiative with the 
presidents and foreign ministers of other latin american nations 
he said if he gets the support he seeks he may announce a new plan 
shortly after his return 
my new initiative is to convince the other democracies that we 
must put pressure on the sandinistas arias told reporters 
he refsued to elaborate but when his peace plan was signed last 
year arias promised to seek political and economic sanctions 
against any nation that failed to comply 
if arias succeeds shultz will have indirectly achieved a us 
goal of isolating nicaragua politically and economically from the 
rest of central and latin america the difference is that an arias 
initiative will not be stamped made in the usa 
like shultz arias harbors little love for the sandinistas but 
he differs from the reagan administration in his belief that the 
usbacked rightwing rebels known as contras are no better 
a contra victory in nicaragua arias said friday would simply 
replace a dictatorship of the left with a tyranny of the right 
in his last meeting with shultz in late july arias said he 
told the secretary that the sandinistas today are the bad guys 
they have unmasked themselves he added they were not 
really honest when they committed themselves to democratize and to 
advance toward a pluralistic society 
if any president of central america has signed the plan 
and simply tried to deceive the world or the rest of the central 
american presidents arias said he should be punished 
but arias said he remained strongly opposed to further us 
military aid to the contras who have been trying to topple the 
sandinistas for the past seven years 
asked about charges by some us congressmen and administration 
officials that he is naive in believing the sandinistas can be made 
to bargain in good faith without a contra threat arias replied 
was george shultz naive when he proposed a middle east peace 
plan

the small valve that halted the test 
firing of the space shuttle discoverys main rocket engines was 
being removed saturday to prepare the ship for another try at the 
hotfire test 
that test could come as early as midweek but nasa officials 
declined to set a date until the work is completed 
weve got a schedule laid out we know what we have to do we 
have access to the engine and were slowly very carefully making 
our way down to the valve said kennedy space center spokeswoman 
lisa malone 
a replacement hydrogen bleed valve flown from nasas engine 
facility in mississippi was on hand 
according to the schedule the old valve assembly that closes a 
oneinch line was to be out by midnight sunday the engine work was 
proceeding around the clock with three shifts of mechanics 
the task was time consuming because a maze of structures pipes 
wiring and other materials had to be moved out of the way in the 
cramped aft section of the orbiter before workers from enginemaker 
rocketdyne could get to the faulty valve 
when the new valve is installed all that piping and other 
material will have to be put back panels replaced and work 
scaffolding removed 
the space center told its employees that work is expected to be 
completed tuesday whether the firing test could be scheduled for 
wednesday remained to be determined 
last thursdays scheduled test firing was aborted microseconds 
before ignition because computers sensed that the hydrogen bleed 
valve on the no 2 engine was about onefourth open it was 
supposed to be nearly closed at that point 
the valve is used to circulate liquid hydrogen at 423 degrees 
below zero fahrenheit to cool other engine parts before ignition 
but it must be closed when hydrogen pours into the combustion 
chamber at the rate of 1035 gallons a minute during firing 
engineers determined the valves position indicator was not 
giving the correct information to the engine controller miss 
malone said referring to an onboard computer 
the valve was actually closing as it should have been in the 
last seconds of the countdown she said but the indicator said 
the valve was open more than specifications say it should have been 
at that time which is just milliseconds prior to engine 
ignition 
since the indicator sensor and the valve are in the same 
assembly engineers decided to replace both

president reagan vowed today to block any 
effort in congress to respond to his veto of a 300 billion 
pentagon spending bill warning against an even worse defense 
bill as an act of retribution 
it wont happen not if i have anything to say about it the 
president declared in his weekly radio address delivered from the 
oval office 
reagan vetoed the military authorization bill on wednesday 
saying that although it offered more funds than he requested it 
was loaded with requirements that would jeopardize his defense 
program and weaken the us posture in arms control talks with the 
soviet union 
he repeated these objections in his radio address and said 
now that ive vetoed the defense bill there is talk on capitol 
hill about producing an even worse defense bill as an act of 
political retribution 
well let me ask you what could be more deplorable than to 
use the defense of this nation as a political pawn the president

as long as im president our nations defenses including our 
strategic defenses will remain above partisan politics reagan 
said congress needs to go back to work to pass a new defense 
bill one that i can sign because it strengthens our negotiating 
hand instead of weakening it 
we may be republicans or democrats but when it comes to a 
strongly defended nation we must all be simply americans reagan 
said 
the president repeated his charge that the bill made 
unilateral concessions to the soviets and would have crippled 
his spacebased star wars or strategic defense initiative 
program 
i could not in good conscience have done anything other than 
mark that bill veto and send it right back he said

after a week of answering questions about his 
health michael dukakis invited or perhaps challenged the press 
corps that travels with him to a spirited speed walk workout 
saturday 
as the sun rose on denver at 6 am dukakis was walking briskly 
around city park accompanied by a couple dozen reporters aides 
photographers and network television cameras 
also along was california sen alan cranston a serious jogger 
and colorado gov roy romer also a jogger 
behind a group of newspaper reporters less committed to 
exercise than the massachusetts governor and democratic 
presidential nominee rode in a dark stretch limousine getting out 
occasionally to walk a few paces 
dukakis regularly spends 30 to 40 minutes in the morning or 
evening taking what he calls a power walk a fastpaced walk 
carrying hand weights in an exercise he says keeps him in shape 
its enough to get the heart rate up dukakis said as he 
began 
normally he works out only with senior aide nick mitropolous 
but on his campaign trip thursday and friday dukakis needled 
reporters traveling aboard his jet about their health at one point 
calling them an unhealthy looking bunch 
and at laguna beach calif on friday he told a large audience 
he was inviting the press on his next workout as long as they 
bring a doctors letter remark that hinted at dukakis own 
doctors report released wednesday to squelch unsubstantiated 
rumors he had previously sought psychiatric care 
no letter was required for the workout however 
were going to get out there and exercise for about 45 minutes 
and see just whos in shape and who isnt dukakis said 
he and some of those accompanying him walked some jogged 
twice around a paved 13 mile course through the park and around a 
lake they made the rounds in 35 minutes 
he ignored the exhaust fumes from gaspowered golf carts that 
moved ahead of him carrying television camera crews and news 
photographers and from the police car that traveled ahead 
dukakis also said he didnt feel the effects of denvers 
milehigh altitude it feels pretty good actually he said 
dukakis talked about landscape architecture and public land 
acquisition for a while as he walked with sam taylor 
concessionaire at the park 
dukakis and mitropolous were the only ones to carry the hand 
weights and mitropolous readily gave his up to others who wanted 
to give the weights a try 
dukakis wore blue shorts and a tshirt given him by the atlanta 
boys clubs when he was in that city for the democratic convention 
and where dukakis given a largesized shirt in a public 
presentation asked that they given him a medium instead 
he said if you give me a medium ill wear it said press

an oregon state 
university oceanographer piloting a oneman submarine has become 
the first person to see the bottom of crater lake the nations 
deepest lake 
jack dymond explored the southcentral area of the lake at a 
depth of about 1450 feet in search of hydrothermal vents or hot 
springs during an eighthour dive friday in the oneman 
submersible deep rover 
the deepest point in the lake is 1932 feet making it the 
seventhdeepest lake in the world 
dymonds dive conducted a day earlier than planned was part of 
a threeweek exploration of crater lake which is funded by a 
225000 grant from the national park service 
it was very rough terrain down there said jim milestone 
natural resource management specialist for the national park 
service at crater lake 
crater lake was formed nearly 6900 years ago when an a volcano 
mount mazama erupted violently and exhausted its supply of magma 
or molten rock and then collapsed into the empty magma chamber 
milestone said dymond explored a rugged fault part of a 
fracture line that rings the floor of the lake 
dymond and colleague bob collier both oceanography professors 
at oregon state university theorize that hydrothermal vents exist 
along the fracture line feeding the lake with hot water chemicals 
and sediments from a source underground 
results of fridays dive would not be released until sunday the 
researchers said 
milestone said dymond and collier decided to take the first deep 
dive friday because they felt comfortable with the submersible 
after taking shallow twohour dives thursday 
collier was to take his turn on the lake floor saturday 
milestone said 
the rough lake floor made it difficult for navigation equipment 
to keep track of the 10footlong craft milestone said 
the dives are being recorded by cameras mounted on the 
submersible which also has maneuverable pincerlike arms and 
instruments to measure temperatures and other data

democratic vice presidential 
candidate lloyd bentsen counterattacked republicans on the defense 
issue saturday accusing them of poisoning defense policy with 
partisan politics 
the texas senator appeared at a meeting of the american gi 
forum a hispanic veterans organization two days after george bush 
told the same group that michael dukakis was for unilateral 
disarmament bentsen told the group the republican accusations 
missed the mark 
mike dukakis supports a strong national defense im strong on 
defense the democratic party is willing to pay the price to defend 
freedom he said 
but he said we wont ever never wink at corruption in 
the pentagon and we wont ever never allow your hardearned tax 
dollars to be used for kickbacks to consultants 
the 2995 billion defense bill vetoed last week by president 
reagan was supported by the secretary of defense and the joint 
chiefs of staff bentsen said 
when reagan vetoed it and bush hailed the action they said 
no to a strengthened role for the military in stopping drug 
traffic they said no to a 41 percent pay raise for our 
service men and women they said no to the biggest defense budget 
in history he said 
unfortunately they also said yes to poisoning defense 
policy with partisan politics he said decisions on national 
defense are now being based on the latest political poll at the 
white house he said 
bentsen received an enthusiastic welcome from the group but the 
400 or so people who listened filled less than half the auditorium 
bentsen himself more conservative than dukakis on defense and 
foreign policy did not respond specifically to bushs attacks on 
dukakis defense positions including opposition to new nuclear 
weapons systems he also made no mention of the senates current 
wrangling over aid to the nicaraguan rebels which the senator 
supports but dukakis opposes 
the american gi forum is a 150000 member organization of 
hispanic veterans formed after world war ii and bentsen made a 
general pitch for support from the hispanic community 
you will see an administration committed to good jobs at fair 
wages not just along the east and west coasts but here in corpus 
christi in the rio grande valley in the barrios of los 
angeles he said 
hispanics are important in the 1988 election he said you are 
strongest in the states where this election could be decided here 
in texas and in california 
he poked at bushs promise to put a hispanic in his cabinet 
hispanic americans arent maneuvering for a cabinet post he 
said what theyre saying is dont do us any favors just 
put is where the action is 
some in the group had been critical of dukakis for not 
appearing bentsen a native of the rio grande valley and a bomber 
pilot in world war ii who has a long relationship with the group 
tried to deflect that criticism 
speaking in spanish he said he had asked group president hector 
p garcia why the vice presidential candidate was not sufficient 
garcia told him he said oh lloyd youre not important youre 
family 
bentsen received 90 percent of the hispanic vote in his last 
senate campaign in 1982 in addition to seeking the vice 
presidency bentsen is on the ballot in texas for reelection to 
the senate 
bentsens stop in corpus christi was part of a oneday campaign 
sprint he was stopping next in kentucky at a big picnic before 
returning to washington

churches are losing their hold on the 
hearts and souls of americans in part because theyre too busy 
taking care of their own to reach outsiders leaders at an 
evangelism conference said 
we do almost nothing for the truly unchurched said the 
rev alvin a illig director of the washington dcbased paulist 
national catholic evangelization association 
he noted that 44 percent of adult americans 78 million people 
consider themselves unchurched meaning they belong to no 
church or attend services only on holidays or for weddings or 
funerals according to a recent gallup poll 
that is up from 41 percent or 61 million 10 years ago the 
gallup organization said 
ninetynine percent of us catholic parishes consciously choose 
not to try to reach the average of 4000 unchurched people who live 
in each parish illig said friday at congress 88 a national 
evangelism conference in this chicago suburb 
the vast majority of our time effort and money is spent on 
maintaining the faith of the active added illig whose 
organization is a missionary arm of the church that reaches out to 
inactive catholics and noncatholics 
protestant churches are just as guilty as catholic churches in 
that regard illig said 
paul benjamin director of the washington dcbased national 
church growth research center agreed 
american churches are going to have to take a really sharp 
look at themselves said benjamin a minister in the 15million 
member christian church movement 
theres a tendency in the church to go along with business as 
usual what these people want is a congregation that has warmth and 
a biblical emphasis he said 
i think churches are going to have to tone down their blatant 
fundraising and realize that people are more important than 
things benjamin added 
sometimes churches are put off by the challenge of reaching 
potential members illig said 
thats a community of people that is often nonresponsive and 
its an enormous amount of work with very little results and at 
times it can be very discouraging he said 
but it can make all the difference said the rev william j 
carl iii pastor at first presbyterian church in dallas 
in the 1970s he said his church made a pivotal decision not to 
follow affluent members to the suburbs and to start caring for the 
homeless and hungry on its doorstep 
the press picked it up and we got a flood of volunteers and 
money said carl whose 1850member church now boasts 11 
million in annual pledges almost double the 600000 low reached 
during its transition period 
we have served 800000 meals in the last 13 years carl said

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans radio address saturday given by sen sam nunn 
dga 
good afternoon 
americas defense and foreign policy can only be successful when 
it is supported by a bipartisan consensus in the congress we are 
reminded of this truth by the withdrawal of soviet forces from 
afghanistan and the recent ratification of the intermediate nuclear 
forces treaty 
these achievements were not merely coincidences the courageous 
afghan resistance to soviet invaders was supported by two 
presidents and by a strong bipartisan consensus in the congress 
the important steps leading to the inf treaty were started by the 
carter administration and pursued with determination by the reagan 
administration with consistent support from republicans and 
democrats in congress 
on the other hand disarray in our defense and foreign policy 
has usually been the product of a divided congress and a divided 
america and can often be traced to irresponsible positions taken 
during presidential campaigns our nations failure to deploy a 
survivable landbased missile as well as the delays and costly 
mistakes made in deploying a new penetrating bomber and especially 
our inconsistent and unsuccessful policy in central america are 
vivid examples 
this week president reagans veto of the national defense 
authorization bill represents another serious setback to building a 
bipartisan consensus regarding americas national security policy 
although vice president bush clearly was anxious to toss 
national defense into the political arena i had hoped that 
president reagan would place national security above partisan 
considerations 
i had hoped that president reagan would listen to those who 
urged him not to veto this important bill including his secretary 
of defense his national security adviser and key republican 
members of congress who are experts on national defense like sen 
john warner sen strom thurmond sen ted stevens sen bill cohen 
and sen jake garn unfortunately the president followed the advice 
not of his national security team but rather of vice president 
bushs political team he made this decision without consulting a 
single democrat in the congress 
we will continue to work for the enactment of this important 
defense bill but it will not be easy to put humptydumpty back 
together again congress must be clearly told who speaks for the 
president on national security matters i am confident that we can 
develop a bill that is acceptable to president reagans secretary 
of defense and his national security adviser but i do not believe 
we can reach agreement with the vice presidents political pollster 
and his campaign manager 
the challenge before us however is much broader than simply 
getting this important bill enacted 
if we are to safeguard our nations security we must insist on 
clarity and common sense in our security strategy toughminded 
management of the pentagon measures to reduce the risk of war a 
greater sharing of the burden of defense by our allies and a 
foreign policy grounded in respect for our constitution and our 
basic values 
the next president must appoint experienced capable managers 
who will insist on getting our moneys worth every defense dollar 
spent it takes more than a cash register to run an efficient and 
effective pentagon and it takes more than an adding machine to 
formulate a sound strategy and to set realistic priorities 
in recent years too many tax dollars have been wasted because we 
have produced too many procurement scandals and too few effective 
weapons 
we must also call for a new relationship with our allies to 
achieve a more equitable sharing of defense tasks and to improve 
our common defense through sensible specialization 
finally we must recognize that americas power rests not on 
military might alone but on a competitive economy a solvent 
government an educated people and above all on the democratic 
principles that we exemplify to the world 
as the campaign heats up and the political rhetoric inevitably 
increases i hope that we will remember that our national security 
is too important to be the hostage of partisan politics the late 
sen scoop jackson said it best when he said in matters of 
national security the best politics is no politics 
thank you and have a nice weekend

he also criticized the united nations for refusing to adopt a 
resolution calling for comprehensive global disarmament 
a coalition of peace groups issued a statement criticizing japan 
for its role in the war and accusing the citys atom bomb museum of 
neglecting koreans who were living in hiroshima and died in the 
blast 
the group called the liaison committee on the war of 
aggression said the museum refused to exhibit facts about the 
citys military buildup prior to the bombing 
japan has come under sharp criticism from its asian neighbors 
for deleting or altering references to its world war ii military 
actions from school textbooks 
in seoul south korea about 300 korean survivors of the bombing 
attended a memorial service they said they had been ignored and 
called for compensation for their injuries from the united states 
japan and south korea news reports said 
many bomb victims stayed away from ceremonies preferring to 
mark the occasion in private 
dr itsuzo shigematsu chairman of the radiation effects 
research foundation said many victims dont want to remember the 
day the bomb was dropped because it is too painful 
after nightfall relatives of people killed in the blast wrote 
the names of victims on paper floats then sent the floats down the 
citys river

president reagan appealed for bipartisan 
support of his military spending programs saturday and charged 
congress with trying to handcuff the president in our arms 
reduction negotiations with the soviets 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committeehowever charged that reagan followed political rather 
than national security advice in his decision to veto the pentagon 
spending bill congress sent him 
in his weekly radio address delivered from the oval office 
reagan said his conscience required him to veto the 300 billion 
measure 
now that ive vetoed the defense bill there is talk on 
capitol hill about producing an even worse defense bill as an act 
of political retribution he said 
well let me ask you what could be more deplorable than to 
use the defense of this nation as a political pawn it wont 
happen not if i have anything to say about it 
as long as i am president our nations defenses including 
our strategic defenses will remain above partisan politics the 
president said 
nunn in the democratic response to the presidents address 
noted that vice president george bush the prospective republican 
presidential nominee had urged the president to veto the bill 
while secretary of defense frank c carlucci and others urged him 
to sign it 
although vice president bush clearly was anxious to toss 
national defense into the political arena i had hoped that 
president reagan would place national security above partisan 
considerations the senator said 
unfortunately the president followed the advice not of his 
national security team but rather of vice president bushs 
political team he made this decision without consulting a single 
democrat in the congress 
nunn said democrats will continue work on a defense spending 
bill but it will not be easy to put humptydumpty back together 
again 
i am confident that we can develop a bill that is acceptable 
to president reagans secretary of defense and his national 
security adviser but i do not believe we can reach agreement with 
the vice presidents political pollster and his campaign manager 
he said 
reagan said congress needs to go back to work to pass a new 
defense bill one that i can sign because it strengthens our 
negotiating hand instead of weakening it 
we may be republicans or democrats but when it comes to a 
strongly defended nation we must all be simply americans said 
the president 
the bill represents an attempt by congress to handcuff the 
president in our arms reduction negotiations with the soviets and 
this kind of unilateral concession to the soviets could set back 
all the progress we have made on the arms reduction front he 
said 
in vetoing the bill wednesday reagan conceded that it offered 
more funds than he requested but said it was loaded with 
requirements that would jeopardize his defense program and weaken 
us posture in arms control talks with the soviet union 
specifically he said and repeated in his radio address that 
among other things the bill would have crippled his spacebased 
star wars or strategic defense initiative program 
i could not in good conscience have done anything other than 
mark that bill veto and send it right back he said

more than two months before the uss 
vincennes mistakenly shot down an iranian jetliner confusing radar 
signals caused three other american warships to believe they were 
under attack by nonexistent iranian missiles 
possibly because no casualties occurred neither the mixup 
during an april 18 skirmish between us and iranian forces nor a 
subsequent investigation by the us central command headquarters 
attracted much public attention at the time 
but for the us navy the incident raised some of the same 
questions that officials have confronted in the vincennes tragedy 
whether commanders can depend on information fed to them in a 
fastchanging combat situation where they must make splitsecond 
decisions 
pentagon sources say a report to be issued this month finds 
human error in the heat of combat caused vincennes radar 
operators to think the iran air a300 airbus was an attacking 
fighter 
all 290 aboard died when the plane was shot down july 3 over the 
persian gulf 
the april 18 incident occurred during a oneday miniwar that 
flared in the southern gulf after the united states attacked three 
iranian oil platforms in reprisal for the sowing of mines by iran 
during the fighting in which six iranian naval craft were sunk 
or disabled radar operators aboard the us missile frigate jack 
williams picked up signals indicating that chinesemade silkworm 
antiship missiles were being fired from the iranian coast in the 
strait of hormuz 
the ships which included the destroyer obrien and the missile 
destroyer joseph strauss took evasive action and launched chaff to 
confuse the missiles guidance systems 
the jack willliams skipper cmdr edward mann and capt donald 
a dyer who was commanding the threeship group told a 
fivemember pentagon news pool aboard the frigate that four 
silkworms were fired over a span of about an hour 
the officers were incredulous when top pentagon officials later 
that day said that no silkworms had been fired 
in a news conference here june 3 the chief of central command 
gen george b crist said a subsequent analysis by electronic 
warfare experts found no hostile missiles were fired and the radar 
operators had misread tracks of those fired by us ships and 
planes 
what you got was a number of missiles outgoing a number of 
laserguided bombs and missiles coming in from us aircraft 
hits on the system as they picked up seekers and missiles moving 
through the air said crist 
he said ship commanders had reacted properly because had they 
been missiles incoming and they didnt take the necessary actions 
they would have been in trouble 
in response to queries from the associated press spokesmen for 
the tampa floridabased central command said an investigation of 
the april 18 mixup found no evidence of human error inadequate 
training or equipment malfunction 
they conceded that the same thing could happen again in similar 
circumstances but said the report did not make any specific 
recommendations for change 
what you had was a combat scenario which is always 
characterized by confusion such a scenario could be duplicated 
again in the gulf or anywhere in the world said maj barry 
willey 
we are changing procedures constantly on the basis of whats 
learned all the forces take a close look after something like 
that he said 
some officers have compared the situation to that faced by 
vincennes skipper capt will c rogers iii who has said he would 
respond the same way if given the same data again 
the best decisions always depend on the flow of information 
getting to the top says capt alex g balian commander of the 
amphibious assault ship dubuque 
some gulfbased navy officers say the radar operators might have 
misread the silkworm blips because they were unfamiliar dont 
forget iran has never fired one in the hormuz said one 
although the jack williams radar is nowhere near as 
sophisticated as the vincennes aegis system both investigations 
relied heavily on analysis of tapes from ships computers the 
vincennes probers also interviewed many participants and took sworn 
testimony 
it was not known whether the earlier inquiry dealt with the fact 
that a us navy helicopter had to dodge a missile fired by the 
jack williams or with eyewitnesses claims of seeing one silkworm 
cross behind the frigate and hit a distant oil platform

president reagan is preparing to sign 
legislation to curb us trade deficits with most of its tough 
enforcement features long gone most of its benefits for key 
industries still intact and almost everybody happy with the end 
product 
america is starting back majority leader robert c byrd 
declared wednesday as the senate gave 8511 approval to the measure 
and sped it toward reagans desk and a guaranteed signature 
bandwagon rhetoric swept the senate leaving in the dust a 
handful of critics bold enough to find flaws in the 1000page 
measure some of whom grudgingly voted for the bill 
unfortunately the bill is still wrongheaded declared sen 
phil gramm rtexas who voted for it nevertheless 
he proclaimed himself torn between what he regards as a 
lingering aura of protectionism and a provision that would repeal 
the 1980 windfall profits tax he is a critic of both protectionism 
and the tax on oil industry earnings 
for a while he said he thought about cheering loudly for the 
bill and voting quietly against it on the other hand i would 
have to admit that there would be a little hypocrisy in that 
gramm added 
he ended up voting for the measure but i do not want anybody 
to be confused that somehow i think this is a good bill 
as measured by the overwhelming majority of lawmakers what 
protectionist features were once part of the bill are long gone 
major provisions would streamline machinery under which the 
government imposes tariffs and quotas on imports to protect us 
industries being damaged by imports and retaliate against 
international trade violations 
but authority to take such steps already exists new provisions 
would require industries benefiting from import restraints to show 
that they could become competitive and thus could actually make 
such protection harder to get 
no intense debate has focused on these provisions for months 
for many lawmakers in both houses the key was repeal of the 
windfall profits tax it has not produced revenues since oil prices 
plunged in 1985 but it continues to be hated in texas and other 
oilproducing states 
and if concerted efforts by the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries succeeded in raising oil prices the tax would 
generate revenue once again it also could be much harder to repeal 
if budget makers were counting on it to help them meet fiscal 
targets under the grammrudman law 
farm lawmakers were once among the quickest to view any trade 
legislation as restrictive and thus likely to trigger retaliation 
against american exports by asian nations that buy large amounts of 
us grain 
indeed japan remains the american farmers top customer with 
more than 5 billion a year in agricultural purchases from the 
united states 
but farm lawmakers were brought on board with a potentially 
lavish outlay of subsidy dollars for agricultural exporters and 
farmers themselves 
the export enhancement program established under the 1985 farm 
act would get a new lease on life with a 25 billion 
authorization it pays exporters with government surplus crops to 
ship american farm goods overseas and has been an increasingly 
important part of the trade equation 
meanwhile 500 million would be authorized for advertising and 
promotional activities on behalf of us farm products in foreign 
markets 
wheat feed grains and soybean growers could become eligible for 
marketing loans under the bill these are sizeable export subsidies 
that would be triggered if negotiators failed to make progress 
in the uruguay round of international trade negotiations now in 
progress 
it was the need for authority to conclude such deals in the 
uruguay round that was the reagan administrations major reason for 
reversing course and seeking a trade bill after three years of 
throwing cold water on the need for such legislation 
the negotiations named for a kickoff meeting held in uruguay 
but taking place in geneva have two more years to run and us 
participants view having the authority as necessary to make 
progress 
reagan had largely ignored earlier attempts by congress to force 
him to accept a trade bill by threatening to withhold negotiating 
authority trade officials however said the administration 
concluded that it was time to get the authority 
the massive bill is most often described as aimed at curbing 
us trade deficits although it has many purposes 
actually us trade deficits have been coming down fairly 
steadily for the last eight months the red ink was a record 1703 
billion last year it was 693 billion for the first five months 
of 1987 and 586 billion for the same period this year 
on a monthly basis the trade deficit peaked at 155 billion in 
october since then it has fluctuated but the trend has been 
steadily down it was below 11 billion in both april and may the 
most recent figures available 
the administration primarily credits a steady downward march of 
the dollar which it engineered starting in september 1985 at the 
same time it announced a crackdown on unfair practices by us 
trading partners 
threats of retaliation against such practices have been made in 
a number of cases and the more energetic approach appears to have 
registered with some lawmakers but retaliation has come in only 
two cases 
tariffs on japanese electronics were raised in retaliation 
against dumping or selling at prices slashed below the cost of 
production of computer chips duties also went up on european 
pasta in retaliation for common market restrictions on us citrus 
goods

the low hum of voices is continuous 
punctuated by ringing telephones and the crackling of a shortwave 
radio at the boise interagency fire center the nations command 
post for the war on wildfires 
the operation is described as organized chaos by fire center 
spokesman arnold hartigan partly because this years dry weather 
means it is staffed around the clock at a time of year when it 
normally would operate only in the daytime 
beginning with the spring fire season in the south and peaking 
with roaring fires of late summer in the west a staff of around 20 
per shift depending on the number and severity of fires routes 
everything from toilet paper to bulldozers to create the small 
towns that mushroom around base camps at major fires 
about 8800 firefighters are battling the worst of some 200 
blazes in the west and alaska 16 of them considered major fires 
nearly a third of the manpower is in yellowstone national park 
where fires have charred 140000 acres 
six major fires were still burning in yellowstone on saturday 
a 29240acre fire situated mostly in the bridgerteton national 
forest had charred about 6400 acres inside the remote southeastern 
section of yellowstone 
along with the firefighters themselves manpower for food 
service public information law enforcement and heliport 
operations is pulled from every corner of the nation 
we have to put this foamer out over old faithful today if its 
going to do what its supposed to jonel wagoner tells her 
supervisor on the supply desk at the command center he quickly 
gets on another phone to find the retardant 
another phone rings a fire manager needs special couplings for 
his equipment as soon as possible 
we can throw em on the bifc truck heading that way rick 
squires assures him 
three control desks in the logistics center are covered with 
colorcoded requisition orders blue for helicopters orange for 
air tankers green for manpower red for equipment specialists 
check computer terminals to locate resources needed on the fireline 
in some remote mountainous area 
the logistics center keeps shuffling crews in and out of 
hotspots as fire bosses manage to contain one blaze in washington 
only to have a dry lightning storm or a careless smoker spark new 
ones in idaho or wyoming 
just a few days ago a fire blazed in the boise foothills 
outside the centers windows 
the pavement outside the centers huge warehouse is cluttered 
with boxes and equipment especially at night when trucks and 
cargo planes are loaded to fill requisitions while fire crews use 
the cool dark hours to get some rest 
in just the past month the center has moved the bulk of the 12 
million pounds of goods and equipment it has handled so far this 
year resources worth more than 8 million 
the force on the line now amounts to just over a third of the 
nations primary firefighting army but the driest hottest part of 
the summer still is ahead to date the centers biggest push has 
been the mobilization of 25 20man crews in a single day 
were getting more fires because its so dry hartigan said 
the number of fires is up 50 percent from last year but its a 
question of whats burned so far 
in 1985 the worst fire season in decades with 29 million acres 
burned some 1400 structures were lost to forest and brush fires 
this year the number of structures lost can still be counted in the 
dozens 
but nearly 24 million acres have burned this year and while 
over half of that has been in remote roadless terrain in alaska 
the total has already exceeded fire acreage for all of 1987 land 
managers fear it will exceed the acreage burned in 1985

an amtrak spokeswoman in washington dc 
the train was carrying about 375 passengers and a crew of 10 to

amtrak made arrangements saturday to get passengers to their 
destinations 
about 85 passengers left nearby glasgow mont on a bus for 
spokane wash and other passengers planned to fly to their 
destinations martin said 
its sort of a difficult situation because the airport at 
glasgow is not a commercial airport she said its an old 
stragetic air command facility thats normally used for test 
flights so its a matter of getting things prepared for flights in 
and out of there weve been working throughout the night with a 
charter company and airport officials to find out exactly what kind 
of aircraft we can use out of there 
some passengers decided to remain in glasgow and take a 
westbound train saturday martin said 
investigators from the national transportation safety board and 
burlington northern railroad which owns the track were due 
saturday martin said 
assistant conductor dennis cotton said the cars hardest hit by 
the derailment were the dining car the dorm and sleeper coaches 
the first thing that happened was a brief jerk a slowdown and 
people in the aisles went sailing by said jim matuska a 
passenger from girard ill the car was beginning to tilt i was 
pretty sure we were going to go down but i didnt have the presence 
of mind to do anything i was out of control i went flying in the 
opposite direction

of the line in paris gare de lest station saturday killing one 
person injuring 57 and trapping some victims for more than two 
hours authorities said

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address given from the white house oval office 
my fellow americans on wednesday of this past week i took a 
dramatic step one that i must admit gave me no pleasure 
i vetoed the defense authorization bill as it stood the 
defense bill that congress sent me would have made unilateral 
concessions to the soviets at the very moment when were trying to 
achieve a strategic arms reduction treaty i could not in good 
conscience have done anything other than mark that bill veto 
and send it right back 
permit me to discuss with you for a moment just whats at stake 
in this whole matter of the defense bill and in doing so its 
important to begin with some historical background you see it was 
just eight years ago that americas defenses were in a pitiable 
state weaker relative to the threats we faced than at any time 
in decades 
we had airplanes that couldnt fly for lack of spare parts our 
navy had declined from more than a thousand battleready ships to 
fewer than 500 among our men and women in uniform morale was 
understandably low 
and yet at the same time the soviet union was embarked upon a 
massive arms buildup enlarging its armed forces on land sea and 
air the soviet union had invaded afghanistan it was backing 
communist expansion in africa in asia and yes with the 
sandinistas in nicaragua in our hemisphere 
the trend was clear american power and influence were 
declining while the power of the totalitarian world was growing 
greater and greater the implications for the cause of freedom for 
the cause of peace were grim the trend had to be reversed 
during these last eight years weve done just that restoring 
americas strength the results well today the soviets are 
withdrawing from afghanistan were seeing progress in settling 
regional conflicts and not long ago an american president 
returned from a successful summit in moscow having earlier signed 
the first treaty in history that actually reduces nuclear arsenals 
by the way if we had listened to those who wanted to stop the 
deployment of our inf missiles in europe the socalled freeze 
movement we would have thrown away the bargaining leverage that 
forced the soviets to return to the negotiating table we would not 
have signed the inf treaty in washington and soviet ss20 missiles 
would still be pointed at our allies 
this brings me back to the defense bill that i just vetoed 
you see if i had accepted that bill it would have undermined 
the strength we worked so hard to restore in time jeopardizing 
all our remarkable diplomatic advances 
congress defense bill represented an allbutopen attempt to 
block our strategic defense initiative or as we call it sdi yet 
no development has been of greater importance in our strategic arms 
negotiations with the soviets than our decision to proceed with sdi 
the idea of sdi is simple to give us the advance technologies 
necessary to defend us and our allies from attack by nuclear armed 
ballistic missiles some said it would take years to develop such a 
technologically sophisticated defense system we said all the more 
reason to get started right now and in fact as sdi has gone 
forward overall progress has taken place even faster than we had 
hoped 
perhaps the best endorsement for sdi comes from the soviets 
themselves since theyve long engaged in many kinds of strategic 
defense programs of their own 
but congress wants to cut our budget request for sdi deeply 
congress also wants to cut all requests for funding one of the most 
promising sdi technologies the spacebased interceptor program by 
over 70 percent 
it is not just the damage done to sdis funding and space 
component that concerns me from requirements for unilateral 
disarmament missile testing the bill represents an attempt by 
congress to handcuff the president in our arms reduction 
negotiations with the soviets and this kind of unilateral 
concession with the soviets could set back all the progress weve 
made on the arms reduction front 
now that i have vetoed the defense bill theres talk on capital 
hill about producing an even worse defense bill as an act of 
political retribution well let me ask you what could be more 
deplorable than to use the defense of this nation as a political 
pawn it wont happen not if i have anything to say about it 
as long as im president our nations defenses including our 
strategic defenses will remain above partisan politics 
congress needs to go back to work to pass a new defense bill 
one that i can sign because it strengthens our negotiating hand 
instead of weakening it we may be republicans or democrats but 
when it comes to a stronglydefended nation we must all be simply 
americans 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

the united states is granting asylum to three 
chinese couples and their families because of fear they would face 
persecution for violating chinas stringent familyplanning policy 
the justice department said saturday 
attorney general edwin meese approved requests for asylum from 
the three families under new department guidelines that pertain to 
chinas family planning program a department spokeswoman said 
the three chinese citizens who along with their families are to 
be granted asylum were identified as dr quan bang li dacheng cong 
and jiguang zhou 
li is believed to be a resident of phoenix ariz where he been 
working as a mechanical engineer according to the washington post 
the whereabouts of the other two families could not be determined 
saturday 
deborah wade a spokeswoman for the justice department said she 
had no additional information about the families and presumed that 
some of them wish to avoid publicity 
the chinese government in an attempt to curb population growth 
has adopted a policy aimed at encouraging families to limit their 
size to no more than one child 
a couple with only one child receives free health care for the 
child as well as priority in schooling and housing increased 
pensions and salary bonuses 
people who have more than one child however may lose their 
membership in the communist party be fired from their job and find 
the purchase of certain items such as fuel and agricultural 
supplies difficult according to a recent state department report 
on human rights around the world 
in granting asylum to the three families the department gave 
its first indication that it had adopted new guidelines in dealing 
with couples who request asylum as a result of chinas family 
planning policies 
these guidelines call on immigration officials to give careful 
consideration to such applications when the chinese citizens 
express a fear of persecution upon return to china because 
they refuse to abort a pregnancy or resist sterilization after 
the birth of one child 
if such refusal is undertaken as an act of conscience with 
full awareness as to the severe consequences which may be 
imposed by chinese officials for violation of the family 
planning policy it may be appropriate to view such refusal as 
an act of political defiance sufficient to establish refugee 
status the new department guidelines say

fight the national union for the total independence of angola or 
unita a guerrilla movement which receives military aid from south 
africa and the united states

namibia was terminated by the united nations in 1966 but it has 
retained control over the territory in defiance of several un

a garbageman who found a picture of a 
partially dressed woman while collecting trash did not violate her 
constitutional rights by showing the photo to friends and owes no 
damages a federal judge ruled 
the court premised its decision in part on the basis that 
people should expect their trash to be searched by trash 
collectors us district judge sam c pointer wrote 
pointer said his july 25 opinion was based partly on a may 
supreme court decision that gave police the right to use evidence 
rooted out of the trash in criminal cases 
the trash collectors display of the photograph showing the 
woman in her underwear was clearly for his own amusement but 
violated no federal law or constitutional rights the judge said 
the womans attorney craig izard said the photograph was taken 
as a prank by her daughter while the woman dressed last december 
the photo was not in any way suggestive but the woman found it 
embarrassing he said 
the lawsuit was filed may 10 by the woman and her husband it 
named the city of oneonta and the trash collector identified as 
richard eakes as defendants 
izard asked that the name of his client not be used she lives 
in a very small town and it would be embarrassing to her its bad 
enough whats already happened he said 
according to the suit the man was showing off the photograph at 
a christmas family gathering when one of the womans friends or 
relatives realized who it was 
the mans publication of a photo of a partly clad woman may 
have caused embarrassment to her and her husband pointer wrote 
this does not however infringe upon any constitutionally 
protected liberty interest 
the couple is considering an appeal or possibly a state lawsuit 
izard said

city manager neil deluca outlined his 
doomsday scenario as fines levied by a federal judge mounted 
first he would lay off nonessential workers then sanitation 
workers and then police and firefighters finally hed fire 
himself 
it might be the best thing that ever happened to me he said 
a dispute between a defiant city council and a judge who ordered 
it to desegregate housing has split this already divided city 
which has been hit with fines that double daily and could bankrupt 
yonkers this month unless the council complies with the order or 
gets an appeals court to intervene 
the city moves from crisis to crisis and this is the worst 
yet said former mayor angelo martinelli its one thing to 
have the councilmen go down its another to see the city go down 
the tubes after all everyone has done in the past to save it 
yonkers hovered on the brink of bankruptcy in 1984 because it 
underfunded its school system 
in 1985 us district leonard sand who last week found the 
city in contempt and imposed the fines found the city liable for 
40 years of intentionally segregating its schools through 
segregated housing 
the racial divisions evolved through the citys shape split by 
the saw mill river parkway with the older more industrial section 
on the west and the affluent area which includes sarah lawrence 
college and houses with manicured lawns to the east 
some 6800 units of lowincome housing were built in the 1960s 
mostly on the west side originally they housed the irish 
italians and slavs but those groups prospered and moved to the 
east side 
blacks and hispanics from new york citys borough of the bronx 
on yonkers southern border took their place and now account for 
nearly 30 percent of the citys population 
the judge wants the city to build low and middleincome housing 
all over the city not just on the west side 
but last week the city council voted 43 to reject a package of 
incentives to attract developers of 800 housing units 
sand as promised assessed fines of 500 a day against each 
recalcitrant councilman and an escalating fine against the city 
that began at 100 a day tuesday and doubles daily it reaches 
3200 sunday and by day 22 the citys 337 million budget will be 
wiped out along with the jobs of its 1800 municipal employees 
the councilmen also are threatened with jail terms if they are 
still in contempt after aug 10 
the real tragedy is yonkers was doing so well economically 
before this said mayor nicholas wasiscko 29 who supports the 
desegregation order weve had three years of surpluses and there 
really has been an economic rebirth except for this 
once the city of 200000 people was known as the city of 
gracious living some black leaders now call it the city of racist 
living 
whites will violate the law to keep blacks out of their 
neighborhoods whites will pay huge fines to keep blacks out of 
their neighborhoods and whites may even go to jail to keep blacks 
out of their neighborhoods said marvin andisson 27 who lives 
in the schlobohm houses one of the citys worst housing projects 
others say race is not at issue i am absolutely convinced it 
is a dispute of class said gov mario cuomo 
residents focus on the effect of the judges order on the value 
of their homes and complain bitterly that yonkers is being 
persecuted 
yonkers has 24 percent of the population of westchester county 
but about 40 percent of the countys lowincome housing other 
towns have none 
opponents of the judges housing plan fear their town might 
follow the path that transformed the bronx into new yorks poorest 
borough 
we worked and saved all our lives so we could move out of the 
bronx to this beautiful neighborhood and for what asked john 
loggio 62 whose house faces a site for 22 lowincome homes so 
we wont be able to sell our house its value has lost 100000 
on the other side of town a few blacks are opposed to the plan 
too like stonewall odom who said sands order could ruin the 
black community and its political base he called it plantation 
politics 
we need education jobs we dont need any more handouts 
judge sand is condemning my son to poverty odom said 
allen cunningham a black who moved to yonkers two years ago 
said that while blacks need housing its going to hurt relations 
between blacks and whites its going to hurt us 
some of the councilmen who voted against the housing plan last 
week received bullets and dead rats in the mail earlier this year 
when they approved a consent agreement providing for the housing 
now that the councilmen have reversed themselves some groups 
have promised to hold fundraisers for their defense 
we hope they wont betray us again resident bernadette 
mclaughlin said after the councils most recent vote we know we 
arent guilty of anything weve done nothing wrong

soldiers armed with bayonets patrolled 
the streets of the burmese capital saturday and authorities began 
selling food to counter soaring prices and hoarding officials and 
travelers said 
thai and western travelers returning to bangkok from rangoon 
described the city as quiet but tense with armed soldiers 
stationed at street corners and small groups of people gathering to 
discuss the countrys troubles soldiers placed empty oil barrels 
along some streets to force vehicles to proceed slowly they said 
thousands of burmese demonstrated in the past two weeks against 
newlyelected president sein lwin who moved quickly to quash all 
political dissent he ordered the arrests of the most outspoken 
critics of the authoritarian system and several other people 
including associated press correspondent sein win 
sein lwin was elected president and chairman of burmas only 
political party after the resignation of ne win a general who 
seized power in 1962 
the president promised economic reforms and authorities 
saturday began selling such items as rice cooking oil salt and 
fish through various cooperatives units to help relieve manual 
laborers and lowincome earners affected by rising prices of basic 
foodstuffs the official radio rangoon reported 
the price of rice which one western diplomat called a 
barometer of tension in burma has quadrupled over the past 
few months 
farmers and traders are hoarding it because theres no 
confidence in the present government said the diplomat who 
spoke on condition of anonymity if that leads to 
shortagesthat might trigger more violence 
rangoonbased diplomats link the price increases hoarding of 
food and other economic hardships to the general tension in the 
country 
sein lwin has endorsed a package of reforms aimed at loosening 
government control over the economy and attracting private foreign 
investment which has been forbidden 
but diplomats in rangoon and visitors to the capital in recent 
days say burmese businessmen appear to be skeptical of the proposed 
measures and fear another demonetization of the currency as a 
simplistic way to deal with inflation 
the government last fall suddenly withdrew several currency 
notes from circulation without compensation sparking riots and 
talk among burmese that the government had engaged in official 
robbery 
some businessmen reportedly say that the 64yearold sein lwin 
may push the reforms through in order to cling to power but believe 
there will be little followup to the measures since the former 
military officer is considered an old guard socialist 
once regarded as a potential economic power in southeast asia 
burmas influence slipped under sein lwins predecessor 
over the past year conditions have worsened and burma with an 
annual per capita income of less than 200 and a 4 billion debt 
was forced to apply to the united nations for least developed 
developing country status 
although the state in principle supports providing basic food 
supplies to its people through governmentrun stores and 
cooperatives the population has had to rely in recent years on a 
vast black market stocked with items smuggled from other asian 
countries 
however residents say even the once plentiful goods on 
rangoons free markets have disappeared recently accompanied 
by soaring prices 
the illegal trade has also deprived the government of badly 
needed revenue with luxury items such as jade rubies gold teak 
cattle and antiques leaving the country in exchange for basic 
necessities

srivastava the director of the seismological observatory in new 
delhi no major quakes have occurred in the region in recent years 
but an earthquake in 1950 killed about 300 people in assam

measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph every increase 
of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude

of widespread damage in populated areas

more than 30000 people on may 31 1935

democrat michael dukakis met with western 
governors and other democratic officials saturday declaring he 
loves the west and leads in the region over republican george 
bush 
dukakis the massachusetts governor and democratic presidential 
nominee met in private for nearly three hours with the democratic 
group and emerged saying they were in broad agreement on western 
concerns and the chances for a democratic victory in the region 
that has been dominated by the gop in presidential elections since 
1964 
were ahead now theres no reason why we shouldnt stay ahead 
and build on that lead and i think its because the people of the 
west are ready for change said dukakis who later donned a 
cowboy hat and was presented with a pair of cowboy boots 
i think we have an opportunity to win the west and i mean all 
the west he said 
dukakis revealed no specific policy agreements reached with the 
nearly 50 elected democrats including governors from 10 states 
members of congress and former governors on questions of water and 
oil big issues in much of the west dukakis said only that he 
wanted a national energy policy and a national water 
policy while voicing caution about diverting water between 
regions 
among those present for the meeting were former presidential 
candidates bruce babbitt the former governor of arizona and gary 
hart the former colorado senator 
dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas was 
campaigning in his home state saturday where he told a group of 
hispanic veterans that the republicans were playing politics with 
national defense 
decisions on national defense are now being based on the 
latest political poll at the white house bentsen said in an 
appearance before the american gi forum 
bush meanwhile was spending the weekend at his home at 
kennebunkport maine where no public events were scheduled 
dukakis was concluding a threeday campaign swing that took him 
from mississippi to california and washington state before stopping 
in colorado 
dukakis began his day in denver with a brisk 26 mile walking 
workout at dawn in a park along with colorado gov roy romer 
california sen alan cranston and some of the reporters and 
photographers who travel with him 
dukakis invited them along at the end of a week in which he 
faced questions about his health he later said of the press 
theyre in bad physical condition and im worried about them 
he spoke to about 2000 people at an outdoor rally in the same 
park standing in the hot sun before a spectacular view of spouting 
water the denver skyline and the rocky mountains he planned a 
brief stop in cedar rapids iowa on his way back to boston 
dukakis enjoys a substantial lead over bush in most national 
polls but pollsters rate colorado as a tossup 
appearing with some of the officials at a news conference after 
the meeting dukakis said he favored placing restrictions on small 
handguns but said he recognized the perfectly legitimate right 
of sportsmen and others to own guns 
my principle concern is small concealable handguns whose only 
purpose is to kill people dukakis said he had been asked if he 
supported national gun control legislation 
referring to those small weapons he said i think they have 
to be subject to strict regulation 
making his second visit to colorado in a month dukakis 
described himself as someone who loves the west and that after 
campaigning in the region he is impressed even more with its 
grandeur its uniqueness with the independence and the values of 
its people 
believe me he said youre going to see me out here many 
many times if elected

the republican chairman of the national 
governors association opened the groups electionyear meeting 
saturday with a pledge to make the conference nonpolitical and 
nonpartisan 
im going to display tremendous discipline said gov john 
sununu of new hampshire a strong supporter of vice president 
george bush and frequent critic of gov michael dukakis his 
massachusetts neighbor and the democratic nominee for president 
dukakis planned to attend tuesdays final session of the 
fourday meeting of the nations governors 
president reagan was flying in monday to address the conference 
at a news conference opening the meeting sununu said im 
aware that our meeting has been bookended by the two major 
political gatherings of 1988 the democratic national convention 
and the republican national convention 
were also as governors very much aware that the success of 
the nga depends on the very bipartisan nonpartisan character of 
our deliberations 
he added that for my part im going to try to make this the 
most nonpolitical nonpartisan nonpresidential year event that 
youve ever seen 
participating in the news conference with sununu were two 
democratic governors host richard celeste of ohio and gerald 
baliles of virginia who is slated to succeed sununu as nga 
chairman 
the two democrats agreed that during the past seven and a half 
years president reagan had succeeded at times over the protests 
of governors in transferring many domestic responsibilities from 
the federal government to the states 
in keeping with sununus admonition to keep the meeting 
nonpolitical neither he nor his democratic colleagues would 
address directly the question of how they felt bush and dukakis 
would deal with relations between the federal and state governments 
i wont touch that one with a 10foot poll said sununu 
sununu has had a long bitter fight with dukakis over the 
seabrook nuclear power plant dukakis played a key role in blocking 
licensing of the facility that sits on the new hampshire seacoast 
near the massachusetts border 
an early backer of bush for the gop presidential nomination 
sununu was one of three governors said to be on bushs list of 
potential vice presidential choices the other two were jim 
thompson of illinois and carroll campbell of south carolina 
gov george deukmejian of california sent bush a letter asking 
that he not be consider for the no 2 spot on the national ticket 
the republican national convention convenes on aug 15 with bush 
the certain presidential nominee 
another governor thomas kean of new jersey will deliver the 
convention keynote address 
democrats outnumber republicans among the nations governors by 
a margin of 27 to 23 but many states expected to be major 
battlegrounds in the presidential election have republican 
governors 
in addition to california illinois and new jersey they 
include texas with gov william clements and florida with gov bob 
martinez 
big states with democratic governors include new york with mario

governors who played key roles at the democratic convention last 
month that nominated dukakis for president and texas sen lloyd 
bentsen for vice president were blanchard who was chairman of the 
democratic platform committee and gov bill clinton of arkansas who 
delivered the speech placing dukakis name in nomination 
once thought of as officials who could make a difference 
politically in their states governors have lost some of that 
luster in recent presidential elections 
the fact that democrats held a majority of the governorships in 
1980 did not help jimmy carter win reelection against reagans 
challenge and of course a democratic majority in statehouses did 
nothing to stem the reagan landslide in 1984 
the national governors association was meeting at a time when 
many of the chief executives were expressing concern over what they 
consider the erosion of the role of states in their relationship 
with the federal government 
because of supreme court decisions in recent months and years 
congress is free to regulate every minute detail of state 
administration and management and every sector of society that 
states traditionally had regulated said sununu 
one of the court decisions that upset governors was a ruling 
last spring that declared congress had the authority to end the 
federal tax exemption for state and local bonds

pitching him forward onto the metal rod which his father said was 
part of the rake 
while his brother jerry 15 rushed to a nearby house for help 
brian lifted himself from the rod and feeling dizzy lay down on 
the ground 
it was just scary brian said i pulled myself off i 
guess i didnt realize what i was doing 
i was scared i was going to die brian said it was 
close 
the boys father jerry soon arrived and he and his wife 
deborah placed ice towels and a damp cloth over the wound and 
took brian to carlisle hospital about 10 miles away brian was 
treated in the emergency room and transferred to polyclinic medical

archbishop of canterbury robert 
runcie leader of the worlds 70 million anglicans told the 
closing session of the lambeth conference of bishops saturday that 
what had been called an impossible conference was a success 
the first meeting in 10 years of the anglican bishops was 
overshadowed by the prospect of the consecration of the first 
anglican woman bishop in the next few months by churches in canada 
and new zealand and the us episcopal church some thought this 
conference was impossible reason and experience suggested we would 
fall apart but keeping our eyes on the lord we have not sunk 
runcie said 
critics said the controversial issue of the first woman bishop 
would break up the threeweek conference in canterbury wrecking 
the anglican communion of 27 selfgoverning churches in 164 
countries 
the opponents say the act would irreparably damage the bonds 
with anglican churches that want to keep the allmale episcopate 
and the church would decline into a loose federation with some 
dioceses breaking away 
the critics say traditionalist bishops would feel they could not 
be in communion with the consecrated women because bishops are 
regarded as successors of the apostles of jesus christ who were 
all men 
but runcie masterminded a compromise resolution which by a 
42328 vote pledged the churches to respect one anothers decisions 
and instructed him to set up and head a commission to examine 
relations between the churches when a woman bishop is actually 
consecrated 
i hope i speak for many others beside myself in testifying 
that this conference has for me created spiritual energy and fresh 
vision runcie said 
after three weeks of debate over issues of poverty injustice 
militarism and war the 66yearold archbishop said of the 
conference 
it has not been without conflict because persons of flesh and 
blood inevitably move in and out of conflict and grow through it 
most of all it has been joyful discovery the discovery of a 
common treasure despite our diversity 
runcie concluded with a quotation from a sermon preached more 
than 30 years ago at cambridge by martin niemoeller the german 
lutheran pastor and opponent of dictator adolf hitler 
as long as the church lives only for herself as long as peter 
the first of the apostles does not leave the boat she lives 
safely and undisturbed he said 
the bishops voted friday to let england continue appointing 
their leader the archbishop of canterbury 
pressure for an end to the custom stems from the rapid growth of 
the anglican church in africa asia and the pacific 
the bishops voted 177163 against a resolution asking the 
churches to consider the implications of the archbishop of 
canterbury being appointed from among any of the bishops of the 
anglican communion fortyfour delegates abstained 
runcie is spiritual head of the church of england and leader of 
anglicans worldwide including 25 million episcopalians in the 
united states 
the conference closes sunday with a service in canterbury 
cathedral the anglican mother church

ear force one a balloon likeness of 
mickey mouse was grounded by high wind saturday but seven small 
iowa towns still got a lift from the celebration of the 60th 
birthday of walt disneys famous cartoon character 
an estimated 15000 people filled this northcentral iowa 
community of 1200 for a parade fireworks and birthday party that 
doubled as a pep rally for sheffield and six neighboring towns 
depressed by the farm crisis of the 1980s and the drought of 1988 
children squealed for attention from mickey mouse his 
girlfriend minnie and pals donald duck and goofy and townsfolk 
quickly sold out thousands of tshirts and other souvenirs at the 
start of the twoday festival 
the rev dick streeter of first united methodist church in 
sheffield said residents hope the celebration will help the area 
commit itself to rebuilding its farmbased economy 
we discovered some things a few years ago that werent 
particularly pleasing the main street was boarding up and 
enrollment in our schools was declining we realized that the money 
was being funneled to the metropolitan areas streeter said 
its amazing what mickey mouse has done for us he added 
this is a disney movie come to life 
disney spokeswoman mimi schaff said the company normally 
celebrates milestone birthdays of cartoon characters at disneyland 
at anaheim calif disneyworld at orlando fla or in some major 
us city 
but the fair in sheffield is the first time disney has taken its 
party to a rural area she said 
the celebration was part of the unveiling of kernel mickey 
mouse a huge likeness planted in a 520acre farm field northeast 
of sheffield about 90 miles north of des moines 
the field planted in corn and oats features a 3mile 
circumference likeness of mickeys head and is easily recognizable 
from 30000 feet above the iowa countryside although it cant be 
seen from the ground 
the high visibility to 150 commercial airline flights passing 
overhead daily is why disneyland asked farmer dick pitzenberger and 
his sons to plant the field 
it wasnt that tricky to plant the curves werent that 
tight said rick pitzenberger cultivating it was a little 
tough 
farm fields across much of iowa are suffering from a severe 
drought and the 65 million corn plants that make up mickeys head 
are no different although they did benefit from some timely rain 
earlier this summer 
ear force one a 12story hotair balloon also shaped like 
mickeys head and topped with a birthday hat couldnt be inflated 
because of high wind 
the communities were putting together a huge birthday card to 
give mickey by the end of the weekend and 7 tshirts were a hot 
item 
weve just been pulling them out of the boxes and selling 
them said mary schissel of dougherty who said the 10000 shirts 
ordered for the twoday celebration were almost sold out in the 
first hours of the festival 
the post office was putting its stamp on the event with a 
special cancellation mark for post cards picturing mickeys 
likeness in the field 
weve sold more than 2000 of them said jane etnier the 
sheffield postmistress who called the event the biggest thing to 
happen in her hometown

islam for 1300 years

leader

hussainis murder was part of americas cia policy he charged 
that united states saudi arabia israel and zias government were 
collaborating to divide islam 
hussainis party issued a statement friday calling the 
assassination a calculated move and a conspiracy to plunge 
pakistan into civil war 
a resolution passed by the punjab branch of pakistans leading 
opposition party the pakistan peoples party said the killing was 
an attempt to thwart opposition demands related to a nov 16 
general election 
zia dismissed the civilian government may 29 and called the 
general election in which candidates will be forced to run as 
individuals rather than as members of a political party 
opposition parties have called on the president to lift this 
condition saying it is unfair to their candidates although 
hussaini also opposed this condition he was not considered a 
radical or an outspoken critic of the zia

king hussein closed his ministry for 
israelioccupied territories saturday official reports said but a 
government official pledged jordan would still honor its passports 
there and keep the border open to the west bank 
husseins moves which included a minor cabinet reshuffling 
came after his announcement last week that he would sever links 
with the west bank which jordan controlled before israel seized it 
in the 1967 middle east war 
the decision to transfer the remaining tasks of the ministry for 
occupied territories to the foreign ministry signaled the kings 
view that relations with the territories are now a foreign not a 
domestic matter 
hussein has said the changes are in response to the plos desire 
to secede and form its own state with its heart in the west 
bank 
however a senior government official said jordan would stay 
committed to the rights of its fellow palestinian citizens unless 
the plo asks the contrary 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said any 
citizen who holds the jordanian passport wherever he resides and 
regardless of his origin is considered a son of this country 
twothirds of jordans 35 million people are palestinians 
carrying jordanian passports all west bank residents and some from 
the gaza strip hold the jordanian passport 
jordans decisions unleashed widespread worry among west bank 
palestinians that they might no longer be allowed to travel to 
jordan 
commenting on the possibility of closing down the jordan river 
bridges that lead to the west bank the government official said 
this measure will never be taken under any circumstances 
the official jordan news agency said the king presided over a 
cabinet meeting late saturday and said the latest moves have 
enhanced the role of the plo as the prime party in solving the 
palestinian issue 
hussein was quoted as saying that cutting ties with the west 
bank foiled israeli plots aimed at setting up jordan as an 
alternative palestinian homeland 
the reagan administration and some officials in israel have 
called for talks on palestinian autonomy on the west bank with 
jordanian involvement 
jordans new body for dealing with the occupied territories the 
palestinian affairs department will be under the jurisdiction of 
foreign minister taher masri the official agency said 
under the reshuffling the incumbent minister for occupied 
territories marwan dudin became minister of labor staterun 
radio jordan said 
a senior jordanian official who spoke on condition of

israel television on saturday said authorities 
seized a draft of a declaration of independence drawn up by 
palestinians leaders who planned to set up a ploled state in the 
occupied territories and parts of israel 
the television said the seizure would either totally prevent or 
seriously disrupt the planned independence initiative and it 
broadcast what it said were portions of it 
the broadcast came one hour after us envoy richard murphy 
arrived for talks with israeli leaders the talks will focus on 
jordans cutting of ties with the occupied territorites and the 
impact on a us plan that hinged on jordanian representation of 
palestinians in middle east peace talks 
staterun television said the independence document was in works 
before jordans king hussein announced last week his intention to 
pull back from the occupied territories and hand over 
responsibility to the palestine liberation organization 
the report said a draft version was seized by the israeli 
security forces during a search at the east jerusalem arab studies 
institute immediately after the institutes leader feisal 
husseini was detained on aug 1 husseini is viewed by israeli 
officials as a leading plo figure 
it was the first time that the seizure of the draft declaration 
was announced and its contents revealed 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs office issued a statement which 
said the document was filled with insane and dangerous dreams 
that will not come true 
some palestinians suggested the document was leaked to justify 
husseinis arrest which was protested by the united states israel 
radio reported 
the television said that the paper called a declaration of 
palestinian independence document included names of dozens of 
palestinians who were to become members of a local parliament 
it was not immediately clear whether palestinians whose names 
appear on the list would be arrested 
it said the document called for a palestinian state headed by 
plo chairman yasser arafat with plo executive farouk kaddoumi as 
his foreign minister and heads of other plo factions as ministers 
the state would include the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
and some land inside israel according to the report israel seized 
the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from egypt in the 1967 
middle east war 
however palestinians who composed the document also called for 
recognition of israels right to exist and peace talks based on the 
clarification of future border lines linkage between the west bank 
and gaza and future ties with israel the television said 
it said the documents authors wanted to push israel to the 
wall by issuing the declaration and continuing violent protests 
while giving their state a chance of being recognized by supportive 
arab nations 
they also stressed the need to receive a soviet blessing the 
television said 
meanwhile hundreds of palestinians holding jordanian passports 
streamed across jordan river bridges into jordan to express concern 
over their future and king husseins decisions to sever links with 
palestinians in the occupied lands 
hussein canceled a 13 billion development plan for the west 
bank dissolved the lower house of parliament and announced the 
dismissal of 21200 palestinian employees working for jordanian 
institutions in the west bank and gaza 
on saturday he abolished the ministry for israelioccupied 
territories and put the foreign ministry in charge of its 
functions the move signaled the kingdoms view that relations with 
the territories were now a foreign not a domestic issue 
king hussein might close the bridges and if he does it will 
be my last visit to jordan said ammanborn salwa abu kaf 27 
arab sources said most of the palestinians traveling to jordan 
were concerned about their ties with relatives living in the 
kingdom children employed in the gulf states or economic links 
with jordan 
several palestinians said they planned to seek residence in 
jordan so that their families would not be separated 
in amman a government official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said saturday his government would keep those bridges 
open and continue to honor jordanian passports held by residents of 
the occupied territories 
shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir said jordans decision to 
dismantle the occupied territories ministry was yet another 
artificial step to separate palestinian arabs living on the east 
and west bank 
protests erupted saturday in the west bank and the gaza strip 
where underground palestinian leaders called on followers to 
greet murphy with demonstrations and clashes with troops 
murphy did not speak to reporters after his arrival he is due 
to meet sunday with shamir and foreign minister shimon peres 
troops wounded three arabs hours before murphys arrival and a 
15yearold boy died after being shot friday arab reports the 
army and israel radio said 
the death raised to 237 the number of palestinian victims in the 
uprising which began dec 8 four israelis also have died

the private british news agency reuters ltd 
says it has taken steps to avoid future procedural errors such 
as those that resulted in a 400000 fine for reexporting 
usorigin microcomputer equipment 
the commerce department on friday announced that reuters had 
agreed to the civil penalty the department said that between april 
1983 and december 1986 reuters made 488 shipments of such 
equipment from the united kingdom and other locations to various 
destinations around the world including east bloc countries 
reuters said it was under the mistaken belief that the shipments 
were permitted under a distribution license held by its us 
subsidiary 
reuters in a statement said it was the companys understanding 
that the department would have granted licenses for virtually all 
of those equipment shipments had the correct procedure been 
followed reuters has put in place extensive controls to avoid any 
future such procedural errors 
the department said reuters acknowledged that more than 100 of 
the shipments occurred while the company was subject to a 24month 
probationary period resulting from a previous case involving 
similar violations 
the 400000 fine includes 23400 which represents a civil 
penalty for the earlier violations that had been suspended and 
would have been waived if reuters had fully complied with 
regulations during the probationary period commerce said in a 
statement 
reuters voluntarily disclosed the violations to the commerce 
department and cooperated with the investigation the department 
said 
the commerce department administers and enforces the export 
administration act which restricts exports and reexports when 
necessary because of national security foreign policy or domestic 
short supply 
reuters added that the company maintains ownership and 
ultimate control over each item of the relatively unsophisticated 
equipment in question thus the risk of diversion and threat to 
us national security is diminished 
the computer equipment is used in reuters monitor service by 
clients trading on financial markets around the world according to 
the commerce department

hungarians convicted for their part in 
the 1956 popular antisoviet uprising will no longer face 
discrimination a high government official pledged in an interview 
published saturday 
interior minister istvan horvath also indicated that dissidents 
should not necessarily be regarded as enemies of the communist 
state and he predicted reform of the nations police 
the minister was quoted by the communist party daily 
nepszabadsag as saying that the calling to account in court 
should not mean an everlasting stigma 
the 1956 protagonists almost all of them have now been 
discharged from the legal point of view either as a result of 
individual mercy or judicial rehabilitation he was quoted as 
saying 
but he said some cases remain to be settled 
horvaths remarks suggested that authorities are willing to end 
job discrimination and denial of passports to people who played a 
role in the 1956 uprising which was crushed by soviets tanks and 
troops 
in given sharp social conflicts at the time of ideological 
and political clashes the term enemy may be applicable but it 
may not become a perpetual category a former enemy could become 
neutral in fact a cooperating partner even an ally and a 
friend he was quoted as saying 
horvath also said there should be guaranteed sanctions 
against abuse of authority in the name of the state 
he predicted a reform of hungarian police but gave no details 
he said public security in hungary excessively carries the 
imprint of the approach that had been based on the omnipotency of 
the state 
hungarian officials have been liberalizing political policies 
along the lines of reforms under soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
they have allowed greater freedom of the press and invited 
dissidents to engage the government in a dialogue 
but they also have said that the supreme authority of the 
communist party must remain intact

silently through the streets saturday in a show of solidarity with 
the roman catholic church 
the march organized by the church came six days after the 
church said it was being persecuted by the government 
agents of president alfredo stroessner who has ruled since 
seizing power in a 1954 coup watched the demonstration but did not 
intervene no incidents were reported 
tensions between the government and the church have risen since 
july 25 when spanish jesuit priest juan antonio de la vega was 
expelled to neighboring argentina allegedly for publicly 
advocating the overthrow of the government 
church officials denied the charge and said de la vega a 
65yearold theology professor was explaining liberation theology 
a movement that advocates political action to achieve social change

denounced arbitrary arrests and limitations on freedom of 
expression

president daniel ortega said saturday 
the best thing the united states can do to promote democracy in 
nicaragua is to end its dirty war of aiding antigovernment 
rebels 
ortega speech came two days before us secretary of state 
george shultzs scheduled arrival in the region shultz on a 
ninenation latin american tour has tried to rally allies against 
the nicaraguan government 
in washington the us senate also is working on a new aid plan 
for the rebels known as contras 
let them stop their aggression against the nicaraguan people 
and this will be the best contribution to peace and democracy 
ortega said of us support for the rebels 
congressional funding of the rebels ran out in february but 
us senate democrats have proposed restoring 27 million in 
humanitarian aid 
it would also provide for trade benefits for nicaragua if peace 
combined with democratic reforms is achieved 
but ortega said if the reagan administration and us congress 
want to encourage democracy in his country the only thing they 
need to do is immediately stop their dirty war against the 
nicaraguan people 
ortega made his comments in a speech in esteli about 90 miles 
north of managua 
he reiterated the willingness of his leftist sandinista 
government to enter direct negotiations with the united states to 
normalize relations 
last week shultz said he supported regional efforts to achieve 
peace but that the sandinistas were insisting on direct talks with 
washington

antiabortion demonstrations at three clinics 
landed 69 more activists behind bars saturday joining more than 
120 others already in jail from previous demonstrations who have 
refused to identify themselves to police 
fiftythree members of operation rescue were arrested at 
midtown hospital 12 at the atlanta womens medical center on the 
northside and four at the atlanta surgicenter in midtown said tom 
pocock deputy director of the atlanta bureau of corrections 
the clinics are three of seven in the area licensed to perform 
abortions 
in florida 133 antiabortion demonstrators were arrested 
saturday at tallahassee and charged with misdemeanor trespass 
police said except for two men jailed for resisting arrest without 
violence and three juveniles released to social workers all had 
bonds set at 100 but only four were released by late saturday 
officials said 
apparently theyre continuing their protest by not making 
bond same as they did in atlanta said police spokesman duane 
west the leon county sheriffs department prepared a makeshift 
detention center at the north florida fairgrounds 
the demonstrators arrested in atlanta were charged with criminal 
trespass and giving a false name to police bringing to 276 the 
number who have gone to jail since the current series of protests 
began on july 19 during the democratic national convention 
twentyeight were charged with obstructing a sidewalk or highway 
pocock said 
many refuse to give their names 
operation rescue leader randall terry also was arrested and 
charged with being a party to a crime pocock said initial 
hearings for the protesters arrested saturday were scheduled for 
monday but may be changed to accommodate the arresting officers 
schedules pocock said 
demonstrators are being held separately from the general inmate 
population at various jails 
as of friday 82 arrested protesters had been released by 
disclosing their names and either posting 500 bond or being 
released on their own recognizance 
the group will continue pressing for the prisoners release 
under the names baby jane doe and baby john doe which 
many of the arrested have given in solidarity with aborted fetuses 
said operation rescue spokeswoman dawn stover 
the activists have said they are willing to plead guilty to 
criminal trespass charges under their aliases a deal prosecutors 
have said would compromise the criminal justice system 
operation rescue leader randall terry has said his group will 
fill the jails as long as its members remain in custody and that 
hundreds of supporters will flock to atlanta in the next few weeks 
one minister who was arrested and released said friday he and 
other ministers would return with members of their congregations 
well most likely be back with 200 to 300 others if thats 
what it takes said the rev david diamond of baton rouge la 
bob fierer an attorney who represents the jailed activists was 
preparing a court order at the direction of fulton county state 
court judge nick g lambros that would compel the protesters to 
reveal their names in order to be arraigned 
fierer said the order would dramatize his clients cause 
it tends to underline the position they have taken the 
existence or nonexistence of their names he said this is 
something people are going to focus on 
but prochoice forces cheered lambros action 
should a court order be issued it would indicate the 
courts desire to allow the judicial system to operate properly and 
not as a tool of the extremists said elizabeth j appley 
attorney for the abortion clinics 
we have always believed that these people should give their 
names said sally tyler executive director of the georgia 
abortion rights action league 
i think its naive of them to believe they could get arrested 
have criminal charges brought and then walk out as if nothing had 
happened she said 
in tallahassee saturdays arrests came at the conclusion of a 
threeday rally protesting the imprisonment of a jailed colleague 
when the demonstrators blocked the entrance to one of the citys 
two abortion clinics 
on friday an estimated 300 demonstrators marched on the florida 
capitol seeking a clemency hearing for joan andrews who is serving 
a fiveyear sentence after being convicted of burglary after 
interfering with operations at a pensacola abortion clinic in 1986

aides to the foreign minister were worried by his antinicaraguan 
statement to us secretary of state george shultz 
the report in jornal do brasil came as shultz arrived in rio de 
janeiro to spend the weekend relaxing before continuing his 10day 
latin american tour monday 
on friday in brazilia the secretary gained unexpected support 
on the us stand toward nicaragua 
foreign minister roberto de abreu sodre told shultz that 
nicaragua is out of line and must return to the democratic 
path 
sodre said his remarks were personal but the statement was 
still considered unusually strong for brazil which traditionally 
has advocated noninterference in the internal affairs of other 
countries 
the rio daily on saturday said abreus statement alarmed 
brazilian foreign ministry high officials even though the minister 
said he was speaking for himself and not compromising the countrys 
position 
brazil officially advocates a negotiated solution of the central 
american civil wars and opposes us funding of nicaraguan rebels 
shultz arrived from brasilia the modern inland capital about 
750 miles southwest from rio where he met friday with president 
jose sarney and high officials

bolivia first and then to costa rica honduras and el salvador on 
wednesday he will attend the inauguration of ecuadors new

extra police patrols roamed upper manhattan 
saturday after the citys second major power outage in two days 
left tens of thousands of people without fans air conditioners 
lights and elevators for 21 hours 
power was restored about 8 pm saturday when workers repaired 
three of five damaged feeder cables said consolidated edison 
spokeswoman laurie hanson 
at this point it looks pretty good but we cant rule out any 
further problems she said power was restored at a slightly 
reduced voltage level but would not be noticed by most customers 
ms hanson added 
the blackout affected harlem and upper west side residents from 
columbia university to washington heights along the hudson river 
side of the island on a muggy day with a high temperature of 89 
degrees 
the cause of the outage was not immediately known but another 
con ed spokeswoman pat richardi said the recent spate of hot 
weather may have been a factor 
no crimes were reported that were related to the power failure 
police sgt raymond odonnell said 
the outage began about 11 pm friday while con ed crews were 
still struggling to restore power to a large area of lower 
manhattan mostly office buildings near the financial district 
that was blacked out earlier in the day power was largely restored 
saturday in lower manhattan ms richardi said 
the upper manhattan outage began with the failure of the fourth 
out of 19 feeder cables that provide power to the region ms 
richardi said cables had begun failing the day before but the 
electrical grid was able to reroute power until the fourth 
failure she said a couple hours later she said a fifth feeder 
cable failed 
included in the area of the blackout were columbia university 
city college st lukesroosevelt medical center and several large 
housing projects st lukesroosevelt was forced to rely partly on 
an emergency generator according to an administrator ann baxter 
ms richardi said up to 5000 customers were without power but 
noted that large buildings and institutions are sometimes listed as 
a single customer so the number of people affected was many times 
greater 
about 200 utility workers were assigned to the problem working 
in 80 manholes to replace the damaged cables she said 
con ed recorded its secondhighest day of energy usage last 
tuesday but power use slowly declined through the rest of the 
week ms richardi said still she said the hot weather has to 
be a factor 
asked if there was any tie between the outage in lower manhattan 
friday afternoon and the one in upper manhattan friday night she 
replied i honestly dont know im quite frankly speechless and 
perplexed

twelve cars of a freight train derailed 
saturday and hit chemical and fuel storage tanks igniting a 
ninehour fire releasing hazardous gas and displacing about 600 
residents authorities said 
four firefighters suffered minor injuries in the fire said troy 
fire chief gerald cherry a spokesman for the authorities involved 
a 15squareblock downtown area in this eastern missouri town 
remained evacuated 14 hours after the accident which occurred 
around 6 am he said 
several rail cars hit a diesel tank puncturing it and allowing 
diesel fuel to spill cherry said the fuel and several rail cars 
carrying lumber products and piping were engulfed in flames 
cherry said the fire at the lincoln county agricultural coop 
was dangerously close to 28000 gallons of diesel kerosene and 
gasoline being stored he said a bulk fertilizer plant also was 
nearby 
throughout the evening highway traffic was routed around the 
town of about 1900 people about 50 miles northwest of st louis 
the fire was brought under control shortly after 3 pm but 
residents were not expected to be allowed back to their homes until 
early sunday because of anhydrous ammonia gas leaking from a 
punctured tank cherry said 
he said authorities hoped to pump the anhydrous ammonia a 
liquid that becomes a gas when it is released into the air out of 
the storage tank and haul it away 
the gas is not highly flammable but is dangerous to respiratory 
systems and can cause severe burns cherry said explaining why 
authorities evacuated at least 200 residents and kept a total of 
about 600 from returning to their homes 
he said the tank that was punctured had a 20000gallon 
capacity but contained only between 4000 and 6000 gallons of 
anhydrous ammonia coincidentally he said the railroad car that 
punctured the tank was also carrying anhydrous ammonia 
that car was not damaged but was to be the last of the derailed 
cars to be righted he said 
the 113car train had been southbound from galesburg ill to 
st louis said burlington northern railroad spokesman brian 
sweeney 
cherry said about 150 firefighters including some from as far 
away as st louis helped fight the fire with foam and water after 
letting it burn itself down for several hours 
a cleanup crew and investigators were on the scene sweeney 
said the cause of the derailment had not been determined 
the evacuees were taken to a church and a school

a man charged with rape was acquitted after 
his accuser testified while intoxicated and a prosecutor said he 
wants to review the case to see if the judge acted properly 
attorneys said circuit judge jc norton refused to look at the 
results of a bloodalcohol test given to the alleged victim before 
she testified 
the judge later said he was shocked any lawyer would allow an 
intoxicated witness to testify 
reached at home saturday night norton declined to discuss the 
case i dont think it would be appropriate to comment on it 
he said 
district attorney roy johnson said he has ordered a transcript 
to review what norton said to the jury hearing the case against 
henry gray 
the womans drinking had been brought to the courts attention 
before trial said johnson if norton did anything improper 
we will take whatever action is necessary 
gray was found innocent thursday a day after the woman 
testified 
a defense attorney smelled alcohol on the womans breath and 
requested a test to determine whether she had been drinking the 
test showed her to have a bloodalcohol content of 016 percent 
while the legal presumption of intoxication in alabama is a reading 
of 010 percent 
defense attorney collins pettaway said norton told prosecutors 
before the trial he did not want to see any test results until 
they were properly presented 
after the verdict of innocent was read pettaway said norton 
told jurors he might have overruled a guilty verdict because of 
information about the womans drinking

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said iraqs announcement saturday that it will accept a conditional 
ceasefire with iran is a very important step forward for 
stalled un peace efforts and he hoped to declare a truce early 
this week 
i received information from the foreign minister of iraq that 
his president has decided to accept an immediate ceasefire 
followed by direct talks under my auspices perez de cuellar said 
i think this is a very important step forward said perez de 
cuellar the impression i have is that it can solve the problem 
but iran gave no official reaction on president saddam husseins 
call to accept a ceasefire if iran agrees to immediate direct 
talks 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati met the un chief 
for more than an hour and was presented the iraqi proposal later 
he brushed past reporters without comment 
in a saturday night interview with cable news network javad 
zarif counselor to irans un mission reinterated irans stand 
to engage in direct talks immediately following a ceasefire 
within the appropriate framework of the un plan zarif did not 
elaborate 
perez de cuellar said he would meet velayati sunday to receive 
irans formal response to the iraqi proposal 
i think we are on the way to a final solution of the problem 
with the full implementation of resolution 598 he said after 
talks with velayati the un resolution calls for an immediate 
ceasefire then a troop withdrawal to international borders and a 
prisoner exchange 
iraqs un ambassador ismat kittani met the secretarygeneral 
first to brief him on husseins proposal 
after the meeting kittani said if they the iranians accept 
this we are on the road to peace if they refuse it then it will 
be obvious to everyone that iran and iran alone is responsible for 
shedding any additional blood 
husseins dropping of his demand for direct talks before a 
ceasefire represented acceptance of perez de cuellars compromise 
plan to break the deadlock according to diplomats who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
peres de cuellar said iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz was 
summoned home saturday for consultations but would return as soon 
as i tell him i am ready to initiate the direct talks 
i hope that i will be in a position early this week to 
announce the beginning of a ceasefire to end the 8yearold 
persian gulf war and other elements of a un peace plan he said 
one middle eastern diplomat familiar with the talks speaking by 
telephone said the iraqi announcement should give fresh impetus to 
un peace efforts 
he described husseins announcement as high drama and artful 
diplomacy and said he effectively tossed the ball back into 
irans court 
perez de cuellar told the security council friday he planned to 
dispatch a 250man un observer team to monitor a ceasefire and 
troop withdrawal 
middle east diplomats said they expected iran to welcome the 
iraqi announcement 
the iraqi president announced iraq would observe a ceasefire on 
condition that iran agree to enter into direct talks immediately 
after a ceasefire 
hussein also said iran must accept implementation of all aspects 
of un resolution 598 
iraq accepted the resolution a year ago iran after a series of 
battlefield losses accepted the resolution in a surprise 
announcement last month 
iraq had demanded facetoface talks before a ceasefire as a 
way of testing irans sincerity following its surprise turnaround 
iran rejected the demand but said such negotiations could be 
held at an acceptable level after a ceasefire troop 
withdrawal and prisoner exchange 
the secretarygeneral attempting to break the stalemate 
proposed that both sides announce they accept both a ceasefire and 
direct talks then he would announce a ceasefire date and 
simultaneously call for early direct talks according to diplomatic 
sources close to the talks 
details of the secretarygenerals plan have not been disclosed 
the five permanent members of the security council are also 
working on a plan to guarantee iraq that iran will fully implement 
all aspects of a truce the five are the united states britain 
china france and the soviet union 
un diplomats have said that the combination of the 
secretarygenerals plan and security council guarantees should 
remove iraqs inhibitions about a un peace agreement

the stability of all nations

of the south

developing countries after the opening session the representatives 
moved to the mountain resort of cocoyoc for private meetings on 
their nations economic and political problems the conference will 
end monday 
de la madrid said the economic problem for developing countries 
is complicated even more by the onerous service of the foreign 
debt and the resistance to solutions that might imply recognition 
of coresponsibility and restore the right to development 
the majority of debtors have managed to avoid confrontations 
and unilateral decisions he said 
among those attending the conference are former president julius 
k nyerere of tanzania the commission chairman former president 
carlos andres perez of venezuela and the cuban vice president 
carlos rafael rodriguez 
nyerere in his opening statement proposed the debtor nations 
organize a forum in which they could make more precise their 
common problems 
the creditors are strongly organized to defend their 
interests he said the debtors arent organized each one 
doesnt even appreciate the nature or the magnitude of the problems 
of the others 
because of that the commission proposes the creation of a 
debtors forum 
he also said the commission will have to make inevitably a 
call for cooperation from the north the north that today 
dominates as much in economics as it does in politics 
the commission of the south was formed last year in geneva it 
met in march in kuala lumpur malaysia and this is its third 
meeting 
its declared purpose is to strengthen cooperation among 
developing countries and develop the northsouth dialogue

the head of the american bar association 
reacting to the troubles of former attorney general edwin meese 
urged us presidential hopefuls friday to select an attorney 
general with the care they would give a supreme court nominee 
association president robert maccrate said in identical letters 
to republican george bush and democrat michael dukakis that too 
often in the past presidents have selected political friends 
to head the justice department 
the care and importance given to the selection of justices of 
the supreme court should be given as well to the selection of 
attorney general he said 
addressing a news conference in toronto where the bar 
association is holding its annual meeting maccrate said his 
message was prompted by the events of the past 18 months 
culminating in meeses resignation under a cloud meese a friend 
of reagan was the subject of a 14month ethics investigation by an 
independent counsel james mckay mckay decided against filing 
charges but said meese probably violated conflictofinterest laws 
and willfully filed a false tax return 
the reagan administration has nominated former gov richard 
thornburgh of pennsylvania to replace meese until the end of the 
term 
maccrate said meese was one of many top law officers appointed 
through personal connections he cited robert kennedy attorney 
general for his brother john f kennedy 
a close connection between partisan politics and the office of 
attorney general inevitably reduces the effectiveness of the 
department incites fear about the integrity of the administration 
of justice and undermines public confidence in the rule of law 
said maccrate a new york attorney 
maccrate acknowledged that the attorney general is in many ways 
the presidents lawyer and its natural that he would choose a 
trusted friend 
he also said the 346000member aba could do more to help ensure 
the candidate is qualified 
although an aba standing committee scrutinizes all candidates 
for the federal courts it does not review nominees for attorney 
general or other cabinet posts we should have a machinery to do 
it he said 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar will address the 
opening assembly of the weeklong annual meeting on monday other 
speakers will include cia director william h webster and former 
supreme court justice lewis f powell about 12000 us and 
canadian lawyers are expected to attend

at least 22 insurance companies still 
have life insurance policies in effect that charge blacks higher 
premiums than whites but most companies responding to a survey 
stopped the practice years ago 
the national association of insurance commissioners questioned 
2806 life insurance companies after the american civil liberties 
union asked about racially based premium rates said david simmons 
the associations lawyer 
the kansas citybased group adopted a resolution in june 
criticizing racebased premiums as inherently unfair and 
unacceptable as a matter of public policy 
it asked state regulatory offices to direct companies to 
neutralize the race based differentials for policies in effect 
of the 2719 companies responding to the survey by aug 1 52 
said they had used race as a basis for differences in life 
insurance premiums fiftyone of those said they had discontinued 
issuing such policies and one did not answer that question 
asked if they were currently collecting premiums that 
differentiate based on race 22 said they were 27 said they were 
not and three did not answer 
four of the 22 companies were from louisiana three were from 
texas two each were from alabama north carolina south carolina 
and one was from nebraska ohio indiana kentucky kansas 
missouri and georgia arizona and arkansas 
most companies that said they had used racially differentiated 
premiums said they had discontinued them years ago some as far 
back as 1912 most in the 1950s and 1960s and the last in 1987 
new york life insurance co for example said it had stopped 
using the policies by the end of 1938 in new york new jersey 
connecticut ohio michigan and minnesota it said its records did 
not show when the practice was discontinued in other states but by 
the end of 1948 it was no longer using it anywhere 
home beneficial life insurance co of virginia said its premium 
differences reflect differences in published and recognized 
mortality statistics and it cited population statistics from the 
us department of health and human services showing a life 
expectancy of 706 years for whites born in 1960 and 636 years for 
blacks

the government on friday named a leading terrorism 
investigator to head its battle against the mafia and proposed an 
expansion of judicial forces to operate in major centers of 
organized crime 
domenico sicas appointment as high commissioner came after a 
team of antimafia investigating magistrates in sicily announced 
their resignations last week saying their work was being 
obstructed 
several judges involved with the magistrates team also accused 
the government of letting the antimafia effort disintegrate 
following the conviction of 338 people in a trial of 
organizedcrime leaders last december 
sica 56 has investigated many of italys major terrorism cases 
over the past decade including the kidnapmurder of former premier 
aldo moro in 1978 and the shooting and wounding of pope john paul 
ii in 1981 
sica replaced pietro verga who retired 
there isnt much difference between terrorism and the mafia 
and therefore i approach my new job with calm and integrity 
sica told reporters 
at fridays cabinet meeting interior minister antonio gava 
proposed the government either create a new intelligence agency to 
aid in fighting organized crime or increase the powers of the high 
commissioner sica 
gava also proposed reorganizing the detective force in the 
sicilian capital of palermo establishing judicial investigation 
squads linked to police stations in palermo increasing the powers 
of internal revenue agents and creating a special crimefighting 
center in catania sicily 
the proposals are to be presented to parliamentary commissions 
criticism of the governments actions against organized crime 
has increased since midjuly when a prominent sicilian prosecutor 
paolo borsellino said probes by the antimafia pool of 
investigating magistrates in palermo were being obstructed 
president francesco cossiga called on the interior and justice 
ministries and the superior council of magistrates which oversees 
italian judges to investigate 
as the council began hearings last week giovanni falcone the 
most famed member of the antimafia pool submitted his 
resignation and asked for a transfer the other members of the 
group then announced their resignations 
falcone said a new chief investigating magistrate antonino 
meli had dispersed the pool and detectives were not cooperating 
with the magistrates but the council of magistrates backed meli 
when men like falcone and borsellino talk about leaving their 
posts there is a sensation of fear and loss palermo mayor 
leoluca orlando told a news conference this week he said the post 
of high commissioner had turned into a bureaucratic job 
sica gained fame for tracking down and prosecuting leftist red 
brigades terrorists including those who killed moro 
he also investigated propaganda due the rightwing organization 
accused of trying to overthrow the government in the early 1980s 
in italys legal system some judges adjudicate court cases some 
are public prosecutors and others investigate crimes with the aid 
of police units

material of cocaine is grown in the region 
antidrug officials say manual eradication of coca plants and 
programs to encourage peasants to substitute other crops for the 
lucrative coca leaves have not been effective

the report referred to mounting evidence of an 
erosion of moral values in society particularly in the past 20 
years and called it a real and present danger 
you have heard such statements before but probably not from a 
group of this sort which calls itself the committee on developing 
american capitalism made up of influential capitalists and 
academics 
can business be profitable and ethical the report asks it can 
and must the group says or selfrespect business and other 
institutions and freedom and democratic principles will be lost 
leo r futia walter e hoadley and john winthrop wright signed 
the statement futia is former chairman of guardian life insurance 
hoadley former bank of america executive vice president and 
wright chairman of wright investors service in bridgeport conn 
and former manufacturer and academic 
they ask you to consider the startling findings of a survey of 
fortune 500 companies conducted by professor amitai etzioni a 
committee member among his findings were these 
between 1975 and 1984 more than 300 of the fortune 500 
companies were involved in one or more illegal incidents 
the top 100 companies were involved in more incidents 55 
percent than all the others combined 
these offenses occurred during a period of unparalleled 
prosperity and were perpetrated by businessmen in leadership 
positions possessing wealth power and influence 
virtually every episode of corruption cited builds daunting 
evidence that its root causes are uncontrolled human greed and lust 
for fame and power the groups statement said 
they contend that expedience has become a more compelling 
force in the marketplace than law and ethics and they warn 
this sows the seeds of distrust and hatred among neighbors 
between employer and employees between voters and their elected 
officials and between business and government 
in the extreme it opens the door of government to anarchy 
the mounting evidence the authors refer to includes illegal 
political contributions bribes cheating on defense contracts 
money laundering by bankers check kiting on wall street insider 
trading fraud payroll padding 
they cite evidence in other institutions as well including 
religion and education but as capitalists and members of the 
committee based at fairfield university they are primarily 
concerned with refining and restating principles of american 
capitalism and focusing them on the nations key issues 
they question the notion supported by many that the impression 
of moral bankruptcy is created by the media and its ability to 
spread news globally and that corrupt and unethical behavior is no 
greater than in the past 
it is at this point that they express the opinion that mounting 
evidence suggests moral values have indeed declined 
as their report was being distributed the new york times on one 
day aug 5 carried these stories on its front page 
biaggi convicted in wedtech case simon also guilty 
hertz admits use of fraud in bills for auto repairs 
10 are indicted in major fraud on blood tests 
6 charged with racketeering in wall street insider inquiry 
company shuts in fraud case 
the page contained only three other stories 
shocked by such evidence many graduate schools of business have 
instituted course on ethics the notion being that moral values can 
be applied like a lacquer to provide the product a graduating 
student a finished look 
they suggest the remedy must be more fundamental and that it 
might take time they list several possible explanations for the 
sense of moral decay one of them not often cited by representives 
of capitalism 
it is they say our affluent society and the now culture 
which focuses on selfgratification and substitutes selfindulgence 
for personal responsiblity and selfrestraint 
training they suggest begins in the family and the american 
family they observe is itself broken down by a lifestyle that 
says me first

the nottingham playhouse did big business last 
year with agatha christies everpopular and then there were 
none hardly the gritty social realism that made its reputation 
in the 1960s 
the royal shakespeare company better known for its hamlet 
and king lear has had to brush up its shakespeare with cole 
porters musical kiss me kate 
such forays into lowerbrow fare may horrify the purists but 
britains governmentfunded theaters say they have little choice 
given rising production costs and the hostility of prime minister 
margaret thatchers conservative government toward subsidizing the 
arts 
the new mood was set last year by arts minister richard luce 
when he declared its time the arts world got rid of its 
welfarestate mentality 
the notion of taxpayers money funding the arts has been 
sacrosanct since world war ii this year the state is giving 690 
million to the arts about onethird of it to theaters through the 
quasigovernmental arts council 
but some critics suggest the erosion of subsidy means an erosion 
of quality they point to the rscs embarrassment over carrie 
its 7 million musical that flopped on broadway after a short run 
at stratford in february 
some argue that the theater handsomely repays the governments 
investment peter hall artistic director of the national theater 
said last year it is simply daft economics let alone daft 
culture to apply a dogmatic view that subsidy is sick and bad 
i dont believe the arts cost britain a penny he said it 
has not occurred to the current government that the arts is one of 
the few absolute success stories of britain since the war 
the policy studies institute a nonprofit research group 
published a recent study showing that the arts are a 17 
billionayear sector of the british economy and that onefourth 
of tourist income is spent on cultural activity 
it said the arts account for 25 percent of all spending on 
goods and services in britain and directly employ 496000 people 
or 21 percent of the work force 
but theater insiders concede that the subsidies battle is lost 
and greater concessions to commercialism are inevitable 
some even find it desirable it behooves us to go out and make 
our money from time to time and to have that commercial hard 
knack terry hands artistic director of the rsc and director of 
carrie said recently in an interview with the guardian 
newspaper 
the rsc faced a 189 million deficit last year and briefly 
considered closing its stratford base it was rescued largely by a 
255 million grant from the royal insurance company and by the 
commercial success of les miserables the tony awardwinning 
musical based on victor hugos 1862 novel 
les miserables a hit here and on broadway is bringing the 
company up to 17 million a year in worldwide royalties 
in london christopher hamptons longrunning les liaisons 
dangereuses has been netting the rsc 260000 a year since it 
began an openended commercial run in october 1986 
with profits of up to 500000 from kiss me kate and a 
344000 fee for the illfated carrie even its less 
commercially successful ventures have brought the rsc some cash 
still the rsc is not alone in its new bout with commercialism 
the national theater the countrys other major subsidized 
company has been playing safe with such broadway plays as neil 
simons brighton beach memoirs and brian clarks the 
petition and undemanding revivals such as arthur wing pineros 
the magistrate and george abbott and john cecil holms three 
men on a horse 
the national says 52 percent of its annual turnover is now 
selfearned since 1985 it says its subsidy of over 12 million 
has fallen by over 35 million in real terms 
the nottingham playhouse which began in 1963 producing such 
offbeat plays as frank wedekinds lulu and peter barnes the 
ruling class now leans heavily toward agatha christie and 
farces such as fur coat and no knickers to keep costs down 
and audiences up 
some theaters have come up with novel ways to make ends meet 
the crucible theater in sheffield rented out its auditorium for 
a billiards championship so it could go on financing rarely seen 
classics and daring new material 
its the weird situation of buildings built on one philosophy 
having to survive in a society operating on another philosophy 
said clare venables the crucibles artistic director in an 
interview 
the crucible is one of many playhouses built in provincial 
cities in the 1960s when the prevailing social philosophy held that 
the state had a duty to foster the arts 
the aspirations of the 60s look sick today wrote paul 
allen in the new statesman the arts he said are regarded with 
something surprisingly akin to hatred in the new sourer 
political climate 
the nationals hall agreed theres a feeling now in the 
subsidized sector and i speak not for myself but for my 
colleagues that we are simply not wanted 
they wish we would just go away so they could turn the whole 
thing into the american model that would be a disaster 
commercial sponsorship is relatively new in britain and viewed 
with some suspicion but theaters are learning to live with it 
the rscs press releases say sponsored by royal insurance 
recent theater programs at the national emblazoned the logos of 
citicorpcitibank and ladbroke group plc over such classics as 
the threepenny opera and antony and cleopatra 
but sponsorship has its limitations earlier this year the 
national lost an unnamed backer for a revival of john fords 1633 
tis pity shes a whore because the firm balked at the title 
and ended up financing the production from its own funds 
what were talking about is creative life depending on 
sponsorship rather than being something that sprang from a 
community activity says patsy silburn chairwoman of the east 
midlands branch of the arts council 
there are fewer and fewer places where one could say with any 
conviction theres a vibrant and dynamic theater

glasnost has come or 
returned to czechoslovakian art with the first freewheeling 
exhibit by hundreds of artists held in prague since 1969 
twentyfive thousand people filed past more than 2700 works by 
882 artists in the first two weeks of the prague salon staged 
at a city stadium and in the park of culture and recreation 
following demands for such a show at a meeting last year of the 
staterun union of artists the salon is free of the rigid 
restrictions imposed on most art exhibits since the prague 
spring reforms of 1968 were crushed 
picking up on a tradition started with a salon in 1968 but 
abandoned after 1969 works are shown in alphabetical order each 
artist gets the same space regardless of rank and is free to fill 
it with any work completed in the last five years 
the result is a chaotic mix of abstract expressionist and 
surrealist styles competing sidebyside for the visitors 
attention 
despite the freedom however there is no explosion of 
previously unknown talent 
nonetheless some artists make bold steps into the political 
sphere premysl vanicek for example hung a kitsch portrait of 
mikhail and raisa gorbachev close to a portrait in identical style 
of franz kafka the author whose full works are still unpublished 
in his native prague 
another picture by vaclav sramek consists entirely of the 
letters p and a and is entitled perestroika a variation on 
somebody elses theme a possible allusion to the similarity 
between gorbachevs reforms and those introduced in czechoslovakia 
in 1968 by alexander dubcek 
elsewhere in the exhibit olga berekova displays a portrait of 
pope john paul ii while rock star mick jagger graces the sculpture 
section 
the exhibit is limited to members and candidates of the artists 
union in the past the union was often accused of giving 
preferential treatment to some members and failing to promote young 
artists who have a chance to show at the salon 
one idea behind the present exhibit seems to have been an 
official desire to show that the alleged restrictions were not 
preventing great young talents from coming forward 
gone is the era when socalled forbidden fruit tasted good 
just because it had the odor of something forbidden unwelcome and 
outlawed the political and arts weekly tvorba said 
the possibility of such a broad exhibition prevents the 
birth of wronged artists and even martyrs because of an insensitive 
and entirely unnecessary administrative intervention all were 
given the same chance and only the future will show who will win 
official support for the salon went all the way up to communist 
party leader milos jakes who praised it as a chance for artists to 
compare works 
but not everybody was so enthusiastic czechoslovakias graphic 
artists highly ranked internationally did not take part and not 
one professor from the academy of arts chose to display works 
the communist party daily rude pravo chafed at the low standard 
of many works shown and took issue with at least one sculpture 
criticizing a torn chaise longue with a figure made out of tree 
fungi as a work that had nothing to do with contemporary art 
the exhibit was preceded by a handful of much smaller shows that 
were tolerated but not officially sponsored in prague last year 
the soviet drive for glasnost or openness in the arts and 
staterun media has produced nothing like the outstandingly frank 
films plays and articles now seen in moscow but a few previously 
banned films have been shown and the media has printed articles on 
previously taboo topics such as drug addiction and prostitution

this summers drought has focused more 
attention on the greenhouse effect but an agricultural analyst 
says its impossible to predict whether the grain belt will be 
among the early losers from a global warming 
in an article published by resources for the future and the 
national center for food and agricultural policy norman j 
rosenberg also cautions against prematurely adjusting us 
agriculture to cope with potential changes in the climate 
one cannot rule out the possibility that some lands now too 
arid for cultivation of food crops may indeed become more usable 
for these purposes in the future writes rosenberg director of 
the climate resources program for resources for the future an 
independent research and education group 
however there is no more evidence to support that assumption 
than there is to support the idea popularized by the media that 
productive lands in the us midwest and great plains are certain 
to become drier and less productive 
still rosenberg strongly suggests that some agricultural 
efforts be vigorously continued as precautions against possible 
problems he also says more research is needed to develop 
techniques to help farming prepare for the natural ups and downs of 
climatic variations 
there is nothing in the predictions of the climate change 
community to suggest that we should reduce emphasis on soil and 
water conservation programs he writes 
rosenberg was a professor of agricultural meteorology and 
director of the center for agricultural meteorology and climatology 
at the university of nebraska before joining the washingtonbased 
organization last year 
the conservation reserve program and sodbuster provisions are 
likely to be needed as much in the future as they are today he 
writes 
conservation of groundwater should be emphasized especially 
in aquifers like the ogallalla that are only slowly rechargeable 
vast quantities of water in storage may provide a buffer to lessen 
the negative impacts of greater aridity in the midlatitudes of 
north america should climate change occur as some global climate 
models suggest 
the ogallala covers portions of great plains states from 
nebraska to texas and is primary source of irrigation for farming 
in an interview rosenberg expressed concerns that the current 
drought gripping portions of the grain belt has generated hype 
and sophistry about the greenhouse effect that increasing 
concentrations of carbon dioxide and other gases would cause a 
general warming of the atmosphere by trapping heat around the earth 
rosenberg contends the drought shouldnt be blamed on the 
greenhouse effect but is a product of natural variations in weather 
patterns 
however he says the drought should serve as a lesson for policy 
makers and as an indicator of the kinds of severe weather changes 
that could occur more frequently in the future if the greenhouse 
effect manifests itself as some have suggested 
i think the people who are using this years drought as some 
kind of omen of the greenhouse effect are doing us a bit of a 
disservice because this drought is not at all unprecedented 
says rosenberg but the drought does drive home the point that 
were very vulnerable and climate change can make us more 
vulnerable 
rosenberg says he is reasonably convinced that the 
greenhouse effect is responsible for the gradual warming trend that 
has occurred worldwide but he says scientists lack the ability to 
accurately predict the regional effects of a continuation of that 
warming past greenhouse effect studies have predicted widely 
ranging temperature and precipitation changes 
for example a stateoftheart study by the energy 
department in 1985 projected temperature increases for the middle 
of north america from 2 degrees to 8 degrees celsius depending 
upon which scientific model was used by researchers 
in his article rosenberg says there are indicators that 
agriculture can adjust to some of the predicted climatic changes 
he points to the expansion of the nations winterwheat growing 
region since 1920 
hard red winter wheat is grown in the northern plains including 
montana where average temperatures are lower the growing season 
shorter and there is less rainfall than traditional areas like 
kansas that expansion rosenberg says has occurred over a 
climatic gradient greater in many ways than the greenhouse 
changes predicted in some studies 
still rosenberg says the current drought illustrates how modern 
agriculture remains extremely vulnerable to weatherrelated 
stresses he contends that more emphasis should be placed on 
research to develop crops and techniques that minimize that 
vulnerability 
that he says is the best strategy for agriculture to prepare 
for what the greenhouse effect could bring 
even if the whole greenhouse effect would turn out to be a 
misconception but we had invested a lot more in research to 
fortify agriculture against climatic variability natural 
variability wed still be coming out ahead says rosenberg

stock traders seem to have been paying attention 
lately to the critics who fault them for overreacting to news 
events 
rather than gyrating wildly when a government statistic on the 
economy comes out higher or lower than expected the market in 
recent days has barely budged 
in the past week for example the dow jones average of 30 
industrials did not rise or fall more than 75 points in any single 
session 
whatever happened to the volatility everybody was so worried 
about 
new yorkers at least are inclined to put the situation down to 
the stifling heat and the traditional summer doldrums that set 
in on wall street in august 
but that doesnt serve as a full explanation its an 
international market these days and the orders arent coming in 
from london or tokyo just as they arent from manhattan 
the idea that everybody is on vacation doesnt wash the way it 
used to either money managers at the large institutions that 
dominate the modern marketplace are under just as much pressure to 
produce results in the third quarter of the year as they are in the 
first second and fourth 
jay donnaruma an analyst at first albany corp in albany ny 
has an alternative explanation its called number numbness 
he says 
each week there is some government number to be released that 
causes the markets to go catatonic before its release and 
paralyzes the markets afterward while the experts analyze it 
as a result no one wants to get caught by the number trade 
deficit consumer price index producer price index gross national 
product so millions of folks do nothing simultaneously 
against this background the dow jones industrial average 
drifted down 960 points to 211913 in the past week 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 26 to 
15309 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
edged up 38 to 38771 and the american stock exchange market 
value index was down 123 at 30495 
volume on the big board averaged 15581 million shares a day 
against 16398 million the week before 
the mood on wall street is dominated by fears of revived 
inflation but jeffrey applegate and richard bernstein analysts at 
tucker anthony amp rl day inc argue that that concern is 
misguided 
the most important question for the markets they say is when 
the federal reserve and central banks of other leading 
industrialized countries will stop tightening credit 
the chief economic risk in this round of tightening is that 
central bankers go too far and create a recession they contend 
but the adroit behavior of central banks through this economic 
expansion suggests thats unlikely 
in the worldwide market crash last fall applegate and bernstein 
observe central bankers rushed to throw liquidity into the 
system to prevent a financial fissure from becoming an economic 
one it worked 
central bankers and finance ministers still meet and 
telecommunicate often enough to coordinate policy this time around 
to slow economic growth 
if restrictive credit policies should create a financial 
lightning strike they say it is most likely to hit the tokyo 
stock market which is the only major market that has surpassed its 
1987 highs this year 
by any rational valuation yardstick it is and has been widely 
overvalued they say the risk is very high

insider trading on stolen stock columns from 
business week issues has raised troubling questions that go to the 
heart of the relationship between financial markets and influential 
news reports 
the business week scandal also has focused attention on 
widespread ignorance of what insider trading is despite the wave 
of publicity about wall street felons such as ivan boesky 
in addition the scandal illustrates the securities industrys 
own problems in detecting and policing suspicious trades despite 
its array of sophisticated surveillance gear 
although business week has been faulted by some for not 
disclosing longtime suspicions of insider trading on the 
marketsensitive inside wall street columns lawyers agree the 
biggest us business weekly bears no legal liability for what 
happened and took sincere action to stop the thefts 
but the magazines policy of reporting on littleknown thinly 
traded stocks a key element of the scandal has aroused concern 
that business week may have been an unwitting accomplice of the 
insider traders 
it does make the situation more troubling said sam scott 
miller a securities lawyer in new york but its always easy to 
judge what the right thing to do was after its clear what was 
going on 
john dierdorff business weeks managing editor said in an 
interview that the magazine is acutely aware of the potential 
impact on prices of offbeat stocks described in inside wall 
street but has to balance that concern against the news value of 
telling readers about interesting situations 
we do not tip stocks dierdorff said if you actually make 
recommendations youd have to get yourself a license from one of 
the regulatory bodies 
the magazines aim in the column dierdorff said has been and 
will be to report what some smart guys on wall street are doing 
trades in at least two dozen securities firms are under 
investigation because of the scandal in which some employees of 
rr donnelley amp sons co a company that prints business week 
peddled issues to brokers before the magazine reached the public 
the brokers then bought stocks described in inside wall 
street and sold them later for profit after other investors had 
read the column and purchased the stocks thereby inflating the 
prices 
at least seven people have lost their jobs because of alleged 
roles in the scandal although no charges had been filed by the 
weekend the securities and exchange commission and criminallaw 
enforcers in at least two states were known to be involved in 
probes of the purloined magazines 
the use of confidential information to buy and sell stocks is 
commonly described as insider trading and is considered a felony 
under federal securities laws 
two weeks after business week revealed the problem which 
editors had suspected in early 1987 the magazine gave the first 
detailed accounting of what happened 
in the latest issue distributed friday business week said it 
first tried to plug suspected leaks by tightening security 
procedures restricting access to inside wall street during the 
editing process and reminding printers of the need for 
confidentiality the problem appeared to abate until this spring 
editorinchief stephen shepard defended the magazines decision 
not to alert the sec saying regulators may have demanded 
disclosure of confidential news sources as part of any 
investigation 
moreover business week had no obligation to notify the 
commission in the opinion of its general counsel robert n 
landes other lawyers agreed with that opinion especially since 
the magazine had determined none of its staff was implicated 
when you go talk to the cops the first thing the cops do is 
chase the people who reported the incident said stephen r 
miller a securities lawyer at the philadelphia law firm of dechert 
price amp rhoads so youre a little wary and want to be sure you 
know the guy who did it 
as in many insider trading cases the key to finding the 
culprits is abnormal trading of the stocks in question but even 
the most sophisticated technology used to track stock activity does 
not reveal more than simple hints 
market surveillance computers at the major exchanges are 
designed to sound alarms when a stock breaks its historical price 
or volume pattern an aberration called a kickout 
in the business week case more than two dozen stocks kicked out 
over a period of many months and were noticed by surveillance 
officials at the new york stock exchange american stock exchange 
and national association of securities dealers which monitors 
overthecounter trading 
but these officials said in interviews that patterns of trading 
can be extremely difficult to detect especially if the stocks have 
no apparent relationship or the kickouts occur irregularly 
when you see 10 different stocks kicking out at any point in 
time its not necessarily going to click immediately said agnes 
gautier vice president of market surveillance at the nyse what 
youre looking for is a common theme 
even if kickouts are traceable to a column in business week or 
some other publication she said of necessity youre talking 
about time and a number of issues you have to see that before you 
say theres a problem here

unemployment edged up from a 14year low to register 54 percent 
in july but financial markets still wary of higher interest rates 
interpreted the report as showing too much economic strength 
the labor department said friday that a total of 170000 more 
americans 80 percent of them teenagers found themselves out of 
work last month as unemployment edged up from a 14year low reached 
in june 
but the monthly statistics that the financial markets watch more 
closely on nonfarm payroll employment told a different story 
payrolls increased 283000 in july and the figure for june was 
revised upward to show a gain of 532000 
robust economic growth raises the prospect of increased 
inflationary pressures and can give the federal reserve fresh cause 
to consider tightening credit further 
interest rates climbed in the credit markets friday the 
governments bellwether 30year bond lost about 750 per 1000 
face amount while its yield rose to 912 percent from 903 percent 
on wall steet stock prices sagged the dow jones average of 30 
industrials fell 747 to close at 211913 
most private analysts had anticipated new nonfarm payroll 
growth of only 150000 to 200000 jobs in july normally a slow 
month in the labor market 
revised numbers for june showed much stronger job creation as 
well originally june payroll growth was put at 346000 but based 
on new data the government said friday it was actually 532000 
the revision for june plus the strong job growth last month 
are pretty healthy signs that the economy will keep growing at a 
good pace the rest of this year said roger brinner an economist 
for data resources inc of lexington mass 
elsewhere currency traders embraced the employment data and the 
dollar rose soybean and energy futures advanced while grain 
futures were mixed

william m agee is returning from corporate exile to head the 
big engineering and construction firm morrison knudsen corp in his 
hometown of boise idaho six years after his illfated tenure at 
bendix corp crashed to a close 
the 50yearold agee who led bendix in a disastrous attempt to 
acquire martin marietta corp was named chairman and chief 
executive officer of morrison knudsen on friday effective 
immediately he has served on the companys board for a total of 11 
years 
his first order of business will be to return the company to 
profitability morrison knudsens earnings have declined from their 
1984 peak the company posted a loss for the first six months of 
1988 of 467 million mainly from the divestiture of its real 
estate development segment and poor performance in its 
shipbuilding operation 
revenue for the first two quarters totaled 9488 million 
people dont like to see red numbers agee said at a news 
conference in boise i like to underpromise and overperform 
a complex man described as both warm and quick on the trigger 
agee enjoyed an enviable rise up the corporate ladder only to 
stumble in the tangled fight for martin marietta and rumors of a 
sexual relationship with another executive 
agee entered the business world at boise cascade corp in 1963 
a graduate of harvards prestigious business school he joined 
bendixs management team in 1971 and took over as chairman and 
chief executive officer in 1977 
in his five years in the executive suite agee shifted bendixs 
emphasis from auto parts to electronics and aerospace systems and 
boosted annual sales toward the 5 billion mark his compensation 
of about 1 million a year in salary with stock options and 
deferred pay to match helped make him an object of keen interest 
in business circles 
but agees alienation of both colleagues and observers began 
when he hired and rapidly promoted mary cunningham an mba holder 
from his alma mater rumors of a romantic liaison with her boss 
forced cunningham to resign from the vice presidency of stragegic 
planning a year later in 1980 although both continue to deny they 
had a relationship while she worked at bendix 
together however the two had conceived of an aggressive 
acquisition stragegy that would culminate in bendixs dramatic 
fight with martin marietta in 1982 
rather than embrace agees buyout offer martin marietta fought 
back ferociously in a textbook example of the risky and expensive 
pacman strategy martin marietta responded by snapping up 
shares of bendix in a counter takeover bid 
both companies spent millions of dollars buying stakes in each 
other without one completing the acquisition before the other 
ultimately bendix was acquired by allied corp which is now 
alliedsignal inc for nearly 2 billion in early 1983 martin 
marietta meanwhile was left heavily in debt and a big portion of 
its stock also was acquired by alliedsignal 
agee resigned from a shortlived career at allied to form a 
small venture capital and consulting firm in massachusetts with 
cunningham whom he had married in 1982 
at morrison knudsen agee is taking the reigns from william 
deasy 51 who will continue as president deasy also will return 
to the job of chief operating officer a position he held before 
being elevated to chief executive officer 
morrison knudsen is a world class company with world class 
growth potential he said in a statement my job is to ensure 
that we maintain the financial muscle and clear strategic thinking 
to realize that potential 
wall street appeared to sanction the appointment morrison 
knudsen stock rose 150 a share to close at 4350 on the new york 
stock exchange 
cunningham has been running the privately financed nurturing 
network which helps middleclass women who are pregnant and 
single the network has expanded to all 50 states and she likely 
will continue her work in boise
