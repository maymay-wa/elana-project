philadelphia and several other of the nations largest cities will 
be electing mayors 
four states will be electing governors including one arizona 
that tried but failed to pick one in 1990 among the others are 
louisiana where gubernatorial politics is a blood sport and 
kentucky where gov wallace wilkinson hopes to be succeeded by his 
wife 
there are no congressional elections scheduled and political 
activity in many states is confined to minor municipal or court 
races nationally political insiders will be laying strategy for 
the 1992 presidential race and scouting the field of potential 
democratic contenders 
in chicago mayor richard m daley will try to win his first 
full term in office after serving out the last two years of the 
term of mayor harold washington who died in office 
daleys announced opponents in the feb 26 democratic primary 
include former mayor jane byrne a threetime electoral loser since 
serving as mayor from 1979 to 1983 byrne has been accusing daley 
of displaying a lack of leadership in the mayors office but polls 
suggest that most voters disagree 
in philadelphia twoterm mayor w wilson goode is barred by law 
from seeking a third consecutive term that may be a good thing for 
him given the citys fiscal condition 
a halfdozen candidates are already vying for the opportunity to 
lead the nations fifth largest city away from the brink of 
bankruptcy philadelphia is counting on 150 million in emergency 
shortterm loans from city banks and two public employee pension 
boards to stay afloat for the time being 
the bestknown candidate so far is former twoterm mayor frank 
rizzo a toughtalking former police officer who is running as a 
republican 
four democrats are expected to be in the running including 
former district attorney edward rendell who lost to goode in the 
1987 primary and also failed in a 1986 try for governor also 
running is former city councilman george burrell who played 
football for the denver broncos 
denvers mayoral race was thrown wide open last month when 
twoterm mayor federico pena made a surprise announcement that he 
wouldnt seek reelection city auditor wellington webb is the only 
announced candidate so far but several others are edging toward 
the ring 
there also will be a new mayor in kansas city mo where 
recently imposed term limits bar mayor richard berkley from seeking 
reelection and in nashville tenn where mayor bill boner has 
been the butt of jokes over his affair with and subsequent marriage 
to singer traci peel 
the mayor of memphis tenn richard hackett is expected to 
seek a third term he may get a challenge from rep harold ford 
tennessees only black member of congress 
san francisco mayor art agnos is expected to seek a second term 
and already has announced opposition from county supervisor tom 
hsieh in baltimore mayor kurt schmoke is expected to run again 
in columbus ohio mayor dana rinehart plans to run for a third 
term despite revelations that he had an extramarital affair with a 
member of his cabinet 
several mayors have yet to announce their plans among them salt 
lake city mayor palmer depaulis and indianapolis mayor william h 
hudnut iii 
las vegas mayor ron lurie is in the offagain onagain 
category he said he wouldnt seek reelection and then said he 
might 
in chicago dallas and los angeles minorities hope to make 
gains following lawsuits that challenged electoral district 
boundaries 
the chicago and dallas cases are still pending but hispanic 
groups have won their fight in los angeles where a federal judge 
redrew one district on the powerful county board of supervisors a 
special election jan 22 is expected to result in the election of 
the first hispanic member of the board 
arizona voters will try to settle their governors race jan 26 
in a runoff between republican j fife symington and democrat terry 
goddard symington received about 4000 votes more than goddard in 
the november general election not enough for the majority needed 
to win 
louisiana gov buddy roemer intends to run for another term and 
may face a challenge from former gov edwin edwards the fellow 
democrat whom roemer ousted in 1987 former ku klux klan leader 
david duke now a state representative has said he will seek the 
republican nomination 
kentuckys governor is barred by law from seeking a second term 
so his wife martha wilkinson is running in his place her 
opponents for the democratic nomination include her husbands 
archrival lt gov brereton jones republican hopes seem pinned on 
us rep larry hopkins who hasnt announced whether hell run 
mississippi gov ray mabus will try to do what no other 
mississippi governor has done this century win a second 
consecutive term his main competition is expected to come from a 
fellow democrat former us rep wayne dowdy

winning the olympics alone would have given 
atlanta reason to crow this year but then the heavyweight 
championship and what about landing a super bowl and a spot on 
the most liveable list and now grits meets glitz jane 
fonda too 
this citys triumphs finally gave substance to its boosters old 
nickname in 1990 it was hotlanta indeed 
true the olympics fireworks burst over a city that would pass a 
curfew to save its children from drug dealers true the mayor had 
to challenge preliminary census figures indicating his city was 
losing people 
but even if the ticker tape snowed on a cooling economy and on 
troubles common to urban area atlanta celebrated as it hadnt 
since the curtain went up on gone with the wind half a century 
ago 
in september a few months after being picked as the site of pro 
footballs 1994 super bowl dark horse atlanta beat out athens 
greece as host for the 1996 summer olympic games the confetti was 
barely swept up when hometowner evander holyfield brought boxings 
heavyweight title to the city tagged losersville for its sorry 
teams 
billboards around the nations 13th largest metropolitan area 
saluted hard work and chutzpah headlines hollered its 
atlanta on sidewalks and in grocery lines natives beamed 
at the atlanta historical society executive director john ott 
didnt know of another time when two parades had streamed down 
peachtree street within six weeks 
it may make atlantans like texans you know were the best 
were the greatest were the biggest he said we do have the 
sense that we have the wherewithal to capture things 
a city of dreams proclaimed atlanta magazine profiling 
its own parade of locals who realized grand visions from martin 
luther king jr to ted turner 
the latters atlantabased cable news network which many credit 
with raising the citys profile marked its 10th anniversary in 
1990 and in december ted and jane fonda that is whose causes 
and caresses filled the daily people columns announced their 
engagement 
along the way there were high marks for atlanta from arbiters 
as different as the population crisis committee tied for second 
highest score on list of worlds most liveable cities and the 
fortune industrial survey first among executives likely picks for 
future plant sites 
only three us cities attract more conventioneers and 
atlantas high profile this year will only enhance that said john 
jackson vice president of the atlanta convention and visitors 
bureau 
a few years ago i was in london and a gentleman told me we 
needed to get our boardwalks fixed people associated atlanta with 
atlantic city jackson said thats not going to happen 
anymore atlanta is on the world map 
the 1988 democratic national convention provided a smallerscale 
dress rehearsal for events the city is now committed to staging he 
said adding that atlanta managed the attention well then some 
15000 reporters descended on the city and 95 percent or more of 
the stories were positive 
in 1989 however atlanta led the nations large cities in 
serious crime according to fbi statistics even though the city 
has shed that dubious distinction as crime figures declined this 
year some reporters continue to cite it said angelo fuster press 
secretary for mayor maynard jackson its terribly frustrating 
he said 
in november the city council restored a curfew for children 16 
and under that hadnt been in effect in nearly a decade prompted 
earlier by the socalled atlanta child murders cases in 
calling for a new curfew a sponsor cited killings in her district 
including that of a 4yearold girl 
civil libertarians doubted the curfew was constitutional but 
the mayor said it would help us fight drugs and protect our 
children 
city hall damage controllers went to work after preliminary 
figures from the us census bureau said atlantas population fell 
from 425000 to 384000 between 1980 and 1990 the city contending 
it had grown to 437000 said census takers overlooked many and 
undercounted others it demanded a recount 
cracks even began to show in the smiling facade of unanimity 
that helped win the olympics residents near the proposed sites of 
certain venues protested that their neighborhoods would suffer 
some activists worried that officials would try to sweep 
lingering problems like homelessness from visitors view rather 
than working to solve them 
there are blighted neighborhoods in the path of stadiums all 
over atlanta that are going to have to be gentrified complained 
anita beaty director of the ctys task force for the homeless 
which counted 47000 individuals who sought emergency housing last 
year 
ms beaty said shes concerned that money which could go toward 
shelter and other needs will instead be used for superficial 
beautification she called for more public involvement in planning 
im no longer saying we dont want the olympics thats 
useless she said im saying how can we benefit how can 
we manage the impact 
the super bowl and the olympics are new chapters in an old story 
of selfpromotion and courting outsiders that has helped define the 
city that grew from a railroad terminus torched by gen william t 
sherman in the civil war atlanta adopted the motto resurgens 
latin for rising again and never forgot that goal 
after the civil war atlanta editor and orator henry grady 
trumpeted a new south less splendid on the surface but 
stronger at the core a hundred farms for every plantation and 
a diversified industry that meets the needs of this complex age 
northerners liked what they heard and yankee investment poured 
in to the new souths capital 
that typifies atlantas style welcome anybody particularly 
if theyve got a few dollars said jack spalding former editor 
of the atlanta journal 
people say the olympics good god how can you handle it 
spalding said but he cited precedents notably a civic showcase 
mounted just three decades after shermans destruction the 1895 
cotton states and international exposition it attracted 800000 
people nearly 10 times the citys population 
other than to get attention there was absolutely no 
justification for it spalding said a smile wrinkling his eyes 
atlantas always had a lot of imagination

in this country there arent 
enough white people to handle all the managerial positions 
johann haasbroek said you have to use people of other 
cultures 
driving a pickup over bumpy trails cut through maize and wheat 
fields northwest of johannesburg the 57yearold farmer explained 
why he began promoting black workers more than a decade ago 
such radical action was considered suicidal in the rightwing 
world of south african farming but it worked for haasbroek who 
runs a successful family farm and is setting up another for his 
son 
he employs five whites and about 60 or 70 fulltime blacks 
at the main farm some of the black workers hire seasonal work 
crews and manage specific areas of the operation 
when i was young youd very seldom get a black man who wanted 
to be a foreman haasbroek said there was a lot of 
superstition more than now among the blacks they thought 
something would happen to them 
then need and ambition combined and about 12 years ago one 
of my black workers said he was willing to train as a foreman he 
said when pressed the farmer acknowledged encouraging the man 
i said you know it would be much easier if i could have one 
of you guys as foreman it would take a lot of responsibility off 
my hands he recalled 
new responsibilities led to new commitment on both sides 
haasbroek said workers displayed a better attitude he said and 
he let them open a school for their children on the farm 
some of the workers attended courses on farm management at 
government training centers at their employers expense 
they give the basics of how it should be done not only seen 
from a job point of view but communication among themselves and 
other things he said of the training centers 
the result of it all in haasbroeks view is a stable group of 
workers who take pride in the farm 
id never say it was expressed in words but in their way of 
doing things taking responsibility and doing it for themselves 
theyre all very proud of the farm he said 
for instance we have two soccer teams they always want to 
win theyre very proud of the team 
people are like trees haasbroek said with some growing taller 
and straighter than others 
the big thing is to be able to identify the bloke who can do 
it he said theres a lot of potential in these people waiting 
to be developed

for stan edmister bridges are a canvas where 
an engineer sees a mass of concrete and steel he sees a potential 
masterpiece 
if paint is going to be put on a bridge to sustain its life 
why should it be brown or gray or pastel green when it could be a 
lively combination of colors says the 51yearold artist 
two years ago edmister won a 10000 grant from the national 
endowment for the arts to design a color scheme for the guilford 
avenue bridge in baltimore the result was so pleasing one nea 
official said that edmister was awarded a second 10000 grant to 
select colors for 15 other bridges that cross interstate 83 
as the bridges are rehabilitated they will be painted according 
to edmisters design 
jeff soule special project manager at the nea in washington 
said the award committee hopes edmisters work will spur other 
cities to treat their public works as art 
we felt it would be a national model in improving the 
appearance of ordinary structural elements in the urban 
environment it is a very very pragmatic application of art it 
elevates public works and at the same time it makes art 
accessible soule said 
hes uncomfortable with muted hues that allow behemoths to 
settle anonymously into the background so he experiments with 
vibrant greens yellows oranges and foil appliques that change 
color 
he selects colors to highlight the design of a bridge and its 
setting he says 
he wants to treat the bridges over interstate 83 as a continuum 
related yet each with its own temperament 
driving under and through the city there is a series of 
tunnel arches or bridge covers that sets up a natural rhythm there 
should be some sort of color theme uniting them but there should 
not be a bland blanket similarity from one to another he said 
the arches of the guilford avenue bridge are bright green gray 
and henna vertical yellow bands link arch to deck girders on the 
underside are green and yellow iridescent green stripes along the 
bridges gray fence appear to change color when the sun strikes 
them 
the painting was part of a 38 million bridge rehabilitation 
city officials say they dont know whether the special treatment 
cost more than if a single color had been used harry mccullough 
chief of baltimores interstate bridge division said the city 
sought just one contract and didnt seek a comparison bid 
the cost of cleaning and painting the bridge was 137000 well 
below the engineers estimate of 210000 he said 
the federal government provided 85 percent of the rehabilitation 
money porter barrows division administrator of the federal 
highway administration in maryland said the government allowed the 
special painting after determining the additional cost would be 
minimal 
i dont want to say that the cost isnt important because it 
is he said but we felt the proposal was legitimate and 
interesting it resulted in some interesting comments i think 
the federal government must approve edmisters colors which 
include the vibrant green used for road signs and the bright yellow 
used for center lines foils must be used in moderation the 
government toned down edmisters initial idea for the guilford 
avenue bridge fearing it would be too distracting to motorists 
not everyone approves of his concepts edmister said although 
the guilford bridge has converted some skeptics 
i remember a few engineers who said they disliked an artist 
tampering in their arena and certainly didnt like a carnivallike 
color scheme being used he said now that the bridge is done 
and the newness is starting to settle in or the familiarity is 
becoming apparent these same engineers are accepting it

for combat pilots on the 
carrier uss john f kennedy what counts most is the large 
greenie scoreboard in every squadron that shows who landed 
perfectly and who didnt 
the thing that scares us most even more than flying in combat 
and dying really is the fear of failing in the eyes of fellow 
pilots or ourselves said navy lt wes huey 25 of pensacola 
fla whos been an f14 pilot for just more than two months 
in the elite circle of combat aviators there is no greater 
skill than a perfect carrier landing catching the third of four 
wires stretched across a rolling pitching deck with a hook under 
the tail of an f14 interceptor or a7 lightattack aircraft 
to do it on a moonless night is the pinnacle of precision flying 
with no exaggeration said lt cmdr val diers 33 of norman 
okla whos mainly been flying a7s for 12 years 
on carriers like the 82000ton kennedy whose key feature is 
its compact runway which is always moving with the ship a bad 
landing can spell disaster hence there is a premium on 
perfection 
the greenie boards hold a prominent position in the ready 
rooms of every squadron where pilots gather and wait for their next 
takeoff the boards not only record the quality of every landing 
but promote the competitive edge crucial for combat aviators 
thats how we grade ourselves diers said each landing is 
critiqued and its a big deal for a navy pilot 
every time a landing cycle starts on the carrier pilots from 
each squadron stand on the side of the flight deck guiding their 
planes in and grading the landings which can be watched on 
television 
slowing down from several hundred miles an hour to catch the no 
3 wire and come to a complete stop in seconds gets a big green mark 
on the board 
an average landing slightly short on the no 2 wire or too long 
on the no 4 gets a yellow mark an orange or red mark means a 
safe but belowaverage landing 
a white mark with a large b in it means a bolter missing 
all four wires and having to try again uusually its the newer 
pilots who miss 
as diers looked at the board on the back wall of his a7 
squadron va46 he pointed with pride to the large field of green 
with a scattering of yellows and reds and just a few whites 
most of them hit that target wire theyre that good he 
said 
there is stiff competition between the junior and senior pilots 
in hueys f14 squadron vf32 and its board had a similar emerald 
hue 
its all just a competitive experience from the minute you 
wake up to the minute you go to bed said huey a graduate of the 
us naval academy his father was an f4 pilot 
where else in the world do you find people berating their 
fellow workers with things theyve done wrong but in the fighter 
pilot profession he asked 
its all sort of a stress test that we go through when were 
not actually out there flying in the arena where stress is the way 
of life we sort of try to bring that into our daily routine so 
that its not such a shock when we do get into combat he said 
like huey many pilots on the kennedy said theyre ready for war 
with iraq but hope for a peaceful solution 
lt dan turner 29 of jacksonville fla said he hoped hed 
never have to use the laserguided bombs or antiradiation missiles 
on his a7 
by being out here hopefully were providing the punch to make 
him pull back he said of iraqs saddam hussein 
lt timothy j naughton 27 of sheldon iowa an a7 pilot like 
his father who is now nasas chief of operations at the johnson 
space center said no one ever wants to go to war 
its always fun to drop bombs if you know theres no one 
around and no one shoots back at you but no one wants to get shot 
at he said

in 1968 college student dan blue wanted to 
leave the farm and become a scientist but the assassinations of 
martin luther king jr and robert kennedy sent him in a new 
direction 
next month he is in line to become north carolinas first black 
house speaker 
blue was nominated unanimously dec 7 by democrats for the key 
legislative post his nomination followed the defeat of another 
black democrat former charlotte mayor harvey gantt in a bitter 
and racially divisive us senate campaign against jesse helms 
blue says the two events were not linked even before the 
election he already had commitments from house colleagues to vote 
for him the fact that they belived they could do so without 
backlash from constituents is saying a tremendous amount about 
north carolina i believe 
because democrats control 81 of the 120 seats in the house blue 
is virtually assured election when the general assembly convenes 
jan 30 blue 41 would be the first black speaker of the house in 
north carolina and the nations fourth assuming history didnt 
lose track of any during reconstruction 
blue won his first term in the state house in 1980 he has 
served as chairman of the legislative black caucus and sponsored 
the law declaring kings birthday a state holiday 
he was active in the jesse jackson and michael dukakis campaigns 
in 1988 blue also was instrumental in changing the states 
election laws last year to require 40 percent of the votes to win a 
primary rather than a 50 percent threshold that had been a barrier 
to black candidates 
blue grew up on a family farm in robeson county where the 
population is divided almost evenly among blacks whites and 
indians despite the 1954 us supreme court decision outlawing 
school segregation blue was bused across the county to a black 
school 
he arrived at predominantly black north carolina central 
university in durham during the upheavals over civil rights and 
vietnam 
there were the meetings at various churches or just meeting 
houses where young black students and young white students got 
together he said you developed an activisttype attitude you 
simply couldnt be in durham back in the mid60s without it 
infecting you to some degree 
blue was attracted by the role lawyers played in the movement 
they had a direct understanding of the system knowing that 
they had an obligation to make it work to make the overall society 
better 
all of us followed martin luther king blue said i guess 
my decision to go to law school was firmly fixed after he was 
assassinated with the kingkennedy assassinations 
but first blue completed his degrees in math and chemistry 
because you dont quit once youve embarked on a course 
he had decided to become a scientist after television reports on 
the first satellite sputnik launched by the soviets in 1957 
i remember distinctly all the news stories with douglas 
edwards and all of those folk on sputnik and how we were really 
making a push for science and all of that he said i just had 
it fixed in my head from the time that i was in second or third 
grade that i was supposed to become a scientist of some sort 
after graduating from duke universitys law school blue went to 
work at a raleigh law firm that included terry sanford a 
democratic former governor who is now a us senator 
blues first foray into politics as an 11yearold was nailing 
up sanford campaign signs in 1960 
in 1991 the major issue facing the state house is a projected 
budget shortfall of more than 1 billion 
there are more challenges when there are tough issues youve 
got to face but the rewards are certainly much greater too 
blue said 
my thing is that we steer this state on a sound course so 
that we truly do become that progressive beacon that folk from off 
a distance say we are and that id like to believe we are he

new years eve will bring a 
onceinabluemoon event a blue moon witches and scientists have 
varying opinions on its importance 
i think it will be a great night for parties theyll be wild 
parties said astrologer and tarot reader tom jerome roma of 
suburban woodlyn 
derrick pitts an astronomer at the franklin institute laughed 
at the idea of the second full moon in a month having some special 
effect on human affairs 
its definitely good luck everybody should spend at least two 
minutes in the moonlight so you can get bathed in all that 
moonlight he said with a chuckle no theres no real 
significance 
a full moon comes every 29 days when the earths natural 
satellite is opposite the sun in the sky so any month but february 
could see two full moons the second appearance known as a blue 
moon 
actually a blue moon occurs about every 32 months the moon 
when the weather conditions are just right can also appear blue in 
color but the expression once in a blue moon came from two 
moons in a calendar month 
the last blue moon was on may 31 1988 the next one will be 
sept 30 1993 the last blue moon on new years eve was in 1971 
the alignment of the earth moon and sun will mean stronger 
tides but roma insists that the lineup of heavenly bodies will 
exert a pull on people too 
the full moon is really the moon opposite the sun he said 
to confront that emotional energy twice in a month is 
difficult he said especially during the holidays 
ann duckworth a witch who operates the hand of aries store in 
philadelphia pointed out that dec 2 saw the full moon closer to 
the earth than its been in 60 years this one will be nearly as 
close she said 
witches believe the moon represents a female deity she said 
and the proximity of the full moon means her influence will 
increase 
most witches are hoping we will have a stronger goddess 
influence on the earth she said we will have more nurturing 
and peace which will help the war situation that is developing 
in more downtoearth matters emergency services director ellen 
doyle at crozerchester medical center said she expects trouble new 
years eve from the spirits that come in bottles not the ones in 
the stars 
new years eve can be a very busy night and thats from 2 
am on she said couple that with a full moon i can 
anticipate a pretty busy night the fact many have been drinking 
makes it more complex and difficult to handle it will really be a 
challenge

breast cancer surgeon rudolph almaraz was 
considered a gifted healer who inspired trust but his death last 
month left some of his former patients frightened and feeling 
betrayed 
he had never told his hospital or his patients that he had aids 
the case has embroiled johns hopkins hospital one of the 
nations most respected medical centers in an emotionally charged 
debate over the responsibility of doctors to inform patients of 
their own health problems 
two weeks after almaraz died the sun reported he had operated 
on some 1800 patients after becoming infected with the aids virus 
after the story broke hopkins mailed letters to those former 
patients and invited them to call if they had concerns about 400 
have called so far 
the reaction has varied really from one extreme to the 
other said dr timothy townsend the hospitals senior director 
for medical affairs who has taken about 100 of the calls 
some are tremendously shocked that they were not told he was 
an extremely charismatic doctor townsend said many a large 
majority have very nice things to say about him many of them feel 
a bewilderment and a sense of betrayal 
about 90 percent of the callers have indicated they will accept 
hopkins offer to be tested for the aids virus 
hopkins doctors emphasized the slight risk of contracting the 
aids virus during surgery 
according to one study a physician who is cut while operating 
on an aids patient has a 02 percent chance of picking up the aids 
virus 
the risk of transmission the other way from doctor to patient 
is even smaller of the estimated 1 million hivinfected 
americans only one patient is believed to have been contaminated 
during medical treatment experts say 
hopkins doctors say the only way almaraz could have passed on 
the aids virus is if he had cut himself during surgery and dripped 
blood onto the patient hopkins knows of no such incidents 
involving almaraz 
the case has placed hopkins in the middle of the growing 
national debate over whether doctors have a moral obligation to 
inform patients if they are infected with hiv the issue arose in 
july when it was disclosed that a florida dentist apparently passed 
on the aids virus to one of his patients 
the risk is almost zero not zero but almost said dr 
hamilton moses iii vice president for medical affairs at hopkins 
the question is does a patient have a right to know that 
question should best be answered in the context of the risk 
even hopkins doctors are split on an hivinfected doctors moral 
responsibility 
if the risk is zero or close to zero then i dont think there 
is a responsibility townsend said 
personally i think the patient does have the right to know 
and to make that choice said dr robert heyssel president for 
medical affairs at hopkins 
officials at the us centers for disease control said they 
expect to come up with a policy next month to guide hospitals in 
deciding whether hivinfected doctors should be allowed to operate 
and whether they should inform patients 
three lawsuits including one for 22 million have been filed 
against the hospital and the almaraz estate plaintiffs claim 
mental anguish over the fear that they might get aids 
marvin ellin the attorney for almarazs widow complained about 
a baltimore law firms placement of advertisements offering its 
services to patients operated on by hivinfected surgeons 
almarazs name was not mentioned 
gary strausberg of the firm of janet and strausberg which 
placed the advertisement said the firm has been contacted by 
several of almarazs former patients and lawsuits are under 
consideration 
a patient who is treated by a health care provider should not 
be exposed to extraordinary danger he has a right to know whether 
he is being exposed to an additional risk said strausberg 
hopkins officials say they dont think the case will have any 
longterm effect on the hospital 
this is a flap that will soon pass moses predicted we 
will have a legacy of lawsuits it will have some educational value 
for the public and provide better data on the risk of 
doctortopatient transmission of hiv but i dont think this will 
have major consequences

thousands of people go to prison every 
year for a myriad of frailties hate greed sometimes love 
arthur frenchy cournoyer went to prison for junk and he 
says a principle 
this is a country where a man is supposed to have a right to 
earn a living and they are supposed to have justice said 
cournoyer who has spent 32 years and about 100000 battling 
attempts to close a truck salvage yard on his property in the 
northern rhode island town of lincoln 
his salvage yard was there before town zoning prohibited it 
cournoyer said the authorities contend hes an outlaw 
so cournoyer 66 last week finished six months at the 
minimumsecurity prison in cranston for contempt of a judges order 
to clear his property 
i believe that if im right i should fight to the end he 
said in a recent prison interview 
it was his fifth time in prison since 1963 a total of 287 days 
behind bars he said 
the quiet barrelchested cournoyer seemed out of place among 
the mostly younger inmates his hair was going white a broom straw 
dangled from his mouth in place of a trademark toothpick 
they call me the legend he said i keep coming here 
theyll be giving me a pension pretty soon 
talk about prison life evoked not much more than a verbal shrug 
if a man should be in jail hes got it made but a man like 
me that dont belong here you know its still not that bad he 
said 
the headlines of his continuing battle may bring sympathy but 
town officials patience has worn thin 
the fact that hes a colorful person the fact that hes 
quotable and funny doesnt color the basic fact that the guy 
doesnt want to listen to a court edict which to me makes him 
something of an anarchist town solicitor james marusak said 
cournoyers 32 acres are in a wooded area dotted with 
splitlevel houses his rocky land is now mostly clear but 
glitters with bits of broken glass from junked vehicles 
a man who has lived across the street for 43 years was bitter 
about the junkyard saying the business has been an eyesore and a 
noise nuisance 
its about time the judge done something about it said the 
80yearold man who would not give his name he said cournoyer had 
sued him twice 
cournoyers father a carpenter who came from canada in the 
1920s bought the land in 1946 and hoped to develop it but it was 
too rocky cournoyer suggested he start a salvage yard 
cournoyer has watched at least four times as crews have come to 
haul away his junk sometimes hundreds of cars but he always found 
more 
when they cleaned me out i started running again thats what 
burnt them up cournoyer said i did make a living out of it 
one way or the other as long as i keep the yard open i could 
survive 
superior court justice anthony a giannini ordered cournoyer 
released in time for christmas but told him to clear a mobile 
home a halfdozen vehicles and a garage from his land by feb 15 
cournoyer said he would be content to retire collect social 
security work on the restoration of a 1952 tractor truck 
but a truce may have to wait 
cournoyer said he lived in the lime green 50sstyle mobile 
home and it shouldnt be part of the junkyard dispute 
the war is not over i will make history he said as he 
talked about appealing to federal court even us supreme court 
and if the battle stopped today the one that has lasted 
through most of his adult life and taken him to talk shows 
newspaper front pages and courtrooms as well as prison 
i think id be lost id be like a fish out of water he 
said

in the vast rolling countryside 
of the northern transvaal efforts to end apartheid have sown 
conflict between white farmers and millions of blacks who want 
land 
the government has promised that laws prohibiting blacks from 
owning property in most of the country will be scrapped next year 
instead of easing tension plans to repeal the land acts have 
illuminated the deep divisions between blacks and whites about 
south africas future 
historical injustices resulting from landgrabbing over three 
centuries cannot easily be rectified now the star newspaper said 
in an editorial 
under the land laws 87 percent of south africa is reserved for 
the 5 million whites most of it agricultural land owned by fewer 
than 50000 farmers 
the 30 million blacks can own property only in black townships 
around cities and in the 10 tribal homelands on the remaining and 
worst 13 percent of south africas land 
how to undo the disparity is a contentious issues for the 
government and such black opposition groups as the african national 
congress as they negotiate a new constitution that will give blacks 
political power 
to blacks reform means reversing decades of injustice when 
laws perpetuated the white expansion that drove them from the land 
of their ancestors 
most delegates to a recent anc workshop on land reform approved 
a statement saying the state should play the principal role in 
effecting a major redistribution of land 
many white farmers see land reform as a leftist plot to strip 
them of their godgiven heritage as the proper caretakers of the 
land 
we feel there is no way the blacks are going to go onto our 
land said bill ruthven a supporter of the proapartheid 
conservative party 
south africas land acts of 1913 and 1936 forced blacks with 
small farms to give them up and move to homelands or work for 
whites the anc and other antiapartheid groups say those who lost 
their land should get it back and large portions of the country 
should be turned over to blacks 
the existing inequitable distribution of land must end said 
joanne yawitch coordinator of the private national land committee 
in order to redress the apartheid legacy theres going to have 
to be a strong policy of affirmative action 
ms yawitch also is an administrator of the anc land commission 
a central recommendation of the anc workshop was a strong 
government role in redistributing land including a program of 
loans and grants available to people of all races 
president fw de klerks government has offered no formal land 
policy but said current title deeds of farmers and landowners 
are safe 
the south african development bank which provides government 
loans for homeland developmewnt has suggested turning over 5 
million acres of stateowned land to blacks it also recommends 
that about 1000 white farmers with heavy debts to the government 
land bank sell their land to blacks in exchange for debt 
writeoffs 
such proposals smack of socialism to ruthven and other white 
farmers 
most are afrikaners the descendents of dutch settlers who 
dominate the government they were raised on the doctrine that god 
chose them to live in south africa and farm the land 
afrikaner farmers generally believe de klerk has betrayed his 
people by seeking to share power with blacks some belong to 
extreme rightwing groups that have organized private armies and 
vowed to keep their land 
piet swart director of the allwhite south african agricultural 
union said i dont think we need any government agency going 
around and telling people to whom to sell and for how much 
it isnt only a question of changing land ownership you have 
to have the wealth and entrepreneurial skills i think change is 
going to come not only in agriculture its going to take time it 
must take time 
his organization contends market forces alone should determine 
who buys and sells property after the land acts are gone 
swart granted such a policy would maintain the status quo since 
few blacks would have the money to buy farmland 
johann hartman of the transvaal agriculture union the most 
conservative chapter of the national organization said the debate 
should focus on how best to use the land 
agricultural land should be utilized for maximum production 
to feed the people of the land and not for political purposes he 
said 
ruthven a burly bearded man of 53 fears the government or 
independent agencies will provide loans or grants for blacks to buy 
land he also opposes affirmative action programs intended to help 
blacks become farmers 
for 300 years the white people have been doing this for 
blacks he said now were weaning them were not 
breastfeeding them anymore my nipples are sore

mexico where sun worship has passed from 
ancient civilizations to modern beachgoers is gearing up early for 
the day next year when the sun will be blotted out 
president carlos salinas de gortari has appointed a 
cabinetlevel commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as 
the slar eclipse of the century on july 11 posters have been 
placed in mexico city subways promoting the event and resorts 
along the eclipses path are scrambling to accommodate the expected 
rush of tourists 
its the most important eclipse in history says miguel gil 
guzman secretarygeneral of the mexican astronomical society 
this one will cut a swath across one of the most populous 
regions of the globe turning day to night for an estimated 50 
million residents in 14 of mexicos 31 states the eclipse path 
reaches from hawaii through mexico to brazil 
the 165milewide path will go dark for almost seven minutes 
the maximum length for a total solar eclipse 
on july 11 the moon will pass between the planet and the sun 
abruptly swallowing middays light except for a weird glow on the 
horizon 
people from british columbia to buenos aires will experience at 
least a partial eclipse 
viewing conditions may be poor because of the latin american 
rainy season 
but the special government commission eclipse 1991 is banking 
on the clouds to roll in the countrys financial favor 
the commission bills the northwestern state of baja california 
sur as the best place to watch because the state has an average of 
300 cloudless days a year 
baja california sur alone plans to spend 265 million for 
public safety for eclipse enthusiasts but banks on raking in 
millions more from tourism 
for three years scientists and astronomy buffs have been 
staking out turf in mexico it will be the last chance to see a 
total solar eclipse this century 
most hotels along the eclipse route are full for july 11 
tourism officials are seeking private homes and campgrounds 
schools and auditoriums to house the influx 
baja california surs tourist facilities can only handle 120000 
visitors and 90 percent of that capacity is booked tourism 
director rodolfo palacios says 
the state says at least four ships will pressed into service as 
floating hotels 
some 13500 amateur and professional astronomers from the united 
states japan soviet union china canada england france and 
germany have confirmed reservations some tourists have been booked 
into one hotel even before it is completed 
the pacific coast region of nayarit is bracing for about 1 
million visitors about double the population 
cuernavaca 35 miles south of mexico city is hosting a 
geophysicists congress during the week of the eclipse 
at least one expedition plans to view the show from the 
17887foot popocapetl volcano the countrys secondhighest peak 
others plan to see it from boats at sea 
an eclipse is an astronomical coincidence the moon is 400 times 
smaller than the sun but because it is 400 times closer to the 
earth the smaller body appears to cover the larger one 
rosy rays of light will shoot out around the moons edges 
forming what astronomers call a corona or crown 
temperatures will drop at least 5 degrees the stars will come 
out the planets mercury venus mars and jupiter will shine 
streetlights will be triggered on 
the national university is developing six halfhour 
documentaries on eclipses and 10 tv spots on the dangers of looking 
at the sun astronomy professor jesus galindo says 
since september the university newspaper has been publishing 
installments of a book called eclipse that will be translated 
into indian languages 
the government plans to supervise the production of special 
lenses for viewing an eclipse

israel is not a big market for us tobacco 
but an agriculture department analyst says there are opportunities 
if some obstacles can be overcome 
laura r davis of the departments foreign agricultural service 
said domestic production of israeli tobacco declined sharply in 
recent years from a dry weight of 700 metric tons in 1985 to an 
estimated 130 tons in 1990 
but israeli use of unmanufactured tobacco in 1990 was forecast 
at 3900 metric tons meaning that imports of around 4000 tons 
were needed to meet the demands of israels cigarette industry 
cigarette consumption has been fairly stable in israel 
davis said smokers represent a quarter of the population and 
prefer americanstyle cigarettes the recent influx of soviet 
immigrants who are heavy smokers may offset any gains in 
antismoking efforts 
writing in a new report on world tobacco davis said the united 
states accounts for approximately 90 percent of israels annual 40 
million in cigarette imports 
compared with the huge us export trade in total that is 
hardly a puff in the wind 
in october for example exports of 15150 tons of us tobacco 
leaf alone were valued at 106 million and cigarette exports in 
october 187 billion pieces were worth 571 million 
but usda looks carefully at potential foreign markets in hopes 
of adding a bit here and there to the export total 
israels imports have shifted in recent years from the 
unmanufactured tobacco to cigarettes the 4000 tons of leaf 
imported in 1990 is down from nearly 7000 tons in 1986 
meanwhile cigarette imports have climbed to around 2 billion 
pieces annually from 433 million in the same fouryear period 
the israeli tobacco industry is monopolized by one company 
dubek which has roots in the domestic market for over 50 years 
davis said this company is the major force in determining the 
quantity and types of tobacco that is imported 
recent increases in imports however have created competition 
for domestic cigarettes and davis said the israeli government 
would like to encourage additional competition for domestic 
cigarette manufacturers and importers 
two cigarette companies attempted to enter the israeli cigarette 
industry in 1989 but failed potomac cigarette co ltd which 
introduced a brand named forum and ca blockers of louisville ky 
which tried to introduce a smokeless cigarette 
davis said production of an established international brand 
would be the most likely to succeed in the israeli cigarette 
market 
a company that would produce cigarettes under license in 
israel and export some portion of total production would qualify 
for investment incentives and tax concession she said 
major cigarette companies have shied away from investing in 
israel for a number of reasons davis said one is israels rigid 
price controls on cigarettes another is that the market is too 
small 
some industry sources say a namebrand manufacturer would want a 
market of at least 5 billion pieces annually the analyst said 
 
washington ap australias young and relatively highincome 
population is developing into an upscale market for us food 
exporters says an agriculture department trade report 
the microwave oven has had a big influence too 
based on 198889 figures the united states had a 15 percent 
share of australias 28 billion in agricultural imports 
including many highvalue prepared and fresh products 
with a very young urban and relatively wealthy population 
that must turn to imports for a substantial amount of 
consumerready products australia should be a market for even more 
us products the report said 
the united states is a major supplier of shelled almonds 
walnuts pecans prepared potatoes fresh strawberries oranges 
grapefruit and onions as well as many other processed items 
some of this market is due to the different growing seasons 
with australia in the southern hemisphere and the united states in 
the northern 
with more australians working increased mobility and a 
greater concern for the pursuit of leisure microwave ovens have 
become the leading domestic appliance in australia and demand is 
expanding for convenience food said john e riesz us 
agricultural counselor in canberra 
a recent informal survey showed products with good potential 
include health foods branbased cereals and breads garlic 
microwaveable foods mexican foods especially frozen meals salad 
dressings mayonnaise snacks confectionery products particularly 
gourmet chocolate items and new innovative food items 
rieszs report was included in the january issue of agexporter 
magazine published by usdas foreign agricultural service 
 
washington ap the agriculture department is seeking public 
comments on setting up a soybean promotion research and consumer 
information program 
congress authorized the soybean program in the 1990 farm law 
along with similar programs for pecans mushrooms and limes the

us industry should log a ninth consecutive 
year of growth in 1991 but just barely says the governments 32nd 
annual forecast of winners and losers in american business 
the commerce department predicted sunday that 110 of 184 
manufacturing industries it surveyed would enjoy rising sales next 
year and the rest will suffer no growth or a drop in sales 
the new year holds promise for hightechnology and medical 
companies but a broad array of businesses tied to automobile and 
housing production face dim prospects it said 
overall the median growth rate for manufacturing sales is 
expected to be a barely perceptible 089 percent down from an 
almostasdismal 095 percent this year 
the median rate was far healthier in 1988 21 percent and 
1987 3 percent the median is the point where half he industries 
had bigger sales increases and half smaller 
the outlook is generally one of continuing but slow growth for 
most sectors said commerce undersecretary j michael farren 
however the departments forecasts are based on the assumption 
the economy will avoid a recession private economists however 
believe the economy was in recession by the fourth quarter of this 
year and will continue to shrink through at least the first three 
months of 1991 
the commerce department assumed growth in the gross national 
product next year would be toward the lower end of a 1 percent3 
percent range while private analysts look for minimal growth of 
around 03 percent 
the 560page report us industrial outlook was prepared 
by 130 analysts using information current through august and 
september it goes on sale to the public in january 
in manufacturing most of the 10 fastestgrowing industries are 
connected with either health care or high technology 
leather tanning and finishing topped the list with 94 percent 
growth but that was an anomaly in an industry that has undergone 
considerable shrinkage in recent years much of the predicted 
growth was based on the assumption that domestic leather production 
would increase because of retaliatory duties imposed on leather 
imports from argentina 
leather tanning was followed by semiconductors the basic 
building block of computer chips with a 89 percent increase in 
sales projected and surgical instruments up 86 percent 
others in the top 10 were surgical supplies medicines 
diagnostic substances poultry slaughtering and processing 
biological products aircraft and dental equipment 
on the bottom of the scale was creamery butter with a projected 
sales decline of 146 percent the report attributed the drop to 
consumers worry about cholesterol and weight gain 
other shrinking industries were mobile homes frozen baked goods 
except bread boat building motors and generators household 
cooking equipment hardwood and flooring mills electric housewares 
and fans fabricated metal and sawmill and planing mills 
the report also evaluated 166 service businesses the 
fastestgrowing sector of the economy electronic information 
services computer software and other computer services topped the 
list slower expansion was projected for movie theaters home 
entertainment and legal services 
in general the report said industries linked to export sales 
will fare better than businesses tied to the domestic economy 
however undersecretary farren conceded that the price of oil 
driven up by the persian gulf crisis likely will prevent the us 
trade deficit from dropping below 100 billion this year as the 
bush administration had predicted earlier the shortfall was 1094 
billion in 1989 
farren said the deficit probably will total 104 billion to 105 
billion this year and about the same in 1991 
meanwhile retail sales in the united states were projected to 
rise only 1 or 2 percent after inflation 
such products as furniture appliances and household audio and 
video equipment are expected to decline farren said 
two key sectors of the economy construction and motor vehicles 
were forecast to have another bad year in 1991 with their weakness 
spilling over into a variety of related industries 
the survey said high vacancy rates will depress officebuilding 
construction by 15 percent while hotel construction will fall 20 
percent residential housing construction was forecast to decline 6 
percent from 122 million units to 115 million 
car sales probably will fall from 95 million this year to 93 
million in 1991 but truck ales likely will rise about 1 percent 
to 47 million the report said

in the two years since becoming transportation 
secretary samuel k skinner has been mentioned for so many other 
top bush administration jobs that he has developed a ritual 
response 
every time his name crops up he recalled in a recent interview 
he calls the person he is rumored to be anxious to replace 
i tell them theres just nothing to it he said we joke 
about it on occasion we laugh about it 
whether the person at the other end of the phone laughs as 
heartily as skinner isnt known 
but it seems to be a measure of his standing in washington that 
skinners name has come up recently as the rumor mill ground on 
about the job of white house chief of staff already held by john 
sununu attorney general a post occupied by dick thornburgh and 
director of the office of management and budget a job held by 
richard darman 
skinner 52 came to washington in 1989 as a relatively unknown 
figure nationally with an extensive resume and political 
connections to president bush and former illinois gov james 
thompson 
a night law school graduate he was in turn an aggressive and 
successful computer salesman at ibm a tough us attorney in 
chicago a lawyer in private practice and head of the chicago 
areas mass transit authority he also ran bushs 1988 campaign in 
illinois 
skinner was tested early in washington 
when the tanker exxon valdez ran aground and spilled 11 million 
gallons of oil into alaskas prince edward sound on march 24 1989 
skinner flew to the scene as the lead cabinet officer dealing with 
the cleanup 
he helped shape tighter aviation security in the wake of the 
bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 
1989 
last year skinner and the transportation department assembled a 
congressionalaviation industry coalition that helped pass the most 
sweeping legislation since the airline industry was deregulated 
it included a national policy to curb aircraft noise and a 
passenger facility charge to help expand airport capacity and ease 
congestion and delays 
skinner now is preparing for a struggle on capitol hill next 
year over his plan to reshape the nations surface transportation 
policy with a fiveyear bill carrying a price tag said to range 
from 70 billion to 90 billion 
with the 44000mile interstate highway system all but complete 
skinner is said to be seeking ways to improve existing highways and 
bridges and ease traffic congestion rather than engage in a new 
round of expensive road building 
meanwhile his name continues to be bandied about for other 
jobs 
skinner said one rumor has some basis in fact he was briefly 
mentioned at the white house as a possible successor to the ailing 
lee atwater as chairman of the republican national committee 
but at times he has suspected that his name is being used by 
unnamed others to jab or tweak an administration colleague 
caught up in the capitals political warfare or under scrutiny by 
the press 
sure that happens skinner said unfortunately they grab 
my name to do it frankly its a little frustrating to be 
constantly mentioned for something else these rumors have me doing 
six different things 
they have me over here being restless said skinner who 
added he is far too busy with planes and trains and highways and 
multibilliondollar budgets to be that 
but in politics one never says never and like most people in his 
position skinner leaves the door at least slightly ajar 
if the president of the united states especially a president 
that im as close to as i am to george bush asks me to do 
something im going to do it he said but hes not going 
to ask me to do anything i dont expect him to 
when asked by reporters recently what bush would have to do to 
twist your arm skinner replied with a flash of humor 
george bush doesnt have to twist my arm he said he 
brought me to the dance and ill go home with him if barbara lets 
me

like a patrolman on the beat lee barrett 
strides into a chinese restaurant flashes his id card and has a 
look around styrocop is on the trail of illicit carryout 
containers 
the city has gotten a complaint that the restaurant is putting 
its egg rolls and fried rice in boxes that violate portlands 
yearold ban on polystyrene foam fastfood containers 
barrett 44 a longtime environmental activist is the bans 
enforcer a local television reporter dubbed him styrocop a 
takeoff on the movie robocop his first day on the job and 
hes become something of a celebrity 
but while hes easily portlands most visible environmentalist 
barrett is reluctant to take credit for leading the city into the 
green decade 
what i do is a fly speck as far as recycling is concerned 
he said others do so much a lot of people have been toiling 
and theyre still out there doing the work 
barrett moved to portland from new york in 1972 a year after 
the oregon legislature passed the nations first bottle bill 
imposing a 5cent deposit on beverage cans and bottles 
the bill was barretts first real exposure to recycling 
except for a dim dim memory of saving tin cans during the 
korean war there was no recycling consciousness at all he said 
within a few years barrett was on the board of portland 
recycling team inc a can and bottle depot by 1978 he was 
general manager when portland advertised for a contractor to 
enforce the plastic foam ban he applied 
barrett believes americans must go beyond recycling by rejecting 
products that are overpackaged and becoming accustomed to using 
things again and again 
as a recycler our creed has always been reduce reuse 
recycle he said recycling is the last thing to do before you 
throw it away 
opponents of the ban argue that environmentalists should work 
with the industry to make polystyrene recyclable otherwise they 
say restaurants will substitute paper which will wind up in 
landfills 
the portland law does not restrict containers made of paper or 
plastic not blown into foam those have been the alternatives used 
by fastfood restaurants the only industry affected by the 
portland law few have been willing to switch to glassware and 
dishes 
the 12 million people in the metropolitan area send 99000 tons 
of plastic to the landfill each year that is 9 percent by weight 
of portlands garbage and 18 percent to 20 percent by volume 
advocates pushing stricter recycling rules say the plastic is 
not biodegradable but simply breaks into small pieces birds eat 
the pieces of plastic and die 
business cited by barrett face fines of 250 for a first offense 
and 500 for each subsequent offense 
neither a police officer nor a health inspector barett only 
responds to complaints received by the city hes written only a 
handful of tickets but says the law is a start and has raised 
public awareness 
back at the chinese restaurant barrett spots a stack of 
carryout containers in the kitchen and holds one up 
thats a hundred percent polystyrene he said zero 
percent air its legal barrett asks to see a storeroom 
downstairs where he finds more of the same 
hes satisfied but glad he pressed his inspection 
i need a fair amount of evidence that they have complied he 
said you cant believe everything that you see

a presidential commission planning the 500th 
anniversary celebration of columbus voyage to america has been 
plagued by problems a tiny budget few corporate donations and 
until this month almost no publicity 
now add a conflictofinterest controversy to its list of woes 
the panels chairman miami real estate developer john goudie 
resigned amid disclosures that a close friend has ties to a company 
doing business with the commission 
the events biggest corporate sponsor texaco inc suspended 
its donations in september after raising questions about the 
commissions management another potential sponsor chrysler corp 
may stay away from the event 
and a congressional subcommittee is looking into goudies 
involvement with the christopher columbus licensing group inc or 
cclg of miami and new york 
to have this project blow up in our faces now is making it 
difficult to deal with future sponsors said frederick 
guardabassi a fort lauderdale fla businessman who has served on 
the commission since 1985 so much damage has been done to the 
commission its a tragedy 
the centerpieces of the celebration are replicas of columbus 
three ships being built in spain and originally financed with money 
from texaco the commission is 600000 in arrears in payments for 
the ships which are to follow columbus route and visit 50 us 
ports 
chrysler says it wants to clear up unspecified contractual 
questions before making a donation of more than 1 million 
congress has appropriated 210000 a year for the commission 
which pays for staff salaries and office space 
strapped for cash the commission turned to cclg in 1989 because 
the company was willing to pay 300000 immediately for the 
licensing rights to columbus souvenirs from clocks to key chains 
to coffee mugs 
the rights potentially are worth millions 
goudie is a popular fund raiser for republican candidates in 
florida his hispanic background made him a natural for the 
commission chairmanship say gop figures in miami who know him 
this year cclg paid at least 35000 to manuel gonzalez who 
describes goudie as a close friend the two miami businessmen have 
known each other since their days in junior college gonzalez said 
during the course of several interviews 
other commissioners say they didnt know about gonzalez role 
i was stunned said commissioner charles ginoli who served 
on the finance committee that reviewed the cclg contract 
gonzalez said he was a consultant basically to cclg and that 
the firms president gunter pfitzenmeier asked him for help in 
trying to drum up business for the columbus celebration 
gonzalez says he discussed the idea of becoming a stockholder but 
that i didnt want to put any money into this thing 
i have acted ethically and i didnt share any money with 
john said gonzalez 
in a brief interview goudie said he was involved in no 
improprieties he said gonzalez brought cclg to the commission 
and that the company was the best of five companies that made 
presentations 
some businessmen who dealt with cclg are unhappy 
peter dunev a miami clothing manufacturer agreed to pay 
100000 to cclg for what he thought were exclusive rights to make 
and sell shirts bearing the official columbus logo dunev said 
goudie introduced him to gonzalez and that gonzalez came by 
dunevs office to pick up two payments totaling 50000 last 
summer 
after paying the money dunev found out that other groups here 
and in spain will market their own logos dunev complained to 
goudie and gonzalez cclg then canceled his contract 
dunev said hes out his 50000 and im concerned with the 
direction the columbus celebration is taking id hate to see it 
become a disaster 
then there is tony baltes a souvenir company owner from toledo 
ohio 
baltes and 21 friends and relatives from toledo put up 500000 
a year ago in exchange for 25 percent of the stock in cclg 
last march according to baltes goudie announced he wanted 
gonzalez installed as a stockholder and manager at cclg a few days 
later baltes was removed as a cclg officer in a letter from 
company president pfitzenmeier 
we wanted to be part of the celebration and the investment was 
attractive maybe we got sucked in said baltes who is suing in 
an attempt to win back his post as a cclg officer

first it was the searing heat 
relentless monotony and a plague of flies scorpions and vipers 
now us troops in the saudi arabian desert face a new menace 
bonechilling teethchattering cold 
it makes nighttime an endurance test and forces soldiers to wear 
all the layers of clothing they can lay their hands on 
you can really feel the north wind here theres nothing to 
block it said 2nd lt bob guillo 31 of the 5th battalion of 
the 62nd regiment 11th air defense brigade 
at nights the guards look like a bunch of mummies theyre 
wrapped up so tight in all their clothing said guillo of long 
island in new york 
winter in the desert is relative of course temperatures are 
nothing like the frigid blasts that have been wiping out 
californias orange crop and dumping snow in the northeastern 
united states 
its also a far cry from the deepfreeze chills of military 
history such as temperatures of minus30 at the chosin reservoir 
in the korean war the frostbitten battle of the bulge in 1944 or 
napoleons disastrous retreat from moscow in 1812 in which 
general winter and russian partisans decimated his army 
but over the weekend it was 34 degrees in the northern desert 
and much colder with the wind chill 
highs barely reach 70 degrees thats a plunge of about 50 
degrees in the highs and lows that greeted the first us ground 
troops in august 
i didnt know it could get this cold in the desert said 
sgt daniel flores 27 of fresno calif serving with the armys 
75th artillery brigade 
the cold makes soldiers burrow deep into their downfilled 
sleeping bags to stay warm those who pull guard duty at night feel 
it the worst 
specialist hector macias 25 of el paso texas looked like 
something out of a sciencefiction film as he patrolled his 
perimeter 
he wore longjohns under his camouflage fatigues and covered 
himself with a night parka and insulated liner he wore a tshirt 
around his ears and had arctic mittens to keep his trigger finger 
from turning numb 
you can feel it down to the bone if you dont wear your 
longjohns youll be freezing out here macias said 
the mess tent supplied him with hot chocolate coffee and soup 
during his threehour watch 
traditionally january and february are the winter months in 
saudi arabia its also the season for the shamal which 
literally means northwest wind which spawns sandstorms 100 miles 
wide 
the wind drives the sand at more than 50 mph stripping paint 
off cars and sending a haze 18000 feet up into the air 
soldiers in the northern desert braved a mild sandstorm on 
christmas day the sand was so thick it nearly shut down helicopter 
traffic and made it impossible to see whole brigades encamped 100 
yards away 
this is the closest thing to a snowstorm youll get in the 
desert said capt michael huber 30 of anchorage alaska the 
commander of a company of combat engineers in the armys 20th 
engineer brigade 
most units rig heaters to their outdoor showers for hot water 
the real trick is running back out to get dressed in the tents 
that walk between the showers and the tents is a little 
nippy said specialist craig nordstrom 21 a medic with the 
armys 595th medical company out of fort devens mass

whether you were pleased or peeved by the 
performance of americas legislature last year get ready for 
congressthe sequel 
the cast being sworn in this week for the 102nd congress is much 
as it was in the 101st but the unaddressed problems have grown to 
the point where those in starring roles must put in much bigger 
performances 
thomas s foley dwash returns as speaker of the house 
george mitchell dmaine as senate majority leader and robert h 
michel rill and bob dole rkan as minority leaders of the 
house and senate respectively 
their backups standins and bit players remain the same too 
as another twoyear period of governing begins thursday the 
football redskins a more popular washington institution make more 
roster changes than the voters make with congress 
the plot for the coming session picks up where things left off 
last fall but now its clear theres much more riding on every 
twist 
shooting has not broken out in the persian gulf but the level 
of tension has risen dramatically 
congress immediately faces the prospect of the jan 15 deadline 
by which iraqs saddam hussein is supposed to withdraw from kuwait 
in the event that president bush carries through with his threat 
to attack congress must decide whether to insist that he obtain a 
declaration of war or some other endorsement of the action 
the democrats in congress have so far been walking a fine line 
balancing their prerogatives under the constitution with the need 
to voice support for the presidents policy 
they also are keenly aware that in the aftermath of vietnam you 
can oppose a war but youd better not be seen as less than fully 
supporting american fighting men and women 
if bush fights a war and quickly wins democrats dont want to 
be seen as losers but if the gulf situation drags on in war or 
peace and becomes politically unpopular the democrats want to be 
able to sever their ties with him 
that will be a major theme at least for the first weeks of 
congress return 
i think its makeorbreak time for george bush dole said 
sunday on nbcs meet the press 
but the senate gop leader wasnt referring just to the persian 
gulf 
weve got twin problems i think he could do very well in 
the gulf and still go downhill on the economy dole said that 
may be more difficult to deal with in the final analysis than the 
gulf crisis 
like the gulf the issue of the economy was around when congress 
adjourned last october but it has become much more sharply defined 
since then as statistics show the recession looking deeper and 
perhaps lasting longer than believed a few months ago 
both congress and the white house will come under increasing 
pressure to address the nations economic problems but the huge 
federal deficit going up despite last falls approval of tax hikes 
and spending restraints might close the doors on many options 
the 101st congress was at times dominated by ethics debates and 
it looks as though the 102nd will be too 
the senate ethics committee this week resumes hearings on the 
keating five the senators who allegedly did improper favors for 
charles keating the top executive of a failed savings and loan 
institution 
will the five be punished by their peers and how many tens of 
billions of dollars of taxpayers money will be needed to continue 
the sampl bailout stay tuned 
related unfinished plot lines from the last congress include 
campaign reform and the congressional salary structure the 102nd 
congress begins with senators getting paid 101900 and house 
members 125100 will the senate follow the house and take a pay 
raise in exchange for limits on members outside earnings 
other issues returning from the last congress include bills to 
expand civil rights and to guarantee unpaid leave to workers after 
childbirth or for other family emergencies bush vetoed those 
measures 
congress also may attempt to address problems with health care 
insurance education and the nations trade imbalance 
its impossible to predict where events will carry the new 
congress but undoubtedly the players soon will be looking ahead to 
the ending the 1992 presidential and congressional elections

the bush administration must try to find a 
diplomatic solution to the persian gulf crisis before going to war 
top lawmakers say but they disagree over whether to hold back 
money if the fighting starts without congressional approval 
a diplomatic effort really needs to be made and has to be made 
before the decision to go to war rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee said sunday 
his thoughts were echoed by the senates ranking republican bob 
dole of kansas who said he would like to see president bush 
pursue at least one additional time a date for usiraqi 
discussions 
the american people are not yet committed to war and they 
want to make certain that president bush has done everything 
pursued every avenue for peace before the firing starts dole 
said on nbctvs meet the press 
dole said iraqi president saddam hussein may be willing to bend 
in an effort to end the stalemate on diplomatic talks 
he said iraqs ambassador to the united states mohamed 
almashat telephoned him from baghdad on saturday night with that 
news i had some indication there was some flexibility he 
said 
previously saddam had said he was only able to see secretary of 
state james a baker iii on jan 12 a date rejected by the united 
states as too close to the jan 15 deadline set by the united 
nations for iraqi troops to leave kuwait a un resolution 
authorized the use of force to expel iraq after that date 
dole said mashat indicated it would not have to be the 12th of 
january 
rep lee hamilton dind appearing with aspin on cbstvs 
face the nation predicted an intense round of diplomatic 
negotiations as jan 15 draws near because people are very very 
nervous about the outbreak of war 
there are some straws that indicate a diplomatic solution may 
work he said but arbitrary deadlines ought to be ignored in any 
case 
the new congress goes into session thursday but is expected to 
quickly recess until later in the month 
bush will meet gop and democratic leaders at the white house 
lawmakers said they will press bush on whether he intends to ask 
congress to give him warmaking authority before he launches any 
attack 
i do think thats a very very important thing that we do 
have a vote on that in congress aspin said 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo has suggested the 
democraticcontrolled congress might try to cut off money for 
operation desert shield if bush initiates a war without prior 
congressional approval 
dole called such an attempt incredible and a big big 
political mistake that would not get through congress 
but dole agreed with gephardt that japan and germany should pay 
more of the cost of keeping more than 300000 us troops in the 
gulf region 
dole like bush expressed optimism the gulf crisis can be 
resolved peacefully 
my gut tells me there will be a resolution without firing a 
shot he said 
bush told time magazine in an interview to be published today 
that his instincts told him saddam would pull troops from kuwait 
meantime vice president dan quayle today was spending the first 
of two days visiting us troops in the desert

vice president dan quayles decision 
to play golf at an american course that bars women is following him 
to a country that forbids them to drive cars or socialize or work 
with men 
quayle cut short an outing last friday at the cypress point golf 
course in pebble beach calif after learning it was the subject 
of controversy because it had no black member 
but he said sunday hell continue to play at the maleonly 
burning tree club in the washington suburb of bethesda md where 
he is an honorary member by virtue of his office 
ive played there before and ill play there again he said 
when questioned by reporters traveling with him to visit us 
troops in the persian gulf region 
im not going to protest burning tree he said maybe 
theyll change i think it would be a good idea for them to take 
women into the club i dont have any problem playing there in the 
meanwhile 
further he noted there are a lot other very wellrespected 
people that have played at burning tree 
 
the setting was opulent with the soothing gurgle of indoor 
fountains in the airy goldtrimmed hall where quayle greeted saudi 
dignitaries on sunday 
but the ringing of a loud bell repeatedly disrupted the quiet of 
the vice presidents first evening in riyadh 
it sounded just like a clattering fire alarm and in fact it 
was smouldering incense the saudis were burning to welcome the 
quayle party activated a smoke detector 
while the room did not seem at all smoky the detectors high in 
the gilded ceilings were very sensitive information ministry 
spokesman mohamed khayat explained the long line of robed saudi 
officials filing though the reception line to meet quayle seemed 
oblivious to the intermittent clatter 
how then would they know if the palace was really on fire 
khayat said reassuringly that the alarm system is equipped to 
ring nonstop not intermittently if it detects heavy smoke 
 
its a long way from sears roebuck headquarters in chicago but 
in some ways navy cmdr lou smiths job isnt that different from 
his executive position with the department store chain he says 
smith was director of corporate communications for sears and 
also a navy reservist generally fulfilling his military duties one 
weekend a month he had to leave his civilian job when called a 
month ago to serve at us military headquarters in riyadh as 
deputy director of public relations 
in some ways he said handing public relations for gen norman 
schwarzkopf the us commander has parallels to working for 
civilian counterparts in the business world who are as powerful in 
their own spheres as schwarzkopf is here 
smith escorting reporters traveling with quayle said he never 
expected to get such a choice assignment when called to active 
duty 
he stood beneath a mammoth crystal chandelier in the entry hall 
of king fahds goldtrimmed palace complex where quayle was meeting 
the king and joked with a shrug how am i going to be able to go 
back home its going to be hard to go back to sears after this

islamic fundamentalists in pakistan 
have no objection to new years eve parties as long as the 
celebrants dont dance drink or mingle with the opposite sex 
a group calling itself the tigers of allah has strung 
banners throughout the city of karachi denouncing new years 
celebrations as a product of the decadent west 
skullandcrossbone insignias emblazon the banners which warn 
beware 
leading the drive against festivities to welcome in 1991 is the 
small but powerful jamaatiislami party of god a key member of 
pakistans rightwing coalition government 
were not against celebrations as such but we are against 
what is against decency and our own value system khurshed ahmed 
a parliamentarian and jamaat party leader said sunday 
we have warned people that we would not allow these types of 
celebrations in a country where moslems are in government said 
khalid rehman another jamaat leader 
islam was never that narrowminded said one religious 
analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity people who are like 
this and they are there in every religion make religion a joke 
what is unislamic that people be happy 
but threats canceled parties at all hotels none of which serve 
alcohol because it is banned in this predominantly moslem nation of 
120 million people 
mohammad akram a karachi hotel manager said telephone threats 
and warnings put a damper on any festivities 
the callers just say you better not have any new years eve 
celebrations or you will face the consequences akram said 
the threatened consequences ranged from bombing the hotel to 
throwing stones at it 
hotels have taken out advertisements in english and 
urdulanguage newspapers promising a quiet new years eve 
most restaurants were to close at 10 pm just in case 
said another hoetl manager who declined to be identified by name 
many of pakistans more liberal moslems say that because islamic 
fundamentalists have such influence in the governing party even 
individuals are afraid to talk too loudly of planned celebrations 
everyone is so quiet they either indiffierent to a 
celebration or are afraid said one analyst 
pakistans moslems follow the islamic calendar which begins 
with the prophet mohammeds 200mile journey from mecca to medina

guards armed with machine guns patrol the gray 
perimeter wall of lurigancho prison but rarely venture inside 
where emaciated inmates in rags spend their days picking through 
garbage for food 
the prisoners who populate the prisons brown barren grounds 
are too violent and too diseased the guards say 
many are dying from tuberculosis 
conditions in lurigancho have always been notoriously bad then 
president alberto fujimori slashed government spending and life 
become more tenuous 
most of the prisoners in lurigancho havent even been convicted 
of a crime eight of 10 people in lurigancho are still awaiting 
trial and some have been waiting as long as eight years 
others completed their sentences long ago but have not been 
released 
lurigancho is sometimes seen as a nazilike problem something 
like the final solution for the poor said carlos caparo 
madrid former director of the national penetentiary institute the 
agency that runs the prisons 
many of the inmates agree and often call the prison a 
concentration camp 
lurigancho built to hold 2800 prisoners has about 5500 
inmates but no one knows the exact number 
an average of two prisoners a day die from violence or sicknes 
especially tuberculosis 
its terrible here you can get credit on as many drugs as you 
want but theres no medicine theres no food all there is are 
guns bullets and drugs said charles weedon 43 
weedon a british citizen has served six years of a 10year 
sentence for cocaine possession he lives in pavilion 7 the cell 
block where about 30 foreigners are kept 
lacking bads many prisoners sleep in the open by day they 
squat in garbage piles looking for food or hunch over small fires 
cooking in tin cans and worn pots most of the hundreds of dogs 
cats and rats that once roamed lurigancho have been eaten 
critics of perus troubled overcrowded penal system say lasting 
change will occur only if the system gets enough money to upgrade 
its every aspect 
but peru is struggling with its worst economic crisis this 
century and relief seems distant 
at one point the daily budget to feed a lurigancho prisoner 
fell below 10 cents per prisoner thousands of prisoners went on a 
hunger strike forgoing the one bowl of thin gruel the government 
offered nothing changed 
inmates are allowed to receive food from family members and 
friends but much of the food is stolen by other prisoners or the 
guards 
guards who make about 100 a month also sell food prisoners 
say bribes and kickbacks are common at every step 
drug use is rampant the most common drug used by the prisoners 
is pasta basica semirefined cocaine thats rolled with 
tobacco and smoked 
the only thing that keeps the prison more or less peaceful is 
the pasta basica says the rev hubert lanssiers a belgian 
priest who has been working with prisoners for 15 years it makes 
them sleep and puts them in a constant dream of resignation 
even so the prison is not peaceful many inmates carry long 
knives made of metal bed slats fights often claim inmate lives 
in a june 1986 prison riot some 125 inmates who belonged to the 
shining path guerrilla movement were executed at lurigancho after 
they surrendered to paramilitary police the riot was part of a 
coordinated uprising in three lima prisons during which about 250 
inmates were killed 
lurigancho is organized into 12 cell blocks unofficially there 
is also cell block 13 a former chapel that houses about 35 
prisoners many of them homosexuals and transvestites 
cell block 13 is dark as a cave and the walls are stained black 
from cooking fires the inmates huddle and speak in frightened 
whispers 
jose santos acosta has served four years of a sixyear sentence 
for burglary his clothes and skin are covered with filth his 
voice is weak because he is dying of tuberculosis 
acosta lifts up his ragged shirt to show a chest and abdomen 
with long scars on his side is taped a dirty plastic bag that 
holds part of his intestines seven years ago he was shot by a 
policeman and the wound has never properly healed 
they cant operate on me until they cure my tuberculosis but 
the doctor here doesnt want to give me the treatment i need 
acosta says 
soon after he took office in july fujimori began a campaign to 
reform the entire judicial system 
he used lurigancho as an example 
look at the conditions they live in the poor and outcast 
people without means are rotting away in the jails he said 
fujimori pledged to pardon hundreds of prisoners accused of 
minor crimes but never sentenced 
but the government has been slow to act on its promises and few 
believe life in lurigancho will improve soon 
theres no doubt about it lanssiers said lurigancho is 
an inferno

with about two dozen members 
authorities said gang members boasted about their assassination 
plans on fliers posted around the san fernando valley 
i consider them a flock of idiots to tell you the truth 
said cmdr william booth a police department spokesman 
informants also tipped off police vojtecky said 
as early as september we began getting information that local 
street gangs were getting a little irritated and we had 
indications they were going to attempt to kill a cop because we 
were screwing up their drug operations in the streets he said

the argentine nation is bitterly 
divided over president carlos menems weekend pardon of key figures 
in the 1970s military dictatorship that conducted a dirty war 
on leftists 
a key figure in the leftist terrorism of the era mario 
firmenich the 42yearold cofounder of the montonero movement 
was also pardoned by menem 
but the outcry sunday was over the military figures freed 
about 40000 people a broad crosssection of ages income 
levels political parties unions professionals students 
gathered outside menems office sunday afternoon waving banners 
and shouting derisory chants 
were here to tell him that we havent forgotten what 
happened and we wont forget said protester daniel sossa he 
said his aunt was arrested during the 197683 dictatorship and 
never heard from again 
menem himself jailed without charge during the period told 
reporters they can have all the marches they want that 
doesnt bother me i believe it was best for my country period 
human rights groups called for national mourning and protest 
marches 
but there was joy in a group representing families of victims of 
leftist killings at the release of six exgenerals including 
former presidents jorge videla 65 and roberto viola 66 and five 
other former officials 
roman catholic bishop jaime de nevares said the pardons mocked 
justice broke the law and trampled on human rights another church 
leader archbishop antonio quarracino said they were necessary and 
make me happy 
the two rival factions of the general labor federation 
argentinas major labor group were also divided 
recent polls had indicated that up to 80 percent of argentines 
would oppose the pardons which menem said would close a sad and 
black stage of argentine history in announcing them saturday 
videla freed saturday after more than five years in prison 
attended mass at a chapel near his apartment sunday and handed 
reporters a short statement that said in part i ask god to 
extinguish forever the hatred among argentines with the goal that 
we all may reconcile ourselves in peace union and liberty 
viola videla and six other senior officers were pardoned for 
crimes including torture illegal detention and murder former 
finance minister jose martinez de hoz and two former civilian 
officials all of whom had been jailed on other charges were 
included in the pardon 
menem said the pardons by ending a justification for military 
restiveness would allow argentina to look ahead but many said 
they merely reopened wounds 
the pardons do not leave the past behind but take us back to 
the worst failures of our past said former president raul 
alfonsin leader of the main opposition party the radical civic 
union 
this is the saddest day in argentine history he said 
urban terrorist attacks in the 1970s and the military juntas 
heavyhanded response still wrench argentinas national psyche 
seven years after the return to democracy with alfonsins election 
in october 1983 
menem was elected last year 
alfonsin and the congress gave amnesty to hundreds of 
lowerranking officers after three military uprisings against his 
government to protest pending trials of soldiers accused of rights 
abuses 
a fourth rebellion to protest videlas imprisonment was crushed 
by the government dec 3 menem had earlier promised the military 
that the pardons were in the works 
the military insists it was forced to use unconventional methods 
to stop the leftist guerrillas but many claim the military used 
the insurgency as a pretext for repression 
at least 8960 alleged leftists disappeared and were presumed 
executed human rights put the death toll at about 30000

responding to a formidable public outcry 
the government has reversed itself and decided not to go ahead with 
announced plans to pardon leaders of the 196774 military 
dictatorship 
prime minister constantine mitsotakis had said friday that he 
decided for humanitarian reasons to pardon nearly all the jailed 
former members of the junta some of whom are serving life 
sentences 
that provoked cries of outrage from socialists communists and 
other leftists both in greece and on the island of cyprus 
it also drew criticism from members of the governing new 
democracy party cabinet members and other prominent conservatives 
on sunday the government said it was backing down in order to 
avoid political tension 
the universal condemnation both in greece and on cyprus by 
the overwhelming majority of the people forced the government to a 
hasty retreat said andreas papandreou the leader of the main 
opposition socialists 
approval had been expected by a government committee this week 
but newspapers reported sunday that president constantine 
caramanlis would not sign the necessary presidential decree his 
office would not confirm the reports 
most politicians conservative and leftwing were jailed 
tortured or exiled during the seven years of military rule 
the governments change of heart came at a cabinet meeting its 
announcement said 
the government believed and believes that democracy in our 
country is so strong that it can show its humanity the 
announcement said 
but it said that in order to avoid turning this issue into the 
object of artificial political tension it decided to not advance 
the procedures for the granting of a pardon 
a protest against the pardons had been planned for today 
papandreou whose elected socialist government was in power from 
1981 to 1989 had said he would request an emergency debate in 
parliament on the issue 
leftists accused mitsotakis of repaying a political debt to a 
projunta rightist group that has backed his new democracy party 
the former rulers had themselves never sought pardon or amnesty 
but junta supporters have lobbied for an amnesty since the officers 
were sentenced 
eight members of the junta are serving prison terms ranging from 
20 years to life imprisonment convicgted of treason torture or 
the murder of prodemocracy student protesters 
those serving life sentences include col george papadopoulos 
71 who led the 1967 coup his brother constantine 69 and former 
brig dimitris ioannides 67 ioannides exchief of the dreaded 
military police overthrew papadopoulos in a 1973 coup 
under mitsotakis proposal the only junta member who would not 
have been pardoned was ioannides who also engineered a failed 1974 
coup in cyprus by rightwing supporters of the islands union with 
greece 
the disastrous coup attempt prompted an invasion of cyprus by 
turkey which partitioned the eastern mediterranean island it also 
caused the juntas collapse and the restoration of democracy in 
greece 
on cyprus nearly all political parties condemned the proposal 
to pardon the leaders government spokesman akis fantis said 
cypriots will always hold the greek military dictators responsible 
for the islands division

the director of the hospital where 
nancy cruzan died won a court order against the father of another 
patient who wants to remove his braindamaged daughters feeding 
tube 
pete busalacchi wants to transfer his 20yearold daughter 
christine from the missouri rehabilitation center to minnesota 
where she could die under a state provision that recognizes ethical 
decisions by doctors 
the hospitals director fought the move claiming ms busalacchi 
has a better chance of recovering than ms cruzan did 
ms cruzan died at the missouri hospital dec 26 after her 
parents won a landmark court battle to have her feeding tube 
disconnected 
prolife advocates predicted a tidal wave of euthanasia 
cases after her death 
since a 1987 car accident in st louis ms busalacchi has been 
in a vegetative state similar to that of ms cruzan the subject of 
the supreme courts first righttodie ruling 
i really sometimes feel with chris that the lights on but no 
ones home busalacchi said sunday i believe my daughter is 
dead and all i have left in the hospital is a machine 
judge scott sifferman of lawrence county court issued a 
temporary restraining order saturday after the centers director 
don lamkins said there is scientific and observational 
evidence that ms busalacchi is aware of her surroundings 
lamkins said the 10day restraining order would allow doctors to 
examine her further sifferman scheduled a jan 8 hearing to review 
the doctors findings 
lamkins said ms busalacchi waved at him after a nurse ordered 
her to but her father said there is no indication she responds to 
commands 
yes her fingers can move but it doesnt happen on command 
he said they also say she can smile at you but its no smile 
that you or i would recognize it isnt my daughters smile 
dr ronald cranford of hennepin county medical center in 
minneapolis a neurologist and medical ethicist said ms 
busalacchi is incapable of conscious thoughts or deliberate 
actions 
ms cruzans parents joe and joyce cruzan fought a threeyear 
legal battle to have their 33yearold daughters feeding tube 
disconnected 
the supreme court ruled last june that ms cruzan severely 
brain damaged in a 1983 car accident could be allowed to die if 
there was clear and convincing evidence she would want to 
although she had left no written instructions on her intentions 
former coworkers testified that she said she would never want to 
live like a vegetable busalacchi said he does not have such 
proof 
certainly this has set off the tidal wave we warned about 
since there is no clear and convincing evidence in christines case 
that she would want to die rita marker director of the 
international antieuthanasia task force said sunday from 
steubenville ohio 
busalacchi said a doctor told him two years ago that his 
daughters condition was hopeless 
i asked him to compare chris condition with nancy cruzans 
he said he responded with two words the same 
he said he was encouraged sunday by a telephone call from joe 
cruzan who offered to help in any way he could 
ive tried to be strong in all of this but i dont have 
anybody to lean on but myself sometimes i get angry and 
frustrated when that happens i do try to think about chris as she 
was

intend to check with parents to confirm any childs story she 
said 
if kids have the justification for being out on the streets 
outside the time limit if we get a confirmation from a parent we 
have no problem with that she said its for those loitering 
hanging around without an obvious purpose thats who were 
concerned about 
thirtyone violators have been detained and 24 parents have been

the procrastinators club could get a bad 
name for this it released its 1990 predictions a day before the 
year ended 
normally we wait until the very last minute to make these 
predictions but we want to get this year over with said 
president les waas who released the list on sunday 
the clubs annual forecasts have been completely accurate 
for the past dozen years among the latest predictions 
a lipsynching pop group named milli will mourn the loss of 
its beloved grammy 
an nfl team will show more of its stuff in the locker room 
than on the field 
the biography of a dog named millie will outsell one written 
by a former resident of the same house 
a tv star will grab more than attention while singing our 
national anthem 
liz taylor will parlay one scent into many dollars 
a trumpedup fortune will crumble as a donald ducks 
and perhaps most outlandish of all east and west germany will 
reunite 
the club formed in 1956 and now has has 8500 members waas 
estimates a half million potential members havent gotten around to 
joining 
he said the club would never make advance predictions 
it doesnt make sense he said by doing it our way in 
one year we make more correct predictions than all of the other 
major prognosticators 
our theory is if you wait until the last minute to do 
something it still gets done and look at all the time you save 
he said 
lets say you do your income taxes at the last minute that 
takes about three hours if you start to do them now itll 
probably take the next three months and youll be worrying about 
them all the time too

the dollar closed lower against the japanese yen in 
slow trading today despite some recovery from its sharp decline 
earlier in the day 
the tokyo stock exchange was closed for the new year holidays 
both the stock and foreign exchange markets will begin 1991 trading 
on friday 
the dollar closed 1990 trading at 13540 yen down 065 yen from 
fridays close of 13605 yen it opened at 13410 yen its low for 
the day and ranged as high as 13545 yen 
the dollar had finished 1989 trading at 14340 yen during 1990 
it ranged between 12440 yen and 15995 yen 
mondays spot trading totaled 309 billion compared with 
fridays 55 billion 
a dealer at the bank of tokyo who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the dollars sharply lower opening resulted from 
investors low expectations for the us economy last week the 
dollar had been rising on purchases for yearend settlements 
todays trading was quiet with not much marketaffecting news 
the dealer added 
another dealer said the dollars early plunge in tokyo followed 
heavy selling in sydney where trading started earlier on rumors 
and news reports suggesting the possibility of a peaceful solution 
in the middle east 
fears of middle east war had weakened the yen because japan 
imports almost all of its oil and 70 percent of it comes from that 
region the dollar also is seen as a safe haven in troubled times

the new year brings double trouble for the 
absentminded in tokyo along with remembering a new date theyll 
have to remember new telephone numbers 
telephone numbers in the metropolitan area will expand to eight 
digits to cope with an overwhelming demand for more telephone 
lines the nippon telegraph and telephone corp said today 
after 2 am tuesday callers will have to dial a 3 before 
the current sevendigit local tokyo numbers beepers and phones in 
some areas of tokyo already have eight digits but most japanese 
numbers currently have seven 
the change will affect about 614 million telephone numbers the 
sevendigit system has the capacity for 10 million numbers but 
with eightdigit numbers we wont have to worry about the lack 
of phone lines for a long time said ntt spokesman haruo maeda 
ntt has spent some 37 million on the switchover including 
yearlong mechanical changes and public announcements since 
september 
some confusion is expected at first 
since people have been used to the 7digit numbers for so 
long it might be difficult to switch to the new system right 
away said masatoshi inadome of ntts customer service many 
will have to learn after at least one failure he said 
we are afraid many people may forget to fix numbers programmed 
into their fax machines personal computers and telephone sets 
he said the problem is that callers can hear our recorded 
reminder when they forget to add the extra digit but fax users 
wont inadome said 
in addition to the prerecorded tape service to remind those who 
forget to add the extra 3 dozens of ntt staffers will stay 
overnight in their branches nationwide to help callers 
kokusai denshin denwa co the nations leading long distance 
carrier will also provide tapes in japanese and english to remind 
callers of the change inadome said

former hostage frank reed has appealed to 
syrian president hafez assad to help free 13 westerners still held 
in lebanon 
i beg you and all nations within the community of man to reach 
into their wells of justice and sense of humanity and come to their 
rescue reed wrote in a letter to assad he wants to meet with 
the syrian president 
what a perfect season for syria to demonstrate to all 
americans and the world that its sense of humanity and human caring 
goes beyond standing guard together in the sands of arabia the 
letter said 
reed said sunday he discussed the hostages during a 30minute 
meeting in washington dec 14 with syrian ambassador walid 
almoualem he gave almoualem letters for assad and followed up 
with a mailgram dec 27 but said he has received no reply 
almoualem had greeted reed when he was released in damascus 
syria last april after 44 months in captivity six of the 13 are 
americans but no americans have been freed since reed and robert 
polhill were released within nine days of each other 
bothering me was the enormous attention paid in the media and 
by our administration to people who were detained in iraq and 
living in special conditions that in no way could be comparable to 
what the situation was in lebanon reed said so i decided to 
take it upon myself and go to the syrian government 
reed noted in one letter that it was the sixth christmas in 
captivity for terry anderson 43 chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press and thomas sutherland 59 acting dean of 
agriculture at the american university of beirut 
peggy say andersons sister plans to travel to lebanon in 
january and has vowed not to return without her brother 
i would probably do the same thing after all this time reed 
said her presence will possibly remind everybody there her 
brother is a hostage and should be released 
the other american captives are joseph cicippio 59 acting 
comptroller at the american university in beirut edward tracy 59 
west beirut resident alann steen 51 a communications instructor 
at beirut university college and jesse turner 42 professor of 
mathematics and computer science at beirut university college 
the hostages are believed to be held by proiranian islamic 
shiites syria has about 40000 troops in lebanon and has tightened 
its grip as the major power broker there

professor said 
the monument commemorates a battle in eastcentral greece in 86 
bc at which the romans defeated invaders from asia minor 
it was uncovered last february by students from the university 
of california berkeley said john camp a berkeley professor of 
archaeology and codirector of us excavations in greece 
the odds of finding a historically attested inscription must 
be one in a million camp said he reported the find sunday at a 
meeting of the archaeological institute of america 
plutarch who lived from about 46 to 120 ad referred to the 
battle at chaironeia and the monument in his book life of 
sulla a biography of the roman general 
two local men homoloichos and anaxidamos were credited with 
leading roman troops up a hidden path and surrounding the invaders 
the monuments greek inscription proclaims homoloichos and 
anaxidamos are heroes 
the students found the monument while searching through piles of 
rock near what was known as mount thourion near where they 
believed the battle had occurred 
to actually be able to put your hands on this physical thing 
that is the proof of an ancient story is very exciting said 
gretchen umholtz one of the students 
the announcement of the discovery was delayed until paperwork 
required by the greek government was completed camp said 
the greek government promised to put the monument in a museum 
and the students were invited to submit an article on the find to 
the american journal of archaeology he said

amid police barricades and metal 
detectors rap music returned to one of the citys largest 
auditoriums after a yearlong ban imposed to curb violence at 
concerts 
the moratorium ended saturday when too short and ice cube played 
under unusually tight security for 3000 fans in the henry j 
kaiser auditorium 
it was the first such show since violence prompted officials at 
the auditorium and the oakland coliseum to ban rap concerts for a 
year the coliseum has yet to book another rap show 
im glad its back said fan tom armstrong 27 rap is 
good for oaktown its whats happening here 
concert promoter bill graham said he increased his security 
force by about onethird and the auditoriums managers designed a 
special security plan for the concert 
a police helicopter hovered overhead lighting the parking lot 
with a bright beam barricades circled the parking lot and fans 
were ushered through a maze of metal gates before they reached the 
halls entrance where they were searched and then scanned by a 
metal detector 
at the end of the show the crowd was herded out past a line of 
police officers and security personnel 
just another saturday night dance graham quipped we want 
to let the negative element know were here to take care of 
things 
a fight between rival gangs at a 2 live crew concert in december 
1989 capped a series of violent incidents that led to the ban 
including a fracas at the coliseum during which one person was 
shot 
too short known for biting and sometimes raunchy lyrics 
repeatedly reminded fans to stay calm saturday night there were no 
major incidents officials said

for more than five months protesters from across 
the country tested the tolerance of soviet authorities with a tent 
city that went up just 200 yards from the kremlin 
in several hours saturday night police with bulldozers cleared 
it away 
the order was to clear it out by new years and give the 
impression that all the issues were resolved vadim shilov a 
22yearold resident of the tent city said in a telephone 
interview 
the protesters pressed a variety of causes reflecting the social 
upheaval in the soviet union 
some of the signs that adorned the tents and shacks denounced 
the communist party others told of losing homes and jobs because 
the protesters had dared to criticize their bosses 
rumors had been floating since september that authorities would 
clear away the nearly 30 plastic and cardboard shacks erected in 
front of the giant rossiya hotel 
according to several sources police and bulldozer crews moved 
in saturday night acting on orders of the moscow city council 
shilov said riot police wearing bulletproof vests took away 
about 50 people beating some with truncheons his account could 
not be independently confirmed 
two city police dispatchers refusing to give their names said 
sunday that some of the squatters were bused to police centers for 
people not registered at any address others who were registered 
were given tickets home 
one of the police dispatchers offered the only official 
explanation of the city council decision those people violated 
sanitary norms he said 
neither dispatcher was able to give a number of the squatters 
but a reporter had seen about a dozen at the tent city earlier 
saturday 
the collection of shacks and protest posters was a symbol not 
only of the social turmoil caused by gorbachevs reforms but also 
of his moves toward democracy that included an unprecedented 
tolerance of dissent 
before gorbachev the eyesore located so close to the 
countrys most sacred governmental shrines would have been torn 
down immediately and its instigators jailed for years 
official doctrine maintained that such phenomena could only 
exist in the west where exploitation and injustices were rampant 
the tent city originally was supposed to demonstrate what 
democracy is like in the soviet union we are a litmus paper of 
soviet democracy zhanna fedina a 54yearold former regular at 
the tent city said sunday in a telephone interview she said she 
did not witness the removal of the squatters 
the protest began july 2 when the demonstrators put up the 
tents and shacks hoping to attract official attention and help in 
their struggles with government they generally arrived at 8 am 
and left at 9 pm 
the initial targets were delegates attending a congress of the 
communist party in the nearby kremlin in early july 
passersby would slowly walk past the tents some of which were 
merely poles with clear plastic sheets draped over them others 
were more elaborate storebought olive green canvas tents with 
stones carefully placed outside to form a makeshift porch 
it was the first thing tourists leaving the rossiya saw with 
the colorful st basils cathedral and the kremlin forming a 
backdrop

president yang shangkun today reaffirmed the 
chinese governments goal of doubling the gross national product in 
the coming decade 
i am fully confident in the realization of this goal yang 
said in new years greetings over radio beijing chinas staterun 
international radio 
senior leader deng xiaoping in 1978 set the goal of quadrupling 
chinas gnp by the turn of the century 
the gnp doubled during the booming 1980s and economists say that 
even with moderate growth chinas gnp should reach the goal of 
538 billion by the centurys end 
moderate growth is what the ruling communists mandated in the 
economic and social blueprint for the 1990s they released sunday 
the document suggests no dramatic new reform initiatives urging 
instead a return to basics 
economically that will mean more funds for agriculture raw 
materials industries the infrastructure and the military 
politically the emphasis will be on ideological discipline and 
collective labor 
for a long time to come we must persist in building the 
country through thrift and diligence the party central committee 
exhorted in the communique adopted at a secret sixday meeting 
that ended sunday 
the document filled the front pages today of all leading 
newspapers several newspapers also carried editorials applauding 
the party for the complete success of its meeting which had 
been delayed months by internal debates 
in the end the conservatives appeared to have dominated if 
only by sheer force of numbers in addition to 278 full and 
alternate members of the central committee the meeting was 
attended by 268 members of the central advisory commission and 
commission for discipline inspection party bodies made up largely 
of elderly ideological hardliners 
while leaving the door open to further marketstyle economic 
reforms the document stresses that the goal is to make the 
socialist system work better not replace it with capitalism 
the communique did not mention directly the collapse of 
socialism in most other countries but reflected the siege 
mentality that has developed among chinas aging revolutionaries 
since they crushed a democracy movement at home last year and 
watched similar movements succeed in eastern europe 
western observers believe the partys difficulty in drafting the 
plans for the 1990s reflects a leadership vaccuum senior leader 
deng 86 appears to have lost considerable prestige since the 
massive 1989 democracy movement and bloody crackdown that followed 
the communique made only a single perfunctory mention of dengs 
historical contributions it failed to mention his recent call for 
better more rapid and more effective reform 
reform was one of the key issues dividing the committee 
party elders such as 86yearold chen yun who helped implement 
initial marketstyle reforms in the 1980s argued that private 
enterprise and free markets should not be allowed to replace the 
state sector 
the communique echoed chens position by urging efforts to 
strengthen the inefficient debtridden state sector and establish 
more collective companies in the service sector now dominated by 
private entrepreneurs

a bomb ripped through a toilet at an outdoor 
market in the heart of jewish west jerusalem today killing an arab 
woman who apparently was handling the explosives police said 
they said the victim was a 24yearold woman from the occupied 
west bank 
apparently the person who was handling the charge was killed 
in this toilet stall said police commissioner yaacov terner she 
was alone in the toilet and there were no other casualties he 
said 
the explosion occurred at about 1130 am at the mahane yehuda 
market terner said the woman was torn to pieces but a witness 
said she was still alive immediately after the blast 
shopkeeper meir cohen said he ran into the toilet and found the 
woman lying under a fallen door she was alive the woman i 
lifted her head she moved her head as if she wanted to speak 
wanted help he said 
cohen said she had something in her hand which he feared might 
be another bomb so he ran to nearby police to summon help 
shahar ayalon a senior police officer said a bag of vegetables 
was found beside the woman and it is reasonable to assume that 
she intended to plant the bomb in the bag and place it on one of 
the adjacent streets 
the explosion apparently was relatively small a cookie vendor 
30 feet from the toilet said he heard a muffled pop that did not 
even shake his stall the only exterior sign of damage to the 
toilet was a shattered window 
police sealed the immediate vicinity of the toilet but there 
was no panic hundreds of shoppers continued about their business 
the blast occurred on the eve of the 26th anniversary of the 
first armed attack inside israel by fatah the mainstream guerrilla 
arm of the palestine liberation organization 
asked whether he thought the bomb was linked with the 
anniversary terner said i have no doubt it is connected 
terner said police were making a huge effort to forestall 
trouble in jerusalem and elsewhere 
appeals were broadcast over the markets public address system 
for shoppers to be wary of suspicious packages and report 
anything suspicious to the police immediately 
knots of young men many of them ultraorthodox jews gathered 
at the market occasionally waving their fists and chanting death 
to the arabs someone tossed into the air a handful of leaflets 
of kach the extreme antiarab movement founded by the late rabbi 
meir kahane 
mahane yehuda has been a bomb target before most recently in 
may when an explosion killed an elderly man and wounded nine other 
people 
on sunday night a 19yearold palestinian was killed in an 
explosion near israeli military government headquarters in the west 
bank city of nablus the army said it said the bomb exploded as he 
was priming it 
the occupied gaza strip scene of serious clashes saturday in 
which four arabs were shot dead was almost entirely under curfew 
today to head off fatah anniversary celebrations 
it was the 22nd time the gaza strip has been under blanket 
curfew since march 1988 near the start of the threeyearold 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule 
a 23yearold man was found dead today in a valley outside his 
west bank village of shuyukh near hebron arab reports said they 
said mohammed yunis hussein was murdered for allegedly 
collaborating with israel 
his death raised the number of alleged collaborators killed 
during the uprising to 323 
another 786 palestinians have been killed by israelis soldiers 
and civilians and 57 israelis have died

vice president dan quayle today told 
marines preparing for war near the kuwaiti border that you have 
been patient enough and so has president bush in waiting for a 
peaceful solution to the persian gulf crisis 
the fact is that a policy of indefinite patience only could 
lead to a policy of appeasement which would make iraqs 
president saddam hussein the victor in the gulf standoff quayle 
told the gathering of marines 
quayle on a new years morale buildingmission visited the 
third marine aircraft wing the closest fixedwing aircraft group 
to the border of occupied kuwait 
his tour by helicopter and military truck through the deep 
desert sands also took him to the army third armored cavalry 
regiment out of fort bliss texas which is closer to the border 
than any other troops president bush has sent to the gulf quayle 
visited a base 40 miles from kuwait 
on sunday he met saudi arabias king fahd who gave assurances 
that his country would provide more cash and services to support 
the antiiraq coalition senior administration officials said 
quayle in brief remarks to the marines criticized members of 
congress who urge waiting longer for the unimposed sanctions to 
force saddam to withdraw his troops from kuwait 
you have heard some voices at home urging patience they say 
wait a year or two let the sanctions work quayle said but 
the sanctions have not gotten saddam out of kuwait you have been 
patient enough and so has president bush 
saddam hussein may not withdraw unconditionally and if he 
doesnt he will be forced out of kuwait by military action the 
vice president said quayle reiterated bushs promise that any 
force will be speedy and decisive and will not lead to a drawnout 
conflict as in vietnam 
it may turn out that the only language saddam hussein 
understands is the language of force 
quayle mingled with the marines and army troops at the two sites 
where heavy action would be expected if war does occur said army 
lt gen calvin ah waller at the marine base he inspected 
harrier fighter planes that marine maj jim mcclain said are only 
three minutes flying time from the border of occupied kuwait 
quayle received a cordial greeting from the troops most of whom 
told him they were prepared to do their job and were anxious to get 
it over with 
his entourage inspected cluster bombs that had slogans inscribed 
on them such as merry christmas no new year 
im nervous and scared im not afraid to say that any more 
were sitting right on the verge of where there might be 
fighting lance corp richard kamoe of honolulu told a reporter 
quayle mentioned in his speech that his father and brother were 
both in the marine corps and not withstanding my own service in 
the army national guard the marines in the quayle household are 
no1 he said to applause 
the controversy over quayles national guard service seemed to 
make little impression on the young troops serving here quayle was 
accused when bush selected him as his running mate of having used 
family connections to get a position in the indiana national guard 
and avoid being drafted and going to vietnam 
other people have done worse things than him said marine 
cpl kimberly gender of bloomfield ind 
waller who caused a firestorm of controversy by saying on 
december 19 that the troops would not be fully ready for combat by 
the jan 15 un deadline for iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
escorted quayle on his tour of the desert bases 
waller was reticent to discuss his earlier comment that he would 
recommend against launching an attack until midfebruary the 
component commanders have said they are ready he told a 
reporter my job is to support gen norman schwarzkopf 
commander of the us operation here and the commanders of each of 
the services 
asked if he would be making a recommendation on whether to make 
a strike he replied no everyone has all the information 
they need to make that decision 
quayles trip is also aimed at seeking continued financial 
support from saudi arabia and kuwaits deposed rulers he was 
assured sunday by king fahd that with the looming possibility of 
war saudi arabia will offer more cash and services said senior 
administration officials traveling with the vice president 
there seems to be no problem with getting more money from 
fahd said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
quayle was assured by fahd that the king had no reticence 
regarding a military conflict should that be needed to oust the 
iraqis said the us official who briefed reporters on the 
meeting 
quayle and fahd were in virtually complete agreement on what 
needs to be done to force iraq out but did not discuss details 
of what would happen after jan 15 the official said 
in the meantime quayle told reporters he would impress on the 
saudis and the exiled emir of kuwait when he meets him tuesday 
that they will have to be making more contributions to support 
the deployment of some 300000 american troops 
this crisis is going to continue he said 
an official who attended the quaylefahd meeting said the 
impression that was left was that the saudis would continue to be 
forthcoming in financial and other support such as free fuel 
they dont want any perception of any reluctance on that issue 
so far saudi arabia has contributed 9 billion nearly half of 
it in cash and the rest in material support according to the state 
department and kuwait has given 25 billion 
administration officials have estimated the operation will cost 
30 billion in 1991

promoters called off a concert by the punk 
rock band bad religion a day after angry fans trashed a theater and 
damaged neighboring storefronts 
organizers said the concert at the whisky agogo in west 
hollywood was canceled sunday night to avoid a repeat of the melee 
that erupted saturday night after the groups concert at a north 
hollywood theater was shut down 
fans hurled bottles smashed store windows and ripped out seats 
after fire officials ordered the classic theater closed because of 
overcrowding 
two police officers and several people in the crowd suffered 
minor injuries in the fracas four people were arrested for 
investigation of vandalism 
lead singer greg gaffin said the melee was at odds with the 
message that bad religion is attempting to spread 
what we try to do in our songs is make people responsible for 
their own actions gaffin said during the disturbance 
the owners of the classic theater were cited sunday on charge of 
overcrowding and improper use of the facility which fire officials 
said was not licensed for live entertainment 
police estimated damage to the theater and surrounding 
businesses at 20000 
fire officials said the theater was ordered closed after an 
inspector counted as many as 1900 people in the building the 
theater is permitted to seat 1261 said fire spokesman tony ennis

iraqs health minister claimed monday 
that more than 4200 people have died because of shortages in 
medical supplies brought on by a un embargo western officials 
have repeatedly challenged similar iraqi claims 
western officials say iraq has received 120 tons of medicine 
from humanitarian groups since midoctober and have dismissed 
baghdads claims on infant deaths since the embargo 
the minister abdulsalam mohammed said accused president bush 
of criminal action depriving the iraqi people of their needs 
in a statement carried by the official iraqi news agency said 
claimed that since iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 said 2042 
children under age 5 have died of malnutrition or diseases that 
spread because vaccines could not be obtained 
the statement monitored in cyprus said 2182 iraqis over 5 
have died because of shortages in medicines for various cardiac 
problems cancers diabetes and high blood pressure 
shipments of food and medicines for humanitarian purposes are 
not banned by the un embargo begun after the iraqi invasion 
but baghdad claims many governments have refused to allow export 
of goods even medicines ordered and paid for before the sanctions 
western diplomats suggest that the government might be 
stockpiling medicine in case of war and that some of the reported 
shortages resulted from profiteering 
the claims of shortages have increased markedly since the un 
security council passed a resolution on nov 29 authorizing 
military action against iraq if it does not withdraw from kuwait by 
midjanuary

head in his deerfield beach apartment by two men who came to steal 
cocaine police said he was buried the day before his 28th

time to pursue the case after the official investigation bogged 
down 
his surveillance and interviews took him as far away as canada

stephen rosati and phillip roussonicolos 
during a recent interview at his pompano beach home viscido

and frustrated after the slaying he resumed smoking after 
quitting 10 years ago 
i felt i had three choices i was either going to get killed 
die of a broken heart or get enough evidenc to bring them to 
justice viscido said 
the younger viscido worked in the body shop of his fathers 
usedcar lot and dabbled in construction but his life took a 
dangerous turn when he began using drugs and selling them to his 
friends his father recalled 
viscido began his probe by talking to his sons friends several 
weeks after the murder police gave him composite sketches of the 
gunmen 
viscido wont divulge many details of his tactics because the 
case awaits trial 
however he said police put a hidden microphone on him several 
times when he met with potential suspects or witnesses other times 
he took notes which filled four notebooks as i went along i got 
more professional he said 
when the case first came before a broward grand jury in early 
1989 no indictment was returned but a second proceeding resulted 
in murder and robbery indictments against rosati 30 dallas 27 
and roussonicolos 29 
dallas and roussonicolos are in the broward county jail without 
bond while rosati is fighting extradition from rhode island 
roussonicolos set up the robbery and dallas and rosati were the 
gunmen police alleged 
police and prosecutors give viscido credit for cracking the 
case he had perseverance beyond belief said sgt bill murray 
of the broward sheriffs office 
however fort lauderdale attorney john howes who is defending 
roussonicolos said prosecutors have a case only because the 
boys father goes out and tape records conversations which he 
probably doesnt have a right to do 
viscido and attorneys refused to say what the tapes contained 
viscido who spent about 50000 on the investigation is 
writing a book about it he encourages victims families to help 
police even when things seem bleak 
for a while there i didnt think i could make it viscido 
said i now have peace of mind knowing that theyre going to 
pay

israel today announced it has fired the 
american academic who led an effort to translate the dead sea 
scrolls the oldest known copies of the old testment the decision 
came after the professor made antijewish remarks 
the announcement cited health reasons for removal of harvard 
university professor john strugnell from the project but the 
60yearold scholar has been sharply criticized for an interview 
containing antijewish remarks published in november in the hebrew 
daily haaretz 
the project also had come under increasing fire for the slowness 
with which the scholars work is being published 
strugnell has worked on the scrolls for more than three decades 
and has been editor of the scrolls project since 1987 earlier in 
december other scholars working on the project voted to have him 
replaced 
the scrolls some of which date to 100 bc were found starting 
in 1947 in caves near the dead sea they contain the oldest known 
copies of the old testament other biblical writings ancient 
literature and poetry

israel antiquities authority said strugnell was being relieved at 
the suggestion of the agencys threeman scrolls advisory 
committee

in the united states 
drori said the remaining manuscripts would be edited by emanuel 
tov an israeli named to work with strugnell in october tov a 
professor at hebrew university is on a sabbatical in the 
netherlands and could not be reached for comment 
magen broshi who is one of the members of the advisory 
committee estimated that about 80 percent of the scrolls have been 
published and that what remains is complicated because it requires 
piecing together thousands of fragments 
still he said strugnell before his removal had agreed to a 
timetable that should see the remaining documents published by 
1997 
broshi is curator of the israel museums shrine of the book 
where eight scrolls are displayed the remainder are in the

had made a radio appeal for government forces to retreat to their 
barracks 
in washington a senior state department official described the 
situation in the capital as very fluid 
i dont think anybody controls anything nobody really knows 
who controls what the us official said on condition of 
anonymity 
he added the governments control of the country has been very 
tenuous for some time most official americans have long since left 
the country as a precautionary measure leaving the us embassy 
operating with a very small staff the official said fighting 
appeared to have subsided by the evening 
earlier today a group representing more than 100 leading somali 
dissidents and former politicians called for a ceasefire and the 
formation of an interim government according to the bbc 
the dissidents calling themselves the manifesto group called 
for the army to be confined to barracks and for the rebels to lay 
down their arms the bbc reported 
somalias president mohamed siad barre who is normally under 
heavy guard by an elite unit of fanatically loyal soldiers was 
holed up in a bunker at the international airport according to the 
mogadishubased diplomat and other sources 
the rebels claimed to have taken control of large areas around 
the airport according to ansa

battles that broke out sunday after armed attackers broke into a 
warehouse and killed a senior army officer t least 20 people were

capital regular telephone and telex lines were not working 
gunbattles have been reported in mogadishu almost every day for 
the past two weeks and most aid organizations and western 
embassies have withdrawn all but essential staff because of the 
accelerating breakdown in order 
the united somali congress a recently formed group which 
springs from the large central hawiye clan were reportedly 
fighting within 30 miles of the capital however rebel supporters 
and representatives could be found in mogadishu according to 
recent visitors 
in addition to the united somali congress siad barre is 
challenged in the north by the more established somali national 
movement which draws its strenth from the isaaq clan it has been 
fighting since 1982 for the removal of siad barre a member of the 
marehan clan who seized power in a bloodless 1969 coup 
the rebel groups are loosely coordinated they have twice 
rejected government calls for negotiations in the past month 
saying they prefer to remove siad barre at gunpoint 
the united states has been siad barres strongest ally since the 
late 1970s 
in recent years major human rights organizations have 
increasingly accused siad barres government of a long list of 
abuses including massacres torture imprisonment of political 
prisoners without charge or trial and corruption 
somalia which had been colonized in the north by the british 
and in the south by italy became independent and united in 1960

the new year will bring tough economic times 
according to many forecasters who say 1991 will begin with america 
in a mild recession that could cost an additional 1 million jobs 
inflation will moderate somewhat in 1991 according to these 
estimates and interest rates for mortgages car loans and other 
purchases should drift downward in the coming months 
these economic forecasters express optimism that the recession 
could end sometime in midyear in part because of expanded export 
sales and improvements in the housing industry but theres a 
catch a war in the persian gulf that damages oil production 
facilities could lead to a deeper more severe downturn 
anything that gets the crisis over with in a hurry whether it 
is a quick war or a quick peace helps the economy said david 
wyss chief financial economist at drimcgraw hill inc 
but if the crisis drags out and it keeps oil prices high and 
consumer confidence low then that will make the recession worse 
other dangers could scuttle hopes that the recession will be a 
brief one ranging from the huge consumer business and government 
debt left over from the 1980s to signs of serious weakness in the 
nations banking system 
and the most recent indicators are discouraging the government 
announced on friday that its chief economic forecasting gauge the 
index of leading indicators fell 12 percent in november for the 
fifth monthly drop in a row 
the basic message is theres no light down there in the tunnel 
that we can see said economist robert g dederick of northern 
trust co in chicago the recession is clearly in place and 
clearly has further to go 
not everyone is as pessimistic 
there is a list of risks to the forecast as far as the eye can 
see said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co but 
the most optimistic prospect is that by midyear some sort of 
recovery will be emerging 
by this time next year i believe we will all feel a little 
better about our economic opportunities and the pessimism that 
seems pervasive now will be a distant memory said mark zandi an 
economist with regional financial associates of west chester pa 
for the record the arbiter of recessions the national bureau 
of economic research has not officially declared that the country 
is in a downturn but the group of distinguished academics has come 
awfully close 
in a statement released last week they said it was likely that 
the bureau would end up pinpointing a month between june and 
september as the start of the countrys ninth recession since the 
end of world war ii however the panel said that it did not have 
enough information yet to make such a call and would meet again 
after jan 25 
that is the date the commerce department releases its first look 
at overall economic activity in the quarter from october through 
december 
many economists believe the report will show the gross national 
product declined sharply during this period 
the general definition of a recession is two consecutive 
quarters of declining gnp 
while the bush administration has yet to use the word recession 
it too is inching closer treasury secretary nicholas brady has 
talked of a serious slowdown in the fourth quarter and said there 
was a possibility that the weakness would continue into the first 
three months of 1991 
following is a look at how analysts believe a variety of 
economic barometers will perform in 1991 
gnp estimates on the amount that the total output of goods and 
services will shrink during the recession range from less than 06 
percent to above 2 percent the average drop in output in the eight 
previous postworld war ii recessions is 26 percent given the 
fact that analysts believe there will be a rebound in the second 
half of 1991 they are forecasting a modest gnp increase of around 
04 percent for the year as a whole 
unemployment the jobless rate which had fallen as low as 52 
percent earlier in 1990 rose to 59 percent in november as the 
economic slowdown showed up in layoffs and production cutbacks 
analysts predicted that the unemployment rate would rise to around 
7 percent before beginning to improve each percentage point 
increase in the jobless rate translates into about 1 million more 
people out of work 
inflation the one bright spot for 1991 is the widespread 
belief that consumer prices which shot up at an annual rate of 64 
percent in the first 11 months of 1990 will moderate many 
forecasters are predicting the consumer price index will rise less 
than 4 percent in 1991 although they caution that this prediction 
is based on an assumption that the persian gulf crisis will be 
resolved without pushing oil prices higher for a sustained period 
interest rates the federal reserve which has already pushed 
shortterm interest rates down by a full percentage point in the 
past two months will keep lowering rates to rekindle economic 
growth sinai said he was looking for banks prime rate the 
benchmark rate for many business and consumer loans to be around 
85 percent by next summer the prime rate at many banks is 
currently 10 percent analysts were also forecasting that mortgage 
rates currently at 96 percent for fixedrate loans will drop as 
low as 9 percent next year

the scots dined on haggis the 
french had foie gras and the americans enjoyed steak and a radio 
special by comedian robin williams but new years celebrations for 
the gulf troops were generally lowkey 
the important date for the troops is jan 15 the un deadline 
for iraq to get out of kuwait or face a possible military strike to 
drive it from the emirate 
although soldiers yearned for a cup of kindness new years was 
nonalcoholic because of saudi arabias strict muslim ban on 
liquor 
theres no booze what are you going to do have another 
coke said marine col ml haiman 49 of the bronx new york 
people have their eye on the 15th of january 
the troops in the multinational force have been on heightened 
alert throughout the holidays in case iraqi president saddam 
hussein launches a preemptive strike 
its a prime time for the other side to come after us on our 
holidays when they think our guard might slip if they think that 
theyre wrong said haiman 
the only official celebrations were by the approximately 3000 
men of the scottish regiments in the british 1st armored division 
made up of the 4th armored brigade and the 7th armored brigade the 
famed desert rats 
all the scots will want to celebrate hogmanay said division 
spokesman capt james myles using the scottish term for the 
holiday 
the scots ate a traditional meal of haggis and mashed turnips 
ushered into the camps by bagpipes haggis is made of the heart 
liver and lungs of a sheep or calf and minced with onions oatmeal 
and boiled in the stomach of an animal 
the 6000 french troops toasted with saudi champagne a 
mixture of apple juice and perrier 
our own costs a lot more but for that well have to wait for 
our return said adjutant robert simon spokesman for the french 
forces 
special food like chocolate and foie gras duck liver pate 
had been flown in from france he said 
many us troops said they had not even thought about the 
holiday due to their fierce training schedules but there were some 
small celebrations 
many units barbecued steaks left over from christmas 
im going to get myself a sixpack of nearbeer and have a 
nearparty and sit around and play some cards said staff sgt 
david hebert 30 of brickton nj in the 3rd platoon of the 
armys 595th medical company 
many troops planned to tune in to a robin williams special 
prerecorded for the armed forces radio network 
williams reenacting his radio role of adrian kronauer in the 
film good morning vietnam yelled good maaawwwrning 
saaauuudi and then told jokes like is it just me or does 
yasser arafat look like ringo starr 
while saudis educated in the west tend to celebrate new years 
with private parties at home as do foreigners living here its 
not an official moslem holiday 
the muslims follow a lunar calendar and their new year marks the 
date when the prophet mohammed founder of the faith emigrated in 
the 7th century from mecca to medina both now holy shrines in 
saudi arabia their new year falls on july 12 1991 on the

command said its planes returned safely after hitting a launching 
pad for attacks on israel 
fatah the largest and oldest of nine groups under the plo 
marks the 26th anniversary of its founding on tuesday new years 
day 
the base was in a lemon grove 7 miles southeast of sidon a 
police spokesman said 
there were no survivors those who were dug out from the 
rubble alive died in ambulances before reaching hospital the 
spokesman said he could not be identified in line with standing 
rules 
a plo statement issued in sidon said the bodies of all 12 fatah 
fighters were recovered before bulldozers were brought in to clear 
the rubble

to the foothills of mount hermon 
western military sources say that about 6000 plo guerrillas are

king tut a grandold cockatoo that greeted 
millions of visitors to the san diego zoo during the birds 64 
years as official greeter has died 
king tut was at least 67 years old spokesman jeff jouett said 
the salmoncrested bird had fallen from its perch and was found 
sunday after zookeepers heard odd squawking noises from the bird 
yard jouett said 
veterinarians tried to revive the male bird with oxygen and 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
it was donated to the zoo in 1925 and was named king tut because 
its arrival came shortly after the discovery of king tutankhamens 
tomb in egypt 
the bird delighted more than 100 million zoo visitors from his 
perch next to the flamingo lagoon with antics that included 
whistling and imitations of crying babies meowing cats clucking 
chickens and other species of birds 
it also appeared in motion pictures and television shows 
including an early episode of the mickey mouse club 
bothered by arthritis and cataracts in both eyes king tut was 
retired from the greeters perch just inside the entrance in june 
1989 it was then moved to the education department and appeared at 
special events school programs and zoo tours 
the life expectancy of cockatoos generally is three to four 
decades said jouett some have lived into their 60s and jouett 
knows of one that was in its 80s before dying

they are homeless but three couples and a man 
they took in have made a home out of a ramshackle camp on an unused 
railroad track 
every day reggie and isabelle evon jeannette and donald 
benson jimmy and terri kelly and eugene sullivan laugh talk eat 
and argue together and in a world that seems not to care for them 
they care for each other like a family 
were homeless but were not homeless said evon the 
groups informal leader once in awhile we have arguments but 
everybody has a good time here 
they have held jobs and lived normal lives in the past but 
somewhere along the line a job was lost or the rent was raised and 
they found themselves on the streets 
but while they want to return to their old lives theyll choose 
an independent life in the camp over a homeless shelter any day 
ive had it with shelters said ms benson 44 you have 
no privacy there they go through your personal belongings or they 
throw your stuff out here i dont have to go to bed at 9 oclock 
like a little kid 
the camp sits in a ravine at the end of an unused conrail track 
planted squarely on the track is the evons house a large plywood 
shack that evon built with scrap supplies sullivan and the other 
couples live in more modest tents and there are 14 stray dogs and 
cats 
the group is bound by ties of family and marriage and by the 
solidarity born of life on the streets 
isabelle evon 32 and terri kelly 31 are sisters who grew up 
in boston both had several husbands before meeting reggie and 
jimmy 
reggie evon 37 was a truck driver before coming to boston from 
colorado four years ago jimmy kelly 35 came from oklahoma city 
to be a house painter but there was never enough work 
along the way they met jeannette and donald benson 46 from 
malden who have worked odd jobs and been in and out of shelters 
together for years 
sullivan joined the group when evon found him sleeping under a 
bridge on a rainy day 
he was shivering real bad and i said come on over evon 
said 
sullivan in his 50s came to boston from tennessee 15 years 
ago he married had several children and was divorced he has been 
on the streets since 1987 
some go out canning collecting recyclable aluminum cans 
for the deposit money evon does odd jobs at a nearby produce 
market for food and kelly sometimes finds work in day labor pools 
meals can be found at soup kitchens and shelters 
i get up grab a bite to eat and go canning then i come back 
and argue with everybody kelly said laughing 
its tough in the winter you wake up in the morning and the 
water is ice he added but i can get showers at friends 
houses and the labor pools keep me in beer and cigarette money 
the source of their troubles is not just economic kelly said he 
has had runins with the law a psychiatrist told ms benson she is 
chronically depressed benson drinks cheap wine before noon 
joking and laughter fill the camp but the veneer of cheeriness 
is punctured when a reminder of the past comes flooding in 
for ms evon that happens once a week when she and her husband 
have a 90minute visit in a state agency with their two daughters 
ages 1 and 2 the girls were placed in foster care when officials 
decided the shack wasnt a home she lost three other children to 
the state in the same way 
i was being discharged from the hospital and they said i 
couldnt take my baby home ms evon recalled i started crying 
and trying to punch everyone in sight 
without a child to mother she snuggles one of the skinny 
kittens under her coat 
sullivan thinks about his old life whenever his daughter visits 
him at the camp 
i dont like this life i didnt want to stay here he said 
you cant go back though you cant walk in looking like a 
bum

federal authorities investigating alleged 
price fixing in the baby formula business have subpoenaed company 
records and the files of an infant health group that opposes 
formula advertising on grounds it would discourage breast feeding 
company officials said monday the subpoenas were issued by the 
federal trade commissions bureau of competition 
antoinette parisi eaton president of the american academy of 
pediatrics said the records subpoenaed from the academy dealt 
mainly with its position in opposition to infant formula 
advertising 
breast feeding rates in this country are already going down 
ms eaton said we have concerns that massive advertising 
campaigns promoting infant formula are going to further reduce the 
number of women who will consider breast feeding 
debbie feinstein assistant to the director of the bureau of 
competition said she understands there has been limited 
advertising of baby formula but certainly it is not the kind of 
thing that you see on tv 
to the extent that there is any kind of agreement not to 
advertise that would be something that would be a cause for 
antitrust concern ms feinstein said 
we are not taking a position on whether or not advertising is 
good or bad or infant formula is good or bad but the things we 
have heard are that infant formula is a very concentrated industry 
and one of the reasons it might be hard for people to enter is 
because there is not any advertising she said 
ms feinstein said the investigation was launched in late may 
after the bureau received price fixing allegations from state 
welfare officials and consumer advocates 
infant formula is a major ingredient of food packages given to 
lowincome families who qualify for the special supplemental food 
program for women infants and children the federally funded 
program known as wic serves about 44 million people a month and 
accounts for onethird of the infant formula sold in the united 
states 
kevin j arquit director of the bureau testified before a 
senate judiciary subcommittee in may that the agency had received 
complaints from state directors of the program about alleged 
anticompetitive practices in the industry 
company officials testifying before the subcommittee said their 
prices are fair 
audrey ashby a spokesman for wyeth ayerst laboratories one of 
the principal manufacturers of formula said the company received 
the ftc subpoena in september and has begun turning over the 
requested documents 
we set prices independently and compete vigorously and 
independently in all aspects of the infant formula business ms 
ashby said wyethayerst is a division of the american home 
products corp 
according to a story in the new york times on monday records 
were also subpoenaed from ross laboratories a division of abbott 
laboratories the meadjohnson nutritional group a division of 
bristolmyers squibb co the carnation co a subsidiary of nestle 
sa and the gerber products co 
officials of some of the companies could not be reached because 
of the new years holiday and ms feinstein said the ftc could not 
confirm that subpoenas had been issued 
mead johnston ross laboratories and wyeth laboratories make 
about 90 percent of the infant formula sold in the united states 
according to testimony before the senate subcommittee the domestic 
market has been estimated at about 13 billion a year 
this is a highpriority investigation ms feinstein said 
she said it was not possible to say how long it could take 
before the commission decided whether any price fixing had 
occurred 
dennis bach who heads the wic program in iowa and the national 
association of wic directors said over the last 10 years there 
has been a fairly consistent pattern of the major companies 
increasing their prices on the average of once a year often within 
a day or two of each other and often by virtually the same 
percentage 
bach said the wholesale price of formula had increased by about 
150 percent during this period and now stands at around 190 for a 
13ounce can of concentrate he said retail prices vary from 5 
cents to 50 cents above that

surprised greek officials struggled to 
put up hundreds of newly arrived albanian refugees in makeshift 
shelters today and albanian jews were arriving in israel under 
relaxed travel restrictions 
hundreds more albanians trekked across frozen mountains and 
rivers today in the biggest exodus from their country since its 
communist government promised reforms last summer 
military sources in the northwestern greek border town of 
filiates said today that 632 albanians most of them ethnic greeks 
had crossed the frontier since daybreak 
on sunday at least 500 albanians arrived in northern greece 
seeking political asylum in addition 37 jews flew to rome from 
the albanian capital of tirana en route to israel 
so far this month more than 1600 people from the tiny balkan 
nation of 33 million have fled into greece across the once tightly 
sealed 100mile frontier 
israeli media reported today that four albanian jewish families 
had arrived in israel and dozens more were expected in coming 
weeks israel radio said the albanian immigration was made possible 
by a recent agreement by italy with albania the last of the 
hardline communist regimes in eastern europe 
but israeli government officials were tightlipped about the 
immigration of albanian jews apparently fearful of harming the 
effort 
this is going to save albanian jews from total extinction had 
they remained there they would have been wiped out in a 
generation said rabbi marc tanenbaum a consultant to the 
american jewish committee in new york 
the albanian jewish community numbers only about 1000 
officials said 
the arrival of the albanian jews comes as israel struggles to 
cope with a huge wave of arriving soviet jews 
greek officials too were overwhelmed by the sudden influx 
it looks like there are whole villages crossing its a 
madhouse up here said a police spokesman in the greek border 
village of filiates on sunday 
our police station has become a refugee center he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity we dont know what to do with 
all these people 
he said it appeared the albanian government had opened its 
frontier with greece there can be no other explanation he 
said a mosquito couldnt get across the border before 
police have reported that albanian border guards killed at least 
five people trying to cross the frontier in recent weeks 
last week the greek government charged that albanians were 
murdering many ethnic greeks who tried to flee 
greece claims that more than 350000 ethnic greeks live in 
southern albania the albanian government says the figure is 
60000 
the albanian jews who left sunday were the first in a planned 
operation dubbed flying carpet to take an estimated 500 jews 
out of albania said shula bahat a spokeswoman for the american 
jewish committee in new york 
vladimir prela head of the albanian foreign ministrys press 
office said in a telephone interview from tirana on sunday that a 
new government policy allows anyone to leave albania if they wish 
in israel army radio quoted a tel aviv man who said the entire 
jewish community of albania was packed and ready to leave for 
israel he said some of his 60 albanian relatives had arrived in 
israel over the past two months 
it said immigrants from albania had arrived in recent days at an 
absorption center in the southern city of beersheva 
tirana newspapers on sunday published a new draft constitution 
that guarantees freedom of movement as well as freedom of religion 
and private ownership according to albanian state radio 
the radio said the draft establishes multiparty elections under 
the new constitution the president will be selected by parliament 
to serve a fiveyear term and can only be reelected once 
elections are scheduled for feb 10 
pressures for reform in economically backward albania began 
building on president ramiz alia in july when about 5000 albanians 
sought asylum in embassies in tirana and were allowed to flee to 
italy 
an exodus of thousands of east germans to the west last year 
also helped bring down former east germanys communist government 
pressured during street protets earlier this month alia allowed 
the formation of an opposition party he has also tried to steer 
the nation out of decades of selfimposed isolation and relaxed a 
ban on religious practice 
the communist government also recently ordered the dismantling 
of statues and other images of josef stalin and the renaming of 
some institutions bearing the soviet dictators name

vice president dan quayle told 
us troops monday he shares their frustration with saddam 
husseins refusal to budge from kuwait saying the time for 
patience is about up 
touring saudi desert outposts nearly five months after iraqs 
president sent invasion forces into neighboring kuwait quayle 
sounded pessimistic about prospects for a peaceful settlement 
you have heard some voices at home urging patience they say 
wait a year or two let the sanctions work he said referring to 
the united nationsimposed economic sanctions against the baghdad 
regime 
but the sanctions have not gotten saddam out of kuwait you 
have been patient enough and so has president bush quayle told 
marines and army forces in remarks at two desert bases not far from 
the kuwaiti border 
if war comes and the us troops drive saddams forces from 
kuwait he said the whole world will be grateful 
you are our heroes quayle declared 
on the second day of a threeday trip to saudi arabia the vice 
president flew by military helicopter and plowed through desert 
sands in military convoy vehicles to visit bases bustling with 
massive war preparations 
the tent bases he visited one with harrier jet aircraft that 
can reach the border in three minutes are expected to be involved 
heavily in hostilities if war breaks out military officials said 
at the third armored calvary regiment base some 40 miles from 
the border quayle inspected the new m1a1 heavy armored tanks 
recently brought in to upgrade the older models he played 
basketball and volleyball with the troops ate with them talked by 
telephone to their families at a special desert satellite phone 
center and inspected their readiness equipment 
the personnel quayle met seemed mostly resigned to the prospect 
of war and eager to get it over with 
we were scared when we first got here right now were just 
bored kenneth merrill an enlisted army man 
the troops received quayle cordially some said they liked the 
fact that he came to see them others were indifferent 
if he could get me out of here that would be real nice 
said marine lance cpl richard kamoe of honolulu whose job is 
firing stinger missiles 
sgt michael collins of buffalo ny alluded to the 
controversy during the 1988 presidential campaign surrounding 
allegations that quayle had used family connections to get enlisted 
in the indiana national guard rather than being drafted during the 
vietnam war 
honest we laughed a lot about it collins said 
but many of the troops said they didnt give quayles military 
background much thought 
he is the vice president said capt norbert jocz of 
blacksburg va 
quayle was accompanied by lt gen calvin waller who stirred a 
controversy for the bush administration when he said dec 19 that 
the us forces would not be ready for military action by jan 15 
the deadline in a un resolution demanding iraqs withdrawal from 
kuwait 
waller on monday seemed reticent to talk to reporters saying 
his job was to support gen norman schwarzkopf commander of 
operation desert shield schwarzkopf had recently countered 
wallers comments saying they are ready for combat 
waller who earlier had said he would recommend to bush that the 
us forces not strike until midfebruary said monday he would not 
be making a recommendation at all because everybody has all the 
information they need to make the decision 
the armed forces are prepared for whatever decision the 
president might make quayle told reporters traveling with him 
here 
speaking to a few hundred pilots and other personnel of the 3rd 
marine aircraft wing the most forward deployed fixed aircraft wing 
of the us forces quayle said the fact is that a policy of 
indefinite patience only could lead to a policy of appeasement 
that would leave saddam hussein victorious 
saddam hussein may not withdraw unconditionally and if he 
doesnt then he will be forced out of kuwait by military action 
quayle told the marines 
the vice president sought to reassure them that bush would not 
send them into a long vietnamlike conflict 
if force is necessary it will be quick massive and decisive 
you will do your job and then go home to your loved ones he said 
to applause 
but collins remained unconvinced

when the iraqi ambassador returns to his 
posting next week he will find himself back on the hot seat 
performing one of the most difficult public relations jobs in the 
world 
mohamed almashat is assigned to deliver a message americans 
find repugnant defending iraqi president saddam husseins aug 2 
invasion of kuwait he has performed his task with dedication 
arguing his case forcefully and stridently on myriad television 
news shows 
since coming to washington mashat has also built bridges with 
members of congress 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan telephoned mashat in 
baghdad last week hoping to get the ball rolling on the diplomatic 
front in an effort to avert war in the persian gulf 
mashat told dole saddam might be willing to compromise on a date 
for diplomatic talks thus raising optimism about a break in the 
impasse over direct usiraqi discussions 
since aug 2 mashat has embraced his public relations role with 
relish with his pitchblack hair and roguish cigarette holder 
hes a figure whos hard to miss 
i never turn down an invitation mashat said recently at a 
panel discussion sponsored by the alumnae of skidmore college it 
was one of three engagements to which he had committed that 
evening 
whatever he was expecting mashat did not find a sympathetic 
audience some people shouted at him as he relentlessly propounded 
iraqs position the former foreign hostages were guests the 
kuwaitiraq dispute must be solved by the arabs the united nations 
sanctions are hurting iraqs children the kuwait crisis must be 
solved in conjunction with the arabisraeli crisis 
iraq will never fire the first shot mashat said but if 
attacked iraq will fight to the bitter end the gulf crisis is an 
arab problem and solutions should come from the arabs he said 
the volatile mashat became so upset when the moderator cut him 
off that he threatened to walk out 
a top news executive also complained that mashat was completely 
inflexible and ideological when the newspaper invited the 
ambassador to a roundtable luncheon he wouldnt stop talking 
said the executive who asked to remain anonymous 
mashat says he is trying simply to explain his countrys 
position he blames the news media for distorting what is happening 
inside kuwait and for fomenting trouble by siding with israel 
even the most skilled diplomat would have a tough time 
handling the task given mashat said marshall wiley a former us 
ambassador to iraq who knows him 
mashats public relations show operates without much backup 
since his embassy staff was reduced from 55 to 16 in september in 
titfortat expulsions with the united states 
from time to time mashat is summoned to the state department to 
be dressed down by american diplomats 
although mashat 59 presents iraqs point of view in a 
belligerent tone in public he is a big fan of america and 
americans he studied at the university of maryland and the 
university of california 
mashats first wife was american he lives in the nations 
capital with his second wife and their three children 
the american people and the iraqi people have not problems 
personally mashat says before the invasion he traveled around 
the united states frequently he is particularly fond of 
california 
before he came to the united states mashat had served as his 
countrys ambassador to london paris and vienna

the chairman of new hampshires human 
rights commission said monday he found no evidence of 
discrimination against blacks women homosexuals or jews in an 
offcampus dartmouth college newspaper 
barry palmer said he reached his conclusion after reading two 
years of the dartmouth review 
palmer said he conducted the study as an individual not on 
behalf of the commission after continued criticism of the paper by 
dartmouth president james freedman freedman has said the paper 
published by conservative students consistently attacks those 
groups 
the review published since 1980 has been vilified for years 
for its views on women homosexuals blacks and indians 
palmer said the fivemember commission acts as a body on policy 
only that investigations and reviews are conducted by one of the 
three commission investigators or the commissioners individually 
criticizing blacks women homosexuals or jews is not prejudice 
as long as the criticism is aimed at performance and not sexual or 
racial status palmer said 
kevin pritchett editor of the weekly newspaper said that 
from the very start the review has criticized people not 
because of their race or sex but because of the way they 
performed 
freedman was away and not available to respond to palmers 
findings but college spokesman roland adams disagreed with 
palmers assessment 
just this particular summer the dartmouth review equated the 
lives of 1400 moslems with 7000 penguins he said it said 
the deaths of each were equally tragic they apologized for that 
but then the review seems to be apologizing all the time 
palmer who also is a copy editor for the union leader newspaper 
of manchester said the commission is very sensitive to anything 
which takes away from a human beings selfworth and is always 
seeking evidence of such bias whether in print or verbal form 
i read every single thing they wrote about teachers i 
reviewed editorials and editorial cartoons and i didnt find any 
hint of bigotry or prejudice palmer said 
after reviewing two years of the publication i began 
wondering what all the fuss was about 
palmer said he undertook the review after freedman raised 
questions of discrimination 
earlier this year on yom kippur judaisms most solemn day a 
quote from adolf hitler was inserted into the reviews masthead 
infuriating people on and off campus 
the quote read therefore i believe today that i am acting in 
the sense of the almighty creator by warding off the jews i am 
fighting for the lords work 
trustees and staffers said the quote was the work of a saboteur 
and apologized 
backlash from the quote led the newspapers president and two 
staffers to quit 
freedman called the quote an egregious expression of 
antisemitism and appalling bigotry 
william cole a black music professor resigned in august after 
the review attacked him for seven years as a mediocre teacher cole 
said his effectiveness was compromised by the attacks 
review staffers also were involved in a 1986 sledgehammer attack 
on shanties that were eected on the campus green as part of a 
protest against segregation in south africa several staffers were 
suspended

the immigration and naturalization service says 
it plans to charge a fee to motorists who use new express lanes 
along the canadian and mexican borders 
a pilot program is scheduled to be established next spring by 
the ins at a few locations along both borders the participating 
border crossings and how much travelers will be charged for using 
the optional express lanes have not been determined yet ins 
spokesman duke austin said 
the lanes would be staffed with extra inspectors to speed border 
crossings 
a fee plan was ordered by congress in the 1991 appropriations 
act which passed in october to offset the recent traffic increase 
at border crossings money generated by the tolls would be used to 
hire more inspectors and expand inspection stations austin said 
we are stressing that use of the fee lanes is voluntary 
austin said saturday there will still be nonfee lanes for those 
who choose not to pay 
but immigrant rights groups are criticizing the fundraising 
method contending the plan may lead to a tax on anyone entering 
the united states similar to whats done with international air 
travel 
thats a heck of a way to balance their budget said mario 
moreno an attorney for the mexican american legal defense and 
educational fund 
the ins plans to submit program guidelines for congressional 
approval in february 
about 13 million vehicles passed through us border inspection 
points in 1989

israels antiquities authority on monday 
dismissed a harvard scholar as chief editor of the dead sea 
scrolls citing health problems the professor recently created an 
uproar by making antijewish statements 
the editor britishborn divinity professor john strugnell was 
replaced by an israeli professor 
strugnell also had been criticized for the slow pace of 
publication of the leather scrolls discovered by a bedouin 
shepherd in 1946 in a cave near the dead sea 
the ancient manuscripts are among the most significant 
archaeological finds of the century because they include the oldest 
known texts of the old testmant and shed light on the origins of 
christianity and the history of judaism 
in his announcement monday amir drori the director of the 
israel antiquities authority said strugnell was being relieved at 
the suggestion of the agencys threeman scrolls advisory 
committee 
strugnell 60 and in ill health remains hospitalized in the 
united states associates said he could not be reached for 
comment 
he created a storm in israel following an interview published on 
nov 9 in the haaretz newspaper strugnell who is roman catholic 
described judaism as a racist religion just like hinduism 
in india 
asked what bothered him about judaism he said the fact that 
it survives it should have disappeared the solution to the 
jewish problem in my view is mass conversion to christianity and 
this is of course christian theology and not my dear option 
strugnell denied he was antijewish saying i dont love or 
hate jews more than i love or hate anybody else there are jews i 
cant stand and there are christians catholics even that i can 
stand even less 
he was severely criticized for the comments the weekly 
jerusalem report magazine headlined its article the jewhater who 
controls the scrolls and several editorials questioned whether a 
man with his opinions should continue as editor 
it was strugnells health problems that prompted an 
international editing team including professors frank cross of 
harvard and eugene ulrich of the university of notre dame to 
recommend earlier in december that strugnell be replaced 
the international team had recommended that he be replaced by 
three general editors but droris announcement named just one 
of the men israeli professor emanuel tov as the editor in chief 
the team also had recommended ulrich and father emile puech a 
french scholar working at the ecole biblique in jerusalem 
tov is the only israeli among the three a hebrew university 
professor he had been named as coeditor by the antiquities 
authority in october he is on sabbatical in the netherlands and 
could not be reached for comment 
a hebrew university scholar said on condition of anonymity that 
the change in editors means we are going to try and move things 
along with more speed 
he praised strugnell as a very fine scholar a very learned 
person but said that his personal problems had begun to 
interfere with the project 
strugnell has done research on the scrolls since 1952 and was 
editor since 1987 
magen broshi one of the members of the advisory committee 
estimated that about 80 percent of the scrolls have been published 
and that what remains is complicated because it requires piecing 
together thousands of fragments and interpreting them 
still he said strugnell had agreed to a timetable that would 
see the remaining documents published by 1997 
an estimated 800 scrolls have been recovered but many are in 
fragments eight scrolls are displayed at the israel museum the 
remainder are in the rockefeller museum

bring her home 
laura was put in a neonatal intensive care unit and given a 
hormone to help her lungs develop the march of dimes said it led 
the development of the units for highrisk infants and its 
researchers have studied the effects of the type of hormone laura 
was given 
laura overcame the odds 
the miracle of laura is not just the fact that she lived the 
miracle is that she has virtually no problems as a result of her 
prematurity mrs krumwiede said

two years of record tourism have shown 
that yellowstone national park didnt lose its luster in its 1988 
forest fires but the crowds also raise the question of how many 
people the park can stand 
weve seen in the last few years much higher visitation in the 
spring months and in the fall said ed lewis executive director 
of the greater yellowstone coalition an environmental group 
in the past when you had very high visitation in the summer 
at least the resources in the park had a chance to recover 
before the next press of visitors 
thats becoming increasingly less of a case i know just from 
talking to people in the middle of the summer you just have 
endless traffic jams in the park worse than before the period of 
high use is getting extended each year 
in 1987 258 million people visited the fires held 1988 
visitation down to about 22 million 
in 1989 people flocked to the park to see the effects of the 
fires pushing visitation to a record 268 million in 1990 28 
million visited the 22 millionacre park according to park 
officials 
lewis maintains that yellowstone is approaching its carrying 
capacity of humans but park superintendent bob barbee disagrees 
people come from a long way away and i guess i feel that 
were somewhat fortunate that were not besieged by tremendous 
numbers and if we were we would have to deal with it barbee 
said 
right now i dont see any big problem 
lewis points to the strain he sees people placing on grizzlies 
that are rising in number in the park 
the bears flock toward yellowstone lake to feed on cutthroat 
trout spawning in the spring and come into conflict with tourists 
staying at the campgrounds and hotels surrounding the lake when 
those conflicts arise the bears are relocated he said 
these are bears that are doing what comes naturally lewis 
said and were seeing them moved more and more and weve 
seen from past experience the more you move a bear the more likely 
that bear becomes a fatality 
barbee agrees there are times during the summer when traffic 
jams occur on the grand loop which circles the parks 
interior but he doesnt see a need now to limit visitation 
a lot of it is a matter of perception but i honestly do not 
think that except on isolated circumstances on certain days of the 
year that we have a crowding problem the superintendent 
said 
lewis wants the national park service to institute additional 
measures to ease the crowds one possibility he said would be to 
alter seasonal openings such as delaying the spring opening of 
lake hotel and its surrounding cabins 
the greater yellowstone coalition also wants the park service to 
look at what kind of toll burgeoning winter tourism industry is 
having on the park 
for years we have been asking the park to do further analysis 
and planning of the winter season said lewis were really 
concerned were very concerned that the analysis has not been done 
to determine the impacts of this increased winter visitation 
park spokeswoman joan anselmo said the parks winter use plan 
to be released in its final form in march will address some of 
those concerns and she notes that the park has closed part of the 
fishing bridge campground removed cabins from west thumb and has 
reduced the number of cabins at old faithful 
the growing number of tourists and their impact are not being 
overlooked barbee said 
were trying to manage the situation and deal with it 
realistically and prudently and sensibly he said

in a videotaped new years greeting to all 
the wonderful people of the soviet union president bush offered 
a word of encouragement monday to a beleaguered mikhail gorbachev 
saluting him for undertaking an arduous journey toward a new 
society 
the president welcoming the soviets as partners in the attempt 
to force iraq to give up its conquest of kuwait also hailed the 
sovietamerican common approach to a new challenge in the name of 
stability and peace 
i applaud the world applauds the decisive action of the 
soviet union in strongly opposing saddam husseins brutal 
aggression in the gulf bush said 
despite their previous close ties to iraq the soviets have 
supported the united states in the un security council but 
declined to send troops to join an allied army in saudi arabia 
on a more personal level bush said he was thrilled about the 
warmth developing between ordinary soviet and american citizens as 
a result of the relaxation of tensions in the aftermath of the cold 
war 
tens of thousands of soviets have had contact with americans 
now and the numbers are growing the president said barbara 
and i are thrilled to see our two peoples meeting and getting to 
know one another as friendly neighbors 
gorbachev in a tv message to the american people said he 
expected his moscow summit with bush in february to give impetus to 
the removal of old obstacles still hampering sovietamerican 
relations 
economic and scientific and technological cooperation still do 
not respond to the spirit of the time he said 
but looking back he summed up 1990 as a momentous year the 
cold war is over there is no more danger of nuclear catastrophe 
the horizons of peace have been widened 
he called saddam husseins aggression an obstacle to peace 
and said the international community should find strength to 
overcome this obstacle 
and addressing his own people in a television message scheduled 
for midnight gorbachev said 1990 was one of the most difficult 
years in our history 
crisis phenomena in economics the lowering of peoples 
personal safety a weakening of order and discipline affected the 
conditions of life he said 
bushs new years message was taped last week for broadcast on 
new years day in the soviet union at the same time some us 
television stations will carry gorbachevs message to the american 
people cable news network said it would air the two messages at 1 
pm est 
the exchange continued a custom established at americas 
suggestion by gorbachev and thenpresident ronald reagan in 1986 
dropped in 1987 and resumed in 1988 
in that first message reagan defended the american peoples 
strong interest in humanitarian issues saying that this 
country was founded on the belief in the sanctity of human life 
and the rights of the individual 
gorbachev in his 1989 message called the exchange a 
meaningful symbol of our mutual willingness to go on moving 
toward each other and stressed the soviet peoples interest in 
peace having suffered for it in world war ii 
in this years remarks bush said the reform path on which 
gorbachev has embarked ultimately would lead to a brighter future 
for the soviet people 
he made no reference to gorbachevs struggle to keep his nation 
from splintering as some of the soviet republics assert 
uncompromising claims to sovereignty nor did bush mention the way 
gorbachevs economic reforms have bogged down or the food shortages 
which impelled western countries to send emergency food supplies 
this year to the soviet union 
on this new years day as you celebrate with your friends and 
family i also want to applaud the soviet union for the important 
steps youve taken in building a new society for the determination 
with which you are pressing forward with difficult political and 
economic reforms bush said 
its an arduous journey but one well worth making for it is 
a path that leads to a brighter future for your nation 
he concluded on behalf of the american people i wish 
president gorbachev and all the wonderful people of the soviet 
union a happy prosperous new year

plo chairman yasser arafat said monday that 
israel is pushing the united states into a war against iraq because 
it wants to destroy iraqs military and economic power 
we are not reading the future but this is what israel wants 
to annihilate iraqs military and technical power arafat said in 
an interview with the associated press 
the palestine liberation organization leader said the only end 
he foresaw to the gulf crisis was through negotiations on all 
middle east problems including the palestinian issue he urged the 
european community to avert war in the region 
the foreign ministers of the 12 european community states are to 
meet in an emergency session friday to discuss the crisis and 
officials say they could decide to open talks with iraq 
iraqi president saddam hussein has insisted on linking a 
settlement of the crisis with the palestinian problem 
the united states has refused such linkage as a condition for 
peace talks 
the plo has supported saddam in the gulf crisis arafats 
backing was based on the premise saddam was the only arab leader 
who could force a solution to the palestinian problem 
 
israeli officials would not comment on arafats statements 
but when asked about his countrys position regarding the united 
states and the gulf foreign ministry spokesman yosef amihud said 
we dont advise we dont suggest and besides the us makes its 
own decisions 
israel has repeatedly said that any solution that left iraq with 
its military might intact would threaten it but it also has said 
that it is not pushing the united states to make any decisions on 
the gulf 
the un security council has set a jan 15 deadline for iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait or face the possibility of a military attack 
by the usled multinational force deployed in saudi arabia and 
the gulf region 
time is running out for us iraq the united states and 
everybody arafat said how can we resolve it peacefully 
without talks and without negotiations 
arafat ruled out the possibility of an iraqi withdrawal from 
kuwait without talks between the united states and iraq on other 
middle east issues 
before talks there can be no solution or compromise he 
said 
saddam has invited us secretary of state james baker iii for 
talks in baghdad on jan 12 but the bush administration has 
rejected the proposal saying the date is too close to the un 
deadline 
arafat arrived in iraq on sunday he has held talks with iraqi 
foreign minister tariq aziz on the situation in the area and the 
israeli occupied territory 
arafat who heads the plos mainstream fatah guerrilla faction 
denied that the gulf crisis has adversely affected the palestinian 
uprising in the occupied territories 
some people believed that the gulf crisis has eclipsed the 
intefadeh uprising and others have said the palestinian issue has 
been shelved he said but look and see how the palestinian 
question has topped all issues on the world agenda 
tuesday marks the 26th anniversary of the first armed attack 
inside israel by fatah 
the palestinians will continue their struggle against the jewish 
state until they achieve their goal for an independent state and 
self determination arafat said 
earlier monday israel killed 12 fatah guerrillas in a raid near 
sidon in southern lebanon 
a plo communique warned that israel planned a massive military 
operation in southern lebanon and had sent reinforcements to its 
selfproclaimed security zone just north of the israellebanon 
border security forces in the region said there had been no such 
buildup

nbc news is launching its new 24hour 
news channel on new years day feeding video of latebreaking 
news sports and features from a new base in charlotte to network 
affiliates for local use 
until now the network had been feeding its affiliates several 
times a day from new york city 
we were better off getting out of new york and creating our 
own identity said bob horner a former cbs news bureau chief 
whos now in charge of what he describes as a video wire 
service 
real estate costs climate and access to a major airport also 
played a role 
charlotte is a thriving city with a good business climate 
he said its also blessed with strong local media 
nbc news channel will feed raw and edited footage including 
foreign domestic and regional material to local stations which 
can then edit the reports for use on their newscasts 
local stations want more variety horner said some 
smaller companies like cnn have been more aggressive in using 
satellite technology to help individual stations 
for now horner and his staff of about 50 producers and editors 
are working out of temporary offices later this year the nbc news 
channel will move into a 10000squarefoot wing of the new studio 
of the local nbc affiliate wcnc 
two weeks ago nbc news signed the nippon television network 
ntv as the news channels first overseas affiliate 
in exchange for exclusive rights to news material from the nbc 
news channel ntv will give nbc news the same rights to all 
japanese and international news material of ntv japans largest 
private broadcast network 
horner said his staffers are experienced professionals who are 
used to working behind the scene 
cbs sportscaster john madden would love this team he 
said a reference to the former nfl coachs affection for 
unheralded football players particularly linemen 
its not particularly glamorous work but its very 
interesting horner said i look for people who want to get the 
news on the air 
he said locating in charlotte was not an effort to get away from 
unions 
although i know people have attributed different motives to 
this that really isnt the problem the work that was being done 
in new york was done by people who werent in the union horner 
said 
but the president of the new york local of the national 
association of broadcast employees and technicians disputed that 
mr horner may be correct in claiming that charlotte is a 
thriving city with a good business climate said john clark 
whose union represents some nbc employees 
but he chooses to ignore the prime reason that nbc moved its 
skycam operation from new york and that was to avoid paying union 
protected wages mandated in the broadcast capital of the world 
new york city

relations are strained between the 
civilian government and the military that ruled for almost 17 
years but the real test is soon to come 
the government is expected to issue reports in the next few 
weeks on financial and human rights investigations of the military 
but gen augusto pinochet who relinquished the presidency in 
march remains army commander and has not adjusted easily to the 
reduction in his power 
on dec 19 pinochet put the army on alert to protest what it 
calls unfair news coverage of a series of corruption accusations 
involving military men 
pinochet later described the action as just an exercice on 
security readiness and coordination 
president patricio aylwin said the alert had no justification 
whatsoever and shows the military lack an understanding of what 
democratic life is all about aylwin summoned pinochet to the 
presidential palace to demand an explanation 
the president later admitted the alert was a sign of military 
unrest 
while government officials and politicians from right to left 
say the situation does not pose a threat to the newly restored 
democracy they also say it must be taken seriously 
it is a serious situation said julio dittborn president of 
the independent democratic union a farright party that supported 
pinochets 16year authoritarian government 
the alert showed pinochets strong support in the army 
according to dittborn 
pinochet 75 turned over the presidency to aylwin an elected 
civilian on march 11 however under a special clause in the 1980 
constitution written by the military government pinochet remains 
commander of the 60000member army and aylwin is prohibited from 
firing him 
sergio bitar a socialist leader in aylwins governing 
coalition also described the situation as serious 
these are hurdles in the democratic transition he said in 
an interview but what is clear is that there are no conditions 
in the country for a coup attempt 
there will be more difficulties but there is no reason for 
fear bitar added he said the government has no problems with 
the navy air force and the national police 
bitar and government officials say they expect the real test in 
governmentmilitary relations to come in the next few weeks when 
reports are to be issued by two special panels investigating the 
military 
the first one is a congressional group investigating the armys 
payment of 3 million to a son of pinochet for the purchase of an 
arms factory in financial trouble that panels report is due by 
midjanuary 
on feb 9 a report will be issued by a special commission 
formed by aylwin to investigate widespread human rights violations 
during the pinochet years 
both investigations are expected to lead to trials involving 
military officers 
a judge investigating an illegal savings and loan organization 
that operated inside the army has already indicted eight officers 
seven of them retired on charges of breaking banking laws 
the news coverage of all three cases has clearly bothered 
pinochet and the military and was widely seen as a a key reason 
for the army alert 
retired col cristian labbe one of pinochets closest aides and 
allies told the santiago daily la tercera that the alert was a 
message and the government has clearly understood it 
government officials and news reports say the army has asked the 
government to request reporters to play down coverage during the 
talks the reports say the army even suggested pinochet might be 
prepared to retire in exchange 
most observers see pinochets strong personality as a key 
element in the dispute 
a government official who witnessed the generals interview with 
aylwin the day after the alert said pinochet interrupted the 
president when he told him general ive summoned you 
invited me mr president you have invited me pinochet 
said according to the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
interviewed by the state television last month aylwin said 
pinochet has trouble adjusting to a subordinate post after ruling 
the country as an absolute master for 17 years 
however aylwin later said he had changed his opinion of 
pinochet as a human being and that he now thinks his 
predecessor respects his authority 
i must say that i respect the courage with which he has faced 
the reduction of his position from president to commander in 
chief aylwin told the government newspaper la nacion

secretary of state james a baker 
iii will likely visit saudi arabia and other gulf nations to 
consult with us allies before a midjanuary deadline for iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait an administration official said monday 
baker also is considering a visit to europe during that time 
said the official who was traveling with vice president dan quayle 
on a threeday visit to saudi arabia 
the purpose of the trip would be to touch bases with the 
gulf leaders prior to the deadline after which the united nations 
has authorized use of force to eject iraqi president saddam 
husseins army said the official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
officials accompanying quayle said it appeared unlikely that 
baker would meet with saddam by jan 3 the end of the time frame 
that president bush set for such a facetoface talk in baghdad 
however the possibility remains that if baker did travel to the 
middle east to see other leaders saddam could invite him to 
baghdad at that time one official speculated 
bakers visit to the region would be in the way of a final 
consultation although all plans for military readiness are already 
in place should bush decide to launch an attack the official said 
saddam has suggested that baker meet with him on jan 12 a date 
the bush admnistration contends is too close to the jan 15 
deadline 
administration officials have said that even if baker does meet 
with saddam the purpose would be only to reiterate in person the 
united states demand for iraqi acceptance of a un resolution 
demanding full withdrawal from kuwait with no compromise 
there are some signs of flexibility on the part of the two sides 
in the disagreement over timing the state department has not ruled 
out a baker trip to baghdad after jan 3 at the same time iraqi 
ambassador mohammed almashat told senate minority leader robert 
dole rkan over the weekend that saddam is not wedded to a 
meeting on jan 12 according to dole 
in washington state department press officer mark dillen said 
baker who has been on vacation in houston plans to return to 
washington tuesday night 
meanwhile almashat reportedly was returning to washington 
monday night from consulations in baghdad 
almashat was one of a number of iraqi diplomats who took part 
in the baghdad discussions but iraq has denied that a peace 
initiative was in the works dillen said almashat is not on the 
schedule of any state department official either tuesday or 
wednesday 
dillen also was asked about the possibility of a meeting between 
european community representatives and saddam 
he recalled that when a similar initiative was proposed earlier 
this month baker said then he supports initiatives aimed at 
achieving a diplomatic solution provided they are consistent with 
implementation of un security council resolutions on iraq

texas speaker gib lewis surrendered monday 
to face two misdemeanor ethics charges after his release on bail 
he said he would still seek a record fifth term as house leader 
lewis surrendered at the travis county jail and was released 20 
minutes later on a personal recognizance bond of 10000 
lewis said the indictments will not deter his plan to seek an 
unprecedented fifth twoyear term as speaker when the 1991 
legislature convenes jan 8 
i have seen nothing that would indicate that i should not i 
dont think anybody else has either lewis said 
he said the charges were unfounded and he denounced a newspaper 
report that in april 1987 he shared a mexican resort suite with a 
female receptionist from the law firm linked to his indictment 
thats just a trashy allegation thats not even good 
journalism thats not even good politics said lewis a democrat 
from fort worth 
the dallas morning news reported sunday that lewis 54 and toni 
barcellona 27 now an austin lobbyist were among the six men and 
six women who spent three days together on the vacation paid for by 
the law firm of heard goggan blair amp williams 
the law firm has denied wrongdoing ms barcellona has not 
returned several telephone messages by the associated press 
lewis was indicted friday by a grand jury on misdemeanor counts 
of receiving a gift from heard goggan and of failing to report the 
benefit on the public financial disclosure statement that must be 
filed by officeholders 
the charges stem from a tax payment made by the law firm for 
business taxes owed by lewis said travis county district attorney 
ronnie earle 
lewis attorneys say earle who has vigorously criticized state 
ethics laws as being too lax is on a vendetta to topple the 
speaker 
lewis said he has been wrongly accused of trying to kill ethics 
reforms 
im the only person that has sat down with ronnie earle and 
asked him for his recommendation on what he thinks should go into a 
plan and all of sudden i get bushwhacked by somebody saying he 
is against ethics lewis said 
if convicted on the two counts lewis faces a maximum of 18 
months in prison and fined 3000 lewis attorneys said the 
speaker will plead innocent 
the grand jury investigation is continuing earle says it has 
expanded to include more legislators and lobbyists

prices farmers get for raw products ended 1990 
with a 07 percent decline from november to december the 
agriculture department said friday 
lower prices were reported for milk hogs and lettuce although 
higher prices for cattle peanuts and eggs helped ease the decline 
of the other commodities 
however the departments agricultural statistics board said 
fruit and vegetable prices were recorded before unseasonably cold 
weather hit california about dec 21 
consequently the report did not reflect the freezing cold that 
hit california citrus and vegetables before christmas 
record high monthly prices were reported for cattle but hog 
prices were down again the report said 
oats and wheat were each at their lowest level for the month 
of december since 1972 it said corn increased slightly from 
november while the soybean price decreased slightly 
most prices are middecember averages which will be revised next

meet expenses those are adjusted quarterly 
department economists forecast 1991 consumer food prices will 
climb an average of 2 percent to 5 percent compared with a 6 
percent gain in 1990 larger output of some major commodities is 
expected to help cool the price climb 
the net cash income of farmers in 1991 has been forecast by usda 
at 55 billion to 60 billion which could put it down from the 
record of 59 billion in calendar 1990 
as used by the agency net cash income is simply the difference 
between gross cash income and cash expenses 
in another way of accounting 1991 net farm income may be in the 
range of 44 billion to 49 billion compared with the 1990 record 
of 49 billion 
the report said 
cattle averaged 7760 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally up from 7530 in november a year earlier cattle 
averaged 71 per hundredweight those are averages for all types of 
cattle sold as beef

president mikhail gorbachev said monday in his new 
years address to the soviet people that 1990 was one of his 
countrys toughest years 
in a speech broadcast nationwide just before midnight gorbachev 
said the passing year was one of the most difficult in our 
history crisis phenomena in economics the lowering of 
peoples personal safety a weakening of order and discipline 
affected the conditions of life 
in a remark that would have been uncharacteristic of his 
predecessors gorbachev admitted the leaders of this country of 285 
million residents had made mistakes but he did not specify what 
they were 
in the coming year the soviets are to vote in a nationwide 
referendum on whether to join a federation of sovereign republics 
the issue is crucial to whether this vast nation of 11 time zones 
is fractured into individual states as lithuania and several other 
independenceminded republics want 
there is no more sacred matter than the preservation and 
renewal of the union in which all people would live voluntarily and 
well the 59yearold kremlin chief said 
the soviet leader in office nearly six years called on the 
people in the 15 republics to achieve civil and interethnic 
accord and to work hard together to overcome difficulties in 
1991 
in a separate new years address to the american people on 
monday gorbachev welcomed februarys superpower summit and 
renewing his call for a peaceful solution to the persian gulf 
crisis 
gorbachev acknowledged that 1990 was a difficult year for the 
soviet people but said shortterm disruptions were necessary for 
longterm stability 
the outgoing year 1990 as well as the 1980s was filled with 
events of great importance he said the cold war is over 
there is no more danger of nuclear catastrophe the horizons of 
peace have widened 
however the soviet president said much has not been 
completed including an end to the crisis caused by iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
the international community has run into a serious obstacle 
the aggression in the gulf he said it should find 
strength to overcome this obstacle not to discontinue the advance 
toward a peaceful period of civilization 
gorbachev said he expected his feb 1113 meeting with president 
bush in moscow would give new impetus to sovietamerican 
relations still hampered by some old obstacles 
economic and scientific and technological cooperation still do 
not respond to the spirit of the time he said 
on domestic matters gorbachev said 1990 was a year of 
principle changes in society a year of the most difficult but the 
most necessary decisions 
they will allow this great country and it remains such to 
overcome the critical situation and to follow the path of stable 
democratic processes he said

from humanitarian groups since midoctober and have dismissed 
baghdads claims on infant deaths since the embargo 
shipments of food and medicines for humanitarian purposes are 
not banned by the un embargo begun after the iraqi invasion 
but baghdad claims many governments have refused to allow export 
of goods even medicine ordered and paid for before the sanctions

a white supremacist arrested here 
monday could be returned to mississippi this week to face a third 
trial for the 1963 slaying of civil rights leader medgar evers 
byron de la beckwith 70 was arrested on a governors warrant 
charging him with firstdegree murder and was jailed without bond 
beckwiths attorney russell bean filed a writ of habeas corpus 
seeking his release and a hearing was set for wednesday before 
hamilton county criminal court judge joe dirisio who will decide 
on extradition 
if dirisio finds the governors warrant is in order he could 
immediately turn beckwith over to mississippi authorities said 
hamilton county chief deputy jim hammond 
the purpose of that hearing is basically just to try to keep 
beckwith from going to mississippi by his attorney saying its 
improper paperwork hammond said 
beckwith was tried twice in 1964 for the slaying of evers field 
secretary for the naacp who was killed by a snipers bullet in 
front of his jackson miss home on june 12 1963 
both trials ended with the allwhite juries unable to reach a 
verdict and the murder charge was dismissed in 1969 the case was 
reopened in 1990 amid charges of jury and evidence tampering in 
those trials 
beckwith an avowed racist has denied killing evers and 
contends the indictment is nonsense poppycock and just something 
to stir the people up and incite the lower forms of life 
beckwith who has lived on nearby signal mountain for nearly 
eight years was arrested on a fugitive warrant dec 17 after a 
hinds county miss grand jury indicted him again 
beckwich who vowed to fight extradition tooth nail and 
claw had been free on 15000 bond since a dec 18 hearing 
before hamilton county general sessions judge h l smith 
smith had ordered beckwith to return to court feb 22 but the 
quick processing of the governors warrant which was signed by 
both mississippi gov ray mabus and tennessee gov ned mcwherter 
eliminates the need for that appearance 
beckwith is now ready to travel unless he can block it through 
some legal maneuver hammond said 
beckwith did not resist when two officers served the warrant 
monday morning at his home hammond said i think he was 
surprised it was this soon but i think hes been expecting to hear 
something he said 
beckwiths wife thelma said her husband had vowed to stand 
taller than any of them if he is extradited 
this is not fair to him she said there is a certain 
political element that is doing this to him its politically 
motivated 
sheriffs deputies were not allowing telephone calls to beckwith

cmdr desi bouterse surinames most 
powerful figure the past decade has been asked to return as its 
military chief by a government selected by coup leaders political 
sources said monday 
the sources said the military asked president johan kraag who 
took office over the weekend replacing ousted president ramsewak 
shankar to reinstate bouterse as commander of the armed forces 
its just a formality bouterse will accept the sources 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
bouterse a former dictator officially resigned as army chief 
hours before the christmas eve coup that overthrew shankar 
bouterse was widely believed to have been behind the coup and his 
reinstatement would seem to confirm that view 
president carlos andres perez of venezuela said monday that his 
country had broken relations with suriname because its government 
brings shame upon the dignity of the americas 
perez in his new years eve address in caracas compared 
suriname with kuwait and called it intolerable that the world 
risked war over a small nation in the gulf yet overlooked the 
unseating of democracy in suriname 
surinames military has promised to hold popular elections 
within 100 days of the coup with kraag a veteran politician as 
the interim president 
the ethnically diverse nation of 400000 people on the northeast 
coast of south america is a former colony of the netherlands that 
won independence in 1975 it has suffered a progressive economic 
crisis since 1980 the year bouterse staged a coup 
the dutch government suspended a 15 billion aid program after 
bouterse killed 15 of his political opponents in 1982 the economy 
has also been hurt by a guerrilla war and plunging world prices for 
bauxite the main export 
in 1987 a threeparty coalition led by shankar defeated 
bouterses candidate in popular elections 
shankar took office the next year but bouterse remained as army 
chief and chairman of the fiveman military authority the 
equivalent of a military high command 
shankar and bouterse have often been at odds and their feud 
culminated last week bouterse accused shankar of colluding with 
dutch authorities who refused to grant him a visa when he landed at 
the amsterdam airport

the air force on monday denied a published 
report that it has abandoned plans to build more b2 stealth 
bombers in 1991 
the wall street journal said air force secretary donald rice had 
decided to freeze b2 production at the current level of 15 planes 
and that the 41 billion approved by congress for the b2 program 
in 1991 would be spent to continue assembling and testing only 
those planes already approved for production 
the air force issued a brief statement in response to the 
journal report 
no final decision on how the air force will apply fiscal year 
1991 b2 funds has been made the statement said adding that 
congress would be notified once the decision is made 
the air force said it remains strongly committed to pursuing 
the full production run of 75 b2 bombers as approved by defense 
secretary dick cheney and that it believes the revolutionary 
advantages of stealth radarevading technology will be borne out 
in 1991 
the b2 continues to enjoy the confidence of the air force and 
remains its highest priority the statement said 
the b2 incorporates much novel technology and has been plagued 
by cost overruns as a result each plane of the production run of 
75 would cost an estimated 850 million 
the air force said it is still trying to figure out the intent 
of congress on the b2 until the last minute the house version of 
the defense budget barred construction of the 16th and 17th b2 
which the pentagon had planned for the current year while the 
senate version authorized those planes 
the compromise version that was signed by president bush was 
silent on the issue some members of the house have said the 
pentagon may not spend money on the additional aircraft while other 
members have said the pentagon could go ahead in the absence of an 
explicit prohibition

a landmark commissions attempt to regulate 
changes inside a jesuit church in the citys historic south end 
violated the free exercise of religion the states highest court 
ruled monday 
the government interest in historic preservation though 
worthy is not sufficiently compelling to justify restraints on the 
free exercise of religion a right of primary importance the 
state supreme judicial court said in a unanimous opinion 
the dispute revolved around the designation of the interior of 
the church of the immaculate conception as a landmark there are 
fewer finer examples of classic mid19th century church design 
the court said in its opinion 
the national trust for historic preservation the american 
jewish congress and the council on religious freedom were among 
groups that filed friend of the court briefs in the case 
in 1986 the jesuits developed a plan to renovate the aging 
church and build an office counseling and residential space 
when the renovation work began 10 registered city voters 
promptly petitioned the boston landmarks commission to designate 
the interior of the 127yearold church as a landmark 
the granite church is located near boston city hospital and 
once served boston college students before the school moved out of 
the city said father paul kenney a spokesman for the society of 
jesus of new england 
its overall impression is one of light kenney said of the 
structures interior 
in 1987 the commission approved the landmark designation for 
portions of the church the designation made any permanent 
alteration of the nave vestibule chancel and organ loft on the 
main floor as well as other architectural details subject to the 
commissions approval 
under the designation the jesuits were only allowed to install 
nonpermanent furnishings and to conduct routine maintenance inside 
the church 
the commission eventually allowed the jesuits to make some 
renovations to the interior but in the meantime the jesuits filed 
a lawsuit contending the landmark designation was unconstitutional 
in a unanimous ruling the supreme judicial court agreed but 
the court framed the decision narrowly referring only to a section 
of the massachusetts constitution 
the decision did not refer to federal guarantees of religious 
freedom the court also made no ruling on the preservation of 
church exteriors noting the case dealt only with a church 
interior 
under our hierarchy of constitutional values we must accept 
the possible loss of historically significant elements of the 
interior of this church as the price of safeguarding the right of 
religious freedom the court said 
edward hanify an attorney who represented the jesuits said the 
case represents a key decision for all denominations 
im delighted that we have what i would say is a historic and 
compelling decision about religious freedom hanify said 
john kenneth felter the attorney for the landmark commission 
said he could not comment on the case until he discussed the 
outcome with his clients 
andrea ferster an attorney for the national trust for historic 
preservation said the ruling is narrow enough so that its impact 
nationally is muted

hundreds of albanians trekked across 
frozen mountains and rivers monday to seek refuge in greece despite 
the promise of reforms by their communist government albanian jews 
also were leaving for israel 
meanwhile a government spokesman announced that prime minister 
constantine mitsotakis will pay a twoday visit to albania on jan 
13 he will be the first greek prime minister to visit albania 
military sources in this northwestern greek border town said 
more than 600 albanians most of them ethnic greeks had crossed 
the frontier since daybreak 
more than 700 braved subfreezing temperatures snow and craggy 
terrain to walk across the frontier sunday bringing the weekend 
total to more than 1500 
its been increasing geometrically in the last few days i 
have the distinct impression that they have opened the borders 
regional police chief brigadier andreas vergis said as he struggled 
to count the albanians swarming into his threeroom police station 
many refugees said they encountered no resistance on the 
frontier and that they began the journey after hearing by 
wordofmouth that they would not be shot if they tried to cross 
the border some said guards also were defecting allowing the flow 
of refugees to snowball along the once tightly guarded frontier 
but in tirana the albanian capital a government official 
described as absurd reports alleging that the countrys border is 
being opened for visafree passage the official warned people 
against trying to cross it by force 
albanian radio monitored in london by the british broadcasting 
corp said the reports of the border opening were made by foreign 
media in an attempt to incite albanians to leave the country 
illegally 
in addition to the ethnic greeks many in albanias small jewish 
community were making their way out israeli media reported monday 
that four albanian jewish families had arrived in israel and dozens 
more were expected in coming weeks 
israel radio said the jewish immigration was made possible by a 
recent agreement between italy and albania the last of the 
hardline communist regimes in eastern europe but italian 
government officials reached monday said they had no knowledge of 
any such agreement 
the italian embassy in tirana said it had issued 37 visas for 
albanian jews and that it did not have any applications for others 
israeli government officials were tightlipped about the 
immigration of albanian jews apparently fearful of harming the 
effort 
this is going to save albanian jews from total extinction had 
they remained there they would have been wiped out in a 
generation said rabbi marc tanenbaum a consultant to the 
american jewish committee in new york 
the albanian jewish community numbers only about 1000 
officials said 
greek foreign minister andonis samaras appealed to ethnic greeks 
to remain in albania and enjoy the fruits of democracy as 
reforms are introduced 
the albanian government of president ramiz alia has promised 
such reforms as allowing religious services and the establishment 
of opposition parties but the refugees say they do not have faith 
in the promises 
we didnt believe alia said zisis karkasainas a 
26yearold economics graduate 
greek officials estimate about 350000 of albanias 33 million 
people are ethnic greeks the strain of the sudden influx can 
already be seen in the border towns 
ive been working 24 hours a day for a week now we dont have 
enough food for all these people said a woman who identified 
herself only as anastasia she was in charge of a kitchen in an old 
orphanage that has been trying to feed all the albanians who have 
crossed the border in the last two days 
dozens of refugees waited in a long line outside the orphange 
police estimated that 95 percent of the albanians who crossed 
the border are ethnic greeks who lived in frontier villages ethnic 
greeks are given temporary residence permits while the other 
albanians are taken to a united nations refugee center outside 
athens 
most of them crossed the border near filiates a town of 5000 
because the terrain is less mountainous than elsewhere along the 
100mile border 
they should declare a state of emergency up here we cant 
cope any more said father zilis the town priest he and three 
other residents formed a committee to help the refugees with food 
clothing and shelter 
the mayor pantelis koufalas on sunday sent a telex to premier 
constantine mitsotakis pleading for assistance 
a small greek army border detachment began cooking for the 
refugees after a makeshift soup kitchen ran out of food and groups 
of refugees tried to force their way into the orphanage 
look at them your heart breaks but what more can we do 
committee member nikolas georgopoulos said 
most of the refugees wearing donated clothes sat in the mud 
outside the orphanage 
shepherd ilias bouros brought his wife two infant children a 
65yearold grandmother and a nephew to greece from the town of 
sarande 
i walked 18 hours to get here with my family he said 
were tired but happy to get out of albania

when gov michael s dukakis took over 
massachusetts from a republican governor the economy was spiraling 
downward and the state budget was mired in red ink 
sixteen years later dukakis passes the reins to another 
republican and returns the fiscal favor the economy is in the 
cellar and the dukes successor william weld faces painful budget 
cuts or tax increases 
dukakis leaves office thursday as the longest serving governor 
in state history his threeterm tenure interrupted for four 
years from 1979 to 1983 is studded with accomplishments and 
controversy political heights and electoral disaster 
but the fiscal and economic condition of massachusetts that 
dukakis leaves behind mirrors the circumstances he inherited in 
1975 as a hardcharging cando reformer 
it looks to me as an outsider as though its a hell of a lot 
worse mess now said former gov francis w sargent who planned 
to attend thursdays inaugural and welcome in the first republican 
governor of massachusetts since he lost to dukakis 
when the duke came in i think he had an idea that he was 
going to be able to bring the budget home and spread it out on the 
kitchen table and figure out where he could cut sargent said 
dukakis promised no new taxes in his 1974 gubernatorial 
campaign and when he took office he adopted as a symbol a meat 
cleaver that he said would be needed to cut state government down 
to size he promised a herculean effort to reduce expenditures 
to eliminate waste 
but dukakis and his fiscal advisers discovered that the state 
was in deep financial trouble hundreds of millions in medicaid 
bills were unpaid the state welfare department was in debt a 
modest surplus of six months earlier became early in 1975 a 
deficit of between 350 million and 500 million a huge chunk in 
a state whos total budget was about 3 billion 
with unemployment at 112 percent and with oil prices soaring 
amid the arab oil embargo the state economy was in no condition to 
bail out state government 
less than a year after taking office dukakis had to eat his 
campaign promise and back the largest tax increase in the states 
history 
the parallels in massachusetts today are startling 
oil prices are again on the rise pushed by a different crisis 
in the mideast unemployment is increasing though it has not yet 
reached the doubledigit levels of the mid1970s and once again 
the problems confronting massachusetts coincide with a national 
economic slump and with similar fiscal crises elsewhere 
dukakis disputes those who predict he will leave behind a large 
deficit 
there is no comparison dukakis said in an interview monday 
in 1975 we were looking at a budget deficit that was 25 percent 
of the total 
in the past few months dukakis has been able to present his 
successor with a detailed appraisal of the states fiscal 
condition 
in 75 we didnt have that kind of information dukakis 
said nobody paid attention to monthly revenue estimates back 
then 
still massachusetts does face the prospect of a sizable 
deficit some state legislators have estimated the state would wind 
up some 300 million in the red at the end of the fiscal year next 
june governorelect weld said this week his advisers put the 
deficit as high as 750 million 
weld bound himself to a nonewtaxes promise much as dukakis 
did in 1975 weld is talking about laying off public employees to 
balance the books 
and the state legislature is in no mood to consider a tax 
increase 
in 1975 the legislature was dominated by liberal democrats who 
had no qualms about raising taxes and indeed urged dukakis to 
abandon his nonewtaxes pledge 
todays legislature still has a majority of democrats and some 
surviving liberals but theyre wary of voters who are in no mood 
to shell out more tax dollars

six prominent saudi men in a rare 
public airing of views spoke monday of overzealous religious 
police a demonstration by women drivers that backfired and fears 
that war would destroy their country 
the significance of the news conference was not so much in the 
saudis views which largely reflect the governments positions 
but in the fact that they agreed to talk on the record news 
conferences by saudi citizens were unheard of before iraqs 
invasion of kuwait because few journalists were allowed into the 
country and because saudis are reluctant to freely state their 
opinions 
the hourlong news conference covered everything from gas masks 
for foreign workers to the possibility of a permanent us military 
presence in saudi arabia as well as windfall profits from rising 
oil prices and production 
but it was the possibility of war with iraq an arab brother 
nation that the saudis had supported with 20 billion during the 
eightyear war with iran that stirred their emotions 
the united nations has set a deadline of jan 15 for iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait or face a possible military attack 
salih a altoaimi secretary general of the chamber of commerce 
in riyadh said he was praying for a miracle that saddam 
hussein will withdraw peacefully from kuwait 
i personally think it will happen he said 
nobody wants war i think the highest price ever paid by 
everybody will be much much cheaper than the consequences of war 
so we all should do our best to avoid it he said all people 
are concerned and hate to see our country and even iraq 
destroyed 
dr ali alnamlah an associate professor at imam mohammed bin 
saud islamic university in riyadh said the saudis are ready 
psychologically to face the consequences of war but hope for 
peace 
we are waiting for miracles to happen we are waiting for a 
tough decision by the ruler of iraq he said 
the deployment of more than 300000 us troops has opened a 
window however small in this conservative moslem country where 
alcohol is banned and women must be completely covered in public 
dr fahad alsamari a professor of economics and political 
science at the islamic university said he had studied the presence 
of us troops in vietnam and there was a definite difference in 
their behavior here 
we have seen the american troops are behaving very well he 
said they have been briefed they are following the rules 
respecting the culture respecting the saudis respecting the norms 
and traditions here 
but like the other saudis he said all foreign troops must 
leave as soon as kuwait is liberated and the country must build a 
large army to defend itself 
every society doesnt want any foreigners to stay in that 
military aspect he explained if you have a house and you have 
a soldier by your house you want it from the family not outside 
the family who doesnt know your system or understand you 
the ministry of information arranged the news conference in 
response to requests from some of the hundreds of journalists 
covering the us military buildup who wanted to get a saudi 
civilian perspective on the gulf crisis all six of the 
participants spoke fluent english 
since the arrival of us troops there has been a westernstyle 
demonstration by about 40 saudi women who drove through riyadh to 
protest a ban on women driving 
there has also been a crackdown by the religious police called 
the muttawa who have invaded several private homes where parties 
were being held 
alnamlah said the muttawas role was to control society for 
anything which violates islamic law and they probably had 
authorization to break into peoples homes 
but ibrahim altouq chairman of the riyadh chamber of commerce 
said the muttawa just had a role in keeping certain traditions and 
religious teachings and in certain instances i think they overdo 
it 
many saudis dont agree with people breaking into houses 
without any reason he said we were very much concerned about 
this becoming more extreme or more the rule rather than the 
exception and we expressed our views to the departments concerned 
and im sure they understood the concern of the people 
although there is nothing in islamic law against women driving 
the ban is a saudi tradition and altouqsaid the women should have 
tested public opinion first and tried to win support instead of 
springing the protest 
the very conservative people were surprised and were scared of 
such a thing they thought this was maybe the beginning of lets 
say a revolution or something very bad happening he said 
some of the women who were professors have been suspended from 
their jobs and all the women have been banned from traveling 
outside the country

a young arab woman was killed monday when a 
bomb she apparently was carrying exploded in a public toilet at the 
crowded mahane yehuda outdoor market in jewish west jerusalem 
police said 
she was the only casualty and little damage was caused other 
than a broken toilet window 
shahar ayalon a senior police officer said a bag of vegetables 
was found beside the woman and it is reasonable to assume that 
she intended to plant the bomb in the bag and place it on one of 
the adjacent streets 
police commissioner yaacov terner linked the explosion to 
increased palestinian protests expected for tuesdays anniversary 
of the first armed attack in israel by the mainstream fatah faction 
of the palestine liberation organization in 1965 
i have no doubt it is connected terner told israel radio 
authorities added police reinforcements and imposed widespread 
curfews on the occupied territories to head off violence 
the underground leadership of the 3yearold uprising against 
israeli occupation urged marches firebombthrowing and lighting of 
torches for the anniversary 
we salute the revolution of the rifles the revolution of 
armed struggle said a leaflet issued monday by the plobacked 
uprising leaders 
also monday police arrested a 19yearold israeli and said he 
confessed to shooting and wounding a palestinian doctor the 
doctors sister and her 9monthold daughter last week in the west 
bank israel radio reported 
the attack caused a furor among palestinians since a previously 
unknown group calling itself the jewish avengers claimed 
responsibility and pledged to carry out more such actions 
the suspects name was not released but police told israel 
radio the man acted alone as revenge for the slaying of a relative 
by an arab the national news agency itim said he was a soldier 
whose brother was fatally stabbed by a palestinian 
police identified mondays explosion victim as a 24yearold 
palestinian woman from the bethlehem area in the occupied west 
bank but refused to give her name 
palestinians said she was amal mustafa itabbi a resident of the 
aida refugee camp who was pregnant and married to a man jailed for

israels 200000th immigrant of 1990 stepped 
off the airplane on monday into a celebration that some immigration 
officials called inappropriate 
igor goldfarb 25 an engineer from the ural mountains region in 
the soviet union was met by absorption minister yitzhak peretz 
housing minister ariel sharon and other legislators 
peretz handed goldfarb an israeli flag as an accordion played 
and sharon said i hope that in the not too distant future we 
will be standing here and celebrating the arrival of the 2 
millionth immigrant 
goldfarb and his mother plan to live with his brother who has 
an apartment in petah tikva he told reporters in russian he wants 
to marry an israeli 
about 90 percent of the immigrants who came in 1990 are soviets 
officials say they expect 400000 soviets to arrive in each of the 
coming two years 
missing from mondays singing and dancing was simha dinitz 
chief of the quasigovernmental jewish agency responsible for 
transporting and absorbing immigrants 
dinitz said he would celebrate only after israel successfully 
absorbed all prospective immigrants granting them housing and 
employment 
we are very happy and glad that so many people are coming 
said jewish agency spokesman gad ben ari but this is the time 
for work and not for celebrating 
dinitzs absence underlined government inability to agree on how 
to handle the wave of soviet jews expected to total 1 million in 
the next two years 
israels population now is about 45 million 
sharon chairman of a special cabinet committee overseeing 
immigrant absorption disparaged a plan peretz introduced on sunday 
to put immigrants in tent camps 
i dont find anything clever in this idea sharon told 
israel radio monday he urged instead that israelis with unrented 
apartments make them available to immigrants until new housing is 
built 
plans for starting construction on 45000 new housing units in 
1990 have been derailed by similar disagreements and bureaucratic 
delays 
peretz has refused to attend meetings of sharons committee and 
soviet immigrants groups have accused the government of failing to 
anticipate the strain on housing jobs and social services 
israelis also grumble about the burden they have to bear as the 
government plans to raise taxes and cut the minimum wage 
from the minute the immigrants will come it will get worse 
our youth will be pushed aside and first of all the immigrants will 
be taken care of shimon mizrahi said on israel television 
finance minister yitzhak modai said monday that as more 
immigrants pour in the israeli public have to make bigger 
sacrifices 
the national insurance company bituach leumi released its annual 
report monday counting 118000 families below the poverty line and 
said 110000 more families would fall into poverty in 1991 if the 
burden on the population increased israel tv said 
the rush of immigration follows liberalized exit policies by the 
soviet government and tighter rules for entry into the united 
states 
some officials say immigration totals could hit 1 million in 
1991 alone 
legislator michael kleiner chairman of parliaments immigration 
committee left monday for ethiopia and said he hoped all 20000 
ethiopian jews could be brought to israel in the next year 
the small community of about 1000 albanian jews also has begun 
emigrating under liberalized policies in the eastern european 
country 
peretz calls inadequate sharons plan for putting immigrants in 
rental apartments and mobile homes 
sharon said israel managed to house the many immigrants who 
arrived in the past year we absorbed 200000 people and no one 
is out on the street 
new arrivals are being housed in army camps and hotels

the un security council held urgent 
consultations monday about violence in the occupied territories but 
failed to agree on a plo statement condemning killings by israeli 
security forces 
it was the councils final session of 1990 
a resurgence of violence in which more palestinians died could 
put israel and the security council on a collision course and 
pressure the council to impose sanctions on israel as it has upon 
iraq for its invasion of kuwait 
israel thwarted un efforts to investigate after at least 17 
palestinians were killed in rioting on temple mount on oct 8 that 
lead to a council decision to involve itself in israels treatment 
of palestinians and to request the secretarygeneral to conduct 
urgent monitoring of their treatment 
it is time for the united nations to act and to implement 
relevant resolutions protecting palestinians but unfortunately 
the united states blocked action by the council said m nasser 
alkidwa acting un observer of palestine 
us diplomats declined comment but western diplomats said they 
would seek more time for study before approving a hastily proposed 
statement requiring consensus by the entire 15member council the 
sources spoke on condition of anonymity 
yemen outgoing president of the council for december called 
the meeting to discuss what it said were the shooting deaths of six 
palestinians and the wounding of 120 over the weekend the israeli 
army said four palestinians were killed and 90 wounded in the 
unrest it amended its earlier report that five were killed saying 
one death turned out to be from a heart attack 
the latest violence was reported to stem from anniversary 
celebrations of the first armed attack in israel by fatah the 
mainstream branch of the palestine liberation organization on jan 
1 1965 
diplomats said after closed consultations that no agreement 
emerged that the united states sought more factual information 
about the violence and britain and other governments did not have 
instructions 
the issue is expected to be considered this week when zaire 
becomes council president for january 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar issued a statement 
from an undisclosed vacation site saying he was deeply 
concerned by weekend clashes in the gaza strip where 
palestinians were shot and killed and many were injured by 
israeli security forces 
he asked the un relief works agency which cars for 
palestinian refugees for information about incidents that occurred 
in palestinian refugee camps 
general assembly president guido de marco will visit refugee 
camps in the occupied territories and in jordan from wednesday 
through monday 
israel seized the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war and still occupies those 
territories

he finds the petition has legal merit it goes to the president 
who decides whether to approve or deny the request 
vargas was arrested in zacapa 90 miles east of the capital 
police said they confiscated 287 kilos of cocaine valued at 574 
million 
vargas 52 was recently reelected to a fiveyear term as mayor 
on the national center union ticket 
he has claimed the drug charges are a frameup to discredit his 
partys presidential candidate jorge carpio nicolle who faces 
jorge serrano elias in a jan 6 runoff election 
in early december guatemalan citizen rufino arriaza cordova was 
extradited to miami to face drug charges

rebels attacked a military 
barracks next to the presidential palace only two hours before 
their promised ceasefire went into effect monday the army said 
one soldier was wounded 
guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation front or 
fmln launched three rocketpropelled grenades that hit a dormitory 
wall in the communications brigade in the southern part of the 
capital the military said 
the attack apparently violated an earlier holiday ceasefire 
the rebels had said would last through jan 1 
the rebels said friday they would begin another unilateral 
ceasefire starting monday at 6 am the rebels gave no explanation 
for the overlapping ceasefires 
rebels said the truce was aimed at reopening peace negotiations 
in the 11yearold salvadoran civil war that has claimed 73000 
lives 
they gave the same motive for starting a nov 20 offensive 
saying it was necessary to push president alfredo cristianis 
rightwing government to the bargaining table 
negotiations supervised by the united nations throughout 1990 
stuck on guerrillas demands for major reductions in the armed 
forces and removal of officers and soldiers implicated in human 
rights abuses 
the army doesnt want any outside meddling in its structure 
the fmln said its sixweek offensive caused 1190 army deaths 
and injuries the government said 600 died and 1000 were wounded 
including military rebels and civilians 
rebels for the first time downed two government planes with 
surfacetoair missiles during the offensive alarming both the 
salvadoran government and its us backers the salvadoran military 
is heavily reliant on its air force to prevent largescale rebel 
attacks

communistrun businesses and currency speculators 
in berlin cost the government 666 million by manipulating aspects 
of german unification an official said monday 
berlin justice sen jutta limbach said officials have identified 
54 specific cases where people managed to make vast amounts of 
money off the economic merger of the german nations 
but she said it will take at least six months to sift through 
evidence needed to bring criminal charges 
west germanys powerful currency replaced east germanys 
nonconvertible communist currency on july 1 and the two nations 
united on oct 3 
even though the communist currency was considered worthless 
outside the east bloc it was exchanged for the western mark at a 
11 rate for small personal bank accounts and at a 21 rate for 
corporate and large accounts 
limbach said her office has turned up about 1 billion marks or 
666 million in economic damage caused primarily by former 
communistrun businesses that doctored their financial records 
all of the suspected fraud took place in former east berlin she 
said and 700 million marks or 466 million in fraud was blamed 
on businesses that had soviet rubles in their bank accounts 
the government allowed east german businesses to convert rubles 
in their bank accounts to west german marks at a 21 rate for 
recent transactions even though the ruble was worth only a 
fraction of that 
officials have charged that many businesses altered their 
records to make it look like older transactions took place 
recently allowing the enterprises to convert large amounts of 
rubles in their accounts at the 21 rate 
she said other losses were caused by currency speculation and 
illegal property sales 
officials have said that economic crimes related to german 
unification probably will reach billions of marks nationwide

george allen who transformed 
two professional football teams from losers to winners then came 
out of a fiveyear retirement to take over a struggling 
smallcollege team died monday he was 72 
allen who coached the los angeles rams and washington redskins 
of the nfl also served as chairman of the presidents council on 
physical fitness from 1981 going on television to exhort americans 
to shape up 
he died at his home here of natural causes said his son greg 
he is survived by his wife etty a daughter and three sons 
allen was alone at home when his wife returned in the early 
afternoon and found him dead in the kitchen said mike tracy of the 
palos verdes estates police department she had last seen him alive 
at 1030 am 
allen who also coached two teams with the shortlived usfl in 
the early 1980s had ended a fiveyear retirement to coach at long 
beach state in december 1989 he said at the time he missed the 
challenge 
allen ranks as the winningest coach in team history for both the 
rams and the redskins and had the thirdbest winning percentage of 
712 among nfl coaches with 100 or more victories he was 49174 
or 742 with los angeles from 1966 to 1970 and 67301 or 691 
with washington from 1971 to 1977 
although he had excellent records in the pros he never was able 
to produce a national football league champion the closest he came 
was with the redskins in the 1972 season when they lost 147 to 
the miami dolphins in the seventh super bowl 
allen said his 65 winning season at long beach state this year 
was the most rewarding of his entire career the team scored 48 
the previous season 
in an interview last thursday allen said his health had 
suffered since his players drenched him with icewater to celebrate 
a seasonending victory over nevadalas vegas we couldnt afford 
gatorade he said smiling 
however allen had been showing up recently at the practices of 
the iowa hawkeyes who were holding drills at long beach state in 
preparation for tuesdays rose bowl game against washington he was 
at practice sunday and appeared fit and animated 
allens celebrated coaching career which covered four decades 
began in 1948 at morningside college in sioux city iowa in his 
first year the team had a 36 record 
it was one of only three times he had a losing record the other 
two coming at whittier college in 1951 and 1954

team to a 86 record their first winning season in eight years 
the next year the rams finished first in the division with an 
1112 record allens best singleseason mark 
allen was known for wild spending to build a winner and trading 
draft choices for such veterans as defensive linemen diron talbert 
ron mcdole and richie petitbon earning the redskins the nickname 
the over the hill gang 
the nine games he won in his first season were the most 
washington had managed in 29 years 
his basic philosophy was us against them said petitbon who 
played for allen with the chicago bears rams and redskins and 
became his assistant in washington he made enemies of everyone 
the media other teams and it was effective he was a great 
motivator the players loved him 
redskins owner jack kent cooke said allen was a trojan for 
work and for winning he was one of the indestructibles 
though the redskins kept winning allen was fired after the 1977 
season the late edward bennett williams who owned the team at 
that time said george was given an unlimited budget and 
exceeded it 
allen landed back in los angeles but the rams fired him just 
two games into the 1978 exhibition schedule 
allen also had two winning seasons in the nowdefunct united 
states football league he coached the arizona wranglers in 1984 
where he was 108 and the chicago blitz in 1983 leading them to a 
126 mark 
i talked to coach allen a few weeks ago and he was just so 
excited about the winning season he had at long beach state said 
houston oilers coach jack pardee who played under allen as a 
linebacker with the washington redskins 
coach allen always thrived on building something out of very 
little pardee said and he was very excited about the 
continuing challenge that he had at long beach 
george really did turn things around for the rams and got us 
on a winning track said hall of fame defensive lineman merlin 
olsen who played under allen he always carried such great 
enthusiasm with him and was one of the consummate motivators 
an advocate of physical fitness who competed in marathons 
bikeathons and triathlons allen founded the national fitness 
foundation in 1952 a member of the presidents council on physical 
fitness for several years he was named chairman by president 
reagan in 1981

gov mario cuomo scrapping the pageantry of 
past inaugurations for a simple ceremony befitting new york states 
economic hard times took the oath of office monday for a third 
fouryear term 
cuomo widely viewed as one of the democratic partys most 
eloquent orators gave no inaugural address after he was sworn in 
by new york chief judge sol wachtler 
the afternoon ceremony at the court of appeals building in the 
shadow of the state capitol also featured the swearing in of lt 
gov stan lundine the inauguration was closed to the public 
cuomo hopes the 70000 savings on inauguration festivities is 
symbolic of his commitment to meet what he called the greatest 
challenge faced by a new york governor since the depression 
thats what i have to get done thats what i ran for cuomo 
said of the fiscal problems during his reelection campaign 
theres no way you could say no thats not really important 
ill solve the problem from washington and then take off and 
campaign from coast to coast i couldnt do that and i wouldnt do 
that 
cuomos chief republican adversary in albany agrees that the 
person often mentioned as the frontrunner for the democratic 
presidential nomination must take care of business at home first 
clearly what happens in the next year is going to be very 
conclusive as to his chances as a candidate for national office 
said state senate majority leader ralph marino 
for three straight years the state has run a deficit new 
yorks credit rating in march dropped from aa to a its lowest 
ever only massachusetts and louisiana are considered worse 
investments among states 
during the last two years cuomo and the legislature have raised 
taxes by 28 billion adding to cuomos reputation as a 
bigspending northeastern liberal 
on nov 6 cuomo won reelection with 53 percent of the vote 
down sharply from the 65 percent that gained him a second term in 
1986 
even during the campaign cuomo warned that the states 
finances despite hefty tax increases were again turning red 
after the election cuomo said his relatively poor showing conveyed 
the no new taxes message new yorkers wanted to send him 
cuomo then unveiled a plan to eliminate what he estimated was a 
1 billion deficit in new yorks 50 billion budget to cheers from 
the business community and republican state comptroller edward 
regan cuomo turned away from new taxes he proposed reducing state 
aid to schools and firing 2000 state workers 
with a few changes the legislature approved cuomos plan dec 
14 three days later regan warned that this years deficit could 
balloon to 14 billion and regan said the state faced a potential 
deficit next year of up to 4 billion 
this will be much bigger than 83 cuomo said friday in 
comparing the problem hell face in the coming year to the 
potential 18 billion deficit he faced when he first took office 
on the numbers this is the biggest problem the state has faced 
since franklin roosevelt was governor of new york at the 
beginning of the depression 
the fiscal balancing act represents a particular challenge to 
cuomo who has tried to build a reputation as a champion of the 
poor in his first eight years as governor 
clearly hes going to come in and make a lot of people 
unhappy senate majority leader marino said of the proposed state 
budget cuomo must unveil by the end of january 
in addition cuomo is governor at a time when new york state is 
losing clout in washington the 1990 census results mean that new 
york will lose three of its 34 house seats cuomo has said the new 
population count could translate into billions of dollars in 
reduced federal assistance 
while cuomo insists that he has no plans to run for president 
and no plans to make plans he does remain prominent on the 
national stage two weeks ago he began his work week with a speech 
to the national press club in washington and ended it with an 
appearance on cbstvs face the nation 
lee miringoff head of the marist college institute for public 
opinion noted that cuomo spends a good deal of time attacking 
president bush and congress 
in new york hes the insider but outside new york cuomo is 
the outsider miringoff said its interesting to watch what 
lines hes using because were he to be running for president he 
would likely be saying all those things 
one must reach the conclusion that maybe in fact he is 
the veteran cuomo watcher added

author salman rushdie on monday struck back at the 
writers who have criticized his decision to embrace islam and halt 
any immediate plans for a paperback version of his controversial 
novel the satanic verses 
over the weekend writer alan sillitoe said rushdies decision 
to cancel a the paperback edition was a blow to writers 
playwright arnold wesker was quoted by the sunday times as saying 
it seems the religious terrorists have won 
the answer to that is thanks arnold rushdie said in an 
interview on independent television news actually its none of 
his business 
the interviewer noted that wesker and other critics had 
supported rushdie 
yes but presumably they were campaigning on my behalf because 
they felt i had the right to write whatever i wanted whatever i 
thought rushdie said 
if i only have free speech if i happen to agree with arnold 
weskers atheistic position then thats really not much of a 
position at all 
rushdie 43 has embarked on a cautious reentry to normal life 
after two years in hiding under am islamic death sentence he was 
condemned on feb 14 1989 by irans late ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini 
theres no doubt that the worst part of the past couple of 
years has been that my son has been obliged to be without a father 
for two years rushdie said im sure most muslims in this 
country would understand that there is a innocent victim in this 
and that its time that he was allowed to have a father 
rushdie noted that he had supported distribution of the 
pakistani film international guerrillas which portrayed 
rushdie as a james bondlike villain 
free speech is not to do with being an atheist or being a 
believer he said speaking about his religious beliefs rushdie 
noted that he had recently been reading fyodor dostoevski the 
great russian novelist 
dostoevski after all came very close to a firing squad and 
spent a lot of time locked up and during that time he wrote in 
letters to friends that he had come to feel the need for faith like 
parched earth does and had found it because as he wrote truth 
shines in misfortune 
rushdie insisted he would not repudiate the satanic verses 
which he has characterized as a moral fable and would not 
withdraw it from circulation 
it seems to me whats very important is that the book should 
remain in print so that in time it can be appreciated as something 
other than the book it has been made out to be i dont repudiate 
the book what ive said is and what ive been explaining over and 
over again for two years is that its been much misunderstood and 
that i am trying now by canceling the paperback to create what i 
call a pause for understanding 
earlier in the day egypts religious affairs ministry denied 
reports in the observer weekly and in cairo papers that rushdie had 
been officially invited to egypt 
rushdie said egypts islamic affairs minister had suggested it 
might be appropriate for him to visit egypt at some point but said 
he had no firm plans to go there

the 12 european community nations will 
meet in emergency session this week and reports monday said they 
were ready to start a new diplomatic drive to avert war in the 
persian gulf 
an ec source said the foreign ministers will look at the role 
of the ec in finding a political solution to the gulf crisis at 
fridays meeting in luxembourg 
luxembourg assumes the ec presidency on tuesday and the nations 
foreign minister jacques poos said he expected some ec states to 
push for him to meet with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
poos said in an interview with the british broadcasting corp he 
expected contact would be made with iraq either through 
diplomatic channels or a private talk 
poos said he would be ready to go to baghdad if that was what 
the ec decided asked if he thought he would be meeting aziz in the 
near future he replied yes i think so 
in bonn german officials suggested the ec foreign ministers 
would discuss opening indirect talks with iraq they spoke on 
condition of anonymity and did not elaborate 
the ec ministers agreed on dec 18 not to meet with aziz until 
after aziz met president bush in washington the azizbush meeting 
was scuttled in a dispute over a date however 
in london former prime minister edward heath said a diplomatic 
push was long overdue and accused the united states of failing to 
pursue a diplomative initiative 
tens of thousands of lives depend on this and the whole of the 
world order he said on bbc radio 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said on the same program 
i think theres a chance not a good chance theres a chance for 
peace as long as the issues are clear that saddam hussein knows 
that if he stays in kuwait he will be attacked that if he 
withdraws completely and unconditionally then he will not be 
attacked 
foreign ministers hansdietrich genscher of germany and gianni 
de michelis of italy conferred with yugoslav foreign minister 
budimir loncar on monday to examine chances of a new diplomatic 
initiative 
iraqi president saddam hussein met with loncar on sunday but 
rejected his appeal on behalf of the nonaligned movement to 
withdraw from kuwait diplomats said 
a senior luxembourg official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said some ec member states talk about grand 
initiatives but we cannot do anything in contradiction with the 
united states 
as president of the ec for six months luxembourg has 
considerable sway over the agenda and content of ec ministerial 
meetings and any european initiative aimed at resolving the gulf 
crisis 
luxembourg prime minister jacques santer said monday his country 
would not take the initiative to formulate a new ec proposal he 
said fridays meeting should reaffirm ec solidarity with the 
international coalition opposing iraq 
santer also expressed opposition to linking the gulf crisis and 
the israelipalestinian conflict iraq says the two questions 
should be settled together 
there should be no linkage santer said in a telephone 
interview 
however belgian foreign minister mark eyskens on monday held 
out hope of progress on the palestinian and lebanese issues once 
iraq had withdrawn from kuwait 
if iraq conforms strictly to un security council 
resolutions the united nations could contribute to get 
international talks on other issues under way eyskens said in a 
statement 
but santer said the jan 15 un deadline for iraq to leave 
kuwait or face the prospect of war leaves very little room for 
maneuver

than 600 people were injured in new years revelry as filipinos 
generally disregarded pleas by authorities to avoid celebrating 
with fireworks and weapons hospitals and police said tuesday 
a check of 16 public and private hospitals in the capital showed 
686 people were treated for burns lacerations and bullet wounds

fireworks in manilas arlegui district near president corazon 
aquinos residence 
officials said 13 fires were reported in the city on new years 
eve and all were caused by fireworks 
the cause of fire on new years eve is always firecracker 
explosions said fireman eddie macasadug i think firecrackers 
should be totally banned i am surprised that some people want to 
legalize firecrackers here 
fireworks have been a staple of new years celebrations in the 
country for years the custom apparently came from chinese 
immigrants who believed the crackle and pop of firecrackers would 
scare off evil spirits

transporation officials said monday they had fired 
a driver whose bloodalcohol level tested above the legal limit 
after the trolley he was operating rammed into another rail car 
last week injuring 33 people 
the massachusetts bay transportation authority also will start 
testing its employees at random for alcohol and drugs in the wake 
of the friday morning accident mbta officials said 
two dispatchers who allegedly were slow to react to a 
passengers warning about the drivers behavior that morning have 
been reassigned they said 
we dropped the ball thomas p glynn the mbtas general 
manager said at a news conference we did not act in time to 
avert this accident 
a test after the accident showed the driver who authorities 
have not identified had a bloodalcohol level above the legal 
limit of 10 percent the man has not been arrested 
it is clear that the operators inability to function was the 
critical element glynn said there is no better argument for 
random drug testing than what weve seen in the last few days 
the driver initially claimed the brakes had failed but tests 
showed there were no equipment problems officials said 
although trolleys are supposed to slow to 6 mph as they approach 
the subway platform the train that crashed was traveling at least 
20 mph glynn said its exact speed at the time of impact had not 
been determined 
glynn ordered random drug testing of mbta drivers door guards 
and police to begin in a month despite longtime union opposition 
it would affect about 2350 of the transit systems 5000 
employees 
officials with the carmens union which represents the 
transportation workers did not immediately return a telephone call 
seeking comment 
during the first half of this year the mbta fired 36 workers 
for drug or alcohol abuse discovered either because of absenteeism 
or because it was suspected by supervisors 
the two dispatchers who received complaints about the driver 
from passenger tony niederberger were reassigned to other jobs 
glynn said 
niederberger who got off the train half an hour earlier and 
called the transit authority to report the driver said his 
warnings were handled too slowly to prevent the accident 
we had to be going 70 mph said niederberger who attended 
the news conference with mbta officials i honestly thought that 
we were going to jump the tracks the man did not seem to be 
satisfied with how fast he was going 
the 64yearold driver a 20year mbta veteran had no previous 
incidents of alcohol or drug use on his record officials said he 
also had no lengthy episodes of absenteeism often a sign of 
alcohol or drug abuse

transit employees were slow in notifying 
emergency workers about a subway fire that killed two people and 
injured 188 people last week a preliminary city report on the 
accident said monday 
mayor david dinkins said the preliminary investigation by his 
office found that confusion about the exact location of the friday 
morning accident also slowed rescue efforts 
the transit authority was slow to notify all of the citys 
emergency response agencies and even when it did gave them 
inaccurate information with which to respond the report said 
the lack of proper communication between the transit authority 
and transit authority police resulted in emergency agencies not 
being fully aware of the exact location of the incident it said 
the report said that once emergency workers found the train and 
victims they performed well 
transportation authority president alan f kiepper said transit 
workers gave the best information they had available at the 
time to emergency workers 
kiepper said the authority would conduct its own inquiry and 
report back in about 60 days 
the fire initially blamed on melting snow that fell down to 
track level and caused an electrical short sent thick smoke 
through a tunnel that runs under downtown brooklyn and then goes 
under the east river toward manhattan 
hundreds of commuters were trapped in stopped subway cars for 
more than half an hour later they complained of confusing 
instructions from train crew and delays in getting attention from 
rescue crews once they got off the train 
one passenger died at the scene and a second died the following 
day 
had the smoke condition been worse or had fire broken out in 
the tunnel even more lives may have been lost the report said

a longstanding dispute over this communitys 
landfill was revived monday when the mayor announced he would defy 
a judges order to contract with a courtapproved company to 
operate the dump 
by defying the court order mayor thomas v barnes risks a 
possible 30day jail term for himself and city council president 
gardest gillespie as well as a 15 million fine against the city 
i cannot sacrifice the interests of gary citizens in order to 
avoid jail but we will not accept this order without a struggle 
barnes told a news conference 
we intend to utilize every legal avenue available to set aside 
the courts order which represents an unconstitutional 
infringement on our personal rights and on the rights of every 
citizen of gary 
garys municipal landfill has been criticized for decades as an 
eyesore state environmental officials sued the city in the late 
1970s claiming the landfill also was a source of air and 
groundwater pollution 
lake circuit judge lorenzo arredondo in june ordered the 
landfill closed and threatened to jail barnes and gillespie 
attorneys reached a negotiated agreement whereby mid american 
wastes management systems inc of canal winchester ohio would 
assume operation of the landfill reserve 115 percent of its gross 
receipts for the city and begin cleaning it up 
but in july arredondo rejected the agreement 
on dec 21 he ordered the city to contract with indiana waste 
systems a subsidiary of waste management inc of oak brook ill 
barnes accused the judge of conspiring with waste management he 
said the city would seek to have arredondos decision stayed by the 
indiana court of appeals and to have the judge removed from the 
case 
if we dont get satisfaction from the state courts well go 
to federal court barnes said

a summary of developments in the news industry for the week of 
dec 2431 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the publics attention was riveted to the 
persian gulf crisis more closely than to any other news story in 
1990 a year in which international events overshadowed domestic 
news 
the times mirror center for the people and the press found that 
twothirds of the public closely followed stories about the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait and the deployment of american forces to the 
region 
by comparison the historic fall of communism in almost all of 
eastern europe and the economic and political turmoil in the soviet 
union failed to interest most americans at no point did more than 
30 percent of americans closely follow these events according to 
the centers monthly surveys 
the most closely followed domestic news story also had a link to 
the mideast crisis sixtytwo percent of those surveyed said they 
regularly read stories about soaring gasoline prices in august and 
september 
by comparison reports in november about the declining economy 
attracted only 39 percent of the readers on a regular basis 
stories leading up to and including the november general election 
caught the regular attention of only 38 percent as did stories 
last january about the war against drugs 
only one other news event involving us soldiers fighting 
abroad caught the close attention of more than a majority of 
americans sixty percent of americans regularly read stories about 
the us invasion of panama although us forces invaded panama on 
dec 20 1989 their presence in the country and numerous news 
stories continued into this year 
the centers figures are based on monthly telephone surveys of 
1200 adults nationwide 
public interest in some issues shifted significantly during the 
year 
last spring only 18 percent of the public paid close attention 
to stories about the first signs of economic problems the 
percentage had increased to 29 percent by september and it was 39 
percent in november 
there was only scant attention to the nations budget deficit 
last spring when rep dan rostenkowski dill proposed a deficit 
reduction plan during the summer as congress debated a budget 
package 18 percent of the readers were following the issue 
closely but public attention increased to 34 percent by the fall 
amid threats to shut down the federal government 
interest in news concerning president bush also fluctuated 
when bush attended the drug summit in columbia last february 
only 22 percent of the public paid close attention to stories about 
the visit criticism of the president on his changing position on 
taxes and his persian gulf policy caught the close attention of 
slightly less than a third of the public 
by contrast three out of four people read last march about 
bushs distaste for broccoli 
sensational crimes and trials drew substantial public interest 
news about the serial killings in gainesville fla attracted 
more public attention 36 percent than any other crime story 
during the year twentyeight percent of the readers followed the 
drug arrest of mayor marion barry of washington dc but interest 
waned only 16 percent paid close attention to stories about 
barrys conviction on some of the charges 
some stories attracted less public interest than expected 
despite the extensive coverage of the nomination of david souter 
to the us supreme court only about 15 percent followed the event 
closely 
and more than half of the people surveyed said they strongly 
felt too much was written about the marital breakup of donald and 
ivana trump twelve percent of the public said they closely 
followed the affair

who use video display terminals is likely to be amended to give 
businesses more time to comply 
the law which affects city workers and private businesses with 
15 or more employees requires adjustable workstations regular 
breaks and training on safe use of vdts it also recommends 
transfer to nonvdt work for pregnant women who ask to be moved

protected from dangerous injury without driving away businesses 
mayor art agnos said as he signed the ordinance dec 27 its 
legislation on the cutting edge of social change 
the ordinance requires compliance within two years for most 
businesses but agnos worked out a compromise with business and 
labor leaders calling for a longer period the amendments proposed 
under the compromise are to be voted on next month by the board of 
supervisors 
the proposed changes are a threestep program for compliance 
after one year new equipment would have to meet standards in 
the ordinance 
for existing workstations retrofitting that cost less than 
250 would have to be completed within 30 months 
retrofitting that cost more than 250 would have to be 
completed within four years 
the legislation was pushed by a coalition of activists who cited 
dangers to vdt operators including repetitive strain injury back 
and neck pain deteriorating vision and possible miscarriages 
the law will affect an estimated 56000 workers and will cost 
about 14 million in the private sector within the first 30 months

the editor of a student newspaper said 
she hopes a federal judge will rule on her lawsuit to open campus 
crime reports in time to publish the information in the papers 
next issue on jan 18 
lawyers for both sides filed briefs with us district judge 
russell g clark on dec 21 
arguments were filed after lawyers douglas w greene who 
represents traci bauer and the southwest standard of southwest 
missouri state university and john f black who represents the 
school were unable to reach a settlement 
the issue centers on whether ms bauer can have access to 
university crime reports and whether releasing those reports will 
threaten the schools ability to receive federal funds 
in his brief greene contends the universitys resistance to ms 
bauers effort to get crime reports is indicative of the schools 
refusal to acknowledge crimes occur on campus he said the 
university has refused the springfield police departments offer to 
station two officers on campus 
greene also argues that administrators are more concerned about 
image than informing students and the public of crimes on campus 
he asked the judge to rule that the university is a public body 
and comes under state open meeting and records laws 
black countered in his brief that a ruling for the newspaper 
would open the prospect of requiring every university department to 
make all documents and proceedings available to the public past 
court cases have ruled that while the board of regents is a public 
body governed by the states open records law a university is not 
subject to that law he wrote 
trying to comply with the federal family education and privacy 
rights act while satisfying ms bauers demand for access to crime 
reports would not work because the university would have to notify 
students an exception had been made to the federal act black said 
ms bauer has been given oral reports of crimes by campus 
security officers black said to go beyond that would violate the 
privacy of others he said

the states highest court threw out a 30 
million lawsuit filed against omni magazine by a couple angered 
that their family photo illustrated an article about coffees 
effect on fertility 
the state court of appeals said in a unanimous decision dec 27 
that it was reluctant to secondguess an editorial decision 
triallevel and appellate courts also had rejected the familys 
lawsuit 
joseph and ida finger of saugerties ny and their six 
children were pictured beside an article titled caffeine and fast 
sperm in omnis june 1988 issue the article discussed medical 
research that indicated in vitro fertilization rates may be 
enhanced by exposing sperm to high concentrations of caffeine 
want a big family the photographs caption read maybe 
your sperm needs a cup of java in the morning tests reveal that 
caffeinespritzed sperm swim faster which may increase the chances 
for in vitro fertilization 
the couple who conceived their children naturally had been 
photographed for an article in a roman catholic publication said 
their lawyer paul gruner they werent aware a photo service had 
given their picture to omni until a friend showed mrs finger the 
magazine he said 
when it became known in a small community the children were 
the subject of some ridicule gruner said 
the couple argued that their civil rights were violated because 
the picture was used without permission state law prohibits the 
use of a photograph without consent for purposes of advertising or 
trade 
court of appeals judge fritz alexander noted the courts have 
consistently refused to apply the civil rights law to news 
articles limiting those interpretations to advertising 
questions of newsworthiness are better left to reasonable 
editorial judgment and discretion alexander wrote 
he said the fingers had a misperception about the theme of the 
article which the judge said was more about increased fertility 
than in vitro or test tube fertilization 
the judge said theres clearly a real relationship between 
the fertility theme and a picture of six healthy attractive 
children who all bear a striking resemblance to their parents 
laura handman lawyer for omni said the article made it very 
clear the medical findings are only in the laboratory stages 
you have to assume a certain degree of common sense by the 
reader handman said i dont think theres been any family 
created by six cases of in vitro fertilization coffee or no 
coffee 
gruner said the decision would give the press too much freedom 
to use pictures of people with articles that have nothing to do 
with them

joseph f okicki the former president judge 
of cambria county who was convicted of corruption has filed notice 
that he intends to sue the parent company of the wall street 
journal 
okicki originally filed the notice nov 2 in cambria county 
common pleas court a lawyer representing dow jones amp co inc had 
the case moved to us district court in pittsburgh last week 
w thomas mcgough jr local counsel for dow jones said no 
actual complaint had been filed by okicki only a writ of summons 
that serves as a notice 
okicki did not specify in the writ the substance of the 
complaint the former judge drafted the oneparagraph writ himself 
and named as defendants dow jones journal reporter milo geyelin 
and dow jones chief executive officer warren h phillips 
mcgough speculated in court papers that the complaint would 
focus on a series of articles the newspaper published about the 
judge in november and december 1989 while okickis trial was in 
progress and after his conviction mcgough wrote that the 
complaint seems to be based in some manner upon these articles 
and upon a theory of defamation 
the former judge was convicted dec 16 1989 of official 
oppression bribery and criminal coercion 
the jury decided okicki made court employees chop his wood and 
feed his dogs solicited 500 from a court officer for a promotion 
he never granted sought payment from an attorney after the judge 
awarded damages to the lawyers client and demanded that a bank 
favorably settle his personal loan

a newspaper reporter who received copies of 
confidential fbi documents during the trial of nine organized crime 
figures said dec 27 that he knew who sent him the material and 
promised the source anonymity 
the us attorneys office wants to recover the documents from 
two newspapers and three television stations so investigators can 
trace the leak 
initially six news outlets that received the documents were 
subpoenaed to give them to a federal grand jury the tribunereview 
of greensburg relinquished the documents 
lawyers for the pittsburgh press the pittsburgh postgazette 
and television stations kdka and wpxi filed motions seeking to 
quash the subpoenas wtaetv also received the documents but did 
not join in the motions 
during a hearing postgazette reporter mike bucsko said he 
received the documents in the mail several weeks before other news 
organizations did bucsko said he knew the source and had promised 
not to reveal the identity 
assistant us attorney linda l kelly didnt ask bucsko to name 
the source in court 
attorneys for the news organizations argued that relinquishing 
the documents could ultimately identify the source whether 
reporters know the source or not 
us district judge donald j lee took the matter under 
advisement 
the government claims the documents known as fbi 302 reports 
have value as evidence prosecutors have said whoever mailed the 
documents could be prosecuted for obstruction of justice or 
contempt of court 
the reports were capsules of debriefings of federal witness 
marvin droznek the reports were among many shared by the 
government with defense lawyers in the trial of nine organized 
crime figures who were convicted oct 29 after an eightweek

a newspaper reporter has been subpoenaed to 
testify about a jailhouse interview conducted with a woman accused 
of shooting her husband to death 
the dayton daily news requested dec 28 that the subpoena be 
thrown out citing the critical need to protect the 
newsgathering process from compelled disclosure 
the subpoena was issued by montgomery county common pleas judge 
william macmillan jr 
county prosecutor lee c falke also wants reporter dwayne bray 
to reveal the contents of notes he took during an interview with 
joyce anaga 
in a story published dec 21 mrs anaga was quoted as saying 
that her husband had abused her and that she shot him while they 
were struggling over a shotgun she said she planned to plead 
selfdefense under a new ohio law for battered women her trial is 
scheduled for this week 
prosecutors said they want to see all of mrs anagas comments 
to bray 
if she takes the stand and gives a different story then it 
would be very important to know if she said something different 
falke said 
falke said there are precedents in ohio courts that allow him to 
subpoena a reporter to answer questions about an interview 
the ohio supreme court ruled in june that a subpoena may be 
enforced over a reporters claim of privilege so long as it is 
persuaded that the subpoena has been requested or issued for a 
legitimate purpose rather than for harassment

a man charged with murdering investigative 
reporter don bolles in 1976 lost a bid to reinstate a 300 million 
civil suit claiming phoenix police destroyed records that could 
help prove his innocence 
in a 30 ruling dec 27 the state court of appeals said the 
lawsuit was filed by max dunlap too long after the fact to qualify 
under the statute of limitations 
dunlap was convicted in 1977 of killing bolles a reporter for 
the arizona republic dunlaps conviction was overturned on appeal 
in 1980 but he was charged again on dec 19 he is accused of 
ordering the slaying at the behest of unidentified higherups 
he filed his civil lawsuit on july 2 1982 claiming his 
constitutional rights were violated when police shredded documents 
in the case 
a superior court judge threw out the suit in 1988 saying its 
filing two years and a month after the dismissal of the first 
criminal charge was a month too late 
dunlap argued on appeal that he had three years in which to file 
because the statute of limitations for fraud cases is three years 
and the suit claims police officers engaged in fraud 
but appeals judge william eubank said that the suit really 
centered on the claim dunlaps constitutional rights were violated 
and that such claims must be brought to court within two years 
dunlaps lawyer murray miller said he had to study the 
decision before deciding whether to appeal the state supreme court

richard kimball envisions a future in which 
voters reject television campaign commercials and select national 
leaders as they would prospective employees by reviewing their 
resumes 
he has taken a leave from his job to try to make those resumes 
and more available to voters by telephone in 1992 on every 
candidate running for national office from every state 
the people in congress are the hired help said kimball 
were saying if you the voter are the employer what do you 
need to know 
kimball a political science teacher and former arizona state 
senator is directing the center for national independence in 
politics a nonprofit organization whose honorary cochairmen are 
former presidents ford and carter 
kimball says that by 1992 the center will offer a telephone 
number providing voters 
basic personal information on each candidate 
names of people and organizations who have contributed to the 
campaign 
ratings of the candidate by special interest groups ranging 
from the american conservative union to the american civil 
liberties union 
the center experimented with its concept in this years 
elections in nebraska and north carolina 
we got about 6000 calls said kimball since the center did 
no paid advertising the calls were generated by news stories and 
word of mouth after one press conference 
when people called the 800number they got an operator with 
access to a computer holding the information on each candidate 
kimball said about 50 percent of the callers wanted voting 
record ratings and 25 percent sought campaign finance information 
but operators also got calls seeking a range of biographical 
details 
kimball says the center needs at least 500000 to run a 
nationwide telephone service using tollfree numbers but he said a 
selffinancing 900number system would be used if sufficient funds 
arent raised it would cost 3 a call

was another grim milestone in his ordeal the 43yearold chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press was kidnapped on 
march 16 1985 
sutherland 59 of fort collins colo is the 
secondlongestheld american among the 13 missing westerners he

beiruts eight major newspapers carried messages on dec 25 for 
anderson from mrs say his 5yearold daughter sulome born four 
months after he was kidnapped and sulomes mother madeleine 
the leftist assafir daily also published greetings to british 
hostage john mccarthy from his family and friends on his fifth 
christmas as a captive 
mccarthy 34 a londonbased television journalist was 
kidnapped on april 17 1986 as he drove to beirut airport to catch 
a flight for london 
the message to mccarthy in a paid advertisement urged him to 
stay as cheerful as you can and be assured we all miss you and 
love you 
beiruts independent annahar ran the english text of the 
letters sent to anderson with full arabic translations 
the frenchlanguage lorientle jour carried the text of the two 
messages from mrs say and sulomes mother in english and french 
along with the latest photograph of his youngest daughter 
both newspapers said they hoped the kidnappers would let 
anderson read the letters and see the picture of his daughter 
we are united with you in spirit always but christmas and the 
holidays make it especially difficult to accept the fact of not 
being with you in body sulomes mother wrote we are so near 
you and yet so far but our hopes are always high for a bright 
futre and reunion forever merry christmas to all of you 
mrs say told anderson that his elder daughter gabrielle was 
a blossoming young woman shes a big girl now and captain of 
her soccer team shes attending the school you wanted for her and 
is doing excellently 
mrs say expressed her hope that this would be her brothers 
last christmas in captivity 
your friends have remained committed to your cause and we are 
all working hard for your release she wrote 
especially at christmas i received letters from all over the 
united states telling me of the thousands that work and pray for 
you every day 
you and your fellow hostages are not forgotten terry and you 
will never be for every day that you suffer thousands of 
americans agonize with you mrs say wrote 
there is a god terry and although neither you nor i can 
guess why this terrible situation has been allowed to continue we 
must remain secure in the knowledge that some day some way this 
will end 
until then please keep well and listen in the quiet for the 
love and prayers that are sent to you and the others every hour 
every day may god hold you close to him 
former hostage frank reed said dec 30 that he had appealed to 
syrian president hafez assad to help free the 13 hostages 
i beg you and all nations within the community of man to reach 
into their wells of justice and sense of humanity and come to their 
rescue reed wrote in a letter to assad 
what a perfect season for syria to demonstrate to all 
americans and the world that its sense of humanity and human caring 
goes beyond standing guard together in the sands of arabia the 
letter said 
reed said he gave the letter to syrias ambassador to washington 
on dec 14 but had not received a reply 
bothering me was the enormous attention paid in the media and 
by our administration to people who were detained in iraq and 
living in special conditions that in no way could be comparable to 
what the situation was in lebanon reed said so i decided to 
take it upon myself and go to the syrian government

italys stateowned television decided dec 28 not 
to air an interview with saddam hussein saying the broadcast might 
disturb the efforts for a peaceful solution to the persian gulf 
crisis 
the decision to squelch the broadcast indefinitely drew sharp 
protest from reporters the journalist who conducted the interview 
bruno vespa threatened to resign 
the directorgeneral of rai television gianni pasquarelli 
announced the move in a letter to vespa the highly regarded 
director of the nightly tg1 news broadcast 
italy is president of the european community and we must 
avoid in a moment of extreme delicacy any act that could 
contribute to disturb the efforts that are being made to find a 
peaceful solution to the gulf crisis said the letter read on 
the evening news show 
it did not say how the interview might have affected peace 
efforts 
vespa told viewers he disagreed with the decision i expressed 
to the directorgeneral my surprise and my complete dissent he 
said 
a rai spokesman said he did not know if the italian government 
had asked the network to stop the broadcast the government 
finances rai and political parties have broad influence in its 
operation 
the editorial committee of the rai said it supported vespa in 
the dispute 
the invitation by pasquarelli to not transmit the interview 
appears like an act of selfcensorship that the editorial staff of 
tg1 can not consider acceptible in any way the committee said 
in a statement 
pasquarelli who belongs to the dominant christian democrat 
party became directorgeneral of rai earlier this year after 
serving as managing director of the state highway corporation he 
was previously a television journalist 
the christian democrats control appointments at rai1 the 
channel that broadcasts vespas program

the state broadcasting committee canceled two 
segments of one of the countrys most popular television programs 
because of its political coverage the shows host said dec 28 
the segments of the weekly vzglyad russian for 
viewpoint were to include stories about outgoing foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze including a march interview in which 
he said he considered quitting to protest shootings by soviet 
troops in his native georgia said the host alexander lyubimov 
shevardnadze resigned dec 21 saying he feared hardline 
communist forces were pushing the soviet leadership into a 
dictatorship 
program officials contended the cancellation was clearly 
politically motivated and it indicated a return to state 
censorship 
the segments were to have been in the shows dec 28 and jan 4 
broadcasts lyubimov said 
andrei shipilov an official at central television said the 
episodes were canceled for political reasons 
lyubimov said vzglyad could not ignore shevardnadzes 
resignation and warning or the congress of peoples deputies vote 
to strengthen president mikhail s gorbachevs powers 
we are worried about the coincidence between this event and 
the recent resignations of supporters of the liberal cause on 
gorbachevs team and the dramatic events at the congress of 
peoples deputies he said 
vzglyad includes a game show a historical section and 
american rock music in addition to the news segment lyubimov said

ending its 26yearold monopoly on television saying it will allow 
two private channels to operate alongside the two existing official 
channels 
the new channels which should begin operating in the summer of 
1992 will still be closely regulated spokesman luis marques 
mendes said dec 27 the government will control the length of 
airtime reserved for news educational shows and other programming 
he said 
the centerright government of prime minister anibal cavaco 
silva said prospective broadcasters will have three months from 
jan 2 to present their plans and two will be chosen in june or 
july 
a reform of the constitution in july 1989 allowed the government

initial enthusiasm for the project among portuguese and foreign 
businessmen has been dampened by recent studies casting doubt on

the economics staff of the federal trade 
commission said dec 26 that it again had urged the fcc to abolish 
rules that keep broadcast television networks from owning program 
rerun rights 
the ftcs economics bureau first urged abolition of the rules in 
september it expanded its comments to include several proposed 
modifications of the financial interest and syndication rules 
which commonly are called finsyn 
one proposal would regulate negotiations between program 
producers and networks negotiations about which the economists 
said we do not find compelling reasons to adopt any of the 
proposed restrictions 
a proposal that would modify but not abolish the rules may 
lead to a result that is less desirable than either complete 
elimination or complete retention of the rules the bureau said 
our analysis of these options leads us to continue to believe 
that the best course for the fcc is to repeal completely the 
existing finsyn rules the bureau said 
the justice department also has said the rules should be 
eliminated 
the fcc plans to decide in 1991 whether to keep junk or change 
the rules which were adopted 20 years ago when the broadcast 
networks had a much larger share of the primetime viewing audience 
than they have today 
the rules permit the networks to own only the overseas rerun 
rights to the primetime shows they produce themselves and bar the 
networks from any financial interest in other primetime programs 
including offnetwork or syndicated showings 
the ftcs economics bureau comments frequently on proposed 
regulations of other federal agencies and state agencies generally 
urging views that would result in increased competition

delta force series 
mcbain stars christopher walken who won an academy award 
for the deer hunter and venezuelan actress maria conchita 
alonzo whose credits include moscow on the hudson with robin 
williams and running man with arnold schwarzenegger 
glickenhaus who is also the films director and writer 
downplayed apprehensions about the security situation in the 
country which faces a 21year communist rebellion and the 
continuing threat from military extremists who have launched seven 
armed uprisings in 4 years 
the perception of what the political situation here is really 
a lot worst than i think the reality of it is glickenhaus said 
if you read the papers in new york youd think it is unsafe and 
youre going to be shot and youre gonna be blown up 
obviously when youre here i dont think i dont feel that 
im going to be shot or blown up 
his crew started filming here in october at about the same time 
as a mutiny led by a renegade army colonel erupted in the southern 
philippines 500 miles south of manila the rebellion fizzled out 
in three days 
a series of at least 40 bombing attacks by rightist and leftist 
extremists have occurred in the manila area since august 
in november typhoon mike swept the central philippines killing 
about 470 people 
walken said foreign members of the film were unaffected by these 
incidents since they took place in areas far away from where they 
were filming 
ive been to many places and its been quite normal 
uneventful here except for the typhoon walken said 
glickenhaus said he used several provinces just on the outskirts 
of manila to shoot scenes that depict parts of three countries 
the provincial capitol of batangas province south of manila 
was turned into a colombian presidential palace a forest in nearby 
cavite province depicted a vietnamese prison camp 
just west of manila the film crew built a jamaican white sand 
beach resort in the coast of zambales province 
the film also hired about 500 filipino crew members and actors 
most of whom worked in hollywood films shot here 
the high cost of production in the united states especially for 
independent american film producers working on a tight budget 
makes shooting in the philippines attractive glickenhaus said 
mcbain if shot in the united states would have cost at least 
double its 17 million budget 
he said the film spent about 200000 for a scene in which 
thousands of extras were storming the colombian presidential 
palace that scene would have cost 2 million if if had been shot 
in hollywood he added 
most of the films 17 million was expected to be spent here to 
the benefit of the local economy 
tom gray the films publicist said the widespread use of 
english one of the two official languages gives the philippines 
an advantage over other southeast asian countries he said it is 
easy to give directions to filipino actors and crew members because 
they understand english 
people still like making movies here glickenhaus said 
thats a good thing

david frost preparing for the interview with 
president and mrs bush that airs tonight on pbs was delighted to 
share his knowledge on the art of the interview 
tonights hourlong talking with david frost is the 
first in a series of six by frost 50 a twotime emmy award winner 
known here since the weekly satire that was the week that was 
aired on us tv in 1964 
it was frost who in 1977 won worldwide attention with his 
series of interviews with former president richard nixon 
future talking episodes will feature margaret thatcher and 
entertainer robin williams tonights interview with the bushes was 
not available at press time here then is the david frost short 
course on the interview 
ts eliot said a work of art has a life of its own frost 
said settling back into his chair although i wouldnt claim 
that an interview is a work of art it does have a life of its 
own 
i preparation is important 
some people think the more preparation you do the more it 
shackles you to a prepared plan he said the truth of good 
homework or good research is it liberates you to go with the flow 
of the interview 
the less you know the more you have to stick to your set 
questions 
the other thing is it saves you from boring the pants off 
somebody 
frost said he and a staff of four compiled three thick binders 
of research and background for tonights interview with the first 
couple from that frost transposes his questions background and 
quotes onto cardboard folders 
on those folders theres a game plan but it aint sacred 
he said 
for the famed nixon interviews which yielded six hours of 
television from 28 hours of interviews over 12 days frost said he 
had four journalists working for a year to prepare for it 
ii know when to shut up 
there are silences in interviews and in television 
interviews silence is an eternity he said there are two 
sorts of silences one is where you just sense that if you shut up 
the person will go on and say perhaps more than they were going to 
say 
and then theres another sort of silence where you realize the 
person has forgotten completely what the hell they were going to 
say and that silence is one that youd better fill as fast as 
possible 
iii the importance of listening 
obviously the most important thing is listening that is so 
transparently obvious that it seems unnecessary to say it but so 
many times people have said to me its so good that you really 
listen so i guess not everybody does 
he recalled being interviewed in england by a radio host who 
followed a questions list without listening to the answers frost 
said at first he tried to be kind saying im glad you got back 
to that he soon tired of it 
in the end it got irresistible i ended one answer by saying 
and then of course i married the popes first wife and the guy 
said but what do you feel about the future of the common 
market 
iv turn an interview into a conversation as soon as possible 
thats so theres interplay so that both people become 
absorbed in the conversation he said i dont mean they become 
absorbed in the conversation to the point where they forget 
themselves but where they forget the cameras the lights and so 
on 
v on being lied to 
there are occasions when you do have to become not just the 
catalyst but the principal he said and that is when you feel 
to use a splendid euphemism that the facts are being done a 
disservice churchill used the phrase when you feel someone is 
guilty of a terminological inexactitude 
in those circumstances you do have to become a principal and 
then you do have to press and then you do have to repeat the 
question and then you do have to repeat the facts that you think 
contradict what the persons just said and sometimes you have to 
return to it again and again and say but yes but 
vi on the roles of the interviewer 
you do sometimes have to adopt varying roles frost said 
he cited the first day of the nixon interviews in which nixon 
stonewalled questions about the watergate affair 
it was prosecution and defense frost said when he came 
back on the second day having realized the total stonewall did not 
work he was prepared to volunteer something not enough as it 
turned out and then suddenly the atmosphere became more of the 
confessional 
then on an entirely different subject the breakthrough to 
china there i was boswell to his johnson 
vii on having paid nixon to be interviewed 
i paid 600000 for six hours on the air and nbc news who 
were the semifinalists as it were the runnersup had offered 
400000 for two hours so i wasnt the only person who doing it 
so i offered more money but i got a better rate per hour 
 
elsewhere in television 
and speaking of that was the week that was dept nbcs 
planned debut of sunday best a comedic review of the week on 
tv was to be jan 13 a sunday 
then it was pushed back to feb 3 to the suicide slot opposite 
cbs 60 minutes 
the network cited uncertainties of postseason football games 
that could delay the start of sunday best and affect the 
premiere of dark shadows the fourhour tv movie airing on jan 
1314

james and rikki pomerenke fought to make 
the nations food safer as a result they no longer feel safe 
the truckdrivers keep five loaded guns in their yakima home for 
protection unemployed for more than a year they contend they have 
been blackballed by the local trucking industry because they 
exposed the practice of hauling toxic chemicals and food products 
in the same tankers 
with fellow truckers dave helzer and sharon sonner they 
revealed that some trucking companies required drivers to deliver 
dangerous chemicals in one load then wash out the tanker and fill 
it with food grade products on the backhaul 
their whistleblowing resulted in a new federal law signed in 
early november by president bush that restricted such crosshauling 
practices 
the law requires clear labeling to identify tankers for sole use 
with foods or chemicals it also gives truckers the right to refuse 
an illegal backhaul 
the law will increase the down time for truckers making it more 
difficult to get lucrative backhauls the pomerenkes said 
still cliff harvison president of national tank truck carriers 
inc in alexandria va said much of the industry supports what 
the pomerenkes did 
they are good decent honest moral people harvison said 
they did the right thing 
but doing the right thing has not made life easy for the 
pomerenkes they say they have been ostracized by friends and are 
running out of money they claim that they have been threatened 
and warned by former coworkers that they could face physical harm 
we are at the end of our rope said pomerenke 45 
its real hard for me to deal with said rikki pomerenke 
40 we dont have any friends anymore 
the central washington city of 55000 is a major producer of 
fruits and vegetables with a large trucking industry 
down here people didnt have an axe to grind and were not 
bound economically with the fruit and agriculture community of 
yakima ms sonner said theres loose cannons any place and 
any time 
helzer and sonner have left yakima they moved to hermiston 
ore after the publicity started to overwhelm them and after 
helzers truck was broken into twice while they did not feel they 
had been blackballed they thought there were better prospects for 
steady employment elsewhere ms sonner said 
the pomerenkes are longtime residents of yakima they have 
family there and they dont want to move 
they contend they have applied to numerous trucking companies 
for jobs and are turned down as soon as the employer learns who 
they are they declined to name any of the trucking companies 
the pomerenkes acknowledged there has been at least one local 
job offer but they turned it down because the pay was less than 
the prevailing scale 
the pomerenkes live on a 1500 per month disability check for a 
hand injury rikki suffered while operating a jackhammer on a 
construction job last year james receives unemployment 
ms sonner said neither couple was aware of the attention their 
whistleblowing would bring 
in all honesty i dont think the four of us would have had 
enough nerve to go through with it ms sonner said its scary 
to have someone from dc call up and say please testify before 
congress 
the pomerenkes have filed a lawsuit against their former 
employer in yakima county superior court the lawsuit contends that 
former employer premium transport has hurt their ability to get 
work by unlawful termination outrageous conduct defamation and 
breach of contract 
that company is defunct former president james ketchum also a 
defendant in the lawsuit has declined to return numerous telephone 
messages 
the pomerenkes had been construction workers in the yakima area 
for about 15 years when they decided to seek steady employment 
together as a longhaul driving team in late 1987 
what we learned in the year and a half made me sick said 
mrs pomerenke 
the lawsuit contends they were asked to lie about their previous 
load when using tanker washing facilities and to lie to shippers 
about their most recent load when picking up food after hauling 
chemicals 
they hauled juice wine and milk after hauling items like 
inedible tallow and plastic resin which is used to make foam 
insulation 
in may 1989 the pomerenkes refused to haul a chemical from the 
midwest to the west coast returning with their empty tanker to 
yakima they were fired 
they are angry about the treatment they have received since they 
went to washington to testify 
im an american and i love my country and its obvious from 
what weve done that we care about it james pomerenke said 
its strange that there are no laws to protect people who step 
forward

the jury was tough on the girl who was accused of 
trespassing and harassment at a middle school she was sentenced to 
20 hours of community service and was ordered to stay away from 
the school 
a 15yearold boy who swore at his science teacher in class 
received similar treatment 20 hours of community service and a 
written apology three pages front and back to school 
officials 
each also was sentenced to serve two jury stints in this same 
court the teen court a place where teenagers are tried by a 
jury of their teen peers 
these are kids who are just beginning to get into trouble 
said janice church head of the denver bar associations teen court 
advisory board this is a kind of early intervention program an 
alternative forum to correct the behavior of kids 
the program launched last month after more than a year of 
planning is modeled after ones in odessa texas and tarrytown 
ny but denver is the first major city to implement the program 
the sixmember juries impose real sentences in a real courtroom 
presided over by a retired juvenile court judge the lawyers and 
prosecutors are teenagers the court meets twice a month and 
though it is limited to three schools at first it soon will be 
expanded 
the cases involve minor offenses that could wind up before the 
district attorneys office as well as serious violations of school 
policy that could result in a severalday suspension 
by opting for teen court the defendants instead face up to 40 
hours of community service up to four tours as a juror and 
possibly having to apologize usually in a formal letter to the 
victims 
david chaffee the bar associations teen court coordinator 
drafts a contract that the teenagers sign choosing community 
service that fits the crime and the defendant 
the defendants must complete their sentences of community 
service and jury duty or face punishment in juvenile court or 
discipline by school officials 
church said teen court gives all participants a chance to feel 
they are part of the system and it should make a difference that 
their peers are the ones who decide the punishment 
kids react to negative peer pressure said church maybe 
theyll react to positive peer pressure 
i think kids may hope that people their own age will be more 
lenient said lorelei ockers a student at abraham lincoln high 
school in southwest denver and a member of the teen court advisory 
board 
the trespasser an accomplice and the profane boy all lincoln 
students were the first three defendants if they were counting on 
soft treatment they probably were disappointed 
melanie lucero lawyer for the boy who swore at his science 
teacher tried to paint a picture of a youth struggling to do the 
right thing despite an ongoing personality clash with the teacher 
i was having a bad day and i was trying to have a very 
important conversation the 10thgrader explained 
but jurors stared at the boy as prosecutor donnell vigil made 
him repeat the two swear words he uttered that day judge roger 
cisneros peered sternly at him over his glasses 
vigil who wants to be a lawyer exuded indignation as she told 
the six jurors that no student no matter how bad his day is going 
should swear at a teacher and disrupt the learning process 
i got more than i wanted said vigil after the sentencing 
in the other case lawyer christa goetz maintained that her two 
clients accused of trespassing would not have visited the school 
after it was closed if they had known it violated school policy 
one defendant said she wanted to talk to the principal about her 
sister 
but prosecutor paul rodriguez presented letters from the 
principal accusing the teenagers of harassing two students he 
said both had attended the junior high school and knew the rules 
though one of the defendants received a stiff sentence the 
other got the teen court equivalent of a slap on the wrist eight 
hours of community service one jury tour and a written apology 
why the disparity goetz obviously not yet skilled in the 
lawyerly art of artful dodging said i feel they maybe picked up 
that she the first girl wasnt telling the truth

price gouging at the gasoline pumps not at all

professor of finance and economics at the university of

scholarly data in clarifying popular issues

as a participant in the real estate market most people are 
participants as owners or renters you might find of special 
interest this aspect of his argument 
the charge that producers should not profit from the iraqi 
crisis is about as sensible as claiming that homeowners in los 
angeles who bought their houses in the 1950s are morally bound not 
to profit when selling them 
if homeowners do not collect their accumulated profits asks the 
professor how will they be able to replace their homes they 
cannot he suggests declare that the marketplace should 
accommodate them of course not 
besides if they decline to take profits that doesnt mean the 
profits arent there it means only that the ownerseller declines 
to accept them the profits will be passed on to the buyer who 
will collect them on the next resale 
except for his strong belief in free markets mckenzie has no 
known reason to defend oil companies his identification with the 
subject is academic as a professor and as a fellow of the center 
for the study of american business based on the campus of st 
louis washington university 
in that latter regard he produced working paper 137 
detailing his findings and conclusions 
taking 1967 as a base year the price of a gallon of gasoline 
138 at the time the paper was written had risen less since 1960 
than the price of the basket of goods that goes into the 
calculation of the consumer price index 
uncle sam has a bit to do with those higher pump prices 
gasoline taxes were 105 cents a gallon in 1960 they rose to 145 
cents in 1981 and to 269 cents in july 1990 and of course they 
have just risen again 
the quality of gasoline has risen providing more miles to the 
gallon and less pollution too american consumers are now spending 
a much smaller percent of disposable income on gasoline than in 
1970 or earlier decades 
in 1989 mckenzie states gasoline expenditures for the 
typical consumer as a percent of his or her disposable income 
fell precipitously to less than onehalf of the 1970 level and to 
almost a third of the 1980 level 
mckenzie makes this effort stressed in his paper to describe 
recent pricing events at the pump which a great many americans 
have chosen to call gouging 
oil markets must not only account for current reductions in 
supplies but also must seek to anticipate the prospects of further 
declines in the oil supplies 
when production of any good or service involves delivery at a 
future time he explains then competitive prices reflect both 
current and expected future supplies 
it is like the los angeles homeowner who must worry about 
earning enough on the sale of his present house to buy another 
especially if the housing market like the oil market is volatile 
and unpredictable 
for oil companies and service stations to deny the future 
uncertainty of their markets would have been folly says mckenzie 
who repeats 
the major cost of staying in business is not the past purchase 
price of any item in inventory but the future replacement cost of 
that item 
if there has been collusion with the industry or a conspiracy to 
gouge the public mckenzie says that those involved have done a 
mighty poor job of it

stephen schwartz and john caird have been involved 
in some of broadways biggest hits but they were adamant about 
launching their new show children of eden in london 
it has to do with working style schwartz 42 said of the 
386 millionmusical opening jan 8 at the prince edward theater 
its a much more pleasant and focused working experience 
the composerlyricist said of londons commercial west end 
theres much less of the power and ego games ive experienced in 
new york that frenzy of threats and tears and firings 
the greater quantity of theater in london than on broadway means 
there is less hysteria attached to each individual show also the 
price is right children of eden on broadway would cost double 
its west end budget schwartz said 
schwartz has had three substantial new york hits godspell 
the magic show and pippin as well as such flops as 
working and most recently the 1986 rags 
children of eden which uses the book of genesis to tell a 
cautionary tale about the world today is the first major london 
opening of 1991 
its the first collaboration of schwartz a new yorker who now 
lives in connecticut and caird the english codirector of 
nicholas nickleby and les miserables 
the 35person cast is headed by ken page the american star of 
cats and aint misbehavin as god kevin colson a tony 
nominee in june for aspects of love as noah and frances 
ruffelle a tonywinner for les miserables as yonah 
caird and schwartz have been polishing children of eden for 
three years following a 1985 workshop of a separate version of it 
entitled the family tree which did not involve caird 
the london staging was first planned for the royal shakespeare 
company where les miserables began in 1984 it shifted to the 
commercial west end when the company decided to close its two 
london theaters for the winter in order to save money 
caird said his new project had the initial appeal of les 
miserables which has gone on to become the most internationally 
successful musical ever 
i fell hopelessly in love with stephens songs on first 
hearing just like i did with the score of les mis caird said 
in an interview 
the first act recounts the creation and the fall of man the 
second act said caird is an imaginative version of life in the 
late 20th century where the children of eden man and animals 
are no longer living in harmony 
each is being cannibalized by the other 
schwartz said any similarities to his 1971 godspell his 
most popular show to date are coincidental you couldnt really 
make comparisons 
but he acknowledged children of eden is a risky venture not 
least because no surefire names are attached to it 
we dont have julia mckenzies name up there we dont have 
andrew lloyd webbers name up there said schwartz mckenzie is 
the acclaimed current star of stephen sondheims into the woods 
in london lloyd webber has four longrunning musicals on the west 
end 
im very very exposed in this show he said 
while musicals often postpone opening nights to allow their 
creators to hone the show further children of eden unusually 
moved its premiere forward from jan 16 to jan 8 
frankly it was a financial decision explained schwartz 
its difficult to sell the previews without the notices and 
until those notices are out people are not going to buy tickets 
if the show clicks in london schwartz said he would then brave 
broadway 
its not that im allergic to the air in new york he said 
commercially its still the best thing that can happen to a 
show

peter martins tries to capture the individual 
spirit of each ballerina when creating works about them for the new 
york city ballet companys ballerinas 
you try to capture what each woman is about what her virtues 
are and so forth said martins who has been ballet master in 
chief of the new york city ballet since the death of george 
balanchine in 1983 you also try and see if you can bring out 
something else in them 
five ballets or excerpts from ballets choreographed by martins 
on five ballerinas will be aired by pbs on jan 11 at 9 pm est 
ballerinas dances by peter martins is part the great 
performances series 
i would say for the most part this is basically the way i have 
seen these women says martins who retired from dancing to 
devote full time to running the company they all used to be my 
partners 
when youre dancing with them youre preoccupied with being a 
part of a picture yourself youre much less observant about their 
particular qualities then when you take a step back and look at 
them from a creative point of view something else emerges 
all five dances in the tv program were created by martins after 
he stopped dancing he doesnt choreograph on paper in an office 
he choreographs on the dancers physically having them move in 
a studio 
kyra nichols and adam luders dance beethoven romance 
kyra has such strength and such resilience that you can give 
her the most difficult things and yet they will come across as 
looking very easy and simple martins said 
she keeps challenging you to do more she can stay longer on 
pointe unsupported than most there is a lot of strength there a 
lot of power 
patricia mcbride and ib andersen dance valse triste 
it was toward the end of pattis career and i saw the softness 
in her which had always appealed to me martins said patti 
used to be considered a soubrette a small dancer who moves very 
quickly a lot of ballets mr b did on her in her youth were like 
that 
it was her lyrical qualities that appealed to me its as if 
nature makes her dance it is like snow and rain and the wind and 
the sun it is all natural nothing forced it appears that you put 
a wand over her and she just moves 
heather watts and jock soto dance the second movement of the 
modern ecstatic orange 
they all challenge me in various ways heathers challenge is 
much about architecture said martins it becomes creating 
images it is about sculpting bodies there is always a new 
sculpture emerging 
also there is an element of the unknown when you work with 
heather an unpredictability you may try to get one movement out 
of her and another one will emerge thats always fascinating you 
get a lot of help 
merrill ashley and adam luders are joined by former paul taylor 
dancers kate johnson and david parsons in barber violin 
concerto 
merrill is the epitome of the classical technician martins 
said there was a part of merrill i have always felt was looming 
underneath the surface which was the passionate merrill i dont 
think she has had a dance like that done on her i wanted to bring 
that to the surface this is the passionate merrill not the 
technical merrill we see every day 
suzanne farrell in her farewell ballet and martins 
temporarily back from retirement dance sophisticated lady 
suzanne is in many ways more american than any of them one of 
the things she has excelled in is her showgirl aspect as in 
slaughter on tenth avenue so i thought why not make her a 
little dance that celebrates that part of her where she can go out 
on stage and be rita hayworth gloriously beautiful and not having 
to do very much neither of us was prepared to do a major pas de 
deux on pointe i am an old retiree 
it is she and i playing fred and ginger anybody who loves 
dance has somewhere in them a deep deep admiration for ginger 
rogers and fred astaire i wanted for us to play that role for a 
moment 
the pbs show is coproduced by wnet and danmarks radio dances 
were filmed in denmark

its the same old story 
boy meets girl boy gets girl boy bills girl for grooming of 
schnauzer girl makes tuna fish for boy again and again boy and 
girl sit atop the highpowered world of publishing girl divorces 
boy 
ok maybe the story of richard snyder and joni evans is not the 
same old story it certainly has had a novel ending both sides 
want a judge to declare the others celebrity status a marital 
asset give it a dollar value and divvy it up just like the family 
house furniture and other belongings 
snyder and evans each claimed to have made the other what he or 
she is today and to prove the point they were willing to fling 
major mud 
the case has more than gossip value divorce lawyers are 
watching it and similar cases to see whether the courts will agree 
that fame should be appraised and its value apportioned 
its an idea whose time hopefully will never come said 
attorney raoul felder whos fighting to keep metropolitan opera 
diva frederica von stades husband from claiming a piece of her 
stardom 
but marvin mitchelson who represents roseanne barrs exhusband 
bill pentland hopes to win the first california case based on the 
principle 
the attaining of celebrity status during the marriage is a 
definite asset just as appreciation of a house or an art 
collection is an asset he argues i think it is slowly being 
recognized 
the story of evans and snyder played out in a new york 
courtroom last spring is light on hearts and violins and heavy on 
the bottom line 
snyder head of simon amp shuster hired evans as director of 
subsidiary rights in 1974 shed advanced to associate publisher by 
1976 when they began dating two years later they married at city 
hall during their lunch hour 
theirs was an egalitarian marriage though he always outearned 
her bank accounts were separate his assistant billed her monthly 
for her share of the food utilities and schnauzergrooming bills 
she testified 
in 1979 snyder created an imprint a semiautonomous shop 
within a larger publishing house called linden press for evans to 
run it was a success 
she says the marriage began to break down in 1985 when snyder 
promoted her to president of the trade book division and she was 
working directly under him again snyder who has publicly 
complained about her workaholism testified that the marriage 
went south two years earlier 
they agreed to separate in 1986 and she filed for divorce in 
february 1987 resigning from simon amp schuster at the same time to 
join random house 
had they agreed to an outofcourt property settlement the case 
might have ended there instead the history of their marriage was 
recounted in public 
evans said snyder aimed a tennis ball at her during an argument 
on the tennis court snyder said evans put him in a very 
humiliating and embarrassing and emotionally unhappy position 
by turning her back on him at a publishing convention 
the last time they had conjugal relations the weekend of july 
4 1986 evans testified matteroffactly 
evans said she cooked and cleaned when the maid was off duty 
but conceded she made tuna fish 75 percent of the time 
even then snyder said he opened the can and removed the tuna 
because that was the dangerous part 
evans 48 who now heads her own imprint at random house 
contended in her pretrial memorandum she acted as snyders 
sounding board entertained his corporate bosses simon amp 
schuster is owned by paramount communications participated in 
business decisions and served as a source of emotional stability 
and as moral anchor 
that she said entitles her to a share of the marital estate 
which she estimates at more than 18 million 
on the contrary answered the 57yearold snyder she would be 
nothing without him he argued so he should get a cut of all her 
future earnings 
she is the very opposite of the wife who sacrifices her own 
career or performs unremunerated services for the benefit of her 
spouse and family he argued in court papers made available to 
the associated press 
in significant part as a result of his efforts she is today 
one of the highest paid and most powerful executives in the 
publishing industry 
manhattan state supreme court justice elliot wilk has reserved 
decision 
a decade ago the snyderevans contretemps would have been an 
impossibility judges simply awarded property to the spouse who 
held the title usually the husband while providing alimony to 
the untitled spouse 
but in 1980 new yorks laws were revised to protect the spouse 
whose contribution was nonmonetary in new york and 41 other 
states judges must now make an equitable distribution of all 
property acquired during the marriage regardless of who holds the 
title 
then in a landmark 1985 case new yorks top court ruled that a 
woman who gave up her career to put her husband through medical 
school only to be divorced two months after he got his license 
must be compensated with a share of the husbands medical license 
a new jersey judge took that concept one step farther awarding 
joe piscopos exwife 50000 or half the value placed on his 
celebrity status the states highest court upheld the award in may 
1989 
mitchelson hopes similar logic will prevail in his case against 
roseanne barr he argues that her exhusband helped launch her 
career in comedy clubs was the main parent and homemaker while she 
was on the road and auditioning then worked with her to launch her 
hit abc show and wrote some of the scripts 
here youve got clearly a career that was made and developed 
during the marriage he said barrs current earnings are a 
thousand times more than they were because of what happened during 
the marriage 
alfred ferrer attorney for frederica von stades former 
husband peter elkus is appealing a ruling declaring the singers 
career was not a marital asset he too describes marriage in terms 
more numismatic than romantic 
marriage is an economic partnership he said if ones 
career is enhanced during that partnership each spouse has a right 
to participate in that value

he has no job and no money for rent but 
carpenter reuben soto still believes the northwests economy is 
tops in the nation 
trouble is hes right 
in the late 1980s the northwest became the jewel of the us 
economy sparkling atop charts of economic growth and livability 
the region still outshines the gloomy national economy but thats 
not saying much as reuben soto discovered firsthand the great 
northwest boom is fading 
he came from virginia last summer a 35yearold bachelor 
looking for work and a fresh start in life hed heard times were 
good around seattle and sure enough things started out well soto 
landed a carpentry job and rented a small apartment 
but then seattles hot housing market cooled and construction 
slowed soto was laid off in november and hes been hunting for 
work ever since 
im going through some rough times now he said but i 
know it will get better this is still a land of opportunity 
hes not the only optimist in town many economists say the 
northwest though slowing down is likely to escape the worst of a 
widespread downturn a newly diversified economy growing asian 
trade and banner years for aerospace giant boeing have stabilized 
the region once infamous for sliding to the bottom of national 
recessions 
were not going to be immune to whats happening elsewhere 
said john w mitchell chief economist for us bancorp in 
portland ore but youre still talking about the strongest 
region in the country 
indeed the strong growth of recent years has put the northwest 
on solid footing to face economic challenges 
measured by employment the region far exceeded average us 
growth in the year ending october employment in washington oregon 
and idaho combined grew at twice the national rate add nevada and 
utah the nations fastestgrowing states and regional employment 
grew 38 percent nearly triple the 13 percent us rate 
all five northwestern states last year were among the nations 
top 10 in growth of residents personal income 
in washington the boeing co nearly doubled its work force 
between 1983 and 1990 with more than 100000 workers the 
airplanemaker now accounts directly or indirectly for one of every 
six washington jobs 
in idaho oregon and utah diversification featuring hightech 
electronics and computer industries has evened out the ups and 
downs of formerly resourcebased economies our growth has been 
broadbased said michael ferguson idahos chief economist 
weve got the good fortune of having the right product mix 
so much for the good news if 1990 culminated several years of 
heady northwestern growth it also was when the region started 
pulling in its horns 
in washington boeing finished its hiring binge the company is 
still a strong stabilizing force it has orders for jets it wont 
deliver until after the turn of the century but the impetus 
behind seattles population boom is gone 
the housing market has responded accordingly in 1989 seattle 
had the nations fastestrising home prices by the end of 1990 
home prices were stagnant and houses sat on the market for months 
new construction fell off sharply 
state economists declared in november that washington had 
entered a mild recession they predicted the state would lose 
10000 jobs by june a 5 percent drop in total employment and 
then resume growing slowly 
idahos rapid growth will slow considerably during the next 
three years ferguson said 
perhaps the most worrisome northwestern state is oregon where 
more than 30 percent of factory jobs depend on the beleaguered 
timber industry a nationwide housing slump has reduced demand for 
timber and supply is shrinking due to logging restrictions aimed 
at protecting the spotted owl a threatened species state 
economists predict 5400 timber jobs will disappear in 1991 
the forest industry is oregons achilles heel said michael 
j parks editor of marples business newsletter in seattle 
economists say such negative factors are cooling the northwests 
hot growth down to a lukewarm prosperity 
our economy will behave and grow more like the rest of the 
country predicted douglas pedersen economist at security 
pacific bank washington well be growing faster than the 
nationa average but the margin will be a little thinner 
thats still attractive to regions mired in recession but the 
northwest formula may be hard to match elsewhere 
some economists believe this regions fortune hinges on 
industries of the future such as software and biotechnology 
which benefit more from worker satisfaction than closeness to 
markets or raw materials 
such footloose industries are lured by the northwests 
fabled natural beauty and high quality of life not by tax breaks 
or other government incentives said us bancorps mitchell 
oregon washington and idaho have three totally different tax 
structures but theyre all growing mitchell said its not 
policy were just lucky 
equals

kenneth jackson frederick coolidge laura goodwin and frank s 
pinet belong to an endangered species college professors 
designated as superb teachers 
each works at a huge multicampus research university where 
hundreds of millions of dollars flow into research and where 
faculty prestige comes with outoftheclassroom projects 
yet each is prized for outstanding classroom skills 
great research and great teaching fuel each other said 
michael i sovern president of columbia university yet we must 
acknowledge that great universities like ours are at risk of 
tilting in favor of research at the expense of teaching and we 
must not let that happen 
in america today the great teacher is an endangered 
species 
jackson who has taught at columbia for 22 years is one of 10 
educators recently appointed to professorships created with gifts 
of more than 12 million 
coolidge goodwin and about 25 other professors working at one 
of the four university of colorado campuses are being encouraged to 
teach and suggest how lessexperienced professors can become better 
in the classroom the professors are given 6000 a year for two 
years and the lifetime title of presidents teaching scholars 
we are more encouraged than ever now to take up our mandate to 
educate even though our faculty members do remarkable research 
aid mary ann shea the universitys program coordinator who works 
from the boulder colo campus our mandate is to educate 
students our mandate is to concentrate more on how students learn 
and how we can best teach them 
pinet is a distinguished teaching professor of business at the 
university of kansas which first established endowed distinguished 
teaching professorships in 1957 
the lawrence kan school now has more than 125 distinguished 
professorships 22 of which explicitly recognize outstanding 
teaching 
at the university of missouri president c peter magrath 
recently created an annual presidential award for outstanding 
teaching the award includes a 15000 stipend available to tenured 
faculty members with a record of outstanding teaching for at least 
10 years 
lynne cheney who chairs the national endowment for the 
humanities has said emphasis on outside studies is greatest at 
research universities where 64 percent of the faculty report 
spending five hours or less per week on formal classroom 
instruction and 86 percent report spending six or more hours per 
week on research 
the typical reward for good teaching is a couple of thousand 
dollars and a pat on the back said peter smith a spokesman for 
the association of american universities the colorado program is 
clearly more than that 
now in its second year colorado university with its 
fourcampus system and 43000 student population has an elaborate 
selection process by which faculty deans and students participate 
in selecting tenured professors from the 3000member faculty 
for 199091 12 scholars were appointed from the campuses in 
198990 15 were appointed 
the significance of the program is that master teachers work 
with faculty colleagues as opposed to working with graduate 
students who we know were going to send off from our 
institutions in this case were trying to work with faculty 
members who have never had any experience in talking about teaching 
with a faculty colleague and learning new ways to teach shea 
said 
part of the universitys psychology department on its colorado 
springs campus coolidge is clearly excited about designing a 
course for professors and lecturers entitled how to teach more 
effectively his goal he said is to help show how humor 
stories and parables strategically placed in lectures can create a 
pleasant learning environment 
rex burns of the universitys denver campus said those who will 
fare best in the classroom are the most empathetic 
you have to have an ability to put yourself in place of the 
students looking at the teacher he said and perhaps even 
listening to yourself in the classroom as others see you

you can argue about whether memphis or 
north carolina or texas has better barbecue you can argue about 
the proper sauce the proper meat the proper fuel 
but there is no argument about one simple fact kansas city 
takes its barbecue very seriously 
kansas city is home to the worlds most famous barbecue 
restaurant arthur bryants jack nicholson is known to interrupt 
coasttocoast trips to eat there writer and native kansas 
citian calvin trillin ribs partly in cheek once called bryants 
the best restaurant anywhere 
and some swear the gates amp sons chain is even better the sweet 
aroma of barbecue overwhelms all bus and truck fumes at one busy 
midtown intersection right next to ollie gates rib tech where 
future cookers learn the science 
there are many other momandpop joints that lay claim to the 
title of best barbecue around but the real barbecue the real 
thing is cooked by the legion of people who haul homemade smokers 
to competitions around the region 
its a very tight community said gary wells who doubles as 
an insurance agent when hes not tending to matters of the meat as 
president of the kansas city barbecue society which has more than 
500 members 
they are serious about having fun they are serious about 
cooking too they like things that are a little offcenter its 
every kind of person weve got doctors lawyers forklift 
drivers he said 
and some are even in unexpected places kcbs members jim and 
kathleen tabb recently judged a barbecue contest in ireland the 
food was good and then moved on to another competition in estonia 
where they had an official visit with the mayor of tallin in the 
14th century town hall 
there they were treated to classical music and a performance by 
a soprano who tabb said sounded as sweet as loretta lynn 
a first id say for barbecue to blend itself with culture 
sophistication and classical music tabb reported in the 
bullsheet the official publication of the kcbs totally fun 
and bizarre sort of like taking a weber or a 55gallon drum to 
the opera 
later while toasting champagne around this centuries old long 
table an estonian official whispered in my ear that the last time 
gorby was in tallin he sat exactly where i was standing a shiver 
ran down my spine 
estonia is probably the farthest reach of the kcbs although the 
smoke from cookers goes up in canada vienna bermuda and 40 us 
states back home wells said when you think of the center of 
american barbecue you can envision a triangle from kansas city to 
memphis to texas 
to kcbs purists southern style barbecue doesnt count because 
those folks only cook pork real barbecuers cook beef poultry and 
lamb as well as pork in carolina the sauce is clearer wells 
said they use vinegar and peppers its a mustardbased sauce 
as you go west it gets redder and sweeter 
oh thats another thing never ask a cooker for the recipe to 
his sauce youll be met with stony silence if youre lucky 
barbecuing is the process of cooking meat slowly for a long 
period of time wells said you control your heat disseminate 
enough smoke add moisture but really if it works for you do 
it 
a barbecue competition is judged two ways under kansas city 
rules a group of judges are given blind samples in memphis where 
there is a prestigious competition in june judges go from 
barbecuer to barbecuer to taste samples 
a typical competition goes like this the cooking teams arrive 
friday and set up shop at midnight its time to put the brisket 
on then comes a night and day of cooking 
some teams split up the duties by having one person cook the 
chicken while others do the brisket and ribs others have a chief 
cook and people to tend the fire and run errands 
sometimes significant prize money is involved as much as 
10000 but mainly the aim is to have fun 
you havent lived until youve been on a field trip with 80 
barbecuers said carolyn wells garys wife and a past editor of 
the bullsheet it lets us be kids again theres the 
camaraderie 
each year dozens of kansas city area members go out into the 
cold to barbecue turkeys for the local harvesters group this past 
thanksgiving they donated clothing and just under a ton of food 
that is the spirit of barbecue wells said they are just 
plain good folks theyve got a heart of gold they would do 
backflips for you they are generous in spirit

chinas prodemocracy movement which seized the 
hearts and attention of the world a year and a half ago at 
tiananmen square is faltering 
internal squabbling chinas reestablishment in the world 
community and the international medias preoccupation with eastern 
europe and the persian gulf have nudged democracy activists out of 
the headlines public interest has waned 
the most prominent student leaders of the massive protests that 
engulfed beijing now lead lowprofile lives far from the spotlight 
that made them media stars and one of them a nobel peace prize 
nominee 
wuer kaixi the eloquent but mercurial firebrand has been 
pumping gas near san francisco chai ling whose impassioned 
leadership in the protests final days won her the nobel 
nomination has left her husband fellow student dissident leader 
feng congde in paris and is quietly attending princeton 
university 
without them the movement has lost much of its cachet 
wan runnan newly elected president of the federation for a 
democratic china concedes that public support has diminished 
but there are bound to be periods of high and low interest 
he said in an interview no one can ignore a country that 
represents onefourth of the worlds population 
the federation was born amid much fanfare in paris in september 
1989 two months after the bicentennial of the french revolution 
the annual parade down the champs elysees was led by some 200 
chinese students on bicycles momentarily giving paris most famous 
street the look of a beijing boulevard 
chinese soldiers backed by tanks charged down those beijing 
boulevards in the early morning of june 4 1989 shooting and 
killing at least several hundred unarmed protesters the searing 
images of the bloodshed were etched into the minds of millions who 
watched the tragey unfold on television 
much of the protests leadership fled overseas as had decades 
before them the influential political thinkers kang youwei and 
his disciple liang qichao and sun yatsen the founder of modern 
china all were active in japan preaching democracy for china 
around the turn of the century 
exile abroad was also the lot of former premier zhou enlai 
revered by the students at tiananmen and recently retired senior 
leader deng xiaoping despised by the democracy supporters as the 
mastermind of the crackdown they began their revolutionary careers 
in france where they joined the communist party in the early 
1920s 
the federation has kept its dream of chinese democracy alive 
through seminars demonstrations and criticism of chinas 
authoritarian regime 
its founders include dissidents forced to leave china such as 
physicist fang lizhi who hid in beijings us embassy for more 
than a year before being allowed to leave and outspoken marxist 
theoretician su shaozhi who for years advocated thorough reform of 
the communist party 
it has maintained contacts in china and closely monitors what it 
claims are continuing human rights abuses under chinas communist 
government 
recently it spearheaded denunciations of the trials of top 
dissidents in china the federation said the trials violated 
chinas constitution by holding the accused for 13 months without 
trial and denying them defense lawyers of their choice 
wang juntao and chen ziming who published a dissident magazine 
are accused of sedition which carries a maximum penalty of death 
wang dan the student seen as the behindthescenes brain of the 
popular movement stands accused of counterrevolutionary 
incitement 
but the dissident movement in exile has lost the momentum that 
used to attract large crowds and donations at its rallies and 
fundraisers 
the formation of the fdc the federation came at a high tide 
for the democracy movement says andrew nathan a professor at 
columbia university in new york and author of two books on chinese 
democracy 
there were signs that the chinese regime would collapse and 
the cream of the crop were organizing overseas there were a lot of 
expectations but things didnt happen 
the federation is regrouping and seeking fresh directions under 
wan elected at the groups annual convention in san francisco he 
directs chapters in 20 countries formed most recently in brazil 
and greece from a threeroom office in a quiet section of 
northwest paris 
he insists the group has been effective 
without an opposition faction there will never be 
democracy he says if the united states didnt have two 
parties if poland hadnt had solidarity you couldnt have 
democracy there cannot be a rule that the chinese communist party 
must be in power

his top priority is to persuade foreign governments to pressure 
beijing toward greater political liberalization and respect for 
human rights he is disappointed that the west has dropped most of 
the economic and political sanctions imposed against china so soon 
after the crackdown 
we understand part of their reasons he says but as for 
the conditions that brought on the sanctions in the first place 
the suppression the arrests there has been absolutely no 
change 
wan hopes to strengthen the movement through increased 
cooperation with overseas chinese and other opposition 
organizations but he faces criticism from rival dissident groups 
wan runnan is shortsighted and an opportunist he thinks that 
just by eliminating the communists oneparty rule youll have 
democracy in china says wang xiaoyu a former reporter for the 
government news agency xinhua who is now chief editor for the 
dissident house of chinese democracy also in paris 
the blood from june 4 hasnt yet dried and hes setting up a 
small clique of intellectuals who consider themselves the 
government in exile they make a lot of statements but dont do 
anything constructive 
wan 46 believes he will see democracy in china within his 
lifetime but wang says that is simplistic and that it could 
take 200 even 500 years 
disagreements arise within the federation itself 
on the eve of the san francisco convention a faction within the 
federation criticized wan their candidate to oppose wan was 
elected federation vice president 
wan is a former software engineer with the chinese academy of 
sciences computer center who in 1984 was named head of the stone 
corp chinas first private hightechnology firm a strong 
supporter of the students at tiananmen he defected while visiting 
hong kong four days after the crackdown when he learned an arrest 
warrant had been issued for him 
he took over as federation president from yan jiaqi who as a 
former adviser to ousted communist party chief zhao ziyang had 
respectable credentials but was more theorist than organizer 
among wans tasks is addressing problems of the federations 
first year 
the fdc hasnt been particularly effective in lobbying 
nathan says reaching out to the nonchinese community is 
something theyve proved theyre not very good at doing 
there was also the fiasco of the goddess of democracy a ship 
which was to broadcast prodemocracy messages into china but is now 
a tourist attraction drawing mild interest in taiwan the mission 
floundered when neither japan nor taiwan would allow the activists 
to load a radio transmitter on board 
the federations finances reportedly have suffered more from 
bad administration than malfeasance of the 1 million the 
federation received in its first year it spent only 3 percent on 
expanding democracy activities and 40 percent on travel or 
consultations according to the chineselanguage european daily 
news 
when chai ling visited the united states this past summer she 
raised 40000 but spent virtually all of it paying for the trip 
according to a chinese paper in the united states 
wan also has to make up for the departure from france of chai 
ling and wuer kaixi whose youthful zeal made them strong media 
draws 
yet wuer was a dubious asset to the organization because of 
reports of his flamboyant lifestyle 
wuer kaixi ruined the fdcs reputation by spending too much 
money on food and taxis wang says 
wuer now works at a gas station near san francisco and is 
applying to attend the university of california at berkeley 
things havent been too tough for me over the past year he 
said during a recent trip to taiwan i thought it wouldnt hurt 
to do something humble for awhile 
about wuer and chai wan says you cant base a political 
movement on stars their departure is a maturing process both 
for them and for us 
wan himself was exploring the possibility of returning to 
beijing according to a us diplomat he left behind a wife and 
collegestudent son they were not arrested but cannot leave the 
capital 
wan says only that he considered returning to china to continue 
working for democratic reforms from within but abandoned the idea 
yet with limited ability in french and english he admits thinking 
often of home 
people of that age their lives revolve around china nathan 
says theyve spent a lifetime achieving a stature that they will 
never gain overseas they now have an agonizing choice over what to 
do with their lives 
sitting around drumming their fingers living off of 
fellowships how long can this go on

editors note some hollywood stars have become almost as 
wellknown for the causes they support as for the parts they play 
jane fonda charlton heston and edward asner come immediately to 
mind while those three may represent an older generation show 
business today is not without its activists concerned about such 
issues as the environment energy abortion and the homeless

academy awards night typically finds 
hollywood in a selfindulgent mood the stars lavishing themselves 
with fine clothes finer praise and the finest food 
some but not all 
as the guests preened for last years oscar presentations 
actors ron silver susan sarandon alec baldwin christopher reeve 
and jennifer beales had more serious business at hand 
they are members of an advocacy group called the creative 
coalition and spent all day with new york gov mario cuomo and 
state legislators pushing environmental legislation and sounding 
the alarm of global warming 
in addition to the creative coalition a growing group of 
entertainment figures are cashiering their fame for good works 
performing at benefits and actually embracing causes as if their 
careers and sometimes their lives depended on it 
while the stereotype of the ineffectual celebrity dogooder 
persists these performers writers directors and executives 
endeavor to be both dedicated and knowledgeable 
this is five days a week of two people working regular 
hours says robert foxworth the former falcon crest star who 
along with assistant bobbi murray produces a weekly issueoriented 
radio show with his own money 
ed begley jr st elsewhere is one of hollywoods most 
dedicated activists frequently sacrificing his time and creature 
comforts for energy conservation 
living in a home illuminated by lowenergy 15watt light bulbs 
and commuting to work by bus bicycle or electric car begleys 
lifestyle strives to be as environmentally conscientious as 
possible 
in november begley was named chairman of an advisory committee 
to the southern california rapid transit district which runs the 
citys bus system and is building a massive subway network 
mr begleys commitment to public transit as well as his 
involvement in environmental issues will provide strong 
leadership says rtd board president nick patsaouras 
most actors and actresses say when it comes to choosing between 
their careers and their causes employment comes first without 
work these activists have neither a platform nor money to pledge 
what separates real activists from fairweather warriors is the 
level of sacrifice 
foxworths american dialogues program for example is 
supported entirely by foxworths earnings and falcon crest 
savings 
the 5yearold show heard in 75 cities has foxworth 
interviewing experts in a spectrum of social issues from the war 
on drugs to campaign finances to central american politics 
its always been a frustration to some extent that the work in 
film television and theater hasnt been able to be more focused on 
issues says foxworth sitting in a recording studio built over 
his garage we have our podium our pedestal is to some extent 
our career it provides some access to people 
silver who was one of the founders of the nonpartisan creative 
coalition says entertainers have a duty to charity 
i think theres almost an obligation says silver the 
costar of the film reversal of fortune many of us are very 
well compensated for work which a lot of people would love to do 
and we also have a lot of leisure time in between jobs 
the more visible members of our group use their access and 
utilize their attentiongetting abilities to bring a lot of issues 
to the publics attention silver says 
the 250 show business professionals in the new yorkbased group 
lobby local and national politicians about issues such as the 
environment freedom of expression abortion rights and the 
homeless 
they say that hollywood is sex without substance and 
washington politics is substance without sex so maybe the marriage 
of the two is mutually intriguing silver says 
there are more than a few celebrities who have become almost as 
wellknown for the causes they support as for the parts they play 
jane fondas acting career has been tinged by her activism 
during the vietnam war when she appeared on radio hanoi and begged 
american soldiers to stop bombing to some she is as much hanoi 
jane as she is the star of 1981s on golden pond or 1989s 
stanley and iris 
during filming of the latter in 1988 a waterbury conn 
veterans helped circulate bumper stickers that read im not 
fonda hanoi jane 
im a good scapegoat miss fonda said in an interview not 
long ago i can be painted into an image which causes a lot of 
hostility i may not be that person but thats irrelevant 
charlton heston ben hur donates time to the national rifle 
association and lobbies against government funding for explicit 
art mike farrell mash is recognized as one of the 
nation strongest voices for civil rights singer jackson browne 
whose concerts are loaded with plugs for causes said that some 
fans have taken to yelling just sing

equal protection 
roy scheider jaws who appeared in home box offices 
deathrow drama somebody has to shoot the picture hosted an 
antideath penalty screening of the film its a barbaric custom 
and it doesnt work scheider says 
the compact disc for rock star phil collins new album serious 
hitslive is packaged in recycled cardboard it bears the 
message car pool when possible tune up your car regularly and 
keep your tires inflated to the recommended pressure these steps 
will conserve energy and reduce air pollution 
not bad but musicians peter gabriel and raffi are insisting 
that their cds be issued in no cardboard packaging at all saving 
even more trees 
rock star chrissie hynde of the pretenders is an activist for 
people for the ethical treatment of animals she spent one recent 
morning disrupting hunters as they stalked game in a maryland corn 
field the animalrights group whose other celebrity members 
include kd lang river phoenix and jane wiedlin opposes hunting 
the fur industry and using animals for laboratory testing 
even sincere hollywood activists dance in dangerous territory 
the preposterous tv advertising line im not a doctor but i 
play one on television still points up the basic ambiguity of 
celebrity endorsements just because somebodys on camera why 
should we think they know anything

for new jersey gov james florio a heckler shouted go back to 
hollywood 
in one recent debacle angela lansbury of cbs murder she

miss lansburys commercials which failed a state requirement to 
identify their sponsors were later proved inaccurate the actress 
son and agent conceded that his mother was misinformed she 
doesnt really read newspapers said son david shaw 
foxworth on the other hand reads newspapers included 
despite the heckling of miss sarandon silver says his coalition 
tries to protect its members from ridicule 
what we insist upon in the creative coalition and i think it 
makes us a little different from a couple of other groups is that 
were very concerned about informing ourselves and articulating the 
issues so that when we go out we really know what were talking 
about silver says 
comic relief is an annual comedy concert held in los angeles to 
raise money for the homeless yet principal participants robin 
williams billy crystal and whoopi goldberg are more than hosts for 
the show says comic relief founder and president bob zmuda 
theyve taken on comic relief as their main charity zmuda 
says they write the show they promote the show and they spend a 
lot of time visiting homeless shelters 
a number of serious activists say there will always be some 
people who join a cause not to bring peace to el salvador or fight 
poverty in the inner city but to meet people and get jobs 
a lot of people pretend to be involved when theyre not

superstars by now including myself miss paul says 
daniel sladek who in addition to his frantic job as a

editors note for more than three decades before it closed 
the cotter corp mill in colorado processed uranium for nuclear 
power plants it has been cited nearly 100 times by both state and 
federal officials for allegedly polluting the mill site and the 
surrounding area now residents of one neighborhood near the mill 
have gone to court with a 550 million lawsuit

sitting in the calicocovered swing on 
their back porch watching their horse trot around her pen near the 
red barn nard and sara claar seem to be living the american dream 
fruit trees and flowers cover their acre of land and not far 
away are the rocky mountains cold streams and deep forests 
sara 38 grew up here in the lincoln park subdivision on the 
edge of canon city a city of 13000 in southern colorado she and 
nard 40 never gave much thought to the cotter corp uranium mill 
less than two miles from their home 
cotter was considered a solid citizen next to the state prison 
system and its halfdozen facilities the mill was canon citys 
largest employer in its heyday the mill owned by chicagobased 
commonwealth edison employed 250 people and processed 1200 tons 
of rock a day 
that was before sarah became ill and 13 people on their block 
were diagnosed as having cancer or had died of it 
now the claars and many of the nearly 400 people who live in 
lincoln park think their neighborhood has been contaminated by 
cotters uranium processing 
we just thought this was a natural occurrence everybody knew 
somebody who died of cancer says sara who only recently became 
able to work around her home after being bedridden 18 months with 
immune deficiency problems four members of her family have cancer 
but now the claars and their neighbors believe cotter whose 
mill here is listed as a superfund cleanup site by the 
environmental protection agency is the culprit they note that in 
its 32 years the cotter mill has been cited nearly 100 times by 
both state and federal officials for allegedly polluting the mill 
site and surrounding areas 
the uranium mill has been closed since 1987 because its product 
uranium concentrate called yellowcake for nuclear power 
plants is no longer in demand no date has been set for 
operations to resume 
the mill crushed ground and leached uranium with acid to 
convert it to yellowcake dumping the leftovers into piles next to 
the mill or in ponds used to control dust cotter operated one mill 
at the site from 1958 to 1979 then opened a newer bigger one 
nearby because of growing demand for their product 
the mill site also wound up as the repository of 250 kilograms 
of radioactive leftovers from the first atomic bomb called the 
st louis airport cakes because thats where the tailings were 
stored initially cotter purchased the cakes in 1968 and shipped 
the radioactive residue which contained the rare cancercausing 
radioactive isotope thorium230 to canon city in open railroad 
cars 
cotter processed nearly twothirds of the cakes to extract their 
uranium copper cobalt and nickel the leftovers were dumped into 
a lined holding pond at the mill 
a 1986 state report said there were holes in the pond lining 
that allowed contaminated water to leach into the ground water 
cotters image as a model corporate citizen began to erode when 
traces of radioactive uranium began showing up in well water in 
lincoln park apparently water contaminated with the uranium had 
seeped into the ground water beneath the mill and then had migrated 
to lincoln park airborne uranium dust added to the problem 
about the time cotter was eyeing a bigger operation to take 
advantage of rising uranium prices regulators were starting to 
take a closer look at cotters pollution problems 
the colorado bureau of investigation cited cotter in 1980 for 
repeatedly overexposing its workers to uranium dust and for 
falsifying occupational health data in reports to the state health 
department the same year the health department accused cotter of 
23 violations of its state radioactive materials license 
the nuclear regulatory commission in january 1981 recommended 
that several lincoln park residents stop using well water for 
irrigation and their livestock because of possible contamination 
from the cotter mill 
in march 1986 a study commissioned by the state and done by 
geotransrocky mountain consultants inc found that mining and 
milling activities at cotter had seriously contaminated the 
surrounding area 
in august 1988 the state sent a letter to fremont county 
officials saying lincoln park residents face a potential health 
risk because of contamination from the cotter mill

cotter today is cleaning up the mill site as part of an 11 
million environmental damage settlement reached in 1988 with the 
state of colorado 
phil stoffey the onsite cleanup coordinator for the state 
health departments radiation control division estimates it will 
take cotter 20 years to clean up the site under the remedial action 
plan 
the company also faces a major lawsuit filed by lincoln park 
residents in august 1989 their anger over what they believe is a 
high cancer rate and over cotters pollution problems spilled over 
into a 550 million lawsuit filed in federal court in denver the 
lawsuit claims uranium waste from the mill polluted the ground 
water and was carried on the wind causing damage to residents 
health and property 
nard claar thinks cotter was given too much leeway in how much 
uranium waste it could discharge into the air 30 tons per year 
what happens to that it blows over my house and my neighbors 
house he says to my knowledge the cotter corp didnt use us 
as guinea pigs but with 30 tons of uranium being allowed there 
was a radioactive cloud over this valley 
the state cancer register does not show an aboveaverage 
incidence of the disease among fremont county residents and the 
state does not keep data on individual cities or neighborhoods 
state health officials say it is difficult to assess the cancer 
risk from exposure to cotters uranium mill wastes 
its longrange and lowlevel says ken weaver of the 
radiation control division were not talking about the kind of 
radioactivity where spending a few hours or days in front of 
the uranium pile will cause cancer its the longrange longterm 
effects on health 
a 1981 federal study found evidence of kidney damage in 29 men 
who worked at cotter and a 1987 attorney generals report said 
lincoln park residents are receptors at risk if they drink 
contaminated water eat food irrigated with contaminated water or 
grown in contaminated soil or inhale dust or radon from mill 
sources 
the state in 1988 issued a warning that said lincoln park 
residents face a potential health risk by drinking water 
contaminated by the mill many lincoln park residents got their 
water from wells whose water later was found to be contaminated 
with uranium and molybdenum a byproduct of uranium processing 
while lincoln park residents press their concerns in court 
opinion is more divided among other canon city residents 
everybody living in fremont county is not cowering and 
concerned that they will get cancer says pat sherwood executive 
director of the canon city chamber of commerce she says the media 
have implied that the entire community is concerned about becoming 
ill and its just not true 
jack rothfleisch the cotter mill manager who is supervising the 
site cleanup does not think the cancer rate is any higher in 
lincoln park than anyplace else 
i think those people would have cancer if they were in the 
middle of nebraska too he says as far as im concerned i 
dont think anybody has been harmed in any way by the exposure to 
what weve done out here 
cotter officials would not discuss the lawsuit but they were 
willing to speak about the companys special relationship with 
canon city 
the relationship of the cotter corp with the community has 
been a close enduring one in which the company and the community 
have shared in some good times and some bad times says joe 
mccluskey cotter vice president and general manager of the 
companys lakewood office 
the company and its employees have always appreciated the 
support of the community and likewise the community has enjoyed 
the support of the cotter corp over many years 
meanwhile sara claar is seeking treatment in denver for her 
undiagnosed illness nard and sara say one of their greatest 
frustrations is not knowing what they face 
i cannot say that cotter made me sick mrs claar says 
but id like to know what did weve never been able to get a 
definite answer now at least theyre testing

editors note there is a fascination for some usually the 
doers of crossword puzzles and fans of trivial pursuit in trifling 
information here is a book of facts great and small distilled 
from millions of questions asked of the new york public library by 
people who cant take dont know for an answer

in 1857 elisha g otis invented the passenger 
elevator fifteen years after that william lebaron jenny designed 
the first skyscraper a 10story structure 
naturally someone had to invent the elevator before someone 
could build a skyscraper but the same year that gave us the 
skyscraper gave us the commercial electric fan cool 
if these seemingly distended historical tidbits attract you 
then leaf through the new york public librarys desk reference a 
book full of surprises it is based on the more than 5 million 
questions the library and its 82 branches answer each year 
vartan gregorian former president and chief executive officer 
of the library writes in his preface unlike annuals and 
almanacs that need revising and updating each year the desk 
reference stonesong press 3495 holds a considerable amount of 
true reference information unchanging basic facts and background 
we also hope that our book will be easy to read and fun to 
browse through 
it is 
for instance if you know that thomas alva edison invented the 
phonograph in 1878 you will be pleased to know that lo colvin 
invented the milking machine the same year and james j ritty 
invented the cash register the year after that 
these were heady times a veritable cascade of brainstorms but 
read further every year was like that 
for instance last year was the 110th birthday of the hearing 
aid and the 120th for linoleum and the snap button it was also 
the 100th anniversary of motion pictures and the electric subway 
it was the 90th anniversary of the paper clip 
this year is the 100th birthday of the flashlight by englands 
bristol electric lamp co the aluminum boat by switzerlands 
escher wyss amp co and the zipper by whitcombe l judson so much 
for the snap button 
the desk reference has less esoteric fare it tells you how to 
write your congressman how to call tollfree for rental cars and 
hotels there are 15 pages of visa requirements to travel anywhere 
from afghanistan to zimbabwe 
there is an illustrated section on the human anatomy and how to 
play board games from backgammon to scrabble or cards from 
blackjack to solitaire 
there is simply no way to list all of the tidy bits of 
information from dietary tables to musical terms and symbols from 
extinct animals to semaphore from etiquette to legal forms from 
animal first aid to a directory of poison control centers 
more than an almanac or a book of world records it is a settler 
of arguments take religion the book says there are 648 million 
hindus 18 million jews 840 million muslims 158 million orthodox 
catholics 307 million buddhists and 56 million followers of 
confucius 
in the united states there are 31 million baptists 27 million 
episcopalians 135 million methodists 28 million mormons 8 
million lutherans 700000 jehovahs witnesses 
but worldwide there are 900 million roman catholics the largest 
christian church in the world it takes 6 pages to list all the 
popes 
it takes only a line to inform you that mary phelps jacob 
invented the brassiere in 1914 
one thing that strikes the reader is how long ago some of the 
inventions sprang from the human mind another is what in the 
world did mankind do before they came along 
a third is that with so many minds at work progress is 
inevitable 
we were blessed with the screwdriver and wrench about 1550 by 
unknown gunsmiths

editors note not all park rangers roam the wilds keeping a 
lookout for forest fires and wayward bears at independence hall in 
philadelphia the rangers of the national park service are more like 
classroom teachers than caretakers of nature and theyd better 
know their history

national park service rangers at 
independence hall still remember the woman who insisted on seeing 
the statue of liberty 
people really do think of philadelphia as the cradle of 
liberty and some visitors think its all here says ranger larry 
mcclennie this lady insisted that the statue was here somewhere 
she wanted directions to find it and go 100 miles north and turn 
right wasnt what she wanted 
even if the no 1 question is wheres the bathroom the 
rangers who show off the liberty bell and independence hall need to 
be ready to answer all kinds of questions from some 14 million 
visitors a year 
i probably learned more history here than i ever could have 
imagined says scott dawson whos worked two seasonal stints at 
the park 
a question that comes up a lot is how the bell cracked after it 
rang for years in the statehouse tower to announce important events 
such as the signing of the declaration of independence 
cracks in bells were fairly common in those days mcclennie 
explains they were repaired and put back in service as the 
liberty bell was but it cracked again and wasnt used after 
that 
the park which encompasses nearly two dozen buildings that 
figured in the birth of the united states as a nation has a guide 
staff of 40 rangers 70 in the peak months from april through 
september 
wouldbe rangers go through a week of intensive training 
according to barbara pollarine director of interpretation they 
learn about three themes the american revolution benjamin 
franklin and philadelphia as the national capital 
after a day of lectures and exercises the rangerstudents 
tackle a long reading list 
there are standard texts such as miracle at philadelphia by 
catherine drinker bowen another is the liberty bell the 
venerable relic by former park historian dave kimball 
rangers are also encouraged to do research in the libraries of 
the pennsylvania historical society the american philosophical 
society and the park itself resources not available anywhere else 
by the end of their first week each new ranger is expected to 
deliver a brief presentation prepared for the public 
the trainees learn the basic history of the buildings but when 
they speak to the public as rangers they add their own flair to 
the presentation to make it interesting to the visitors says david 
dutcher chief historian of the park 
when dawson leads a tour of independence hall he explains that 
so much of the interior is green because it was the cheapest dye in 
the 18th century 
then he points out his uniform green and wonders whether the 
government is still as cheap as it used to be 
other rangers tell of the haunted second floor of congress hall 
the ghost of french queen marie antoinette supposedly lurks there 
no one knows how the story got started but king louis xvi of 
france did donate a painting of his wife to congress and the 
painting was lost in the move to washington a reproduction of the 
painting now hangs in congress hall in philadelphia 
as popular as this park is with the public its the biggest 
tourist attraction in pennsylvania many rangers consider it only 
an entrylevel job unlike in many other big organizations the 
staff yearns for transfers out of the big city to the boondocks 
the kind of person who wants to work for the national park 
service doesnt exactly envision working in downtown 
philadelphia pollarine says after a year here many of them 
are looking for someplace else to work 
rangers are just like other people says ranger steve 
perlman when they think of the national parks they think of 
yellowstone 
besides hearing the call of the wild park rangers here have to 
deal with the cost of living in the city a starting park rangers 
salary is about 17000 a year 
while many park service trainees come out of college an 
increasing number are retired from teaching or military service 
a lot of people you meet here are academically very well 
trained pollarine says 
philadelphia ranks as a good place for rangers to prove 
themselves on busy days tours are given every 15 minutes at 
independence hall with 85 people going through the building at a 
time dutcher says 
on the average day we get about 2000 to 3000 people says 
ranger bill kashatus on peak days in may its not unusual for 
8000 schoolchildren to visit the liberty bell 
the training continues after the rangers go on duty every other 
week the park has a 45minute session focusing on a special topic 
because the bill of rights will be a hot topic in 1991 its 
bicentennial year the rangers will soon hear a speaker on james 
madison who drafted the documents 
we never feel that we have all the information that we need 
mcclennie says its a neverending course of study 
the rewards may not be tangible but they are here 
not to be corny about it but this is a very special place 
pollarine says its very important to a lot of people ive seen 
people cry during tours

editors note heres an eagle whose picture could be on a 
postage stamp as a proud symbol of america but this one went bad 
born in captivity and then released in the wild he started doing 
things eagles are not supposed to do raiding barnyards but in the 
land of the free hell get a second chance

a young bald eagle that turned chicken 
thief after he was released in the wild is back in the slammer 
state ornithologist jim d wilson has recommended a short stay 
behind bars for the wayward eagle but plans to give him a second 
chance at freedom 
the eagle nicknamed e was released at the schellosage 
wildlife area in westcentral missouri in july as part of a 
department of conservation program to reestablish a breeding 
population of eagles in the state 
seventyfour young bald eagles were raised in artificial nests 
with only minimal human contact and released into the wilds of 
missouri under a 10year program which just ended 
e which came from a wild nest in wisconsin began doing 
uneaglelike things after he or she its difficult to determine 
the sex of an eagle arrived in missouri 
although most eagles shy away from humans e didnt mind at 
all that a daviess county farm family was watching in amazement as 
he repeatedly killed and ate their tame ducks 
wildlife officials thought the bird had only momentarily 
deviated from its normal diet consisting mainly of rodents so 
they recaptured the eagle and released it again about 75 miles away 
at the squaw creek wildlife refuge in northwestern missouri 
however e turned up in late august in southern iowa eating 
dead baby pigs at another farm the young eagle was captured again 
and returned to squaw creek only to be caught redhanded a few 
days later eating a chicken in a farmers chicken house in atchison 
county 
this time e was rounded up and transferred to the dickerson 
park zoo in springfield which specializes in the care of injured 
eagles and other birds of prey 
bald eagles winter around major lakes and rivers in missouri by 
the hundreds and wilson plans to release e near his cousins in 
february in hopes he will learn proper eagle behavior 
what apparently happened to this bird is it somehow found out 
that farmyards were a place you could find some easy pickins 
wilson says 
id like to give it one more try ill release it with another 
flock of eagles at a wildlife area where it wont come in contact 
with humans very easily and where there is an abundant natural food 
supply 
if it doesnt adapt to the wild it will be a zoo bird i 
dont really want that nobody does there are plenty of zoo 
eagles 
of the 74 eagles the conservation department has released in the 
state only one other bird behaved in a similar fashion wilson 
says that eagle ended up getting killed by a truck in kansas while 
eating an animal killed in the road which is also uncharacteristic 
of eagles 
overall the conservation departments efforts to get eagles to 
nest again in missouri are showing signs of paying off wilson 
says three pairs nested successfully near the mingo national 
wildlife refuge in southeastern missouri this year and another 
pair nested at an undisclosed location in central missouri 
the eagles are equipped with colored wing tags more than 40 of 
the eagles released at the mingo and schellosage wildlife areas 
have been observed in surrounding states and as far away as texas 
and colorado 
it takes about five years before eagles are mature and ready to 
nest 
they are similar to salmon in that they should return to where 
they were raised to raise their own young wilson says 
eagles began disappearing in the state as large numbers of 
settlers moved in around the turn of the century 
ironically habitat may be better for eagles in missouri now 
than ever before 
for one thing the eagle is now protected by law and people 
know it so theres less disturbance of them wilson says in 
addition eagles are water birds and like our abundant 
reservoirs

in the tv series dark shadows 
producerdirector dan curtis faced the problem of how to make a 
vampire a romantic figure 
how do you do that well he made his character barnabas 
collins a reluctant vampire one whos trying to kick the habit 
this vampire is no dracula nor is he a stephen king or anne 
rice ghoul 
barnabas is a classic romantic figure who is seeking the lost 
love from 200 years ago that he can never regain curtis says 
he hates his existence as a vampire which is a spell put upon 
him by a witch hes a great dark brooding romantic figure 
a revival of dark shadows which became a gothic cult soap 
opera in the 1960s begins with a fourhour twopart miniseries 
sunday and monday on nbc on friday it begins as a onehour series 
following quantum leap 
its curtis first project since the winds of war and war 
and remembrance 
i cant tell you exactly what made it work curtis says i 
can tell you what the show is as opposed to what people think it 
is its not horror its a romantic fantasy i think what makes it 
work are the mythical elements 
curtis gleefully concedes that dark shadows an abc 
afternoon soap opera from 196671 was inspired by wuthering 
heights jane eyre rebecca and other gothic stories 
in the beginning dark shadows was merely gothic and about 
to get the ax from abc 
we were about to go off the air when my kids suggested i make 
it scary he says i introduced a ghost into the show and the 
moment the ghost appeared on the screen the ratings went up 
instantly i then came up with a supernatural story and the ratings 
went even higher i decided to see how far i could go 
i figured if i could get away with a vampire i could get away 
with anything i was planning to kill him off but barnabas caught 
on he was a sensation the question was how to make a hero out of 
a vampire so we made him a reluctant vampire that was it 
in the new version of dark shadows barnabas collins is 
played by ben cross jean simmons is the matriarch of collinwood 
an isolated new england manor house joanna going is the beautiful 
young governess a reincarnation of barnabas 200yearold love 
and barbara steele is a doctor who tries to cure barnabas and falls 
in love with him 
curtis says the story is virtually the same as it was 25 years 
ago but there are substantial changes in the production values 
many people have a memory of the show he says im not 
making the show the way it was but the way they remember it it was 
a halfhour before our budget for five shows a week was about 
90000 were spending around 12 million a show today 
people have an exaggerated memory of the show im sure they 
thought the great hall at collinwood was a great hall it was a 
very very small hall the new great hall is enormous we filmed a 
lot of it at the greystone mansion in beverly hills 
curtis was not eager to return to dark shadows but nbc 
began pursuing him while he was still working on war and 
remembrance 
i didnt choose to go back he says nbc came to me im 
getting some laughs out of it but its not like its close to my 
heart and i bring all my emotions to it i cant believe im doing 
this when i was doing the original show i would have killed to get 
out of it it was like i was in jail 
curtis spent the 1980s on the two monumental miniseries based on 
herman wouks books about world war ii before that he was best 
known for horror films such as the night stalker dracula 
the turn of the screw frankenstein the picture of 
dorian gray and burnt offerings 
currently in the works are a third night stalker movie and a 
third movie about his childhood remembrances dean jones who 
played a character based on curtis father in when every day was 
the fourth of july and the long days of summer will star in 
the new film curtis is also writing several feature movies 
its been tough adjusting after so much time on the two 
miniseries he says id like to go back to war and 
remembrance id like to be ready to board a plane tomorrow

onstage in buddy on broadway paul hipp 
looks like the earnest young rock n roller he portrays buddy 
holly offstage he comes across more like the brashly flippant 
facetious early beatles 
in his manhattan apartment which he shares with a west highland 
terrier named dylan he ignores a visitor who walks in while hes 
listening intently to a stevie ray vaughan record 
then he looks up to say incongruously im obsessed with van 
gogh i like vincent i was fantasizing about cutting my ear off 
the other day but itd take longer to do the makeup now all i have 
to do is put base on and eyeliner 
hipp 25 who has a rock band of his own was born six years 
after buddy holly died at age 22 and seven years before don mclean 
wrote american pie about the plane crash that killed him 
but he identifies with holly in the way he stuck with his own 
sound and his own music and he was a nice guy 
hipp took up guitar at 12 and has studied both music and acting 
until buddy he hasnt been famous though hed like to be 
with parallel careers i see no reason why it has got to be actor 
or musician he says i came up doing both its not like im a 
rock n roller slumming on broadway 
one of my main things i want to do is bridge the gap that 
hasnt been bridged yet and have a serious career songwriting and 
acting sting hasnt done it or david bowie kris kristofferson is 
more country music 
paul hipp and the heroes havent cut any records yet but hes 
talking to record companies now his acting in new york previously 
hasnt been broadway or offbroadway but offoffoffoff 
i did a lot of plays nobody came to see he says this is 
a nice change of pace for me its a wonderful thing to look out 
and theres people sitting out there 
people in the shubert theater mezzanine and balcony are warned 
that dancing and standing during the performance are prohibited 
but hipp can see them dancing in the orchestra sections first few 
rows 
if theres a pretty girl up front i can throw her a guitar 
pick he says then i have the crew go get her when i come off 
stage the dressing room is filled with a bevy of beauties the 
next stop is the hot tub 
despite the fact that hes starring in a musical hipp says i 
hate musicals all that show business people dancing aint my 
thing 
hipps 20thfloor apartment on central park south is his first 
new york apartment he says for nine years i couldnt afford 
one i lived wherever there was a couch thats how buddy holly has 
changed my life 
when he auditioned for buddy in england where he played the 
role for nine months he thinks he was chosen primarily for his 
acting ability but im sure the fact i can play guitar didnt 
hurt 
hipp was nominated for a laurence olivier award which was won 
by jonathan pryce in miss saigon i thought it was fixed 
he says i dont know it is fine to be nominated it beats 
playing bleeker street in greenwich village for 50 bucks a 
night 
in buddy hipp plays guitar and sings more than 20 buddy 
holly songs including thatll be the day peggy sue and 
oh boy he did a lot of research on the innovative pioneer 
rocker from lubbock texas before he began portraying him 
the show covers him from 19 to 22 hipp says he had the 
natural growth any kid goes through add rock n roll stardom it 
gets quite complicated to internalize what had happened to him 
maintain that innocence and grow gradually was difficult 
i met a lot of people who saw him on his last tour bob dylan 
saw him three days before he died when he went through 
minnesota 
act 2 of buddy recreates buddy hollys last concert in 
clear lake iowa with dion and the belmonts the big bopper and 
ritchie valens the latter two died on the plane with holly later 
that night 
i wouldnt imagine anyone taped that show hipp says i 
would have run into them by now the buddy holly society knows more 
about the crickets hollys band than the crickets know about 
themselves 
hollys widow who had a miscarriage after his death saw 
buddy in london and has been supportive hipp says 
hipp is the fourth of five children and uses his real name he 
moved to new york from philadelphia right after graduating from 
high school the bell rang i was here 
i thought about changing my name to rock dashing he says 
i want to work on a soap opera really bad i want to be dr 
dashing have my teeth capped plastic surgery a square jaw blond 
hair and blue contacts 
hipp played a lower east side punk in china girl during the 
filming he wrote the song midnight for you the director 
liked it and put it in hipp says hipp and the heroes played it 
during the interview hipp strums on his guitar which is 
autographed by johnny and june cash duane eddy two crickets and 
mrs holly 
after buddy and after his band cuts a record hipp hopes to 
make a movie 
it wont be music he says there wont be a guitar in 
sight

one by one diana lumbrera buried each of 
her six children weeping and fainting as the tiny bodies were 
lowered into the ground begging on her knees for her little ones 
to come back 
each of the children died before his or her fifth birthday and 
doctors ascribed each death to natural causes diana lumbrera knew 
better than that she had been cursed by her former motherinlaw 
she said 
but now authorities say the childrens deaths were neither 
natural nor supernatural they say that diana lumbrera 32 killed 
her kids 
she has been convicted of killing one 4yearold son she faces 
charges that she killed three daughters a son and the daughter of 
a cousin authorities are investigating the death of another son 
still her friends and family insist that a terrible mistake is 
being made 
she was a loving mother and she took care of those children 
said her aunt elodia flores she worked hard every day and made 
those children number one in her life i just dont believe she 
killed those children 
 
joanna garza age 3 months died nov 30 1976 the cause of 
death strangulation due to asphyxiation due to convulsive 
disorder 
jose lionel garza 2 months died feb 13 1978 the cause of 
death is listed as undetermined 
melissa garza 3 died oct 2 1978 the cause asphyxia due 
to aspiration of stomach contents 
erica aleman ms lumbreras 6weekold cousin died oct 8 
1980 medical records are missing 
melinda ann garza 2 died aug 17 1982 the cause is listed as 
heart failure due to increased taxation on a case of congenital 
heart disease 
christopher daniel lumbrera 5 months died march 28 1984 of 
what doctors said was septicemia a fatal infection of the blood 
jose antonio lumbrera 4 died may 1 1990 the cause of death 
was listed as asphyxia due to smothering 
 
for 14 years as ms lumbreras children died one after another 
law enforcement authorities in texas suspected nothing the death 
certificates gave them no reason to be suspicious 
then authorities in garden city kans where ms lumbrera had 
moved were handed a murder case doctors there attributed jose 
antonios death to smothering and a jury agreed in october taking 
just 3 hours to convict ms lumbrera of murder she was sentenced 
to life in prison 
the kansas charges prompted a massive investigation into the 
other deaths resulting in the five murder indictments in three 
west texas counties 
a death certificate may say death due to heart failure 
everyone who dies suffers from heart failure said parmer county 
district attorney johnny actkinson who will prosecute ms lumbrera 
in an upcoming trial 
the question is what caused the heart failure 
actkinson says there was no coverup instead he suggested that 
those who issued the death reports probably did not want to think 
the worst 
those kids deaths were such a horrible state of affairs that 
no one considered a mother would murder her own children so the 
doctors look for another way to explain it i am not being 
critical its just human nature 
lionel garza ms lumbreras second husband and father of four 
of the dead children says he was shocked by her conviction in jose 
antonios death 
all my life i lived thinking my kids died of natural causes 
now all the doors of question are open and the pain is rushing back 
in he said 
still garza who filed for divorce from ms lumbrera in 1980 
two years after their third childs death apparently harbored 
suspicions about his wife according to authorities acquainted with 
his grand jury testimony 
lionel was suspicious of diana after the third death said 
bovina police chief gary coleman especially since he said he was 
playing with the child melissa garza early that morning before 
going to work 
he said the child was healthy and he didnt detect anything 
wrong thirty minutes after he arrives at work hes called and 
told the child has died 
garza said the allegations against his wife gave me a lot of 
anger but now i just want the truth i want to know if she killed 
my babies 
 
virginia bribiesca ms lumbreras sister says she was there 
when garzas mother cursed her telling ms lumbrera her children 
would die at their mothers hands i heard the woman say it 
she says 
garza denies it ever happened his wife never said anything to 
me about the children being cursed by my mother he said 
parmer county deputy sheriff richard bonham who helped lead the 
investigation into the deaths of ms lumbreras children in texas 
says the witchcraft argument is irrelevant in our investigation 
that holds no water for defense of what she has done 
but those who know ms lumbrera a frail former meatpacker 
say there is no doubt that she believes in the supernatural 
maria antillon a close friend said the defendant is 
highstrung emotional and frequently talked about her fervent 
belief in spiritual healers and curanderos fortune tellers or 
witchcraft doctors prevalent in hispanic culture who have the power 
to bless or curse a persons life 
she told me several times about witchcraft and things she 
believed in like curses and things like that said mrs antillon 
she used to tell me that she felt her motherinlaw had cursed 
her she said if you believe in the curanderos they will get to 
you if you dont they wont 
mrs antillon is one of ms lumbreras defenders 
diana went to church every sunday when she lived here she 
said everybody liked her she wasnt the type of person that 
would get in trouble with a neighbor i never heard that she had 
gotten into an argument with someone else and she loved her 
kids 
her aunt elva hernandez notes that ms lumbrera suffered from 
polio when she was a child diana was often sick when she was 
young how can they just disregard that the kids could have died 
because of sickness 
other friends and family members are suspicious of authorities 
motives in pressing the case robert olvera 33 ms lumbreras 
cousin says the police have actively pursued the case because the 
defendant is hispanic 
you think this would happen to a diana if she was white no 
way absolutely not olvera said 
the police are just looking for publicity if you ask me he 
said that is the only way you can explain all this coming out so 
many years later the doctors ruled the children died of natural 
causes 
ms bribiesca fears the kansas conviction will doom her sister 
in texas 
she didnt get a fair trial in garden city said ms 
bribiesca who resides in kansas before this i think she could 
have gotten one in texas but not now not after this theyre 
going to think she killed all her kids but dianas not going to 
give up ill tell you that 
 
in late january ms lumbrera faces trial on murder charges in 
parmer county in the deaths of joanna melissa and melinda the 
grand jury said she smothered the three children to collect 15000 
in life insurance benefits 
she also faces separate trials in lubbock and bailey counties in 
the deaths of jose lionel and erica aleman an investigation into 
the death of christopher lumbrera continues if she is convicted in 
any case she could face either life in prison or the death 
penalty administered by lethal injection 
gordon green ms lumbreras lawyer would not allow her to be 
interviewed 
its not an everyday case said green refusing to comment 
further 
ms lumbrera is being held in the parmer county jail on 300000 
bond fifteen miles away at the bovina cemetery elaborate 
headstones stand over the graves of five of ms lumbreras 
children 
each bears the same epitaph darling we miss thee

the soldier stood at the memorial marked with the 
names of vietnams valleys of death khe sanh and con thien hue 
and quang tri an loc and xuan loc 
then nguyen ngoc hung lighted a dozen incense sticks and 
silently faced his fallen american foes memorialized in the stone 
of the dorchester vietnam veterans memorial hain gormley 
rabinovitz kelly burt husbands sons brothers seventyeight of 
them 
i said to those men who have died during the war please lay 
in peace the war is over now and ive come a long way for 
reconciliation 
hung a north vietnamese combat veteran had come half way 
around the world for solemn ceremonies such as this one and to 
drink beer and feast on lasagna and meatballs with his former war 
adversaries 
fifteen years after its end in 1975 american veterans of the 
vietnam war are shaking hands with the nameless faceless foes like 
hung whom they fought as young men in the jungles of southeast 
asia 
they fought on different sides but now share the common bond of 
duty to country and the inescapable events of history that first 
brought them together 
and they hope the healing of wounds among the warriors 
themselves will nudge the us government into diplomatic 
recognition of its former enemy financial aid and the lifting of a 
trade embargo that is strangling vietnams bankrupt economy 
as a new generation of us combat forces maintains its war 
readiness in the explosive middle east many of the boys of vietnam 
are finally standing down from a war that has seemed hauntingly 
unreal to them 
many are going back to vietnam in their middle years 
sentimental and mellowed by time needing to retrace the old 
battlefields that brought them of age they gather to share the 
pain of war and to heal its stings with understanding 
and they go with their arms outstretched with hammers to build 
and medicine to heal instead of rifles to kill 
there comes a time for healing and i think this is the time 
said mary stout a combat nurse during the war who revisited 
vietnam two years ago i think the people who start it have to be 
the veterans they understand what wars about and have a common 
bond it comes from serving your country 
hoping to win diplomatic recognition the vietnamese government 
allowed hung a 42yearold college english teacher who earns 10 a 
month to tour 11 us cities during six weeks in november and 
december 
the cities were washington philadelphia new york madison 
wis san francisco santa cruz calif los angeles new haven 
conn boston pittsburgh and atlanta 
while scores of americans have been back to vietnam in recent 
years to help that countrys disabled veterans who languish in 
poverty and menial jobs hung was the first vietnam combat veteran 
to visit the united states 
he was invited by the asia resource center and the national 
network of indochina activists a loose network of people who 
support recognition of vietnam and trade with that country 
i think mr hung was here at the auspices of the vietnamese 
government to try to begin to take steps toward reconciliation with 
our country said ms stout president of the 40000 member 
vietnam veterans of america in washington who met with him 
while the vva does not yet fully support diplomatic relations 
with vietnam it has encouraged the beginning of steps toward that 
goal with the establishment of a small diplomatic office in 
vietnam rather than a fullfledged embassy 
some veterans say the united states should hold out until 
americans missing in action are accounted for and there is 
assurance that vietnam is holding no prisoners others feel the 
miapow issue cannot be resolved without first establishing 
diplomatic relations 
hung said the united states was not what he expected 
i have learned a lot here he said it changed some of the 
images about america and american people in the past we thought 
that american soldiers were professionals they were trained to 
kill and they would kill like in the my lai massacre 
what hung found were americans who welcomed him into their 
homes drank beer with him laughed with him and shared war 
stories americans who were just like him who had the same fears 
and joys whose lives were interrupted by a war that was not 
necessarily of their choosing 
i see they are just like me hung said they suffered 
enormously because of the killing so we are just human beings the 
victims of the war 
one recent evening hung and american veterans who had earlier 
returned to vietnam gathered in the home of a boston police 
sergeant who fought in the same region as hung they talked about 
how vietnamese and americans had suffered 
after the war i came back rifle in my hand said hung 
and when i looked at what the war had done to my country very 
very sad a million and a half or 2 million people have died the 
forests have been destroyed or defoliated and we havent been able 
to do very much about it 
nearly 60000 americans died in the vietnam war 300000 more 
were wounded many others are still fighting the war on a different 
battlefield in their minds they suffer from post traumatic 
stress disorder the delayed shock of combat 
weve got a lot of veterans out there who are still in the 
jungles of vietnam gumersindo gomez told hung gomez who fought 
in vietnam in the mid 1960s is now executive director of the 
puerto rican veterans association of massachusetts in springfield 
we are still suffering the consequences here too said 
gomez who worked in a veterans outreach center 
we had nightmares and we had flashbacks and other bad 
things said hung their biggest problem is unemployment he 
said but the vietnamese veterans unlike some of their american 
counterparts were not plunged into alcohol drugs and 
homelessness hung said 
veterans in vietnam were given a very warm welcome home he 
said 
because you won asked veteran paul oconnell 
no replied hung because we were fighting for the 
country 
equals 
editors note special correspondent george esper the aps 
northeast regional reporter based in boston reported from vietnam 
for 10 years from 1965 through the fall of saigon in 1975

vietnam is often seen in retrospect through the 
eyes of americans rarely is it viewed from the vietnamese 
perspective 
but an old american foe former infantryman nguyen ngoc hung 
gave some rare glimpses from the north vietnamese side during a 
recent tour of the united states 
on victory the vietnamese were determined to carry it to the 
end we didnt aim to defeat the americans we fought to drive 
the americans home and in 1973 the americans had to withdraw 
because of the killings but also it was due to the antiwar 
movement in the united states so we didnt actually defeat the 
americans we drove them away 
on the body count in america whenever they fought a battle 
they say ok one american 20 vietnamese killed they won the 
battle they won many battles in vietnam but what was the point 
here it is our country if we lost the war we have no other place 
to go we understood how barbarous the french colonialist system 
was and for many vietnamese we didnt see any difference between 
the war against the french colonialists and the war against the 
americans 
on antiwar demonstrations in the united states the war is 
actually fought not only in vietnam but also in the united states 
it would have been very difficult for the vietnamese to end this 
war without the antiwar movement in the united states because i 
know how strong and how powerful the air force and artillery 
support of the american army and navy were during the war 
comparing the americans to their southern vietnamese allies 
it was difficult to fight against the americans it was not 
difficult to fight the southern vietnamese army because most of 
the soldiers didnt know why they had to fight they were drafted 
from schools and from families and nobody wanted to go to war most 
of the american veterans told me the same story they didnt like 
the southern vietnamese soldiers and they didnt trust them

investigators and auditors in the agriculture 
department are sniffing at commodity programs farm loans and 
dozens of other nuts and bolts that federal workers operate jiggle 
and shift into gear 
the specialists work for the departments office of inspector 
general auditors check on whether money is spent properly and 
investigators look for ways to put people in jail if it isnt 
inspector general leon snead says in his agencys annual plan 
for the fiscal year that began oct 1 that auditors identified 
about 328 million in recoveries and collections last year 
further he said usda managers committed themselves to putting 
4201 million to better use 
investigations resulted in 839 indictments 671 convictions and 
about 388 million in fines restitutions and recoveries during 
the year 
what about 1991 more of the same with auditors looking into 
consumer protection programs such as meat and poultry large 
payments to farmers export credit operations and financial 
management 
snead said his office also will monitor implementation of 
the 1990 farm law this year and will conduct a financial statement 
audit of the farmers home administration 
our investigative priorities include the timely and thorough 
investigation of threats to the health and safety of the public 
employee integrity issues and fraud in the loan regulatory and 
benefit program he said 
the 75page annual report was made available to the associated 
press upon request 
according to the audit blueprint for 1991 there will be further 
looks into operations of various programs operated by the 
departments agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
and its national network of state and county offices 
in fiscal year 1990 we continued to find problems with 
excessive deficiency payments subsidies to producers deliberate 
circumvention of the payment limitation provisions payments for 
ineligible cropland in the conservation reserve program and 
incorrect crop yields and payment rates used to calculate disaster 
payments the report said 
previous audits it added also identified weaknesses in 
producer payment certifications compliance with costsharing 
agreements and other details of the commodity programs 
among the audits of ascs planned for fiscal 1991 are major 
audits of compliance with payment limitation provisions the 1989 
disaster assistance program tobacco program operations claims and 
debt management activities and the 1990 emergency feed program 
the report said 
on the investigative side the report said a significant 
number of staff days will be spent in several areas 
investigation of farmers who have used a scheme or device 
to avoid annual crop support payment limitations 
the investigation of false certification by farmers so they 
could get disaster assistance 
investigation of shortages of usdaowned or usdamortgaged 
commodities stored in commercial warehouses 
the report said auditors will review marketing opportunities 
provided by the support for eastern european democracy act of 1989 
compliance with international trade agreements a followthrough on 
prior recommendations for export subsidy programs and 
implementation of new trade provisions of the 1990 farm law 
on the investigative side the report said this years efforts 
will be increased to 3 percent of the offices total staff days 
from 25 percent last year and 05 percent in 1988 
most of the investigations involved the public law 480 food 
for peace program the export enhancement program and the export 
credit guarantee program usually involving allegations of false 
certifications by us exporters

the long walk home new visions pictures 
 
like mississippi burning in 1988 the long walk home has 
been assailed by some black leaders as being a distortion of the 
struggle for civil rights in the south both films are told from 
the white point of view though the long walk home appears to 
offer more balance between the races 
taken on its artistic merits alone the long walk home is an 
earnest often affecting curiously anticlimactic film its major 
assets are two fully realized performances by accomplished 
actresses sissy spacek and whoopi goldberg 
the setting of john corks script is montgomery ala in 1955 
when municipal buses were segregated and blacks were forced to sit 
in the back a seamstress named rosa parks decided one day that she 
was too tired and took a seat at the front of the bus she was 
arrested and montgomery blacks staged a oneday boycott that grew 
into a movement led by martin luther king jr buses were integrated 
a year later following a federal court order 
in the long walk home nothing has changed in the social 
structure of montgomery since the institution of jim crow laws 
following the civil war and reconstruction 
the backofthebus mentality prevails among the citys white 
leaders and the blacks are expected to know their place the 
decades of degradation well up and blacks call a strike on the 
municipal bus system a prime source of revenue 
enter two reluctant heroines 
miriam thompson spacek is a welltodo matron who accedes to 
the wishes of her good ol boy husband dwight schultz odessa 
cotter goldberg is her dutiful domestic a woman who has never 
challenged the social system 
but odessa believes the bus strike is the right thing to do she 
is willing to walk the nine long miles to and from work mrs 
thompson sympathizes with odessa and is increasingly appalled by 
how her husband is influenced by his racist brother dylan baker 
the strike escalates into violence and kings house is bombed 
miriam thompson decides to drive odessa to work her act brings a 
climax in her marriage and in the community 
inexpensively but caringly produced by howard w koch jr and 
dave bell the long walk home carries an emotional impact 
spacek deftly portrays the ethical dilemma of southern wife and 
mother in her most restrained performance goldberg again 
impresses as one of the best actresses around the other 
performances are firstrate especially schultz as the husband who 
is incensed to find his values questioned 
richard pearce directs with a firm touch on the personal scenes 
which could have been overwrought only in the climax does he 
stumble reducing the issues to a simplistic level and mishandling 
crowd scenes 
the miramax films release of a new visions picture is rated pg 
for language and intensity running time 97 minutes

green card touchstone 
 
green card is a wisp of a movie a harmless puff of smoke 
thats pleasing to watch and quickly forgotten 
gerard depardieu stars as georges an illegal alien from france 
who marries a stranger bronte andie macdowell so he can receive 
a green card and live in manhattan bronte has her own reasons for 
marrying a horticulturist she wants to purchase an apartment with 
a greenhouse and reasons that having another name on the lease will 
persuade the coop board to let her in 
it works at first but when immigration officials become 
suspicious georges and bronte are forced to live together so they 
can learn as much as possible about each other and present 
themselves as a true couple 
georges with shaggy hair and black baggy pants is earthy and 
loveable he smokes he eats fatty food he loses his temper he 
hates instant coffee hes charming but also cynical he ran away 
from home as a child and spent a brief time in jail depardieu had 
the same experiences in his own life 
bronte who favors green baggy pants is welltodo and 
idealistic she is passionate about the environment and especially 
about her garden shes very clean and a little repressed not 
unlike her character in sex lies and videotape i am like a 
gutter and you are like a plant georges shouts at her at one 
point 
this is the comedy of the mismatch a reworking of it happened 
one night woman of the year the goodbye girl and many 
others when opposites are thrown together and eventually attract 
director peter weir takes a lowkey approach applying the same 
thoughtful style of last years dead poets society offering 
quiet shots of macdowell watching the rain and presenting a 
manhattan so golden youd think the lens was dipped in corn oil 
weir also wrote and produced the film 
green card is a timekiller for depardieu who likes to make 
three or four movies a year and can currently be seen in the far 
more demanding cyrano de bergerac 
but the french actor in his first predominantly 
englishspeaking role does get the most out of a slim part 
showing wonderful timing and giving the film a sweet offbeat 
quality the scenes in which georges and bronte concoct love 
letters and put together an album of phony wedding and honeymoon 
pictures are especially funny such as when georges pretends hes 
writing from africa and complains the elephants are keeping him 
awake 
the film wants to be liked and succeeds but the touch is so 
light it leaves no mark even as georges faces deportation there 
is no real tension in green card no demands made of the 
audience nothing to think about when its over a sweet dream that 
fades away after the lights go on 
the touchstone pictures release is rated pg13 running time

love is a strange hotel rna gregson and collister 
 
one problem with people who use acoustic guitars as a primary 
means of musical expression is inflation of their songs and 
themselves 
such selfimportance causes folkrock artists clive gregson and 
christine collister to miss a good opportunity with their new disc 
love is a strange hotel on the record the duo abandon their 
own relatively undistinguished compositions for an eclectic set of 
cover songs 
their choices show a wideranging taste unfortunately a few 
bad song choices and overwrought performances make this an overall 
disappointment 
when aztec cameras roddy frame sings his own how men are 
it works as a man extending an arm in sympathy to a woman whos 
been jilted switch the sex of the narrator and collister turns the 
song into selfpitying malebashing 
similarly turning 10ccs the things we do for love and paul 
carracks always better with you into acoustic ballads comes 
off as a misguided attempt to turn pop into poetry carracks song 
is a soulful shout of joy and needs more exuberance than gregson 
and collister can give it 
the performances of bruce springsteens one step up and 
jackson brownes for a dancer bring emotional ballads one step 
closer to new age background music 
collister has one shining moment that almost cancels out her 
sins elsewhere the pain in her voice perfectly captures the 
heartache of unrequited love on stephen fearings the most 
beguiling eyes merle haggards today i started loving you 
again gives the pair its most effective duet

costumes are often forgotten once films are 
over but not when glenn close is around her closet includes suits 
from jagged edge an overcoat from fatal attraction and the 
marquise de merteuils lowcut gownsfrom dangerous liasions 
she takes good care of those clothes she never knows when 
theyll be needed recently for example the fashion institute of 
technology asked her to donate her wardrobe from reversal of 
fortune for an exhibit on fashion in film close was able to 
oblige 
her costumes are also a reminder of a daring complicated life 
on screen a career spent in coats of many colors from pure white 
in the natural to shining black in fatal attraction 
those characters all stay with me in some way said close 
dressed for a recent interview in a mocha brown suede jacket and 
tan pants an appropriate outfit for a woman who grew up on a 
500acre estate in greenwich conn 
you have to love your character even alex forrest of fatal 
attraction who was a very haunting character you become 
intimate you gain an understanding of their behavior and i usually 
emphasize deeply with them 
as the reserved unhappy sunny von bulow of reversal of 
fortune she favored a sweater outfit with a single strand of 
pearls she wore gowns and long earrings for her new film 
hamlet portraying queen gertrude in the latest version of 
shakespeares classic tragedy 
hamlet stars mel gibson as the danish prince incapable of 
making up his mind and also features alan bates ian holm paul 
scofield and helena bonham carter 
close a veteran stage actress was not in awe of portraying 
gertrude she went about it like any other part reading the play 
several times watching other films of hamlet and taking a 
personal approach to analyzing her character 
i just decided she was married very young and married a man 
much older than her for political reasons said close a 
fivetime academy award nominee 
all the descriptions of her come across as a very tactile 
very sensual woman the ghosts and the king and hamlet revolved 
around her theres something in that woman thats dazzling 
necessary sensual selfish 
she was born in 1947 in greenwich which her ancestors helped 
found in the late 17th century growing up close never dressed 
like a queen but remembers years spent in the country playing 
makebelieve in a number of roles a bride a cowboy an orphan a 
woman dying of cancer 
helping were her two grandmothers one had wanted to be a 
singer the other an actress they were perfect coaches exposing 
her to opera and ballet even offering tricks for improving the 
memory she also made trips to manhattan which gave her a chance 
to try different kinds of clothes 
wed go every year to the nutcracker and go to the circus 
and wed also come in to have our eyes examined it was like going 
to oz wed always get dressed up when we were a little older and 
actually lived in new york it was a shock to be in jeans and just 
be comfortable 
she postponed going to college to pursue a singing career and 
was briefly married to rock guitarist cabot wade tired of life on 
the road she enrolled at william and mary college in 1970 
majoring in drama 
after graduating she starred in a number of plays for regional 
theaters including king lear uncle vanya and a 
streetcar named desire among others 
her breakthrough came in 1980 with the broadway musical 
barnum for which she earned a tony nomination as the circus 
showmans wife and gave over 300 performances in 1984 she won a 
tony for her starring role in tom stoppards the real thing 
closes film career began in 1982 with the world according to 
garp playing the freespirited mother of robin williams she was 
a sympathetic actress at first inspiring robert redford in the 
natural and mourning an old friends suicide in the big 
chill 
but in 1987 tired of warm smiles and soft tears close jumped 
at the chance to play the sexy explosive other woman of 
fatal attraction dropping 10 pounds for the role her sweet 
image evaporating into a single pot of boiled rabbit 
she considers dangerous liaisons based on the 18thcentury 
novel her favorite film admiring the marquises cunning and 
ruthlessness as she spars with the equally formidable vicomte de 
valmont john malkovich the marquise makes and breaks rules 
close notes and is controlling her image rather being controlled 
an actress born at least 200 years too soon 
i liked some of those old roles but they didnt particulary 
interest me said close who plays nice again in sarah plain 
and tall a childrens story to be aired feb 3 on cbs 
i prefer the battles between men and women and whats cliched 
and whats not its one of the great fascinations its exhausting 
emotionally but that kind of exhaustion for me is ultimately very 
cathartic exhilarating

the worlds top auction houses have set up shop in 
berlin seeking to acquire and sell treasures kept hidden during 
the communist rule in eastern europe 
sothebys the worlds largest art auction house has chosen a 
former prussian palace in eastern berlin as the site of its new 
office the previous tenant was the germansoviet friendship 
society 
rival christies has selected a posh groundfloor setting just 
off the kurfuerstendamm western berlins most fashionable shopping 
boulevard as its new address in the capital 
both aim to explore the unknown art world of the former 
communist east that was largely closed off to capitalist dealers 
during the cold war 
sothebys had long thought about going to berlin with the 
opening of the wall it became necessary to open said h josef 
koenig director of the berlin office 
koenig says he gets offers every day from eastern germans 
seeking appraisals of silver paintings or antiques they had hidden 
for years 
the objects include old meissen porcelain pieces of biedermeier 
furniture silver jewelry and paintings sometimes works of real 
value appear and can make their owners rich 
shortly before unity oct 3 an east german from dresden showed 
up at the frankfurt branch of sothebys with a painting he had 
inherited 
the retired worker had hidden the painting after the red army 
fought its way into germany in 1945 and kept it secret from east 
german authorities who had forbidden private ownership of art 
experts identified the painting as a portrait by the 20th 
century german expressionist emil nolde out of sight for 
halfacentury the work had been given up for lost by art 
connoisseurs the painting was valued at 135 million marks 
900000 
nobody knows what is over there said koenig 
to find out christies hired peter betthausen former director 
of the national gallery in what was east berlin and a specialist in 
german art of the 19th and 20th centuries to head its office 
christies is also staffing its berlin office with experts to 
assess the value of objects offered focusing on silver and 
jewelry 
sothebys eastern expansion does not stop in berlin an office 
already exists in budapest hungary and another is planned for 
prague czechoslovakia in 1991 
the arrival of the two major auction houses could signal the 
start of a revival of berlins prewar role as germanys major art 
center 
berlin began its steep decline as an art mecca in 1933 when 
adolf hitler took power the nazis banned many artists and in 1939 
publicly burned more than 1000 works of art that they deemed 
offensive 
socialist realism was the tune of the day when the communists 
came to power in eastern germany after world war ii artists who 
did not conform could not exhibit 
the unstable postwar political situation also affected west 
berlin the city found it hard to attract valuable works for 
museums while the city was divided 
but now that the city is open again both auction houses have 
spared no expense for the occasion 
sothebys sponsored a public exhibition that drew large crowds 
in october to schloss charlottenburg to see modern paintings by 
such artists as kandinsky matisse and modigliani 
christies flew in lord carrington a former nato secretary 
general who is chairman of christies international for the 
official dec 10 opening of its offices 
however it may take a while for berlin to become the site of 
the kind of spectacular auctions held regularly in london while 
many foreigners visit the city to look at what is left of the 
berlin wall most do not come regularly 
germans love traveling to london said angela hucke 
christies press officer for germany auctions are also most likely 
to fetch higher prices in london which has a more international 
buying audeience than berlin

betty boo already a star in britain and riding 
doin the do up the charts in the united states doesnt mind 
being compared to madonna up to a point 
but i dont want people believing im a wannabee i admire 
madonna like i admire margaret thatcher though i dont agree 
with her politics because i like to see strong women women in 
control said the feisty ravishingly attractive 20yearold 
i feel weak if i am not in control i always like to be in the 
drivers seat thats why i dont like flying i always think i am 
going to crash i dont trust the pilot 
shes flying high on her own 
in britain she has had two top 10 singles and her album 
boomania has made the top five and she has signed a us 
recording contract with seymour stein of sire records the man who 
signed madonna 
madonna told seymour stein she liked my video she thought i 
was cute she told seymour oh she needs a choreographer she 
should use luis luiscamacho jose gutlerez who did madonnas 
vogue video 
he is helping with betty boos next video and other connections 
are happening quickly she has signed up with larry frazin and 
larry tollin the american managers who also handle paula abdul 
halfscottish halfmalaysian by birth and 100 percent cockney 
in speech the singer changed her name from alison clarkson because 
someone once remarked that she looked like betty boop the ditzy 
cartoon character 
i dont see myself as a bimbo because im headstrong she 
said im not thick a lot of people think i look good and it 
helps but im not going to go topless or anything like that 
she began her music career with two girlfriends as the rap group 
she rockers three years ago they met professor griff of public 
enemy at a mcdonalds near their home in the west london working 
class district of shepherds bush 
griff liked their insulting attitude and offered to produce a 
single in new york give it a rest was the result 
but the singer didnt identify with the radical black separatism 
and hardcore rap she encountered in new york she returned to 
england disillusioned after a month 
fired with new determination in 1988 after the death of her 
father a driver on the london subway she took a course in studio 
sound engineering so she could control her own work 
she connected with the pioneering british dance label rhythm 
king and wrote the rap and sang on hey dj by the beatmasters a 
top 10 song in britain last year 
her own record deal followed and the company bought her a 
keyboard sequencer and sampler she mastered the equipment and 
composed 10 songs in six weeks 
doin the do was the first real song i wrote she said it 
was aimed at a math teacher who gave her a hard time and sums up 
bettys need to be in control and to win 
she later ran into the teacher who asked how she as doing 
i said i had just received my 10000 pounds 20000 bonus 
and it made him mad she said 
i think i show people that a 20yearold girl with hardly any 
academic qualifications can be successful i really wanted to show 
my teacher i think he is really pleased for me now 
looking back at school what i did was wrong i should have 
studied but in a way im glad i didnt because i wouldnt be doing 
what i do now 
betty boos videos reflect her style sort of a bmovie version 
of barbarella 
i like the way they did their makeup in the 60s i like the 
clothes they were simple quite sexy and raunchy but it still had 
a hardedged appeal its really tough like the emma peel stuff 
she said referring to diana riggs karatekicking role in the 
avengers 
all this toughness is her revenge for growing up as an outsider 
a lot of people cant tell whether im half white or half 
black cant tell whether im half puerto rican or half japanese 
or half this or that i used to lie i used to say i was white so i 
could fit in afterwards i was really proud of my looks i used to 
see models who looked more like me than the common girls who 
criticized me 
betty boo is recording her second album and hopes to tour in 
1992 with a hollywood musicalstyle live show and shes coping 
with the stresses of success 
being in this business makes me very moody and determined i 
want things to be done and i can get very stroppy if they are not 
done i can see why madonna is the way she is i am going through 
what she went through 10 years ago i am quite frightened it will 
change me

a woman slumped in a phone booth crying a 
cheap motel the rotting door of an outdoor toilet 
this is carver country raymond carver country stories and 
poems set in the pacific northwest that make twin peaks seem as 
threatening as honey i shrunk the kids couples drink and 
fight a man grovels at the knees of his exwife furniture is sold 
on the front lawn 
a little autobiography and a lot of imagination are best 
carver once wrote these bleak images were based on real places and 
real people he grew up working class in yakima wash and wrote 
about it even when he could afford to live elsewhere he was a 
longtime drunk who later composed toughlove stories 
carver country scribners 35 collects photographs of the 
late writers friends and family and of yakima and other places he 
lived the pictures fittingly are in black and white some of 
them are pretty shots of water and open fields but the majority 
show seedy bars rundown buildings and faces that stare instead of 
smile 
he was from the start an imagemaker carvers wife 
authorpoet tess gallagher recalled in a interview that would 
correspond to writing photographically he would zero in on some 
precise detail 
color doesnt render ideas very well photographer bob 
adelman insisted during a phone interview i think of the broken 
door in this motel ray sent me to god knows what it would look 
like in color or the broken saws in the factory his father worked 
theyre strong images of things not working out 
in 1984 life magazine thought the author might win the pulitzer 
prize and assigned adelman to spend a couple of months with him 
william kennedy won but adelman came up with another project 
combine pictures of carver and the people and places he had known 
with the writing they helped inspire carver died of cancer at age 
50 in 1988 but adelman continued taking several photographs last 
year 
because rays descriptions were often minimal it was a great 
opportunity for photographs adelman said most of the pictures 
were based on real things in his stories you kind of learned what 
he was familiar with and where his imagination took off from 
gallagher who contributes an introduction to the book didnt 
like the title at first it seemed smug condescending a way of 
taking a vast and complex body of work and reducing it to a catch 
phrase 
but she warmed to it like the best of carvers stories it was 
simple but not simplistic carver country is a place but its 
also a state of mind a sense of holding on against bad luck a 
resignation to living with debts that no one could possibly expect 
to pay 
his earlier stories were the strong silent type flat on the 
surface full of mystery and terror underneath 
in why honey a woman is surprised to learn her son a 
good boy set off firecrackers in a girls ears the eerie so 
much water so close to home tells of a man who finds a 
mutiliated body in the river and takes his time letting anybody 
know what happened 
carver wasnt trying to write who killed laura palmer 
thrillers mysteries remained mysteries important questions were 
left unanswered perhaps because the author himself didnt know how 
to resolve them 
i met him at this writers conference in dallas in the 1977 
gallagher recalled i had gone home with his books and i was 
reading aloud one of the stories to my sister she said i dont 
know what happens at the end of that story call him up 
so i decided id call him up i called him up and said were 
not satisfied with this story what is going on here he said 
im not going to tell you any more 
but carver changed his luck changed he had nearly died from 
alcohol in the mid1970s he was suffering from blackouts and 
depression and was hospitalized several times living alone his 
first marriage destroyed carver joined alcoholics anonymous in 
1977 and finally stopped drinking 
gratified just to be writing again he was eager to fill in the 
blanks cathedral his acclaimed collection of stories was 
published in 1984 and people started talking 
in where im callng from two recovering alcoholics comfort 
each other on the front porch of a dryingout facility in the 
title story two men one of them blind sketch a cathedral 
together his fingers rode my fingers as my hand went over the 
paper the man who sees explains it was like nothing else in 
my life up to now 
a small good thing was the peak the story of a young 
couples heartbreaking trip through carver country and the lonely 
baker who gives them hope for a way out gallagher received a 
letter from a woman who had read it on a plane and burst out 
crying 
with the success of cathedral carver returned to his first 
love poetry he was living with gallagher and writing more 
beautifully than ever but his health broke down by 1988 he had 
developed tumors in his brain and in his lungs he died that 
august 
dont weep for me carver wrote in gravy one of his 
last poems ive had 10 years longer than i or anyone expected 
pure gravy and dont forget it 
all of us who knew ray are still bumping into walls trying to 
get on with our lives said gallagher who had married carver in 
his last june 
the feeling has been if you have tough times tough luck 
she said if things are rough you must have deserved it you 
didnt work hard enough he made the educated segment aware that 
these people had feelings and the dimensions of their suffering 
became real and palpable

it took the closing of an oklahoma 
foundry to get singer joe diffie into the country music business 
he had long dreamed of having a career in music and when he was 
laid off in 1986 he decided to move to nashville and pursue one 
the twist of fate paid off diffies first record home was 
a no 1 hit in november 
seeing it come to fruition is very gratifying the 
31yearold performer said in an interview during his third day 
back in nashville after a whirlwind fiveweek tour of 
onenighters 
diffie had been working at the foundry in duncan okla running 
a core machine when he lost his job and his 1700amonth salary 
i never had any hair left on my arms it was always singed 
off he recalled about the job i always had burns all over me 
i detested every second of the job i didnt like any aspect of it 
except the people there 
it was a blessing in disguise when it shut down if it hadnt 
id probably still be there or some place like it 
after reaching nashville he took a job for 1 years in the 
shipping and receiving department at the gibson guitar factory 
home spent six weeks in the top 10 on the country music 
popularity charts faring better than tunes by more established 
singers such as anne murray and eddie rabbitt 
the wistful song is about the values of home life 
a swimming hole and fishing pole and the feel of the muddy 
road between my toes 
a back yard swing where i wuld sit and mom would sing 
amazing grace while she hung out the clothes 
an easy chair with my daddy there and the smell of sunday 
supper on the stove 
diffie said the song stirred strong emotions 
i think everybody related to it regardless of whether they 
were raised in the country or city because everybody has a home in 
their memory when i first heard it i got a lump in my throat it 
brings back a feeling of when you were younger safe and secure 
without any worries and no problems 
it was a sweet song but not too syrupy 
the tune is on his first album a thousand winding roads on 
epic records the lp is a mixture of ballads and uptempo songs 
performed in a style described by billboard magazine as randy 
travis with a merle haggard catch to his voice 
his second single released from the album is if you want me 
to a traditional country weeper about a man offering to leave 
his lover if thats what she wants 
another cut on the lp there goes the neighborhood is a 
ballad about marriages dissolving the cut almost home is about 
the decline of an aging parent 
diffie who cowrote four of the songs on the album says hes 
taken advantage of a new era in country music 
theres been a changing of the guard in country music the 
listeners the artists the radio stations and the people producing 
the records he said 
the songs are getting better and better with the new 
songwriters coming in thats not to say the old ones are bad but 
its almost like country music has got a little edge to it now 
some of the more sensitive matters are being touched upon 
diffie is a native of the duncan area and spent much of his life 
there his father had a huge collection of country music and his 
parents instilled in him a love of the music he remembers singing 
amazing grace you are my sunshine and peace in the 
valley with his two sisters while they traveled in the family 
pickup truck 
he briefly attended cameron university in oklahoma and eyed a 
career as a heart surgeon or chiropractor but he was more 
interested in music 
he has a sixpiece band and a fan club with the catchy name 
diffie cult keeping things in the family his mother is its 
president

british airways plc klm royal dutch airways and 
belgiums sabena world airways announced monday they are scrapping 
their plans jointly to form a regional airline with a hub in 
brussels 
the three carriers in a joint news release cited practical 
difficulties involved in implementing the original objectives a 
klm spokesman acknowledged that uncertainty over obtaining european 
community regulatory approval was a factor 
the three airlines had intended to develop their venture into a 
regional european airline using brussels zaventem airport as the 
center of a hubandspoke route network linking 75 cities 
throughout europe 
british airways specified in its own news release that sabena 
sa has made it clear that the group requires recapitalization and 
reorganization of a kind which the present minority investments 
agreed by british airways and klm could not solve 
under the original terms of the deal british airways and klm 
each had agreed to buy a 20 percent stake in the joint venture for 
about 66 million apiece the belgiangovernment controlled sabena 
sa was to have held the remaining 60 percent 
current plans call for sabena to take back the shares held by 
british airways and klm 
the capital already invested is being converted into a loan for 
repayment on dec 31 1991 the airlines said british airways said 
it already had contributed 17 million pounds or 33 million 
in amsterdam klm spokesman peter wellhuner said many factors 
led to the decision in addition to high fuel costs he cited the 
uncertainty of regulatory approval 
we have had ample consultation with the european commission on 
this case and up until now we havent had any certainty of its 
approval wellhuner said 
the european commission which safeguards competition decided 
in june that the deal could hurt competition at the brussels 
airport and offered to negotiate a settlement the airlines 
refused and instead prepared legal arguments supporting the 
arrangement 
the british government cleared the deal in july finding that 
travelers would benefit from the hub the airlines wanted to create 
british airways said the decision to scrap the joint venture 
wouldnt result in any capital loss for the company

troubled data general corp has dropped a 
product development agreement with japans nippon telegraph and 
telephone corp company officials said today 
the agreement with ntt to build highspeed hubs for private data 
communications networks was announced in 1987 the communications 
systems were to link voice data and computers in large private 
communications networks such as those used by corporations and 
universities 
ntt executives said then that the company planned to buy about 
130 million of equipment to be developed by data general the 
purchases were to be made in a fiveyear period beginning in 1989 
but the project was scrapped after research showed there was not 
a strong market in japan for such systems said jim dunlap a 
spokesman for data general 
as a result of the review of the market place and the 
potential for the product data general and ntt reached a mutual 
agreement to drop the plan dunlap said 
barry willman an analyst with sanford c bernstein in new york 
attributed the dropped deal to data generals mounting financial 
pressures a shift in the computer market and the firms increased 
emphasis on its aviion workstations 
the program had been under review for awhile willman said 
it had encountered delays during the years and with data 
generals continuing financial pressures there came a time when a 
prudent decision was made to terminate the project 
data general has not had a profitable year since 1985 when its 
employment peaked at 17700 since then the firm has suffered a 
string of losses and employment has continued to decline 
dunlap said the firm had eliminated about 2300 jobs in 1990 
through cuts and attrition the company announced in august that 
more than 2000 workers would be laid off 
data general lost 139 million in its most recent fiscal year 
revenues were 122 billion compared with 131 billion the year 
before 
analysts say the minicomputer slump has acted as a drag on 
earnings and hampered the companys efforts to become profitable

usg corp one of the nations largest building 
products manufacturers said today it is postponing debt payments 
and selling a major subsidiary because of the declining 
construction industry 
the company said its major bank lenders have agreed to cooperate 
in the refinancing plan in the interim usg will defer payments of 
105 million in principal due today to its senior lending banks it 
also will not make interest payments on 40 million in loans from 
subordinated bondholders 
the company said it is not making these payments in order to 
strengthen its cash position so that it can pay its trade and 
operating expenses during the financial restructuring 
it said it also is seeking an equity investor 
the plan also includes the proposed sale of dap inc a producer 
of caulks and other specialty chemical products dap had annual 
sales of 186 million in 1989 with an operating profit of 12 
million 
for the first nine months of 1990 usg lost 2 million while 
sales skidded 6 percent to 16 billion from 17 billion 
the decision to begin financial restructuring now rather than 
simply seeking shortterm amendments to our bank loan covenants is 
dictated by the continuing slowdown in construction markets said 
usg chairman eugene b connolly

federal authorities subpoenaed the records of 
the nations biggest baby formula manufacturers after state welfare 
officials and consumer advocates made allegations of price fixing 
representatives of one of the companies and a professional 
association said today 
officers of wyethayerst laboratories and the american academy 
of pediatrics said their records were subpoenaed several weeks ago 
and they either had responded or were doing so 
debbie feinstein assistant to the director of the federal trade 
commissions bureau of competition said the bureau began the 
investigation late in may at about the time its director kevin j 
arquit testified before a senate subcommittee on the issue 
ms feinstein said she could not confirm that subpoenas had been 
issued 
this is a toppriority frontburner investigation arquit 
told the new york times 
he said authorities have not concluded that price fixing 
occurred the companies denied the allegations 
the times reported that records were subpoenaed from ross 
laboratories a division of abbott laboratories the meadjohnson 
nutritional group a division of bristolmyers squibb co 
wyethayerst laboratories a division of the american home products 
corp the carnation co a subsidiary of nestle sa and the 
gerber products co the american academy of pediatrics was also 
subpoenaed it said 
ross meadjohnson and wyethayerst account for about 95 percent 
of all baby formula marketed in the united states while carnation 
and gerber account for about 5 percent the newspaper said the 
domestic market is worth about 13 billion a year it said 
wyethayerst spokeswoman audrey ashby said the company received 
the ftc subpoena in september and has begun turning over the 
requested documents 
we set prices independently and compete vigorously and 
independently in all aspects of the infant formula business ms 
ashby said she said she had no further information on the 
investigation 
efforts to get comment from other companies were not immediately 
successful there was no answer this morning at bristolmyers 
squibb and a woman answering the telephone at gerber products co 
in fremont mich said all corporate offices are closed until 
wednesday 
in washington antoinette parisi eaton president of the 
american academy of pediatrics confirmed that records of the 
academy mainly its policy statements in opposition to infant 
formula advertising had been subpoenaed she said the academy 
responded to the subpoena about six weeks ago 
our position has been that we are speaking out and have an 
obligation to speak out in the best interests of the public health 
of infants in this country ms eaton said our concern is that 
breast feeding will be reduced by infant formula advertising 
breast feeding rates in this country are already going down 
ms feinstein said we are not taking a position on whether or 
not advertising is good or bad or infant formula is good or bad 
but the things we have heard are that infant formula is a very 
concentrated industry and one of the reasons it might be hard for 
people to enter is because there is not any advertising 
at a hearing held by the antitrust subcommittee of the senate 
judiciary committee in may democratic sens howard metzenbaum of 
ohio and patrick leahy of vermont charged that three companies used 
nearly total control of the infant formula market to keep prices 
high and rebates to staterun programs for poor children low the 
companies named were mead johnson ross laboratories and wyeth 
laboratories industry officials said their prices were fair 
infant formula is a major ingredient in food packages given to 
lowincome families who qualify for the special supplemental food 
program for women infants and children the program serves about 
44 million people a month and accounts for onethird of the infant 
formula sold in the united states 
the programs funds are limited and higher costs mean fewer 
people benefit arquit said 
dennis h bach of iowa who heads the national association of 
wic directors said baby formula prices have seemed to go up in 
lock step over the last 10 years 
betsy clarke director of the wic program in oregon said prices 
have tripled during the past 15 years with different companies 
raising prices by the same amounts within days of each other 
current retail prices range from 180 to 230 for a 13ounce 
can of concentrated formula

to some the welfare systems in northern europe 
are the worlds most humane to others theyre a wasteful gravy 
train supporting thousands of people who could work if they had

and some people living off them will feel the pinch

some of northern europes welfare 
states wonder how to keep their cradletograve safety nets from 
fraying in the impending recession 
in the postworld war ii boom years the scandinavian countries 
the netherlands and west germany introduced programs that spend up 
to a quarter of the gross national product on welfare 
welfare spending now is outstripping the industrial growth that 
was supposed to pay the bill with growth slowing in many european 
countries some governments are considering cutbacks 
with less money available for welfare government officials 
complain more loudly about people abusing the system 
dutch prime minister ruud lubbers says his nations welfare 
system which will cost the government 1323 billion guilders 
796 billion in 1991 is out of hand 
in a recent report the organization for economic cooperation 
and development citing hollands high income taxes and generous 
welfare benefits concluded that incentives to work are low the 
nation has an 11 percent unemployment rate 
dutch authorities recently failed to lure jobless amsterdam 
residents to the understaffed flower industry even after the 
government offered a car for every four workers to use for 
commuting as well as personal use 
denmark spends 40 percent of its budget on the 14 million 
people 28 percent of the population who live on welfare the 
centerright coalition government of prime minister poul schlueter 
hopes it can reduce welfare dependency by stimulating private 
industry 
denmark has 20000 people under 40 years of age getting 
permanent government pensions of 3709 kroner 662 a month 
because of drug or alcohol problems 
in europe welfare helps the employed as well as the jobless 
the system commonly includes free medical insurance sick pay 
disability and old age pensions and childcare and unemployment 
benefits 
in sweden parents can qualify for benefits for taking time off 
to nurse a sick child 
the basic thing is that everyone should have basic 
opportunities to take part in all activities within our 
society said annchristen filipson of the swedish social affairs 
ministry 
scandinavian taxpayers can hardly be expected to dig deeper in 
their pockets to pay a greater share of the welfare costs their 
tax rates of more than 50 percent already are highest in the 
industrialized world 
last october swedens ruling social democratic party made the 
first cuts ever in a social welfare system now costing 25139 
billion kronor 4513 billion just over onefifth of the gnp 
the government is expected to cut 15 billion kronor 269 
billion dollars from the welfare budget in 1991 the government is 
also planning to cut sick pay rates from 100 percent to 75 percent 
of a workers salary for the first three days in an effort to 
discourage malingering workers take an average 25 days of sick 
leave a year 
the welfare programs are usually funded by taxes paid by 
employers and employees and some are getting fed up 
ove danemar of the swedish employers federation criticized 
the whole system because it stimulates people to work less 
and to take more leisure time 
the private sector cant bear it any longer he said its 
no longer consistent with a modern economy 
critics say many of the benefits were begun in good faith but 
have ended up being abused during more favorable economic times 
the abuse was widely tolerated but with the continent entering a 
recession there is more clamping down on wasteful spending 
lubbers has vowed to curb hollands unsuitability for work act 
under which nearly 900000 people get lifelong disability pensions 
of up to 70 percent of their lastearned pay in the late 1970s 
some companies used it by dismissing unproductive employees 
passing the social cost on to the government 
about onethird of the programs beneficiaries claim 
psychological reasons for being unable to work in a recent speech 
lubbers said wryly looking at the statistics one has to 
admit that ours is a sick nation 
this spring the dutch government is expected to make deep cuts 
in the housing education and cultural subsidies that complement 
the welfare handouts themselves equal to at least 70 percent of 
the minimum wage it has borrowed heavily and diverted money from 
other programs to cover welfare costs 
only germany is making large welfare increases to pay millions 
of former east germans who are unemployed 
norway is slightly expanding its 1258 billion kroner 21 
billion welfare system on which almost a quarter of the 
population depends in some form or other the labor government has 
added about one billion kroner 166 million to the bill since 
coming into office last month and even the rightleaning opposition 
progress party favors the expansion

100000 people in 1972 to about 30 per 100000 in 1987 he said 
smokers are believed to comprise only 136 percent of the 
population age 15 and above but health experts were dismayed to 
discover an increase recently in the number of smokers between ages 
15 and 19 
tobacco companies joined the campaign this year to discourage 
youngsters from smoking 
we are not here to promote smoking to children but to provide 
the choice to adults who want to smoke said richard png

military costs in the persian gulf 
crisis have outrun saudi arabias extra revenue derived from higher 
petroleum prices and production the government said monday 
the kingdom said it was delaying promulgation of its 1991 budget 
because the uncertainty created by the crisis has made it difficult 
to project how much revenue it will get from oil 
the worlds largest oil exporter said the financial burdens it 
had to bear because of the emergency circumstances create by 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of neighboring kuwait were much more 
than the extra oil revenues 
under the 1990 budget which took effect last dec 31 the 
government revenues were forecast at 118 billion riyals or about 
314 billion expenditures were set at 143 billion riyals or 376 
billion 
the difference of 25 billion riyals was to be covered through 
issuing government development bonds 
in a statement to the official saudi press agency information 
minister ali alshaer said iraqs flagrant aggression on kuwait 
and the threats it posed to saudi territories have led the 
government to reinforce its military and upgrade services and 
public utilities 
the presence of sisterly and friendly forces has also entailed 
extra spending on the services and infrastructure needed by these 
forces shaer said 
the statement said the rise of oil prices which have increased 
to the 2830 a barrel range from less than 22 prior to the 
crisis have helped the governments added expenses during part of 
october oil briefly surpassed the 40 a barrel level 
however the increase in expenditures for the saudis due to the 
gulf crisis was much more than the increase in petroleum 
revenues said shaer without giving further details 
the statement said it was difficult to assess anticipated 
revenues because of the unpredictability of circumstances that will 
decide the level of production and prices during the next 12 
months 
the united nations has set a jan 15 deadline for iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait 
saudi oil production has risen to around 8 million barrels a 
day from around 54 million barrels a day earlier in the year 
but saudi leader king fahd noted recently that his grade of oil 
never hit the 40abarrel figure in the first two months of the 
invasion which was for activelytraded us and north sea grades 
of oil 
he said his best grades never exceeded 26 a barrel and his 
heavier crude oil sold for as low as 15 a barrel 
saudi arabia has agreed tound 8 billion to the costs of the 
multinational military deployment opposing the iraqis most of that 
force has come from the united states 
economists at the bahrainbased gulf international bank have 
calculated that the gulf crisis has cost saudi arabia around 21 
billion compared with extra revenues of 16 billion

usg corp said the anemic construction industry 
is forcing it to defer debt payments restructure finances and sell 
a major subsidiary 
the company one of the nations largest building products 
manufacturers said it would not make a 105 million payment on 
principal that was due monday putting it technically in default 
and subject to court action by lenders 
usg said however that major bank lenders have agreed to go 
along with the restructuring plan while it continues to make 
interest payments on the 105 million 
the company also said it will not make interest payments due 
jan 15 on 40 million worth of bonds 
spokesman matthew gonring said officials will be in contact with 
the major bondholders but he declined to say if usg has sought 
assurances that the bondholders will not file bankruptcy petitions 
against the company 
the company said in a statement that it does not intend to file 
for protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code 
an outofcourt restructuring is the best solution the 
company said 
the usg announcement reflected a steep downturn in demand for 
construction of homes and commercial real estate that has gripped 
much of the country sales of new homes for example are now at 
their lowest levels since the 198182 recession with little 
improvement expected anytime soon 
usg lost 2 million during the first nine months of 1990 while 
sales skidded 6 percent to 16 billion from 17 billion 
in the past two years the company has laid off 1100 workers 
because of economic difficulties additional employees were lost in 
the sales of subsidiaries 
usg said that as part of its restructuring it will offer for 
sale dap inc a producer of caulks and other specialty hemical 
products dap had annual sales of 186 million in 1989 with an 
operating profit of 12 million 
usg said it also is seeking an investor willing to give the 
company a major infusion 
we believe there are a number of investors who might be 
interested in making an equity investment in the company gonring 
said adding that there have been talks with potential investors 
he didnt identify any 
the company said its cash position at yearend is very strong 
and that it will pay its trade and operating expenses in a timely 
manner throughout the restructuring process 
it said it is not making the loan payments in order to assure 
liquidity during restructuring which it expects to complete before 
the end of 1991 
the decision to begin financial restructuring now rather than 
simply seeking shortterm amendments to our bank loan covenants is 
dictated by the continuing slowdown in construction markets said 
usg chairman eugene b connolly 
the company has retained salomon brothers and lazard freres 
investment banking firms to help in the restructuring

his name doesnt show up in the daily box 
scores but cbs inc chairman laurence a tisch landed the top spot 
in one magazines new listing of the most powerful figures in 
sport 
the sporting news leaned toward businessmen like tisch who has 
agreed to spend almost 39 billion on acquiring the rights to 
broadcast major sporting events on the cbs television network in 
assmbling its list 
only three athletes golfers jack nicklaus and arnold palmer 
and basketball standout michael jordan were chosen for the 
100member roster 
ranking second to tisch was dick ebersol president of nbc 
sports followed by the commissioners of three major professional 
sports paul tagliabue of the national football league fay vincent 
of major league baseball and david stern of the national basketball 
association 
the full list appears in the jan 7 issue of the weekly sports 
publication that goes on newstands on wednesday 
sporting news said in a statement that the ranking of entrants 
was determined by the editorial staff it did not elaborate on the 
selection process 
but editor john rawlings was quoted as saying the list clearly 
indicates that the real muscle of sports lies not with the athletes 
but with the behind the scenes power brokers 
under tisch cbs has agreed to pay almost 39 billion for 
sports broadcast rights including 106 billion for major league 
baseball a similar amount for national football league games more 
than 12 billion for college basketball and football and 543 
million for the 1992 and 1994 winter olympic games 
tischs competitors at the other networks have argued that cbs 
offered to pay much more for the broadcast rights than the network 
could reasonably expect to recover in advertising sales from the 
programs 
cbs has contended that the highprofile sporting events will 
give it a chance to promote its other shows to a large audience 
the company recently announced it lost 55 million after taxes 
on its first year of baseball and would charge another 115 million 
against earnings to reflect anticipated losses in the next three 
years of the baseball contract 
theres no doubt tischs actions have changed the face of 
sports rawlings said 
for better or worse the acquisition of major broadcast 
properties by cbs will have a domino effect on the entire sports 
industry including athletes owners fans agents advertisers 
and all other parties for years to come he said 
he said the effect of higher rights payments is reflected in 
more revenue for sports owners bigger salaries for players 
steeper ticket prices for fans and rescheduled game tmes to suit 
televisions need for large audiences 
rounding out the top 10 members of the list is mark mccormack 
head of international management group a sports agency and 
promotion firm dennis swanson abc sports president juan antonio 
samaranch president of the international olympic committee boxing 
promoter don king and donald dell founder of the sports management 
firm proserv 
only two women appear on the list no 29 ellen merlo vice 
president of marketing services at philip morris whose brands 
marlboro and virginia slims cigarettes and miller beer are major 
sports sponsors and advertisers and no 31 anita defrantz 
president of the amateur athletic foundation of los angeles and the 
first black woman named to the international olympic committee 
the three athletes on the list have connections to business and 
sports 
nicklaus who ranked 61st is a golf course designer and 
manufacturer as well as a golfer jordan who placed 79th has 
appeared in a number of product commercials for cereal shoes and 
fast food the golfer palmer ranked 93rd is a course designer and 
entrepreneur

bond prices closed higher in quiet trading 
monday while the rate for overnight loans between banks skidded 
sharply after the federal reserve moved to offset a predicted 
shortterm credit crunch 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond rose 1116 point or 
688 per 1000 in face amount at closing monday its yield 
which falls when prices rise was 824 percent down from 830 
percent late friday 
yields for the 30year bond posted a slight gain in 1990 ending 
up about percentage point above 1989s closing figure of 797 
percent 
the federal funds rate the bank overnight loan rate and a 
closely followed indicator of the feds activities fluctuated 
throughout the day 
economists attributed the swings to the feds injection of funds 
into the banking system on thursday and monday to ease a projected 
drought in shortterm credit 
the fed seems to have bent over backwards to provide reserves 
to the banking system said douglas mcallister a bond trader for 
prudentialbache securities inc 
the rate fluctuated in a range of 6 percentage points but didnt 
skyrocket as some economists had expected it traded around 2 
percent late monday down from 7 percent late friday according to 
the telerate inc financial information service 
at the end of the year banks aggressively borrow shortterm 
funds to shore up their balance sheets a practice known as 
window dressing this sudden surge of banks shortterm 
borrowing can causes the fed funds rate to jump dramatically based 
on the simple dynamics of supply and demand 
the intense appetite for fed funds pushed the rate to 100 
percent briefly wednesday night said carol stone senior economist 
for nomura securities international inc the feds perceived target 
for the rate is 7 percent 
the wild swings didnt surprise bond analysts 
it is nothing out of the ordinary this time of year to get 
those wild gyrations said kevin flanagan money market economist 
for dean witter reynolds inc 
traders offered a range of explanations for the rise in bond 
prices some felt the market was correcting itself following a 
sharp selloff friday based on an erroneous report of shots fired 
in the persian gulf 
others felt the bond rallied on news of a european peace 
initiative in the gulf crisis 
but samuel d kahan chief economist for fuji securities inc 
said that with such light trading i would caution into reading 
too much into one days numbers 
trading concluded at 3 pm earlier than normal because of the 
new years holiday on tuesday 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds shortterm 
maturities rose 316 point to 932 point intermediate maturities 
rose rsqb point to 716 point and longterm issues were up 1732 point 
to 1116 point telerate inc reported 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer rose 316 to 118410 the index fell 431 
points in 1990 
yields on threemonth treasury bills held at 662 percent as the 
discount rose 1 basis point to 644 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills were down to 671 percent as the discount fell 12 basis point 
to 642 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 680 percent as 
the discount fell 10 basis points to 639 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds rose 132 point to 91 932 the average 
yield to maturity held at 747 percent unchanged from friday the

oil prices closed out a tumultuous year by 
advancing monday in light and abbreviated trading dominated once 
again by concerns about the middle east 
the february contract for light sweet crude the benchmark 
grade of us oil rose 87 cents to 2844 a 42gallon barrel on 
the new york mercantile exchange and subsequent months posted 
similar gains 
mondays session ended early as traders left for the new years 
holiday 
analysts reported the market was preoccupied with the middle 
east and the possibility that war could break out if iraq has not 
withdrawn from kuwait before the jan 15 deadline set by the un 
security council 
andrew lebow an analyst with edampf man international futures 
inc said the market shrugged off a planned peace initiative by 
the european community and focused instead on the fast 
approaching deadline 
traders fear that a war in the middle east would disrupt oil 
supplies from the area as tensions in the area have increased in 
recent months so have oil prices 
on aug 1 the day before the iraqi invasion of kuwait light 
sweet crude closed at 2154 a barrel it then rocketed 157 
higher to close at 2311 on aug 2 and began to fluctuate wildly 
in the following weeks with price changes of 1 or more becoming 
the norm 
the price of crude peaked at 4042 a barrel on oct 12 before 
retreating to its current level crude oil prices had ended 1989 at 
2182 a barrel 
prices for refined products have advanced in response to the 
gains posted by crude on monday heating oil and gasoline prices 
also moved higher on technical factors as the january contracts for 
each fuel expired 
the january contract for heating oil rose 153 cents to settle 
at 8131 cents a gallon and later months also advanced sharply 
heating oil has traded lower than might be expected for this 
time of the year because of the unusually warm fall and winter 
although temperatures have fallen in many parts of the country 
heating oil supplies are adequate and this has kept prices down 
lebow said 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for january delivery picked up 136 
cents to close at 7092 cents a gallon with subsequent months also 
moving higher 
in natural gas trading the february contract closed at 1950 
per 1000 cubic feet unchanged from friday

the dollar ended mostly lower on the final day 
of 1990 finishing a year of marked weakening against other 
currencies due in large part to the reunification of germany and a 
slumping us economy 
gold was marginally higher on monday but ended the year down 
moderately the metal closed up 20 cents to 39420 a troy ounce 
from fridays close on the new york commodity exchange that 
compared with the golds last quote on the final day of 1989 
40250 an ounce 
republic national bank quoted a late bid of 39325 a troy 
ounce up 25 cents from late friday but down from 1989s last late 
bid of 40250 an ounce 
currency analysts said the loosening of communism in eastern 
europe also contributed to the dollars fall by strengthening the 
german mark 
germany is the big story in 1990 said david marshall 
currency analyst at mms international the dollar did worse than 
people expected it due to the quickness with which the 
reunification of germany went through and the strength of the 
unwinding of eastern europe 
in addition he said no one expected the us economy to be 
as soft as it now seems to be 
on monday in new york the dollar closed against the german mark 
at 14885 compared with 16950 marks at 1989s end late friday the 
dollar was quoted at 14935 marks 
analysts said the dollars yeartodate loss against currencies 
other than the mark was not as pronounced in part because the 
middle east conflict seemed to hurt some other denominations more 
than the dollar 
in new york the dollar ended the year at 13550 japanese yen 
down from 14385 yen at the end of 1989 but mondays dollar ended 
stronger than fridays closing 13490 yen 
the british pound also strengthened overall against the dollar 
closing the year at 19345 in new york compared with 16105 at 
1989s close on friday sterling was quoted at a closing 19282 
in london the pound rose to 19280 from 19220 late friday the 
pound traded in london for 16115 at the end of 1989 
the dollars slight fall on monday was due partly to a fresh 
peace initiative from the european community luxembourgs foreign 
minister jacques poos said he may meet with iraqi counterpart 
tariq aziz luxembourg will take over the european communitys 
rotating chairmanship on tuesday 
heightened peace prospects in the persian gulf tend to diminish 
the dollars value because the investment is considered a safe 
haven in times of war 
despite the eecs peacefeeling foray earlier news of a 
hostilesounding new years message from iraqs saddam hussein 
offset much of the dollars fall said marshall 
in tokyo the dollar fell 065 japanese yen to 13540 yen 
later in london it was quoted at 13555 yen the dollar finished 
at 14340 yen in tokyo at the end of 1989 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late fridays 
rates and with 1989 yearend rates in parentheses included 12668 
swiss francs down from 12745 15420 50685 french francs down 
from 50810 57805 11599 canadian dollars down from 11601

instability in europe the threat of war in the 
middle east and economic woes everywhere pushed world stock markets 
down sharply in 1990 and strategists said the new year hinges on 
the course of those events 
in major markets japan tumbled on overvalued stocks and high 
interest rates and germany sank as the effect of abosorbing its 
formerly communist eastern neighbor set in while britain benefited 
from a weak dollar 
according to an index of 20 major markets by morgan stanley 
capital international world stock markets tumbled 23 percent in 
1990 through friday as measured in local currencies the us 
canadian and british stock markets were open monday but most 1990 
trading worldwide ended friday 
excluding the united states and canada the decline for us 
investors playing foreign markets translated to 244 percent in 
1990 compared to a 91 percent increase in dollar terms in 1989 
morgan stanley said 
bascially we had a year where the consequences of high real 
interest rates came out said richard b hoey chief economist 
with barclays de zoete wedd he said higher rates in germany and 
japan were felt worldwide 
market strategists said monday that the world developments that 
shaped 1990 will spill over as the dominant themes of 1991 among 
the key questions 
will the united states go to war with iraq rising oil prices 
had a bad inflationary effect on equity markets from stockholm to 
singapore and trading closely followed the movements of oil 
prices 
how bad will the world financial crisis get the pace of 
slowdowns in europe and japan and recessions in the britain and the 
united states and the movement of interest rates particularly in 
germany are considered keys to stock market performance in 1991 
will the tinder box politics of the soviet union ignite will 
eastern europe become more than an economic drain for the west 
economists said the potential for quick gains there is slim but 
that disaster could depress stock markets 
in the morgan stanley index japans stock market dropped 399 
percent in yen terms in 1990 the worlds second worst performance 
behind a 402 percent fall in finland germany declined 209 
percent france fell 252 percent and italy lost 29 percent in 
their local currencies 
the declines were smaller when measured in us dollars which 
fell against european currencies for the year 
the best performer in local terms was the hong kong market 
which rose 46 percent the austrian market lost just 69 percent 
in local currency and rose 49 percent in dollar terms britain 
dropped 107 percent in pounds and rose 61 percent in dollars the 
us market was down 59 percent according to morgan stanley 
in japan the nikkei index of 225 leading stocks plunged from a 
record high of 3891587 at the end of 1989 to below 20000 after 
iraqs invasion of kuwait in august the index recovered somewhat 
to end the year at 2384871 
a sharp rise in japanese interest rates helped depress equity 
investment there hoey said that combined with what was widely 
considered an unsustainable market level spurred the selloff 
major factors in 1991 are the real estate prices and whether 
economic malaise will increase 
interest rates played the primary role in germany with the 
powerful bundesbank the nations central bank dictating action in 
other european capitals 
the frankfurt stock market soared in the spring amid optimism 
over eastern europe before the cost of german reunification took 
its toll the german government hiked interest rates to offset the 
inflationary impact of pouring billions of dollars into former east 
germany 
higher interest rates dampen corporate expansion and economic

the number of bank and savings institution 
failures declined in 1990 for the first time in seven years but 
the foundering economy may prevent any sustained improvement 
in 1990 169 commercial and savings banks failed including one 
bank that remained open only with an infusion of government cash 
the federal deposit insurance corp said monday 
additionally 211 savings and loans went insolvent the 
resolution trust corp said that included 207 seized by the 
government and put into conservatorship and four kept open with 
taxpayer money 
the failure total in 1990 380 represents a 29 percent drop 
from 535 in 1989 a postdepression high it marks the first 
decline since 1983 when 84 of both types of institutions failed 
compared with 105 the previous year 
analysts however are drawing no encouragement from the 
improvement the sharp deterioration in real estate values 
particularly in new england and new york and new jersey have yet 
to make their full impact on the failure rate they said nor have 
the effects of the economic slowdown since the summer 
1990 in a way was really a lull year said financial 
institutions analyst bert ely of alexandria va every indication 
is that in 1991 were going to see a significant increase 
the geographic pattern of failures shows they reflect old 
problems from the mid1980s in oilproducing states in the 
southwest rather than new problems in the northeastern states where 
real estate markets are weakest he said 
although 1990s failures were spread among 38 states and the 
district of columbia and puerto rico more than a third 140 
were in texas 
ten other states had 10 or more failures they were california 
and florida 21 each illinois 18 louisiana 17 new jersey 14 
oklahoma 13 new york 12 massachusetts and colorado 11 and 
mississippi 10 
whats going to be interesting in 1991 is to see what will 
happen in new england thats where the next wave of problems is 
ely said 
according to economist robert litan of the brookings 
institution the most significant difference between bank problems 
in the 1980s and bank problems of the 1990s is that this time some 
of the nations largest sampls are under stress 
through the 1980s the problems were largely concentrated in 
small banks with a few isolated exceptions he said today the 
weakness is concentrated in large banks 
that is reflected in fdic chairman l william seidmans forecast 
that 180 banks will fail in 1991 although that is only 10 more 
than in 1990 the agency says assets held by the insolvent 
institutions will total 70 billion up from around 16 billion in 
1990 
the sampls toppling into insolvency in 1990 had 117 billion in 
assets meanwhile according to the office of thrift supervision 
an additional 184 institutions with around 150 billion in assets 
are all but certain to fail and 356 sampls with 190 billion in 
assets are in danger of failing 
if all of the endangered sampls fold only around 2000 
privatelymanaged sampls would be left operating if seidmans bank 
failure prediction proves accurate the number of commercial and 
savings banks operating would be reduced to around 12700 
the big danger according to economists is that regulators will 
hesitate to seize failing institutions and sell them off to new 
investors seidman said the fdic has enough money to handle bank 
failures through this year but the insurance fund would begin 1992 
dangerously diminished to around 4 billion 
seidman is proposing that healthy banks contribute around 25 
billion to shore up the fund 
resolution trust corp officials meanwhile estimate they will 
be out of funds unless congress expeditiously acts to provide more 
after spending most of the 50 billion that congress appropriated 
for the sampl bailout in 1989 the bush administration estimates it 
needs at least another 40 billion to cover losses in 1990 
the rtc spent 32 billion in 1990 to protect depositors in 320 
sampls including some that were closed and others turned over to new 
owners that total includes institutions seized in 1989 as well as 
in 1990

western union corp hoping to 
avoid involuntary bankruptcy completed a deal monday to sell its 
telex and electronic mail businesses to american telephone amp 
telegraph co for 180 million 
western union will use the money to buy back some of its junk 
bonds helping ease its crushing interestpayment burden 
western unions remaining operations are its moneytransfer 
service electronic billpaying service and electronic letter 
services such as mailgram 
western union will buy back 335 million worth of its 
highinterest highrisk bonds at 50 cents on the dollar the

percent notes and 6 million of 16 percent notes from investors who 
accept the offer by thursday

the transaction eases the threat of involuntary bankruptcy 
which has dogged the company since it missed a 51 million interest 
payment in june said robert j amman president and chief 
executive officer but it does not end its problems 
we have made it clear to the companys creditors that further 
refinancing of debt will be required in 1991 amman said in a

mean selling more assets offering new deals to investors or 
securing new financing

amman said the transaction with atampt was a turning point for 
western union one of the nations oldest companies and a pioneer 
in the telegram and telex businesses 
with the sale the company is no longer a 
telecommunications carrier and can focus its efforts on providing 
valueadded services in areas where its strengths can be brought to 
bear most effectively most notably our financial services 
business which includes the western union money transfer 
services amman said 
atampt plans to create a new unit combining business communication 
services it previously offered with western unions telex and easy 
link electronic mail services said linda haertlein an atampt 
spokeswoman 
the products we have although essentially the same have 
separate customer bases and have been focused to some extent on 
different industries we plan to continue both product lines and 
eventually develop a new line that brings the best of the new lines 
together she said 
western union is retaining its priority services division which 
provides mailgram priority letter and custom letter services
