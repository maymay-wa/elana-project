president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev anticipated a more relaxed round of summit talks at the 
camp david presidential retreat today after sealing an array of 
superpower agreements on longrange nuclear weapons chemical arms 
and surprisingly trade 
the world has waited long enough the cold war must end 
declared bush at an elaborate signing ceremony friday in the ornate 
east room of the white house 
at a midsummit scene framed by soviet and american flags 
gorbachev said the achievements represent an event of momentous 
importance not only for our two countries but for the world 
agreements aside the two men laid out an ambitious negotiating 
agenda for the balance of the year and success could mean another 
summit or perhaps two they expressed the hope they could seal the 
formal treaty on longrange nuclear weapons and agree to a 
reduction in conventional forces in europe 
secretary of state james a baker iii also said both sides had 
made a commitment to a followup round of arms control talks to 
cover cuts in heavy missiles with multiple warheads 
summit disagreements persisted over german unification and 
lithuania although baker said talks had produced an understanding 
of each others concerns 
bush and gorbachev with one more full day of bargaining on their 
summit agenda were heading for the camp david compound in 
marylands catoctin mountains said gorbachev theres a lot of 
fresh air there and i think well work and complete our 
discussions 
baker said the two presidents would discuss regional conflicts 
during the day presumably including afghanistan and well as talk 
about perestroika and the prospects for improved economic ties 
between the united states and soviet union 
the summit ends on sunday with a joint news conference gorbachev 
is making stops in minnesota and california on his way home he is 
expected to meet with south korean president roh taewoo while on 
the west coast in an apparent bid to improve relations with a key 
potential trading partner 
bush and gorbachev did their work as their wives flew to boston 
for the day together barbara bush and raisa gorbachev attended 
commencement ceremonies at wellesley college before taking frontrow 
seats at the white house signing ceremony and then joining their 
husbands and aides for dinner at the soviet embassy 
in his toast bush said because americans are so free to dream 
we feel a special kinship with those who dream of being free and 
today that kinship is quickly becoming a shared spirit a spirit 
that inspires millions here in our nation in your own and around 
the world 
gorbachev for his part paid a special salute to bush for 
signing the trade agreement he said it takes on special relevance 
since it has been concluded at a time of a dramatic change of 
direction in the soviet economy which is crucial for the future of 
perestroika 
roast duck suckling pig and apple puff pastry were on the menu 
the trade pact was the surprise of fridays summitry a day of 
intense behind the scenes negotiations 
at one point white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said snags 
had developed in the framework to cut longrange nuclear weapons by 
up to 35 percent but secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze went back to work and 
nailed down the framework expected to form the basis for a formal 
treaty in the future 
gorbachev pressed his case for a trade agreement forcefully and 
told congressional leaders he was hoping for a gesture that would 
bolster his troubled drive to institute a freemarket economy back 
home 
i think he feels if he doesnt get it hes going home empty 
handed said senate republican leader bob dole one of several 
congressional officials who heard gorbachevs request 
the soviets also balked at signing an agreement to purchase us 
grain a deal favored by american farmers unless the broader 
trade pact was approved 
in the end it too received signatures the deal commits the 
soviets to buy at least 10 million tons annually starting next 
year of us wheat feed grains and soybeans that is an increase 
of one million tons annually from the current agreement 
gorbachev wanted the broader treaty pact because it will 
facilitate investment in the soviet union by american companies 
the trade agreement also is a step toward granting 
mostfavorednation status to moscow providing the lowest possible 
tariffs on soviet goods baker said the pact would not be sent to 
congress until the soviets approved liberalized emigration 
legislation 
there was no mention at the signing ceremony of any condition 
that the kremlin lessen its economic restrictions on the breakaway 
soviet republic of lithuania that dismayed lithuanian americans 
demonstrating across the street arunas martinonis of boston said 
bush is letting democracy and independence down 
also unmentioned at the signing ceremony was germany the two 
presidents agreed on thursday they would be unable for the duration 
of the summit to resolve their disputes over the military shape of a 
unified germany but baker and shevardnadze will go back to work on 
that issue next week 
heralding the pact to cut stockpiles of poison gas bush said 
let this landmark agreement quickly lead to a global ban on 
chemical weapons negotiations are under way among 40 nations for 
a worldwide treaty 
other agreements signed by the two sides covered verification of 
nuclear test limits signed in the 1970s a pact on atomic energy 
cooperation and one covering maritime transportation other topics 
covered include reciprocal cultural and information centers in 
washington and moscow and the first governmenttogovernment 
agreement to increase student exchanges between the two countries

president bush gave soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev the economic prize he sought from the summit a signed 
trade agreement but whether the accord will ever take effect is 
far from certain 
for one thing bush set conditions on whether he will even submit 
the document to congress for ratification 
and once that hurdle is cleared members of congress were warning 
that they are in no mood to approve the accord unless gorbachev 
eases his economic blockade of independenceminded lithuania 
the united states will not give new trade benefits while the 
soviet noose continues to strangle lithuania said sen alfonse 
damato rny an outspoken backer of the breakaway baltic 
republic 
the administration had tried on its own to pressure gorbachev to 
make concessions on lithuania before it signed the trade agreement 
but in the end bush decided not to send gorbachev back to moscow 
emptyhanded 
gorbachev struggling at home with empty store shelves and a 
variety of economic ills had made the trade agreement an important 
symbol of his ability to improve economic relations with the west 
the trade agreement is a necessary condition for lowering tariffs 
on soviet products sold in the united states levies that are 
currently as high as 10 times the rate imposed on goods from nations 
which enjoy the mostfavorednation trade status 
american business groups had lobbied for approval of the trade 
agreement because the pact contains a variety of provisions aimed at 
expanding opportunities for us companies in the soviet union 
these provisions would make it easier for american companies to 
establish joint ventures with soviet companies a key goal of 
gorbachevs efforts to attract western expertise 
the outcome of the trade treaty was in doubt throughout a lengthy 
day of bargaining friday also signed was a fiveyear grain 
agreement which had become a bargaining chip in the battle over 
trade 
an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said that intense debate was taking place on the grain and trade 
proposals with the soviets threatening to block the grain agreement 
advantageous to us farmers if they didnt get the trade pact 
they sought 
referring to american reaction to the soviet crackdown on 
lithuanian independence efforts gorbachev told the white house 
audience i am pleased to note that the turbulent developments in 
recent months after the summit at malta have not led us astray 
from the goals that we set together 
but secretary of state james a baker iii briefing reporters 
later acknowledged that the required passage of the trade agreement 
by congress will be difficult unless gorbachev starts a new dialogue 
with lithuanian leaders 
baker also said that the trade agreement will not be sent to 
congress for ratification until the soviet legislature passes an 
emigration law allowing more liberal travel abroad 
soviet officials said approval of the emigration measure will not 
be a problem although its final passage by the supreme soviet has 
been delayed several times 
once the soviet legislature acts the administration said that it 
will send the trade agreement to congress and will also submit a 
presidential certification that the soviets are eligible for the 
mostfavorednation status 
both the trade agreement and the presidential declaration must be 
approved by congress for the lower tariffs to go into effect 
signaling a fight unless gorbachev relents on lithuania senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine said the granting of 
mfn status in my mind is in mr gorbachevs hands he can achieve 
it with some rather modest changes in his policy toward the baltic 
states 
lithuanianamerican demonstrators massed outside the soviet 
embassy in washington were clearly disappointed with bushs decision 
i think hes letting democracy and independence down said 
arunas martinonis of boston it really upsets me 
bush should be stronger about lithuania latvia and estonia 
said helen zimavicus carter who drove 15 hours from her chicago 
home to join the protest were really shocked he doesnt stand up 
for their rights 
in addition to the trade agreement several other accords were 
signed on friday these included 
expanding commercial air travel between the united states and 
the soviet union by adding four american and six soviet cities to 
current airliner routes 
a new 5year atomic energy agreement to provide closer 
cooperation in nuclear reactor safety fusion energy and basic 
atomic science 
a maritime transportation pact to make it easier for us and 
soviet commercial vessels to deliver goods to ports in one anothers 
country 
opening reciprocal cultural and information centers in 
washington and moscow 
the first governmenttogovernment agreement to increase student 
exchanges between the two countries

mikhail s gorbachev topped an embassy dinner 
of suckling pig and apple puff pastry with special thanks to 
president bush for a new ussoviet trade agreement he said would 
hearten his hardpressed countrymen 
this agreement takes on special relevance since it has been 
concluded at a time of a dramatic change of direction in the soviet 
economy which is crucial for the future of perestroika gorbachev 
said at the dinner friday night for bush and his wife barbara

that the united states the president of the united states is

relations at this moment of special importance for our country

stockpiles of longrange nuclear missiles 
bush in his toast said he had learned that gorbachevs home 
town in the northern caucasus was called privolnoe which he said 
means spacious or free that prompted a smile from the soviet 
president and bush apologized for his pronunciation

that weve seen sweep across europe and around the globe bush 
said 
because americans are so free to dream we feel a special 
kinship with those who dream of being free and today that kinship 
is quickly becoming a shared spirit a spirit that inspires millions 
here in our nation in your own and around the world 
the stately but fraying embassy a few blocks from the white 
house was so wrapped in security that bulletproof frames of glass 
were placed outside the streetside windows legions of security men 
inside shoved reporters and photographers back into place when they 
took a step beyond their assigned area or lingered for a backward 
glance at the dinner hall 
in deference to soviet custom bush and the other americans wore 
dark business suits rather than the tuxedos customary at such 
formal dinners and the women wore normallength dresses 
mrs bush seated at the head table between gorbachev and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze wore a fuchsia kneelength 
dress with a flouncy skirt

buckling up will soon bring an 
unexpected bonus in the netherlands where police and a road safety 
group plan to hand out compact disc players to drivers who obey the 
seat belt law 
the scheme to distribute 100 of the disc players among 
lawabiding drivers has already come under fire 
wearing seat belts is the law and its the polices job to see 
the law is obeyed the rotterdam newspaper algemeen dagblad said 
friday whats next a pocket calculator for those who obey the 
speed limit 
volunteers of the governmentsubsidized road safety foundation 
will join police patrols in this northern province next month and 
present disc players at random to those found wearing seat belts 
foundation spokesman anne van schepen said 
cd players are the in thing these days so people will wear 
their safety belts if thats what it takes to win one van schepen 
said in an interview 
seat belts have been obligatory for all drivers and frontseat 
passengers since 1971 
but according to the foundations statistics only 77 percent of 
dutch drivers wear them on highways and the figure drops to 63 
percent in builtup areas 
every percentage point increase in seat belt use translates 
into two to three fewer deaths each year van schepen said auto 
accidents claim 1400 lives each year in this nation of 146 million

successful negotiations at the summit have 
carried the united states and the soviet union closer to concluding 
a treaty this year to reduce their strategic nuclear weapons 
arsenals 
but they remain far apart on another accord to withdraw tens of 
thousands of troops and tanks in europe 
serious substantive differences remain secretary of state 
james a baker iii said friday night but he added that both sides 
are committed to resolving them by the end of the year 
the key unsettled issue is the kind of aircraft to restrict 
also the soviets are still reluctant to approve the reductions 
without limits on german forces 
a senior us official who declined identification offered no 
prediction of success and said the united states would not yield on 
its insistence on nato membership for a unified germany 
the success in the strategic nuclear weapons field resulted from 
six days of negotiations that began last sunday at the state 
department 
the us and soviet teams headed by under secretary of state 
reginald bartholomew and deputy prime minister viktor p karpov 
began with six key issues and settled two of them 
as a result the soviets will be banned from putting their heavy 
groundbased ss18 missiles on mobile launchers and the two sides 
will be limited to 1100 warheads on their mobile missiles 
the ban will not affect the us mx missile because it is not 
considered a heavy missile the us official told reporters at a 
briefing under rules that bars identifying him 
second to ensure the treaty is carried out each side will 
conduct 12 kinds of onsite inspections some of them on short 
notice 
left unsettled and to be taken up by us and soviet 
negotiators in geneva are whether to limit flight tests of the 
soviet ss18 missiles or to limit the soviet backfire bomber and 
the restrictions to be imposed on diverting banned weapons to third 
countries 
the sixth issue whether to ban intercontinental ballistic 
missiles with multiple warheads will be considered in followon 
negotiations after the strategic arms reduction treaty is concluded 
the objectives of these negotiations will be to reduce further 
the risk of outbreak of war particularly nuclear war the two 
sides said in a joint statement 
the new talks will begin without delay once the strategic 
arms reduction treaty start is signed the statement said 
baker who joined the negotiations on friday with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze said we made workmanlike progress 
over the full spectrum of arms issues 
he referred also to completion of an agreement to end the 
production of us and soviet chemical weapons 
a senior american official disclosed meanwhile that earlier in 
the week the soviets had renewed their longabandoned effort to 
require limits on the us strategic defense initiative popularly 
known as star wars in conjunction with cuts in offensive weapons 
it was clearly an effort to change the status quo the 
official said it sort of slowed us up and we had to push them 
back he said

the us environmental protection agency 
friday abandoned an effort to revoke north carolinas authority to 
regulate hazardous waste in a move some participants said could 
have nationwide implications 
the decision by daniel w mcgovern the epas regional 
administrator in san francisco upholds the states right to adopt 
environmental laws that are more stringent than federal standards 
it also could scuttle plans by laidlaw environmental services 
co formerly gsx chemical services co to build a massive 
regional hazardouswaste treatment facility near laurinburg in 
scotland county 
at issue in the case was whether a state law prevented 
hazardouswaste treatment plants from operating in the state in 
essence the law requires such plants to dilute each gallon of 
treated wastewater with at least 1000 gallons of water before 
discharging into rivers and streams 
gsx and the hazardous waste treatment council an industry trade 
group asked the epa to revoke the states authority to manage 
hazardous wastes after the general assembly passed the law in 1987 
gsx contended that the law was arbitrary and was primarily aimed at 
preventing the company from building its treatment plant in scotland 
county 
state and local officials said the law was designed to protect 
drinking water the proposed gsx plant would have discharged as much 
as 500000 gallons of treated waste daily into the lumber river the 
main water supply for lumberton and much of robeson county 
the epa held a series of hearings last year on issue 
the final decision was left to the epa official in san francisco 
because greer c tidwell the epas southeastern regional 
administrator in atlanta requested an independent decisionmaker 
he was criticized as partial to the industries involved in the case 
hopefully this will spell the end to the gsx proposal said 
the rev f mac legerton executive director of the center for 
community action a lumbertonbased group that has fought the 
proposed plant for six years 
this was not just a notinmyownbackyard campaign he said 
the gsx proposal raised serious questions about massive discharges 
into a very small river that remains a public drinking water 
source 
the epa decision has farreaching implications he said because 
it reaffirms a states right to pass laws that are more stringent 
than federal ones 
the company has yet to decide if it will appeal said spokesman 
roger e davis from laidlaws headquarters in columbia sc 
the decision doesnt rule out the plant he said but it would 
force the company to build a much smaller version that might not be 
economically feasible 
if we cant get permits to build these facilities there is 
insufficient and inadequate treatment of the waste he said 
since were not going to shut off the production of hazardous 
waste totally the environment is going to suffer

nasa officials fear shuttle 
columbias astronomy mission already delayed until midjune may 
not get off the ground until july because of a hydrogen leak 
the agency plans to pump supercold liquid hydrogen into 
columbias external tank next wednesday to duplicate temperature and 
pressure conditions under which hydrogen leaked during fueling six 
hours before the scheduled launch last wednesday 
that looks like the only way we can find it brewster shaw 
the national aeronautics and space administrations deputy director 
of shuttle operations said friday 
but the agency was not terribly optimistic that the new test 
will pinpoint a cause that can be fixed easily while the shuttle 
remains at the launch pad shaw said 
its worth our while to do the test and find the leak its not 
good to roll back to the hangar not knowing where the leak is 
he said 
the 36th shuttle mission already was two weeks behind schedule 
because of cooling system repairs when the latest snag arose 
returning columbia to the hangar would push the mission into july 
nasa spent thursday and friday searching columbias engine 
compartment for the hydrogen leak columbias external tank was 
drained of fuel and filled with nonflammable helium but no leak 
was found 
engineers are fairly certain the leak is in or near a 17inch 
valve in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen from 
the external tank to the shuttles main engines nasa spokesman 
bruce buckingham said 
traces of helium were found friday in a tight cavity between two 
metal plates that connect the shuttle and its external tank the 
valve and pipe run through both plates 
nasa planned today to circulate helium through the shuttles 
entire fuel system in preparation of wednesdays tanking test 
shaw said columbias seven astronauts are anxious to go fly 
their mission but you cant go until your rides ready so theyll 
just keep training and try and keep their spirits up 
columbias payload is a 150 million observatory called astro 
that will examine ultraviolet light and xrays from extremely hot 
stars galaxies and other objects 
ten miles from where columbia stood silent nasa launched the 
unmanned delta rocket friday the rocket boosted into orbit a west 
german observatory with a powerful xray telescope and a widefield 
camera capable of detecting extreme ultraviolet light

an observatory intended to probe 
cosmic xrays orbited 360 miles above earth today after a trip into 
space on an unmanned rocket 
nasa launched the delta rocket friday as space shuttle columbia 
stood nearby grounded until at least midjune by an engine leak 
that aborted an astronomy mission wednesday 
the space agencys arthur mackey said the delta launch went off 
without a glitch 
they did a beautiful job put it right where it was supposed to 
be he said after the spacecraft separated from its booster 43 
minutes into the flight 
the delta rocket blasted into a partly cloudy sky at 547 pm 
edt from cape canaveral air force station liftoff was delayed about 
12 minutes so a commercial airliner could move out of the launch 
danger area 
confirmation that the spacecraft had separated and was safe in 
its orbit was delayed by a brief loss of radio contact 
the 273 million west german observatory called rosat 
originally was to have flown on a shuttle in 1987 it was redesigned 
to fit into the delta after the 1986 challenger explosion meant 
waiting until the mid1990s for a shuttle ride 
astronomers expect rosat to identify 100000 sources of cosmic 
xrays which cannot penetrate the earths atmosphere and thus are 
invisible from the ground only about 1000 sources currently are 
known to exist 
this will be the fodder that scientists will use for years to 
come to identify targets for future study said nasa program 
scientist alan n bunner 
the satellite consists of a powerful xray telescope and a 
widefield camera capable of detecting extreme ultraviolet light 
after two months of instrument calibration rosat will begin a 
sixmonth survey of celestial bodies that emit xrays it will be 
the first fullsky survey by an imaging xray telescope 
following the survey the observatory will spend the next year or 
more making detailed observations of extremely hot stars black 
holes and remnants of supernovas hot clouds produced by exploding 
stars at the end of their lives 
there will be 1457 targets during the first six months alone 
said joachim truemper rosat program scientist for west germanys 
federal ministry for research and technology 
information will be transmitted to a ground station near munich 
west germany then sent for analysis to centers in that country the 
united states and britain 
rosat is 100 times more sensitive than the best xray observatory 
to date the socalled einstein observatory which was placed in 
orbit in 1978 bunner said rosat will complement the work of the 
xray telescope that is part of the astro observatory waiting to be 
launched from columbia 
nasa is picking up the 63 million cost of the mcdonnell douglas 
delta ii rocket and related launch expenses the united states also 
has contributed 18 million toward the 273 million cost of rosat 
great britain has chipped in 35 million 
rosat is short for roentgen satellite named after german 
scientist wilhelm conrad rontgen who discovered xrays in 1895

a handful of baptist ministers complained 
that pat conroys use of profanity in some of his bestselling 
novels made him unsuitable as furman universitys commencement 
speaker 
conroy whose books include the lords of discipline the 
prince of tides and the great santini was to give furmans 
commencement address today 
the clergymen sent protest letters to john e johns president of 
the private college of 2500 students founded by baptists and 
supported by the south carolina baptist convention 
i have nothing against pat conroy but with furman supposedly 
being a christian and a southern baptist school i dont think he 
should be receiving an honorary degree said david satterwhite a 
minister at roebuck baptist church in spartanburg 
johns said the college was honoring conroy as an outstanding 
novelist and script writer and would not withdraw the invitation 
conroy on friday welcomed the ministers to his speech 
it will probably be a far more interesting speech than the 
sermons they give on sunday he said

prisoners in other states whittle away the 
hours stamping out license plates inmates in a wyoming program do 
their time in the saddle or trying to stay in the saddle as they 
break wild horses 
gary starbuck superintendent of the wyoming honor farm said the 
2yearold horsebreaking program molds inmates into more productive 
citizens than do prison cells 
some say theyve got it too easy its a country club they 
want to see them do hard time starbuck said as he kept an eye on 
the broncobusting recently at the sprawling treestudded 
corrections ranch 
but what you end up with is someone bitter probably harder on 
drugs than when he got there thats been the problem with 
corrections for 200 years its punishmentoriented he said 
the prison horsebreaking program is one of four in the united 
states but the only one that breaks horses enough that they can be 
ridden not just led by a halter the horses then are offered for 
adoption by the public for 125 each 
the program is so popular among inmates that the first thing 
they want when they get here is boots and a cowboy hat said honor 
farm staff supervisor billy eppler 
in wyoming one might presume there would be an abundance of 
incarcerated cowboys bucking for a chance to get back to their 
lifes work breaking horses not so there is a shortage of 
qualified ranch hands in wyoming and most of the eight inmates now 
breaking horses knew nothing about the animals before they were 
convicted 
they learned fast 
he kicked me in the head today inmate joe trotter a chicago 
cabinetmaker convicted of a drug charge said of blade one of the 
wild horses the bureau of land management rounds up from wyomings 
open ranges 
it makes me all the more determined to ride him its just a 
little bit dangerous thats all he said 
ever since i was a little kid i thought of being like a cowboy 
of the old west ive got it here said inmate jim wiggins who is 
doing time for burglary 
i never picked up a horses foot before i got here when i get 
out i want to keep working with horses 
each inmate in the program produces four to six rideable horses a 
month the horse taming is one of several agriculture programs at 
the central wyoming corrections farm the other 100 or so inmates 
herd cattle and raise pigs or work in the dairy or butcher shop 
but the wild horse program is considered the most prestigious 
assignment among prisoners it also is lauded by state corrections 
officials as a productive method of instilling a sense of 
accomplishment selfconfidence and pride 
if they havent accomplished anything in their life if they 
break a horse thats a real accomplishment eppler said 
the inmates some serving time for rape and murder are 
considered a low risk for escape from the minimumsecurity prison 
the only obstacle to freedom at the scenic ranch in the wind 
river basin is a split rail fence and a row of cottonwood trees 
trotter believes hes a better man for his newfound skill of 
breaking horses but he cant help but desire freedom 
you get to thinking sitting up there on my horse the 
mountains are looking pretty good i could just take off he said 
but its not like you can ride off into the sunset and forget 
about it theyll catch up to you you might as well stay put

a 2yearold boys death in a pennsylvania 
crash has prompted an investigation into possible rearseat defects 
in some chrysler minivans the national highway traffic safety 
administration says 
chrysler spokesman tom jakobowski said the company is cooperating 
but does not believe the seats are defective 
we have 2 millionplus minivans out there and we know of no 
specific problems with the rear seats jakobowski said friday 
the investigation will focus on dodge caravans and plymouth 
voyagers manufactured in the 198689 model years agency spokesman 
tim hurd said it is classified as a preliminary evaluation which 
consists mostly of paperwork 
if evidence of a widespread problem is found the investigation 
will be upgraded and government engineers will study the possibly 
defective parts eventually a recall could be ordered 
chrysler manufactures more than half the minivans sold in the 
united states introduced in the 1984 model year they are marketed 
as the dodge caravan plymouth voyager and chrysler town amp country 
the government has received six complaints about the minivans 
involving three accidents four injuries and one death hurd said 
noah z george of washington county pa died feb 11 after the 
1987 voyager in which he was riding crashed he was strapped in a 
booster seat secured to the rear seat by a seat belt 
the impact tore open the vans rear lift gate and the back seat 
collapsed noah was thrown about 35 feet into a stream where he 
died of exposure 
a coroners jury ruled the seat was flimsy and poorly 
constructed and is unsafe for public use farrell jackson coroner 
of washington county said in a letter to consumer activist ralph 
nader jackson called the minivans a potential death trap 
jakobowski said the minivans exceed federal standards for 
rearseat construction 
but mike johnson spokesman for the naderfounded center for auto 
safety said the federal standards were inadequate the minivans 
should be recalled and the seats reinforced he said

many small alternative operator service 
companies are not following federal rules designed to protect the 
traveling public from misrepresentations and overcharges government 
regulators say 
the companies provide telephone operators and longdistance 
services for many pay phones in public places as well as phones in 
hotels airports hospitals schools and other places 
significant problems continue in the operator services 
market the federal communications commission said despite its 
february 1989 order establishing minimum disclosure requirements for 
five of the companies 
the commission said friday it would use findings of an audit 
april 10 and 11 of 971 phones at 351 public places to prepare an 
investigation of the operator services industry 
congress also is considering restrictions including price 
controls on the operator companies which have flourished since the 
atampt breakup opened competition in the 12 billion market for 
assisted phone calls 
the operator services companies contract with businesses to 
handle their dial 0 longdistance service for telephones used by 
their customers 
the operator companies then lease circuits from longdistance 
carriers such as atampt us sprint and mci and pay a commission to 
their partners who own the phones 
critics claim this arrangement invites inflated charges 
before it acted last year the commission had received thousands 
of complaints from travelers who said they sometimes were 
overcharged two or three times what their regular longdistance 
company would charge they also said they werent informed of who 
was handling their calls and that they got bills from places they 
never visited 
in its 1989 order the fcc required that the operator companies 
identify themselves to callers orally and that they place written 
notices with their names and addresses on or near the telephones 
they served 
the companies also were prohibited from blocking callers from 
reaching their own longdistance companies and from billing 
customers calls from cities other than the one where the call 
originated 
operator services officials in february told a senate 
subcommittee that the industry was beginning to police itself and 
follow the fcc rules but in its april 1011 survey the fcc said it 
found 
operators identified their companies orally 87 percent of the 
time but only 20 out of 971 phones fully complied with the 
requirement for written notices more than 30 percent of the phones 
failed to identify the operator services provider and in more than 
200 cases the name on the written material was not that of the 
company providing the service 
blocking of access to the customers longdistance service 
occurred 40 percent of the time 
the audit indicates that the phones surveyed vary widely in 
their compliance with the federal requirements and confirms the 
commissions assessment based on complaints received that 
significant problems continue in the operator services market the 
commission said

a judge refused to stop the collection of 
about 50 million in surcharges from auto insurance companies under 
the states new insurancereform law 
but state supreme court justice daniel j ohern left the door 
open friday for an appeal to be reviewed by the full supreme court 
next week 
under the law the state plans to collect 14 billion in 
surcharges during the next seven years the surcharges are intended 
to help reduce a 3 billion debt incurred by the joint underwriting 
association pool for highrisk drivers 
insurance companies say the surcharges are unconstitutional 
because they cant charge higher premiums to cover the additional 
cost 
attorneys for the state say the new law does not prevent 
insurance companies from making a reasonable profit but they say 
the insurance companies must help pay for the large highriskpool 
debt which gov jim florio maintains the insurance industry helped 
create 
state farm mutual automobile insurance co initiated the appeal 
to block the first surcharge payment which was due friday state 
farm the states third largest insurer was to pay 65 million 
florio who advocated the reform law praised oherns ruling 
the decision reinforces my confidence that the 
constitutionality of the law will be upheld the governor said 
i am pleased that we can move on with the task of bringing real 
relief to the states drivers 
david f snyder an attorney for the american insurance 
association also saw reason for optimism in the ruling 
we are encouraged by the serious review the state supreme court 
is giving to our concerns said snyder we believe the law will 
ultimately be determined unconstitutional

investigators took on an alleged mobled gambling 
operation that relied on computers and displayed a little 
sophistication of their own they tapped a fax machine 
when they get a copy we get a copy queens district attorney 
john santucci said thursday after authorities claimed to have broken 
up a 50 million gambling ring in queens brooklyn and long island 
technology is available to the criminal element he said 
we have to stay abreast of the new technology 
until recently criminals were succeeding in hiding many of their 
transactions with computers and fax machines but then investigators 
learned how to tap the fax phone line santucci said 
in raids wednesday and thursday city police and prosecutors 
arrested 40 men and women at 17 fake storefronts and two apartments 
seized 50000 in cash and 80 slot machines computers and phones 
there was a time when the work was carried in brown paper 
bags said police inspector frank biehler these vast amounts of 
money are beyond manual means fax machines eliminate people having 
to carry gambling records through the streets 
infiltrating the operation was difficult because this is 
basically the first time weve found such sophisticated computer 
equipment in a numbers operation biehler said 
among those arrested were alleged associates of the gambino 
organized crime family including carmelo amato 35 of valley 
stream ny santucci said 
the raids made a serious dent in the gambino crime family he 
said 
but authorities said the raids would do little to curb the 
publics appetite for the illegal business 
theres still a part of the public that insists on doing 
business with the illegal bookmakers santucci said we close 
them today and unless we get really successful theyre open again 
tomorrow

about 50 soviet jews who have been denied 
permission to emigrate rallied in downtown moscow demanding that 
their plight not be ignored as us and soviet leaders meet in 
washington 
refuseniks are the hostages of perestroika read banners and 
posters at the protest shame on antisemitism 
the halfhour demonstration friday on a puddlefilled square in 
front of the lenin library was timed to coincide with one in 
washington it occurred with little harassment from soviet 
authorities 
two vans filled with police were parked nearby several 
plainclothes police who made little attempt to hide their 
walkietalkies milled in the crowd but only one uniformed officer 
walked up to the demonstrators and asked them to disperse he walked 
away when protesters showed they had applied fro permission 
our demonstration is synchronized with a demonstration in 
washington we insist that our human rights are violated said 
mike shapiro who said he has been denied an emigration visa even 
though he stopped his secret work for the soviet government more 
than 12 years ago 
stephen cohen of palm beach fla a member of the board of 
directors of the union of councils for soviet jews said there are 
400 to 500 families of jews who have been refused permission to 
emigrate because soviet officials say they have knowledge of state 
secrets 
in november the supreme soviet legislature gave preliminary 
approval to a bill that allows emigration for virtually anyone who 
has entry permission from another country and no outstanding alimony 
obligations criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets 
it sets a limit of five years on the period a citizen can be kept 
from emigrating because of access to secrets 
but jewish activists claim that the bill is vaguely worded and 
might still be used to restrict emigration 
the bill has not yet come up for a final vote the united states 
is withholding action on loosening trade sanctions on the soviet 
union until the immigration law is passed 
leonid stonov one longtime refusenik who was told in recent 
weeks that he will be allowed to emigrate in august said 
antisemitism is on the rise and that he sees a difficult future for 
jews in the soviet union 
all the jewish culture jewish tradition jewish life 
everything was ruined here during the stalin era and brezhnev era 
there is no basement no foundation for establishing here a real 
jewish life he said 
mark m kotlyar a refusenik from kiev was asked how he felt 
when he saw president mikhail s gorbachev cheered on the streets of 
washington this week he said it was a difficult question to answer 
on the one hand its important that people be friendly that 
they meet our leaders that they give them a warm reception 
kotlyar said but on the other hand i think that they are too 
rapturous about gorbachev he is not that good he is not

investigators suspect a black emory university 
freshman faked racist threats she said she received but prosecutors 
said they lacked evidence to press charges 
dekalb county solicitor ralph bowden said friday he felt 
premedical student sabrina collins needs counseling and treatment 
not prosecution 
ms collins 19 was hospitalized after she collapsed and became 
mute april 10 
her family said she had lifted a rug in her room and found the 
words die nigger die scribbled in nail polish on the floor 
the incident ignited a campus controversy at a time of growing 
reports of racism at colleges around the country 
ms collins also had reported receiving other threats including 
one in a typewritten letter sent through campus mail 
but almost as soon as the georgia bureau of investigation began 
looking into collins allegations evidence suggested she staged the 
episodes herself a police file released friday said 
the typewritten death threat misspelled the word youre and 
the report said only ms collins could have written it 
the case file said your as opposed to youre is a 
grammatical mistake that sabrina frequently makes emory police 
gave gbi investigators a sample of ms collins handwriting that 
read tammy your the best 
the typewriter used to type the letter is the same type as 
typewriters in the library where sabrina works all identifiable 
fingerprints on the letter were sabrinas fingerprints the 
fingerprints pattern on the letter indicates sabrina put the letter 
in the typewriter and removed it the report said 
ms collins attorney james howard was not available for 
comment friday on thursday he maintained his client did not harass 
herself and that the person responsible for the racial epithets was 
free to do so again and had succeeded in avoiding investigation 
emory spokeswoman jan gleason said university officials do not 
intend to press charges against ms collins

even some students who had protested 
first lady barbara bushs selection as wellesley colleges 
commencement speaker praised her address which ended with an ironic 
comment on first spousehood 
mrs bush appeared with raisa gorbachev at fridays ceremony and 
later credited the soviet first lady with the warm reception they 
received calling her my secret weapon 
mrs bush stressed the importance of family life in her speech to 
the graduating women but she received the loudest cheers when she 
closed saying somewhere out in this audience may even be someone 
who will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the white 
house as the presidents spouse i wish him well 
one of the 575 seniors had painted on her mortar board barbara 
bush for president 1992 another wore a picture of president and 
mrs bush with the first lady dressed in a suit and power tie the 
president wearing a dress 
last month 150 of wellesleys 2200 students signed a petition 
complaining that mrs bushs selection as speaker ran counter to the 
schools philosophy that women should be honored for their own 
career achievements 
mrs bush dropped out of college to marry george bush as world 
war ii raged a continent away and has been known best as a 
supportive wife and mother 
in her speech mrs bush who wore a black academic robe with a 
purple cowl urged the graduates to pursue professional careers if 
they wish 
but she said at the end of your life you will never regret 
not having passed one more test winning one more verdict or not 
closing one more deal you will regret time not spent with a 
husband a child a friend or a parent 
i thought it was lovely and i was one who signed the 
petition said betsy pollard 21 a graduating senior from pepper 
pike ohio as she sat with the other graduates after mrs bush and 
mrs gorbachev spoke 
i was very moved by it i thought she was great pollard said 
not all the protesters were appeased though 
barbara bush made choices and i respect those choices but i 
think she was asked to come here because she is the wife of the 
president said patricia hawkins 32 of deer park ny 
speaking second mrs gorbachev gave a serious but upbeat talk 
on the virtues of soviet perestroika and the economic reforms 
undertaken by her husband president mikhail s gorbachev

future we have to give a good deal of credit for that to women 
said mrs gorbachev a former university lecturer who has a phd in 
philosophy 
seniors arriving for the ceremony found letters on their chairs 
urging mrs bush to be a stronger proponent of womens issues 
the authors also distributed armbands of purple the class color 
to be worn by students sympathetic with the letter 
the letter said that in honoring barbara bush as our 
commencement speaker we celebrate all the unknown women who have 
dedicated their lives to the service of others the purple armbands 
you see today are in honor of these very women 
when college president nan keohane cited that section in her 
remarks loud applause erupted mrs gorbachev and mrs bush smiled 
broadly and clasped hands 
later the first ladies toured downtown boston pausing for a 
stop at the public garden near beacon hill 
there mrs gorbachev told reporters i belong to the people 
who believe that children and family are very important to women 
mrs gorbachev who has a daughter acknowleged that many women 
now feel otherwise 
its one of the great controversies of our time she said

a biotechnology company that nearly gave up 
looking for an aids vaccine three years ago now says it has made a 
vaccine that protected chimpanzees from the human aids virus 
our scientists just didnt give up jack murphy spokesman 
for genentech inc of south san francisco said friday 
we have fairly high hopes for this but it will take years to 
develop anything that could protect humans from aids murphy said 
this right now is more of a scientific development and certainly 
not a breakthrough 
dr daniel f hoth who directs the aids division at the national 
institutes of allergy and infectious diseases in bethesda md 
called the genentech findings a potentially very important step 
its another brick in the wall we are building to show that an 
aids vaccine is feasible hoth said 
the us food and drug administration must approve the vaccine 
for testing on humans before further research can begin genentech 
officials said 
the company had virtually abandoned similar research in 1987 
after making no headway until recently researchers were only able 
to protect chimpanzees from a simian form of the aids virus but not 
the human virus itself murphy said 
the genentech vaccine is among several being developed in hopes 
of finding a way protect people from contracting acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome which leaves victims vulnerable to deadly 
cancers and ailments 
more than 80000 americans have died from aids since it was first 
reported in the early 1980s 
vaccines dont cure a disease but prevent those who have been 
vaccinated from becoming infected 
the genentech vaccine is genetically engineered as are two other 
vaccines the fda has approved for testing in people to protect them 
against the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids 
one of the vaccines approved for testing in august 1987 was 
developed by microgenesys inc of west haven conn the second 
developed by bristolmyerssquibb co of new york was approved for 
human trials in november 1987 
dr jonas salk who developed a vaccine for polio also is 
testing an experimental vaccine made from inactivated aids viruses 
that are replicated and dont contain anything that could be 
infectious 
the hardest part about developing these vaccines is theyre 
very specific and work against only one type of virus murphy 
said eventually he said a vaccine must be developed that protects 
against all strains of the disease 
phillip w berman of genentech and jorg eichberg of the southwest 
biomedical research center of san antonio texas developed the 
genentech vaccine for chimpanzees that were housed in texas during 
the experiment 
the research is to be published in the june 14 issue of the 
british medical journal nature genentech got permission from the 
journal to announce the findings early so it could be reported at 
the companys upcoming annual shareholders meeting on june 8 
in the experiment two chimpanzees immunized with the 
experimental vaccine and then injected with the hiv virus remained 
healthy six months afterward an unvaccinated chimp became infected 
within seven weeks the researchers said

hundreds of striking british 
columbia truckers snarled traffic at four uscanada border 
crossings to press for higher pay but new talks were planned to try 
to end the weekold dispute 
the truckers western owners operators association the trucking 
industry and the teamsters union have agreed to go back to the 
bargaining table the provinces solicitor general russ fraser 
said late friday he said he would name a mediator today 
fraser said he has asked truckers to stop blocking the border 
crossings and scale back the strike which has halted grocery 
deliveries in many areas causing spotty shortages around the 
province 
pickets and parked trucks blocked crossings in both directions 
late friday at blaine lynden sumas and oroville wash the 
independent truckers who have been on strike since last weekend 
let passenger cars and noncommercial vehicles through 
royal canadian mounted police reported a bomb threat a broken 
windshield and a severed brake line on one truck 
rick sather a member of the canadian western owneroperators 
association committee overseeing the blockade said some violence 
was regrettable but expected and not encouraged by association 
leadership 
desperate people do desperate things sather said there 
must be 2500 guys out here now and its when the trucks start 
burning that you have to start getting worried a few broken 
windshields aint anything 
fraser would not say why police had not moved in to clear the 
blockades 
there are things we can do if its seen that the law is being 
broken consistently he said refusing to elaborate 
only spotty shortages were reported around the province but some 
said lack of deliveries could make the strike felt in short order 
i would imagine that people are starting to get a little 
shaky said art tonlinson director of services for the bc and 
yukon hotels association going into tourist season it could be 
disastrous 
canadian truckers are demanding an increase in base pay to 40 
canadian per hour they currently earn 26 to 35 canadian per hour 
but they pay for all their own fuel and truck maintenance 
truckers say they cant meet their expenses at current rates 
which they said are lower than they were 10 years ago in us 
dollars the truckers demands are equivalent to 34 per hour and 
their current base wages range from 22 to 29 per hour 
american truckers had differing views on the blockade 
steven boyd vinson of centralia wash said he didnt realize 
the canadian strike meant blocked traffic 
i figured thered just be a bunch of guys on the side of the 
road yelling he said adding he didnt think the blockade was 
doing anybody any good 
im all for it said larry radcliff an oregonbased trucker 
theyve got to get their wages up

anheuserbusch has accused its competitor adoph 
coors co of false advertising for implying that coors beer comes 
from rocky mountain springs when some of it contains virginia water 
in a recent letter to the federal trade commission the st 
louisbased busch said coors produces liquid beer concentrate in 
golden colorado then ships that liquid via railroad tank car more 
than a thousand miles east where local water is added to dilute the 
concentrate prior to packaging 
its a clear matter of consumer deception said busch 
executive vice president michael roarty 
coors spokeswoman anita russell told the denver post in a story 
today that busch was merely trying to discredit the company in the 
competitive beer marketing game 
russell said the ad was accurate and that rocky mountain spring 
water is the companys birthright 
she acknowledged about 14 percent of the companys 177 
millionbarrel beer production in golden last year was shipped as 
concentrate to the companys elkton va plant where water and 
carbonation were added before packaging 
anheuserbusch cos inc is the industry leader with about 42 
percent of the us beer market coors this year passed strohs to 
become the third brewer with 9 percent of the market miller brewing 
co is second with more than 20 percent 
in its complaint to the ftc busch referred to a recent coors 
television advertising campaign in which a voice says clean 
fresh pure rocky mountain spring water next time you reach for a 
beer remember then the screen reads great beers start here 
coors 
claude wild the ftc regional director in denver said he had not

it wasnt exactly pennies from heaven but a juror 
who spotted a river of floating cash thought he stumbled upon a 
godsend 
instead the 20footwide bed of bills was scooped up by federal 
agents who proclaimed the fortune a fake 
us secret service agents believe counterfeiters dumped the 5 
10 and 20 bills into the miami river many of the bills had 
similar serial numbers a detail counterfeiters try to avoid said 
secret service spokesman paul hackenberry 
it must not have been good if they threw it in the river 
said hackenberry 
but the 20000 in fake greenbacks looked pretty real to carlos 
rangel who noticed the bills thursday morning as he arrived for 
jury duty at the metrodade justice building 
the money was floating all over the place he said ive 
never seen so much money in my life

two judges have ordered the overhaul of a 
financially ailing trust fund designed to compensate more than 
130000 victims of asbestosrelated illnesses 
a federal judge and a new york state judge said friday the fund 
set up by the manville corp was out of money and suggested the 
company advance it 200 million to 300 million so it can resume 
payments to victims 
in a joint order the judges ordered manvilles bankruptcy case 
reopened to overhaul the manville personal injury settlement trust 
the judges ordered the trust to make changes in 10 days and said 
that if the bankruptcy court did not resolve the payment plan they 
would impose their ruling at a hearing on july 9 
the trust was formed from the companys 1988 reorganization six 
years after it was driven into bankruptcy court by lawsuits over 
production of asbestos the insulation and building material found 
to cause severe and sometimes fatal illnesses 
the trust came under fire last month because of a cash shortage 
induced by more claims larger payouts and quicker settlements than 
expected the trust told the judges that claimants filing this year 
wouldnt get paid until 2004 
many more than 100000 claimants all over the country and the 
limited assets cry out for a more workable and compassionate 
system us district judge jack b weinstein and new york state 
supreme court judge helen e freedman said in a joint order 
the judges are supervising nearly 500 asbestos lawsuits against 
the trust and other defendants stemming from work at the brooklyn 
navy yard dating to the 1940s 
last month the judges sharply criticized trust management and 
said the bankruptcy court could lift an injunction barring asbestos 
victims from suing manville directly currently only the trust can 
be sued 
on friday they supported keeping the injunction in place if 
changes in the trust are made 
as part of its chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization manville 
placed 25 billion in assets mostly stock into the trust the 
company also agreed to contribute 75 million annually beginning in 
1991 plus 20 percent of annual net income from 1992 until all claims 
are paid 
trust managers told the judges this week it had paid out almost 
all of its 800 million in cash they said the fund has not been 
mismanaged denying claims that hundreds of millions of dollars were 
paid to a few plaintiffs lawyers 
the judges said more than 130000 remaining claims require an 
estimated 65 billion and with incoming claims and costs the 
trust needs at least 75 billion but the trust now is worth only 
about 15 billion they said 
the trust has paid an average of about 42000 on each of the 
first 22000 claims plus 8 percent administrative costs the judges 
said 
denverbased manville issued a statement that it was pleased the 
judges supported continuing the injunction against lawsuits against 
the company 
the company which makes fiberglass and forest construction and 
other products said it is willing to discuss issues related to 
cash flow and liquidity of the trust it declined further comment 
on the court order 
a spokesman for the washington dcbased trust said all 
officials were out of town or in meetings and could not comment on 
the ruling

a jury awarded 287 million in the case of a 
5yearold boy who contracted aids from a blood transfusion the 
boys lawyer said he believed it was the largest award ever in an 
aidsrelated case 
the jury friday awarded 267 million to the boy alex edwards 
and 1 million each to his parents roy and pat edwards 
the jury on may 23 found dr abraham kuruvilla and his clinic 
neonatology associates ltd liable for ordering the transfusion to 
correct severe respiratory problems caused by fluid in the lungs 
the edwards lawyer r douglas dalton had argued that kuruvilla 
should have received consent from the boys parents for the 
transfusion the boys father testified that the couple expressed 
concerns about aids and offered to donate their own blood when the 
boy was given a previous transfusion 
but kuruvillas lawyer duane olson said mrs edwards signed a 
consent form letting doctors treat her son as they saw fit 
dalton said the largest previous verdict he knew of in an 
aidsrelated case was 12 million awarded march 8 in columbus ohio 
to an 8yearold girl who contracted aids from a blood transfusion 
olson said he would seek to overturn the award two other 
defendants a blood bank and the hospital where the transfusion was 
performed settled out of court 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal disease caused by 
a virus that damages the bodys immune system leaving victims

recent flooding along the red river unearthed 
a remarkably wellpreserved canoe buried for 250 years beneath tons 
of silt 
the nearly 25foot long dugout is carved out of a single log of 
what appears to be a cottonwood tree it has a square hull and only 
a part of the bow and a section of bottom are missing 
this is a phenomenal find said bonnie mckee a board member 
of the archaeological conservancy in dallas 
dale moore a farmer in this community about 100 miles northeast 
of dallas made the discovery during a memorial day picnic with his 
family moore and his daughter were fishing when they found the 
canoe upside down on a driedout section of the river bank he said 
i stopped and said have you ever seen a square tree he 
said 
moore who enlisted the help of four friends to move the canoe 
is keeping it soaked down under burlap eventually it will undergo a 
process by which moisture is slowly removed and replaced by a 
strengthening solvent 
jc blaine a museum consultan and specialist in early american 
artifacts said we very rarely get a wooden artifact in this kind 
of shape not only that but this is the largest one of its kind 
the canoe which weighs about 600 pounds is covered with hack 
marks 
they appear to be metal tool marks rather than stone which 
would mean that it was made either by frenchmen or by indians who 
had trade with the french blaine said 
he said the canoe likely comes from between 1730 and 1740 when 
such tools were available 
the indians had lots of wooden tools but we never get to see 
them unless something gets washed out of the river blaine said 
glass and metal stay but wood disintegrates unless it is in water 
blaine said the deteriorated cells of the wood were being held 
together by the water in them which also prevented bacteria from 
attacking 
this never should have come out of the water said blaine 
then again if it hadnt we wouldnt be able to see it

a federal prosecutor met with the man overseeing 
bankrupt eastern airlines to head off a possible indictment of the 
airline for allegedly falsifying maintenance records a source said 
the bankruptcy trustee martin r shugrue met friday afternoon 
with us attorney andrew j maloney according to a highly placed 
law enforcement source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
maloney did not return several calls and declined to comment on 
the investigation earlier in the week 
but the source said shugrue was just trying to convince him not 
to indict the airline 
shugrue reportedly fears any indictments against eastern would 
scare away passengers and possibly torpedo his efforts to save the 
airline 
this is a meeting weve been trying to arrange for quite some 
time and its to present the facts in the case said robin matell 
an eastern spokesman in miami i dont know the nature of the 
talks 
the daily news reported friday that the 10monthold federal 
grand jury investigation concerned with the airlines safety and 
maintenance procedures at kennedy and laguardia airports is nearly 
complete and that several indictments are expected 
the panel is looking into allegations that eastern altered 
maintenance and safety records at the airports as well as 
questionable practices at the hartsfield airport in atlanta the 
airlines largest hub 
one former eastern official at another airport said mechanics 
were routinely certifying that they had tested for water in fuel 
tanks when they had not done so large amounts of water in a fuel 
tank could cause an engine to stall 
according to the news federal investigators were looking into 
whether top eastern officials were aware that eastern managers at 
kennedy and la guardia allegedly ordered mechanics to disregard 
safety guidelines and then falsified logbooks to show that proper 
checks were made 
shugrue was appointed trustee to run eastern as frank lorenzos 
replacement as the airline tries to pull itself out bankruptcy 
proceedings the machinists union at eastern has been on strike 
since march 1989

a 29yearold doctor died from a 
selfinflicted overdose of a potent painkiller that has claimed the 
lives of 18 other us doctors in the past three years hospital 
officials said 
the doctor david leyda died at hartford hospital on april 25 
after taking fentanyl a synthetic narcotic 200 times more potent 
than morphine said dr james j richter head of the hospitals 
department of anesthesiology 
its extremely potent it produces a quick high and it is 
addictive said dr james obrien director of the drug and 
alcohol treatment center at the university of connecticut health 
center 
unfortunately we have a percentage of doctors who abuse it 
obrien said friday in the last two or three years its become a 
drug of choice among doctors 
forms of the drug including one sold as china white also have 
shown up on the streets in recent years 
leyda of ottumwa iowa was in the third year of a fouryear 
residency program in anesthesiology at hartford hospital he was 
found in a private waiting room at the hospital with a syringe 
nearby 
there was no indication that he committed suicide and hospital 
officials and the state medical examiners office said they consider 
the death an accidental overdose 
richter said the department did not know before his death that 
leyda had a drug problem but concluded that he did after a 
subsequent investigation in which leydas apartment was searched and 
drug paraphernalia was found 
richter said leyda was the 19th anesthesiologist in the us to 
die from a fentanyl overdose in the past three years 
because of their easy access to potent drugs anesthesiologists 
are considered more likely to abuse drugs than are other doctors 
richter said 
fentanyl is so potent it can be taken in tiny doses that are 
undetectable in urine tests the potency means the risk of overdose 
is great 
it has a very narrow safety margin ricther said the 
danger zone is unpredictable 
richter said the department lectures residents once a year on the 
dangers of drug abuse and has in place a strict system in which 
doctors must account for all of the drugs they are given from the 
hospital pharmacy 
the problem is that youre dealing with extremely bright people 
and they can conceal their behavior to a great extent richter 
said

a 2ton experimental nasa probe crashed 
and sustained about 2 million damage when a wind gust foiled its 
landing 
dozens of batteries and electronic devices were strewn on the 
ground at the landing site according to jack tueller a scientist 
with the national aeronautics and space administration who helped 
build the probe 
the probe used to measure radioactivity in the upper atmosphere 
had made two successful experimental flights over australia in 1988 
officials said a wind gust apparently caught it as it touched down 
friday in eastern arizona 
it was supposed to land very softly said tueller in the 
two landings in australia there was very little damage 
the probe can measure faint emissions from stars and was 
putting us on the cutting edge of astronomy tueller said 
thats why its so sad to see it smashed up 
the gammaray imaging spectrometer is one of two in the world 
tueller said the other belongs to the university of california in 
san diego 
nasa engineer al huters said the probe cost 2 million to 3 
million to build he said the device rides on a steel gondola about 
10 feet square and is carried aloft by a heliumfilled balloon 
it was launched thursday morning from an airport at fort sumner 
nm and reached an altitude of more than five miles 
nasa workers loaded the wreckage onto a flatbed trailertruck and 
said the probe would be taken to the goddard space center in 
maryland for repairs

community for helping secure his release in february after 27 years 
in prison for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government his 
release came under political reforms implemented by president fw 
de klerk

to the release of other political prisoners and helped bring about 
the first talks between the anc and the whiteled government

heavily armed palestinian guerrillas who were 
intercepted off the israeli coast this week intended to attack the 
us embassy in tel aviv a senior israeli official said 
maps seized from the 16 guerrillas on wednesday indicated they 
were headed for tel avivs densely populated beachfront hotel 
district where the embassy is located the official said friday on 
condition of anonymity 
during the debriefing we conducted it was established that 
the us embassy was one of the targets in the vicinity of the hotel 
district he said an army spokesman said he was not authorized to 
comment on the report 
an israeli military analyst said today that the guerrillas 
planned to fire sovietmade katyusha rockets at the embassy 
we know that at least one speedboat or maybe two had orders 
after onloading their men in the tel aviv marina to go back to sea 
and launch from the sea the rockets on the american embassy said 
benishai military correspondent for the daily yediot ahronot 
speaking on israel radio 
but benishai said the rockets probably could not have hit their 
target located in the hotel district near the marina 
us embassy spokesman don cofman today refused comment on the 
reports and would not say whether the embassy had stepped up 
security 
in condemning the aborted raid wednesday the state department 
left open the possibility the incident could affect the us 
dialogue with the palestine liberation organization that dialogue 
began after plo leader yasser arafat denounced terrorism in 1988 
the palestine liberation front a plo faction believed to have 
its main headquarters in baghdad iraq has claimed responsibility 
for the abortive raid but said it was not aimed at civilians 
arafat has denied israeli charges that the plo itself was 
involved in the raid but he has not condemned it 
in a statement friday in baghdad the front said its guerrillas 
had instructions to hit military sites only in a 50milewide area 
around tel aviv 
the front is headed by mohammad abbas known by his nom de guerre 
abul abbas a member of the plos executive committee he 
masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the italian cruise ship achille 
lauro in which an elderly american was shot and killed 
israel claims libya helped mount wednesdays strike which was 
aimed at crowded israeli beaches israels military intelligence 
chief in an interview with the yediot ahronot daily provided the 
most detailed account yet of that alleged involvement 
maj gen amnon shahak said the guerrillas trained in a camp set 
aside for them by libyan authorities on the mediterranean coast 
the investigation shows beyond doubt that libyan military 
personnel were involved in all stages of preparation shahak said 
in the newspaper interview 
but a libyan official denied libyan involvement in the raid 
gadallah azouz eltalhi libyas foreign minister said some 
news media claimed that a libyan ship carried the speedboats that 
tried to go to shore libya has no connection at all with the 
operation eltalhi said during a visit to egypt 
the libyan ambassador to lebanon warned today that the united 
states would definitely be held responsible for any israeli 
retaliatory attack on libya 
in an interview on lebanons communistrun voice of the people 
radio libyan ambassador ashour fortas claimed israel was consulting 
with the united states for an aggression against libya

university of louisville president donald swain 
has established a system of cash payments and other incentives aimed 
at increasing the number of black faculty members at the school 
my intention is to move us ahead quickly in the next five 
years swain said in an interview he said for example that he 
will offer 10000 to academic departments that not only hire black 
faculty members but keep them at the kentucky campus for a sustained 
period 
similar programs are under way at other american schools the 
louisville initiative represents a variation on a theme that 
others are using says reginald wilson of the american council of 
education 
the university of michigan began in 1987 to target a percentage 
of its budget to hiring minority faculty wilson said that since 
then michigan has hired 77 minority faculty members including 40 
blacks 
miami university in ohio also has significantly increased its 
black faculty wilson said he said the school launched the project 
by funding five positions out of his budget 
wilson said that eastern illinois university gives recognition 
and monetary awards each year to the departments that have been 
successful in increasing minority staff 
at the university of california at santa barbara the number of 
minority faculty members increased from 7 percent to 14 percent over 
the last 15 years but chancellor barbara uehling said bidding wars 
in which recruiters offer high salaries promotions and sometimes 
tenure make it difficult to keep them 
these programs are required to get these institutions motivated 
to do something said wilson who noted that in the 1960s colleges 
and universities were motived by moral suasion 
the major appeal is economics now he said 
swain acknowledged that his actionoriented presidential 
initiative which also includes providing financial support to 
help candidates complete doctoral degrees was prompted by racial 
tensions on campus 
also swain said kentucky remains under a federal mandate to 
end the last vestiges of segregation in higher education this 
means specifically adding africanamerican faculty 
over and above legal requirements we must attract more 
africanamerican faculty to serve the needs of the diverse racial 
and ethnic groups the largest of which is africanamerican who 
look to u of l for educational opportunity he said 
the university had an enrollment of 23180 in the fall of 1989 
including 2666 members of minority groups black students totaled 
1985 about 86 percent of the 1650 faculty members 172 were 
minorities including 36 blacks said denise fitzpatrick director 
of public information 
swain said that faculty affirmative action while making some 
progress in the last nine years has not made sufficient progress 
especially in attracting and retaining africanamerican faculty 
i would like the university of louisville to be a leader in 
affirmative action he added 
for most colleges and universities recruiting and retaining 
minority faculty members has become increasingly important the 
american council on education said minority representation on 
faculties nationwide remains below 11 percent 
between 1977 and 1985 the number of black faculty members barely 
increased and the black share of all faculty positions dropped from 
44 percent to 42 percent 
in 1988 only four blacks in the entire united states received 
doctorates in mathematics 
swain said the goal of his initiative is to remove all 
obstacles so that people wont have any excuses about the 
procedure 
among other things an africanamerican faculty incentive 
fund will be established to encourage academic departments to hire 
and retain black faculty 
in disciplines with few blacks a black candidate can be offered 
a junior faculty position if the qualifications are similar to white 
candidates 
the initiative also includes providing financial support and a 
faculty positions for black doctoral candidates who have completed 
all the requirements except the dissertation 
a grow our own africanamerican faculty program also will 
begin this year to identify promising undergraduates and encourage 
them to seek doctoral degrees at the university the best qualified 
will be offered fellowships and other financial benefits

for a studio audience more accustomed to talk 
of sampm than sampls it was complicated stuff 
tomorrow male strippers it will be a lot easier talk show 
titan phil donahue told the audience as they struggled with the 
complexities of the escalating savings and loan crisis he was only 
teasing the following show will be on the ku klux klan 
donahue took on the daunting task of bringing the sampl crisis to 
main street in a program taped friday in the nations capital 
all weve got right now is the worst financial scandal in the 
history of our beloved democratic experiment he said you and i 
are in this 
by the time the hourlong show was over donahue had whipped the 
audience into a frenzy over the thousands of dollars each of them 
as taxpayers will pay to cover losses to depositors in hundreds of 
failed thrifts 
how much of the 400 billion sampl bailout will you pay for 
was the question posed by the show to be broadcast in most cities 
on tuesday the answer more than 3000 for each us taxpayer over 
the next three decades including interest 
deregulation of the thrift industry was the best thing that 
happened to the mob since prohibition said stephen pizzo one of 
donahues guests and a coauthor of inside job the looting of 
americas savings and loans 
pizzo said organized crime took advantage of liberalized 
regulations for thrifts by taking out big real estate loans that 
went bad 
the money didnt go to widows and orphans said houston post 
reporter pete brewton another guest it went to the political 
criminal and business establishment of this country loud 
applause 
the 200 or so ordinary people in the studio at the us 
chamber of commerce building were getting worked up they almost 
seemed ready to march on the white house a stones throw away 
across lafayette park 
take the money put it under your pillow and know where it is 
in the morning a young man in the audience advised a woman asked 
angrily why the press hasnt been covering the sampl issue more 
vigorously 
outside the streets were choked with tv trucks and reporters 
covering the summit between president bush and soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev 
just down the street about 70 protesters picketed the resolution 
trust corp the agency established last year to manage the bailout 
for not offering more subsidized housing to the poor from projects 
seized from failed sampls 
donahues audience hissed and booed when william greider the 
other guest suggested that government officials believe the 
american public is too stupid to understand the sampl debacle 
the political assumption in this town is that you all will not 
get aroused enough said greider the national editor of rolling 
stone magazine 
donahue threw more fuel on the fire by showing a videotape of 
neil bush one of the presidents sons being questioned by rep 
joseph p kennedy ii dmass at a recent hearing of the house 
banking committee 
regulators have alleged that bushs role as a former director of 
silverado banking savings and loan association a denver thrift 
that went bust for 1 billion involved a conflict of interest with 
his other business interests 
these are exactly the kinds of incestuous relationships that 
led to this kind of looting said pizzo 
after the show a spokesman for the us league of savings 
institutions said industrys remaining health thrifts are helping 
pay for the cleanup in the form of higher deposit insurance 
premiums and other charges 
we deplore the criminal elements that invaded the savings 
institutions business league spokesman jim eberle said in a 
telephone interview we are feeling the effects of the criminal 
elements and the highfliers too

only 40 miles from navys modern atlantic 
fleet rows of rusting hulks that had their fill of salt sun and 
war await the call to carry military cargo in a national emergency 
taxpayers get the bill for the 331ship national defense reserve 
fleet with its dilapidatedlooking world war ii and postwar cargo 
ships some with grass growing through wooden deck planks 
nobody can predict with certainty how many of the drab mostly 
gray ships lined up here on the james river and two other main 
locations will be able to sail 
but military experts still consider this fleet a strategic asset 
to move the armys heavy equipment even while theyre busy writing 
plans to scrap much newer equipment as the communist threat 
diminishes 
the governmentbuilt victory ships of world war ii and their 
companions in the fleet no longer have to worry about german 
uboats but theyre taking salvos from members of the house small 
business subcommittee on regulation business opportunities and 
energy 
chairman ron wyden dore and ranking republican william s 
broomfield of michigan have scheduled a hearing on the issue monday 
saying they want to determine whether the fleet is a waste of money 
they said the ships could be turned into moneymakers if congress 
directs the ships be sold to us salvage firms 
the peace dividend is going down the drain with the rust of 
these federal assets wyden said prior to the hearing broomfield 
commented i would hate to have the defense of our country depend 
on these ships because in the time it would take to renovate them 
the war would be over 
a pentagon official and an official of the transportation 
departments maritime administration marad which maintains the 
fleet disagreed 
this is not going to be pretty said michael delpercio marad 
director of ship operations everybody looks at the ships 
externally and says what a bunch of crap but internally theyre 
in good shape 
jonathan d kaskin director of the navys strategic sealift 
division added this is the only way that we have to move heavy 
army equipment that cant go in modern cargo container ships he 
cited a decline in available commercial us cargo vessels and said 
it would be prohibitive to build enough military airlift capacity to 
hold the same amount of tanks trucks ammunition and other 
equipment 
only 96 vessels in the 331ship fleet are classified as the ready 
reserve ships that are supposed to be able to carry the armys 
equipment on five to 20 days notice 
fortytwo other ships in the fleet are so old that they will be 
used as target practice for navy gunners sunk to become reefs or 
traded to salvage companies for newer ships 
the maritime administration says it is spending 67 million in 
fiscal 1990 to maintain the older part of the fleet and another 89 
million for the ready reserve portion the agency is requesting 225 
million for the ready reserve in fiscal 1991 part of a plan to 
increase that component from 96 to 142 ships 
wyden said consideration of this request will give congress a 
chance to ask some hard questions about the fleet and broomfield 
already has written defense secretary dick cheney that the cost 
and time required to restore these ships far outweighs their 
usefulness 
some ships in the fleet previously have been sold to salvage 
firms for as much as 15 million delpercio said the buyers were 
foreign companies that were able with cheaper labor to underprice 
us firms in the bidding 
both wyden and broomfield said they favor legislation to mandate 
sales only to us firms similar to a law governing disposal of 
navy warships 
between the 42 inactive ships and the 96ship ready reserve sits 
a fleet consisting of victory ships the name given to a class 
of cargohaulers built near the end of the world war ii former 
commercial vessels no longer fit for service onceactive navy 
ships and various specialty vessels including the glomar explorer 
which was built for the cia in 1972 and used in 1974 to recover 
pieces of a sunken soviet submarine in the pacific these ships are 
supposed to be seaworthy on a 30 to 120 days notice 
except for the ready reserve which is spread out across the 
country the fleet is located at fort eustis near norfolk at 
beaumont texas and at suisun bay near san francicso 
here on the james river the huge vessels sit quietly with their 
rusted and broken railings the silence disturbed only by the sound 
of shoes crunching the paint flakes that litter the decks 
many of the ships were activated to carry cargo during the 
vietnam war and during a recent tour of the ships a reporter 
observed that log books maps and navigational charts used during 
vietnam were still in bookcases on the bridge 
inside the compartments below deck there are old mattresses on 
the metal bunk beds dusty lockers mess halls with the chairs still 
at dining tables crankstyle telephones steel cooking pots and 
even small mementos like a pocketsized prayer book 
kaskin who works in the pentagon said the size of the fleet is 
set by the cargo requirements of moving army equipment but not 
troops to a theoretical conflict in the middle east 
the maritime administrations delpercio said there have been 60 
tests to activate ships in the fleet since 1977 and only four were 
total failures he said one or two times ships failed to sail in 
the specified time period all except two of the tests however 
involved the ready reserve 
raymond ramsay a former navy maritime affairs official agreed 
that the appearance of the ships could be improved but he said the 
real test would be the workings of the engines boilers gaskets 
pipes hydraulic systems and other parts that make a ship run 
its like buying a used car he said the paint and polish 
might be great but you have to use it for a while it would be a 
shame to run on a gamble and lose a whole ship

half a world away from home where gunfire and 
bloodshed shocked the world a year ago a small group of chinese 
exiles works to reform the political system that forced them to flee 
the world headquarters for the federation for a democratic china 
is a small office in a quiet picturesque paris neighborhood 
it tries to maintain pressure on the communist government in 
beijing by urging other governments to take political measures 
publishing materials on human rights and keeping track of friends 
and excolleagues in chinese jails 
the idea is to nudge the communist party toward peaceful 
political reform says wan runnan the federations 
secretarygeneral 
the communist party cannot carry out necessary reform from 
within wan says we must put pressure on the party from the 
outside to adopt democracy including from foreign governments 
the federation does not seek to overthrow the party wan says 
but what people want is economic and social stability without 
corruption in the party and the best way to avoid this is a 
multiparty system he says 
a year ago wan runnan was a rare breed a successful elite 
businessman who headed stone group co chinas largest privately 
funded company but wan lent his support as well as staffers and 
equipment to the studentled movement for democratic reforms in 
beijing last spring 
the chinese armys violent june 4 suppression of the unarmed 
protesters left hundreds possibly thousands dead 
six days later while wan was visiting a computer exhibition in 
hong kong chinese authorities issued an arrest warrant for him and 
six other intellectuals accusing them of inciting the 
counterrevolutionary turmoil wan never returned 
today he leads a humbler life in france directing the 
federations protests of human rights violations organizing 
discussions and conferences on the massacre and helping a now 
abandoned project to broadcast prodemocracy messages into china 
the federations chairman is yan jiaqi a former aide to ousted 
communist party chief zhao ziyang 
it is staffed by a dozen chinese and has 2000 duespaying 
members in its branches around the world fees are nominal only 
about 10 a year 
yans often stiff demeanor has helped shift the spotlight to his 
deputy chairman wuer kaixi the flamboyant articulate former 
student leader who relishes media attention and has a penchant for 
fainting at public gatherings 
yan and wuer frequently travel outside france leaving wan in 
charge in paris 
but wan does some traveling himself recently visiting 
czechoslovakia east germany and poland 
the events in china of last spring had two strong effects on 
east europe he says people saw the widespread participation of 
ordinary citizens and governments witnessed the suppression which 
could only make them more sensitive to their own problems 
details of the federations budget were not readily available 
during a recent interview but wang hao secretary of finance says 
there is a plan de finance it costs about 38000 a month to 
run the office itself including rent and staff salaries he says 
the federation in its infancy was beset by its share of 
controversy there have been allegations of financial mismanagement 
overzealous spending by wuer and discord among its leaders 
exiled journalist liu binyan said in new york last week that he 
had been asked to take over the federation from yan in september 
but that he refused noting the prickly relations among the leaders 
the federation while it boasts most of the prominent dissident 
names is not the sole voice of dissent competing with the china 
alliance for democracy in new york and the washington dcbased 
independent federation of chinese students and scholars the three 
were told to consolidate their offices if they wanted continued 
support from the us government according to chinese sources in 
the united states 
the entire movementinexile was given a boost in april when chai 
ling the impassioned student activist who headed the protest 
movement in its final days last june surfaced with her husband in 
paris in april after 10 months on the run 
federation members insist gradual reform will come to china if 
china doesnt adopt democracy then the country has no hope says 
zhang lun an aide to federation chairman yan 
a 28yearold former instructor of political science at beijing 
university of geography zhang advised the students at tiananmen 
square 
he escaped from china late last year using the underground 
railroad that spirited several activists from the country 
now he receives a monthly 180 refugee allowance from the french 
government and wants to study sociology he says however he cant 
abandon the hopes and friends he left behind 
i know many many people who were arrested he says wincing 
i just hope they can see daylight again

arent enough teachers to go around a newspaper reported saturday 
russian language courses at private institutes are crowded with 
college students and company employees and russian textbooks are a 
lucrative market for publishers the korea herald said

exchanges between the countries even though they have yet to 
establish diplomatic relations

two years ago gov michael s dukakis 
was the democratic partys nominee for the highest office in the 
land today he isnt even a headline act at his own states party 
convention 
dukakis was set to address the convention this morning in the 
notably unprestigious leadoff slot but that speech was postponed 
and the entire convention was delayed saturday morning by a police 
picket line that convention participants didnt want to cross 
local police are negotiating a new contract and picketed the 
convention when contract talks fell through 
his name doesnt even appear on the agenda of the convention a 
gathering he dominated through much of his three decades in 
massachusetts politics 
his aides have shown little bitterness over his stature at this 
years convention but the governors press handlers made a 
conscious effort to avoid drawing attention to the speech which was 
billed as a brief address or moving the governor toward center 
stage 
two summers ago in atlanta dukakis a threeterm governor stood 
before the national convention as the democratic presidential 
nominee ahead of george bush in the polls and riding a wave of 
successes in the democratic primaries 
today bush is president basking in popularity and the glow from 
his continuing summit with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in 
massachusetts state finances are in disarray and dukakis 
popularity is at rockbottom democratic candidates avoid him 
politics is very unforgiving especially in massachusetts 
said james french a longtime dukakis ally and one of a dwindling 
number of aides to stay on in the last months of the governors 
administration dukakis leaves office in january 
and yet like jimmy carter who disappeared from the lips of 
democrats after he lost his 1980 presidential reelection bid 
dukakis hopes the years will give him back the high standing he once 
enjoyed in massachusetts 
just as jimmy carter in his many years out of office has 
become americas best expresident and its bestloved president 
the same will hold true for dukakis at the statewide level french 
said 
it would be a major rehabilitation 
an opinion poll gave dukakis an unfavorable rating of 73 percent 
and as the state budget situation has grown worse in recent months 
dukakis has been able to do little to dig himself out of that hole 
the four democrats running for governor are basing their 
candidacies on undoing the fiscal wrongs of the dukakis 
administration even dukakis own lieutenant governor evelyn 
murphy has emphasized the points on which she disagrees with her 
boss 
dukakis launched his statewide career with a surprisingly strong 
secondplace finish in balloting for attorney general in 1966 
four years later in a bid for lieutenant governor dukakis 
wrested the convention endorsement by tirelessly talking to each and 
every one of thousands of delegates in their homes and offices his 
opponent in that race state sen beryl cohen tried to win 
delegates by wooing party leaders 
dukakis lost that race but in 1974 a year when there was no 
convention held he won the governorship in 1978 another year 
without a convention he lost a primary race to a democratic 
gubernatorial challenger but at the 1982 and 1986 conventions it 
was all dukakis 
the conventions throughout the 1980s have been a michael 
dukakis show french said 
french said dukakis hopes and expects that time will be on his 
side 
hes been at the very top and hes also experienced the very 
worst and he realizes that peoples judgments will be formulated 
three or four years from now french said hes very optimistic 
as most of us are

whether its making money spreading democracy 
or boosting morale americans want to do it with the soviet union 
and they werent shy about exploiting the summit to say so 
fax machines whirred throughout summit week with announcements 
from investors and philanthropists and educators eager to publicize 
their new partnerships 
everybody is trying to use the summit to promote their 
projects this is obvious this is capitalism says edward 
lozansky an emigre physicist setting up a sovietamerican 
university in moscow and the united states 
one company that lucked out was radisson hotels international 
the minneapolis firm has signed an agreement with intourist the 
soviet travel agency to operate the first americanmanaged hotel 
and business center in the soviet union 
long before the summit was announced radisson and intourist 
scheduled the signing for may 22 it worked out very nicely for 
us it couldnt have been nicer said jeurgen bartels president 
of carlson hospitality group inc radissons parent company 
radisson billed the project as a historic joint venture and 
said the 165office business center would offer the first commercial 
directdial telephones and fax machines in moscow 
the new marble building designed by a team of soviets and 
yugoslavians also has 430 hotel rooms it was nearly complete when 
radisson came on board and is expected to open in december 
lozanskys sovietamerican university was formally announced at a 
summitweek reception he said the event netted a raft of business 
executives offering money and a top soviet scientist anxious to 
discuss joint research projects 
roland schmitt president of rensselear polytechnic institute in 
troy ny acknowledged that the idea is in a very early and very 
nascent stage 
lozansky admits the summit sped up the announcement a little 
bit but says he has enough money to launch the private university 
the first in the soviet union this fall 
he said five soviet professors will teach at us universities 
and five american professors will lecture up to 75 soviet students 
at moscow state university eventually the school will grant its own 
degrees he said and next year maybe there will be enough money for 
a separate building in moscow 
lozansky who was forced out of his job and his country for 
publicly criticizing the government said educating soviet students 
americanstyle is a way to nudge the soviet union toward democracy 
we want to pull them further and maybe a little bit faster he 
says 
among the other ussoviet ventures that surfaced during summit 
week were the american edition of commersant the first soviet 
business weekly operation usaussr a global relief organization 
that will send teams of us and soviet doctors to work in 
developing countries and the hearttoheart association a 
partnership between soviet television and tv preacher robert 
schullers crystal cathedral ministries 
hearttohearts first project is a remarkable one given the 
soviet unions purportedly atheistic nature a series of 12 monthly 
sermons from schuller to be broadcast to the soviet unions 200 
million people in prime time 
schuller host of the popular hour of power program 
delivered televised messages to the soviet people in december and 
may at the request of soviet tv authorities in the new climate of 
religious tolerance they did not seem to mind schullers biblical 
themes and numerous references to god 
neither did longsuffering soviet citizens under economic siege 
apparently starved for religion and moral support they deluged the 
government with appreciative calls schuller ended up with an 
invitation to be a regular 
why 
im not known for preaching a sectarian dogmatism schuller 
said they the soviets were aware that the thrust of my message 
is building people up and giving them encouragement i offer 
practical help for daily living through spiritual power thats 
exactly what they need at this point they say it and i agree with 
them

mikhail s gorbachev the first soviet 
leader to visit california since nikita khrushchevs tour de farce 
in 1959 has more serious business in mind than his funseeking 
predecessor 
gorbachev scheduled to arrive sunday night after four days of 
summit talks with president bush and a quick visit to minnesota has 
a packed agenda highlighted by a historic first meeting with south 
korean president roh taewoo 
khrushchevs trip to the golden state was a little less weighty 
a dinner with marilyn monroe and other hollywood stars an impromptu 
jaunt around san francisco after eluding security guards and a 
memorable fit when he was denied a day pass to disneyland 
what do you have there rocket launch pads he fumed so 
angry was khrushchev about missing mickey mouse and suffering other 
perceived insults by his american hosts that he reportedly 
considered severing relations between the superpowers 
that was in the chilly days of the cold war in this era of 
glasnost perestroika and crumbling communism gorbachev will be 
allowed where few soviets have ever been permitted into the heart 
of silicon valley 
khrushchev visited international business machines corps san 
jose plant and ate a 49cent fried chicken special with workers in 
the cafeteria gorbachev will venture only as far into the valley as 
stanford university for a speech and meeting with scholars and 
students 
gorbachevs speech at stanford and his agenda in san francisco 
are expected to focus on pacific rim politics and big business as he 
turns from the issues of european security and strategic arms that 
dominated his talks with bush 
except for a brief excursion to view the golden gate bridge at 
days end gorbachev will leave most of the sightseeing to his wife 
raisa during a whirlwind 22hour visit that includes a luncheon 
with 150 west coast executives 
gorbachevs meeting with the captains of industry including the 
leaders of chevron corp bankamerica corp atampt hewlettpackard 
co and more than 100 other major companies is in sharp contrast 
to khrushchevs unscheduled visit to the hiring hall of the 
international longshoremens and warehousemens union 
khrushchev was cheered by the workers gorbachev is likely to be 
applauded enthusiastically by the executives who see opportunities 
for trade in the opening markets of the soviet union and eastern 
europe 
the soviet president also will renew his friendship with former 
president reagan over coffee monday morning at the home of the 
soviet consul general in san francisco where the gorbachevs are 
staying 
the soviet flag is flying at san francisco city hall for the 
first time since khrushchevs visit and boats along fishermans 
wharf are expected to hoist the hammer and sickle for mrs 
gorbachevs tour 
not everyone is thrilled about the visit wherever the soviet 
president goes hell pass demonstrators armenians lithuanians 
estonians latvians palestinians and eritreans from embattled 
ethiopia who are upset about soviet policies 
gorbachev plagued by economic and political woes apparently 
will use his california trip to promote the soviet union as a 
pacific rim trading partner with west coast companies and to improve 
relations with south korea longtime foe of sovietbacked north 
korea 
his meeting with south korean president roh taewoo was a late 
addition to the schedule but it promises to be a dramatic and 
significant event that could have a profound effect on both their 
countries 
besides being a big step toward the establishment of diplomatic 
ties between moscow and seoul and a prelude to eventual 
reunification of the korean peninsula the meeting could affect 
sovietjapanese relations said soviet watcher david holloway of 
stanford 
as the soviet union puts more emphasis on its trade 
relationship with south korea it also puts more pressure on japan 
its a way of telling the japanese theyre missing out on 
something and it might encourage them to break their deadlock in 
negotiations with the soviets said holloway a political 
scientist who briefed president bush before his first summit with 
gorbachev 
sovietsouth korean trade doubled to 600 million last year and 
is expected to surpass 1 billion in 1990 south korea has the 
manufacturing expertise and hightech products the soviets need and 
are a good close market for soviet resources 
for two years south korea has sought to build ties with 
communist nations able to influence communist north korea since 
that northern policy went into effect in july 1988 south korea 
has established formal diplomatic relations with every nation in 
eastern europe except albania east germany and the soviet union

the united states is expected to make a strong 
pitch this coming week for nations of latin america and the 
caribbean to reduce their trade barriers 
president bush is sending special trade representative carla 
hills to a meeting in paraguay of the organization of american 
states to outline us thoughts on how the region can overcome its 
dismal economic performance the past decade 
in an interview friday hills said she plans to stress lower 
trade barriers and establishing favorable foreign investment 
climates as two keys to the regions economic recovery 
investment will flow where climate is most hospitable she 
said adding that a number of countries have begun to scrap policies 
that have crippled growth in the past there have been substantial 
changes this year 
other officials have cited mexico bolivia costa rica venezuela 
and chile as countries which have initiated progrowth policies 
the 1980s have frequently been described as latin americas 
lost decade because of the steep economic decline that occurred 
in almost all countries in the region 
hills will be accompanied to the annual oas conclave of member 
nations foreign ministers by deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger they were due to arrive saturday night in the 
paraguayan capital of asuncion 
eagleburger is standing in for secretary of state james a baker 
iii who will be in europe during the consultations 
bakers top aide for latin america assistant secretary of state 
bernard aronson also is not attending the oas meeting he plans to 
go to rome for a meeting next week of more than 20 donor countries 
for a discussion on ways to help nicaragua overcome its economic 
crisis 
hills will meet starting sunday night with several of the six 
hemispheric presidents planning to participate in the discussions 
which are taking place on the 100th anniversary of the first 
interamerican conference 
recent oas meetings have become bogged down over disputes on 
panama and the overall central american question with those issues 
largely resolved an unusually small number of divisive political 
questions are on the agenda this year 
last year oas delegates spent most of their energies grappling 
with the political crisis in panama this year they will be able to 
focus more on issues such as drugs trade foreign debt and the 
environment us officials said 
delegates also will discuss ways of promoting the scheduled 
transition to democratic rule in haiti this year 
underscoring the relative harmony in the hemisphere these days is 
the fact that virtually all 32 oas members have elected presidents 
paraguay is hosting its first oas meeting a recognition of the 
replacement of 35 years of military rule last year by an elected 
government 
hills will address the meeting at mondays opening session and 
visit brazil and argentina afterwards

mayor marion barrys defense attorneys kept up 
bargaining with prosecutors over the weekend as they prepared for 
the start of his trial on charges of cocaine possession and perjury 
jury selection was scheduled to start monday barring negotiation 
of a lastminute plea bargain in the talks between barrys attorneys 
and federal prosecutors 
the 54yearold mayor last week appeared determined to see the 
case through in the courtroom rather than accept an agreement that 
would require him to plead guilty to felony charges 
but sources familiar with the case speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the two sides continued to explore the possibility 
of an agreement 
the case marks the low point in barrys stormy tenure as mayor 
his latest troubles arise from his visits to the hotel room of 
former city employee charles lewis in december 1988 lewis pleaded 
guilty last year to conspiring to buy at least 140 worth of crack 
cocaine for the mayor 
information from lewis led federal investigators to onetime 
model rasheeda moore whose role in an fbi sting operation led to 
barrys arrest 
barry visited her hotel room jan 18 while fbi cameras taped the 
mayor smoking crack cocaine supplied by an fbi agent posing as a 
friend of moore 
he is charged with possession of cocaine and perjury for lying to 
a federal grand jury about his involvement with drugs 
the videotape is the centerpiece of the governments 14count 
case alleging possession of cocaine on numerous occasions since 1984 
ive seen this videotape and the tape is more damaging to the 
government than to me barry said in an interview with the 
washington post he admitted smoking crack but said the government 
had tried to kill him by providing a potentially lethal dose 
barry has not said whether he will run for a fourth fouryear 
term in november a recent poll shows that his legal problems have 
not significantly eroded his political support 
whatever happens barry already has had a remarkable career 
born into a family of sharecroppers in itta bena miss barry 
grew up in memphis tenn and joined the civil rights movement 
while a college student 
he organized the first lunch counter sitins in nashville tenn 
and became the first national chairman of the student nonviolent 
coordinating committee which engaged in demonstrations and boycotts 
he moved to washington dc in 1965 where he led a oneday 
boycott of the dc transit system he fought for replacing 
congressional control of the district of columbia with a limited 
form of home rule 
barry designed a program to aid washingtons black poor called 
youth pride it received millions of dollars in grants from the us 
labor department and operated a series of small businesses 
it was his ties to youth pride that created barrys first brush 
with scandal his first wife mary treadwell went to jail after 
being convicted of embezzling money from the organization she now 
draws a city salary for serving on a parole board barry was not 
charged in the investigation 
barry won election to both the school board and the city council 
he was elected mayor in 1978 
he dealt with a city financial crisis in his first term a second 
term was marked by a renewal of the downtown area and declines in 
crime and unemployment but his administration has been beset by 
scandal 
the mayors chief aide went to prison for defrauding the 
government of nearly 200000 and 12 other city officials have been 
convicted of various crimes the former head of the dc human 
services department and a businessman are on now on trial in the 
same federal courthouse for allegedly steering city contracts to 
favored companies 
prosecutors have investigated barry before the government closed 
out one probe in 1985 after trying unsuccessfully to prove that 
barry lied to a grand jury when he denied obtaining cocaine from a 
former city employee

the ussoviet trade agreement offers the 
potential of billions of dollars in economic benefits for both 
countries but trade experts said saturday that the soviets now 
produce precious little that interests americans 
the exceptions are well known vodka caviar and luxury furs 
and for those items prices are expected to drop that will give 
american consumers their very own perestroika dividend once 
congress gets around to ratifying the pact and a companion measure 
granting the soviets mostfavorednation trade status 
for now trade analysts see the agreement as a badly needed 
public relations boost for soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
bestowing on him the economic prize he had most sought from his 
summit with president bush 
gorbachev wanted the accord to demonstrate that despite his 
problems at home he still could negotiate economic concessions from 
the west 
in some respects gorbachevs us trip could be viewed as an 
extended trade mission his stops from washington to minnesota and 
california were planned to afford him a chance to court potential 
us business investors 
but analysts said daunting problems remain before either the 
number of us companies doing business in the soviet union or the 
modest ussoviet trade increases to any great extent 
if you look at the structure of their imports they really 
dont have a lot of things that we want to buy said donald 
bowles an expert on the soviet economy at american university 
they are still heavily dependent on raw materials exports 
bowles said they are only able to sell manufactured goods in the 
third world which is willing to settle for less quality 
the soviet union is one of the few countries with which the 
united states beset with its own trade problems is running a trade 
surplus last year it amounted to 357 billion the united states 
exported 427 billion worth of goods primarily grain to the 
soviet union that was offset by a small 703 million in soviet 
sales here 
duties on soviet products are as much as 10 times higher than 
imports from other countries economists said that once the soviets 
gain the lower tariffs promised by the trade agreement soviet 
exports especially of luxury consumer goods are bound to rise 
with the mostfavorednation tariffs the price of a bottle of 
vodka is expected to drop by about 110 tariffs on sable furs 
would fall to 8 percent down from the current 50 percent the 
tariff on russian caviar would drop to 15 percent half the current 
30 percent levy 
the trade agreement also would make it easier for us companies 
to set up shop in the soviet union a largely untapped market of 300 
million people 
joseph pelzman an economist at george washington university 
said he expected the soviet experience would be similar to that of 
the chinese who were awarded the lower mostfavorednation trade 
tariffs in the early 1980s and now enjoy a 618 billion trade 
surplus with the united states 
the trade agreement is a necessary first step for a presidential 
waiver of the high tariffs mandated by the 1974 jacksonvanik 
amendment passed by congress to penalize the soviet union for its 
restrictions on the emigration of jews and other dissidents 
the administration has said it will not send the trade agreement 
or the jacksonvanik waiver to congress until the supreme soviet 
passes a free emigration law something that soviet officials say is 
imminent 
many members of congress say that is not enough they charged 
that the administration should have stuck to an earlier position of 
not offering a trade deal unless gorbachev lifted the economic 
blockade of lithuania 
pelzman said those who linked a trade agreement to lithuania 
missed a key point the baltic republics are likely to be the 
first to take advantage of the expanded trade opportunities he 
said they are the closest to western markets and their business 
acumen is better 
the administration meanwhile was lobbied heavily by american 
business interests anxious not to be left behind in the rush to get 
a foothold in the soviet union 
william archey a former top trade official in the reagan 
administration and now vice president for international relations at 
the us chamber of commerce said bushs decision to sign the trade 
agreement reflected a new realism about americas status in the 
world 
the day has long passed since the united states can 
unilaterally engage in economic sanctions in any form he said 
the united states does not dominate the world economy any more and 
it is time we came to realize that

west german politicians saturday 
praised the arms agreements reached at the superpower summit but 
regretted that no progress was reported on the issue of which 
military alliance a united germany should join 
the politicians also said the summit in washington showed that 
the warsaw pact and nato alliances are ready to take on important 
political roles 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said it is important that 
the united states and soviets find a new level of relations 
when the united states and the soviet union declare that they 
no longer find one a threat to the other which is a correct 
conclusion then that must also apply for the alliances genscher 
told hesse state radio 
this means the alliances are ripe for politican functions for 
a political disarmament function a political disarmament control 
function and to help build a cooperative structure of security in 
europe he said 
genscher said that an important related aspect to the summit 
between president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is 
that the soviets can trust that a united germany will be a 
meaningful and constructive partner in a future european security 
system 
bush and gorbachev on friday signed the foundation of a landmark 
treaty for the first cuts in strategic nuclear missiles and a pact 
to slash chemical weapons stockpiles their summit ends sunday 
horst ehmke a deputy chairman of the opposition social democrats 
in the west german parliament praised the summit for furthering 
disarmament and improving bilateral relations 
we see this an important step toward further reduction of 
strategic nuclear weapons complete elimination of mediumrange 
weapons and the total worldwide ban of chemical weapons ehmke 
said in a statement to the media 
however he said it was regretful that the two leaders had 
not made any apparent progress on the question of the military 
security status of a future united germany 
it is becoming ever clearer that finding a satisfactory 
solution for everyone in this question is difficult ehmke said 
gorbachev has proposed handing the german unity and alliance 
issue to a european council that would meet annually with us and 
soviet participation the council would be made up of the 35 
western neutral and eastern states that now make up the conference 
on security and cooperation in europe 
the united states which wants a united germany to become a 
member of the north atlantic treaty organization has agreed to hold 
further discussions on the gorbachev proposal after the summit 
top diplomatic aides from both sides are to meet in copenhagen 
denmark to discuss the german question next week and again in 
berlin two weeks later

belgrade yugoslavia in six months yugoslavia has achieved a 
quiet revolution no walls and only a few communist leaders fell 
but fourdigit inflation ended the currency is convertible and the 
foreign debt is shrinking 
daunting challenges remain however from achieving political 
stability to reforming moneylosing state enterprises 
federal elections are likely by years end and premier ante 
markovic popular as the architect of reform is promoting himself 
as head of a new coalition government he says he may give up his 
communist membership and form his own party 
political revolt has pushed economic change elsewhere in eastern 
europe but us ambassador warren zimmermann noted last week that 
in yugoslavia major change in the economy has been driving 
political reform 
markovic 65 who became premier in march last year is the first 
politician who may acquire national authority similar to that of 
josip broz tito who died a decade ago 
since titos death regional leaders have tended to have the 
highest standing in yugoslavia a loose federation of six republics 
and two autonomous provinces but opinion polls in serbia slovenia 
and croatia the three most influential republics rank markovic 
second only to the regions leaders 
those three republics are at odds politically 
noncommunists who favor secession from yugoslavia have won free 
elections in slovenia and croatia serbias conservative communists 
have refused to follow the other five republics in legalizing 
opposition parties and cling to the concept of strong federal rule 
because he has performed what a western diplomat termed near 
miracles in the economy markovic appears to have a chance of 
bypassing regional disputes and forging national consensus 
his success rests partly on popular weariness with communist 
leaders who could not halt annual inflation of more than 1000 
percent or ease unemployment which is 15 percent nationwide and far 
higher in the impoverished south 
markovic became premier in march 1989 after the economic crisis 
forced out branko mikulic markovic acted on the economic front in 
december after consulting western experts 
he tied the dinar to the west german mark creating the first 
fully convertible currency in eastern europe 
the foreign debt has fallen from 23 billion to 16 billion and 
foreign investment is up encouraged by laws drafted on markovics 
recommendation even before he became premier 
about 1100 new joint ventures involving 1 billion west german 
marks 600 million were started between january 1989 and april 
1990 
by lopping four zeros off the old dinar to create the new 
convertible currency markovic slashed prices that had risen to 
dizzying heights each day 
in february the belgrade stock exchange resumed trading for the 
first time in nearly 50 years 
vuk hamovic one of the new private entrepreneurs in belgrade 
described the premier as the only bright spot in the idiotic 
situation in yugoslavia 
hamovic joins many others in predicting that if markovic forms a 
new political organization everybody will vote for that party 
the euphoria may be premature markovic has yet to take some of 
the most difficult steps reforming and unifying a labyrinthine tax 
system changing ownership laws and closing big bankrupt state 
enterprises 
when i see the first big firm with over 1000 employees shut 
down then ill believe in the future a belgrade businessman said 
on condition of anonymity 
markovic has promised to announce more reforms by the end of 
june yugoslav sources and western diplomats believe they may 
involve the greatest effort in eastern europe so far to transfer 
ownership from the state to managers and workers 
reports say up to 70 percent of stateowned firms could pass into 
the hands of their workers who would buy shares 
it is not clear how freely such shares could be traded if at 
all the stock market is just being born and many bank managers are 
unskilled in assessing risks 
another difficulty is determining how much a company is worth 
the energoprojekt construction group one of yugoslavias biggest 
firms tried it before forming a holding company a year ago to 
manage its 10 companies 
vice president milan djelic said a british firm which he did not 
name will have to be brought in to do the job again before 
energoprojekt can proceed with plans for managers to buy shares 
which it also wants to offer abroad 
yugoslavia starts with some advantages in the economic conversion 
of eastern europe 
in 1965 it became the first communist nation to give state firms 
some autonomy free travel to the west has been allowed for 20 
years and millions of yugoslavs have worked abroad 
tourism has brought western visitors movies from the west shown 
in the original language are the most popular 
yugoslavs stylish and freewheeling have more ideas than any 
other east europeans about what a modern western economy entails 
make money not war is the capitalist message beamed to firms 
invited to advertise on belgrades lively third television channel

flood victims found that having next to 
nothing didnt mean they had nothing to lose 
a month after floodwaters soaked this town of 300 the deluge 
elderly residents call the worst in memory is far from forgotten 
with soggy reminders bearing silent witness to the destruction 
virtually everywhere 
ruined furniture appliances and clothes are stacked in piles in 
front of stricken houses windows stand open to help interiors dry 
out wooden floors are warped and smell of mildew 
roy roberts auto salvage yard reeks heavily of diesel fumes as 
workers clean car engines that not long ago were submerged in 4 feet 
of water 
two blocks away the moffett school secretary works at a desk 
bearing a 16inchhigh stripe of stains showing where floodwaters 
lapped against the side 
the modest community where the salvage yard is the most prominent 
business may have suffered irreparable harm when the arkansas river 
spilled from its banks officials say 
many residents say they cannot afford even lowinterest disaster 
loans and officials say about 80 percent of the homes are rented 
which rules out federal grants to repair housing 
but moffett described by one state official as a poor second 
cousin to fort smith ark isnt a nowhere town residents are 
eager to flee 
im crazy about this place said 89yearold george hargrave 
i dont consider home anyplace but here 
roberts said moffett thrived in the 1940s and 1950s with grocery 
stores service stations and three or four nightclubs that made the 
town offlimits to soldiers stationed at fort chaffee in fort smith 
but old highway 64 gave way to interstate 40 about 3 miles north 
of moffett and the town slowly fell off the map he said 
longtime residents say there have been other floods but none so 
severe after heavy spring rains runoff from eastern oklahoma lakes 
caused the arkansas river to swell over its banks and into moffett 
the american red cross immediately opened an outreach center and 
went doortodoor looking for those in need spending more than 
135000 on 95 families said spokeswoman franci hart 
sequoyah county was declared a disaster area and the federal 
emergency management agency has taken over but fema relief for most 
residents will be limited 
some will be able to get repair loans some cant afford a loan 
of any size said state social services secretary robert fulton 
a lot of the houses are rented so the landlords have got the 
problem of fixing them up and there are questions whether the 
landlords can carry a loan 
dell greer deputy coordinator of femas oklahoma field office 
said some who cannot repay loans may be eligible for up to 10400 
in federal grants to replace personal property 
sally armstrong has lived in moffett for 68 years her floor and 
carpeting suffered the worst flood damage at her home which she 
moved back into on wednesday after receiving a fema grant of 2576 
its not enough but ill have to stretch it and make it 
enough mrs armstrong said i dont want a loan because theres 
no way i could pay it back 
fema grants to repair houses are limited to the owners greer 
said 
roberts owns eight houses in moffett he has begun repairs on hot 
water heaters and said he will clean up the debris the best he can 
none of the homes built in the 1940s rents for more than 100 a 
month he said 
i probably couldnt apply for a loan but id take a grant 
he said as for his tenants he said im sure theyll get some 
help 
greer said it was unclear whether the 10400 limit applies to 
each property or each owner fema provides temporary housing for 
tenants whose rental homes are unlivable he said 
for many that would mean leaving moffett 
we lost everything but our lives but im going to try to hang 
around here hargrave said ive been in moffett so long im 
not leaving 
earl oxford pastor at the baptist church in moffett remains 
busy attending to repairs and consoling his flock floodwaters 
buckled the floor at the church where about 50 people attend 
services 
free clothing was displayed outside the church for those unable 
to replace clothes lost in the flood 
most of the people are still getting over the shock oxford 
said a lot of them are not going to get their homes fixed a lot 
of them cant be fixed if they were renting they lost everything 
moffett was not the only oklahoma community to suffer from the 
record flooding but fulton said the town with nexttonothing may 
have had the most to lose 
it seemed along the red river the flooding was to second 
homes to lake homes he said this was a permanent community 
already poor that got hit hard

many soviets agreed saturday that president mikhail 
s gorbachev deserved praise for his foreign policy achievements at 
the summit but some said he didnt deserve humanitarian awards and 
doubted his trip would improve their lives 
shame again he has sold out all russia one woman shouted to 
a sidewalk crowd around her on pushkin square a kind of moscow 
speakers corner a few blocks from the kremlin 
she was referring to the five american humanitarian awards 
gorbachev received friday in washington for striving for peace and 
freedom 
her comments reflected the contrast between gorbachevs wild 
popularity abroad where he is treated like a hero for loosening up 
soviet society and helping bring peace and democracy to many parts 
of the world and his unpopularity at home where he is accused of 
ruining the economy and stifling freedom 
the woman said she was from lvov in the ukraine but refused to 
give her name for a variety of reasons many soviets believe 
gorbachevs glasnost or openness campaign is limited and they are 
fearful of being quoted in the foreign press 
a man in the crowd explained many peoples mixed views of 
gorbachevs foreign trips 
he did much on the international arena he earned points but 
in domestic policy he tramples on progressives said anatoly 
bogudinov 40 
if the awards were presented for gorbachevs humanitarian 
actions bogudinov said the sponsors forgot about the basics 
the least we want is sausage but he doesnt give it to us and 
you ask whether he deserves these awards 
during a ceremony at the soviet embassy in washington gorbachev 
received the albert einstein peace prize the franklin delano 
roosevelt freedom medal the martin luther king jr nonviolent 
peace prize the man of history award from the appeal of conscience 
foundation and the martin luther king jr international peace award 
from friends world college 
bogudinov asked a question of his own what would the american 
people do if they had a president like gorbachev 
if bush did everything on the international scene but nothing 
for his own country the people wouldnt support him bogudinov 
said 
even criticizing the countrys president he noted has been 
outlawed the supreme soviet legislature passed a bill last month 
imposing a fine and jail sentence for insulting the soviet president 
diagonally across pushkin square at mcdonalds soviets sinking 
their teeth into americas classic family fare were generally more 
positive about their leader and his policies 
were very glad our relations are improving said oksana a 
23yearold housewife eating ice cream on the second floor of the 
mcdonalds which opened in january 
were anxious for improvements in trade and anticipate that 
friendship with america will bring improvements in our lives said 
the woman who refused to give her last name 
president bush and gorbachev friday approved the outlines of a 
landmark treaty for the firstever cuts in longrange nuclear 
missiles and signed a pact to slash chemical weapons they also 
signed a trade agreement and a fiveyear grain deal sought by 
american farmers 
the united states oksana said should help the soviet union not 
with handouts but with cooperation for instance with joint business 
ventures 
another customer in the crowded restaurant said the simple fact 
he was talking to an american reporter was a sign that glasnost was 
real 
five years ago we wouldnt be talking to you said sergei a 
28yearold radioman for the soviet military who also refused to 
give his last name

nasa on saturday prepared for another 
test of columbia in its effort to pinpoint the hydrogen leak that 
has grounded the space shuttle until midjune or possibly july 
workers have been trying without success to locate the leak in 
columbias rear engine compartment since thursday by increasing 
pressure on the shuttles external tank which is filled with helium 
on wednesday the tank will be partly filled with liquid 
hydrogen duplicating conditions when the leak was detected six 
hours before last wednesdays launch more than a halfmillion 
gallons of volatile liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were being 
pumped into columbia at the time 
it doesnt appear that leak is going to remanifest itself until 
they get that supercold hydrogen flowing through the system again 
nasa spokesman bruce buckingham said saturday what probably has 
happened the leak has sealed itself at room temperature which is 
what were working at now 
engineers believe the leak is in or near a 17inch valve in a 
pipe that carries liquid hydrogen from the external tank to the 
shuttles main engines 
over the weekend nasa planned to circulate helium through the 
shuttles fuel system in preparation for the tanking test then 
disconnect explosive devices that were attached to the orbiter for 
launch 
officials for the national aeronautics and space administration 
said its doubtful the tanking test will pinpoint a cause that can 
be fixed easily at the launch pad returning columbia to its hangar 
for repairs would push the astronomy mission into july they said 
columbia holds in its payload bay a 150 million observatory 
called astro that will examine ultraviolet light and xrays emitted 
from extremely hot stars galaxies and other objects

sherman and georgia cutshaw are known 
as a spicy couple 
after 16 years of marriage the cutshaws have amassed 4000 sets 
of salt and pepper shakers they line shelves in the kitchen living 
room and their bedroom 
it started just real innocent cutshaw says id pick up a 
set or two of them at a yard sale or a flea market or something like 
that just a little something to bring home so i wouldnt have to 
show up emptyhanded 
no typical couple cutshaw is 77 and his wife is 35 they have a 
14yearold son and as their fascination with matching spice 
containers became known relatives and friends added to the 
collection 
every time some of them would go on vacation or just out of 
town they would bring us salt and pepper shakers she said it 
got to be a little fun thing for them to do too 
boasting exotic shakers from cuba bermuda and hawaii the 
cutshaws say their most unusual set depicts adam and eve 
adams got a branch on mrs cutshaw said eves got the 
lower part sort of covered up but the upper parts not you know 
they look like adam and eve ought to look 
cutshaw says hes always on the lookout for new sets but 
avoiding repitition can be tough 
i can hardly ever find any now that i dont have he said 
the colorful variety of salt and pepper sets dominates the 
couples home but cutshaw says the couple uses plain glass shakers 
when they sit down to eat 
keeping 8000 knickknacks clean could drive some homemakers 
crazy but not mrs cutshaw 
i just clean them one at a time never getting in a hurry

increasing referrals of malpractice cases and 
limited resources to investigate them may be prompting state medical 
boards to show too much leniency in disciplining physicians a draft 
government report says 
although the disciplinary boards have grown in strength in recent 
years the report by department of health and human services 
inspector general said most of the cases brought to them are settled 
through consent agreements 
as the proportion of cases so settled exceeds 50 percent and 
indeed nears 100 percent in some places one wonders if the 
pressure to settle might not be leading some boards in some cases to 
act more leniently than the violation would warrant the report 
said 
the report to be released this week said the state boards are 
getting more complaints and case referrals due to laws requiring 
hospitals insurance companies and others to report actions they 
take against physicians 
case backlogs remain a serious problem significant staff 
shortages continue to impede the boards disciplinary efforts hhs 
inspector general richard kusserow wrote in the draft report a copy 
of which was obtained by the associated press 
after reading the report rep ron wyden dore concluded that 
the different state medical boards still dont have the tools to 
properly address these issues 
this country is playing catchup ball in terms of dealing with 
the quality issues said wyden the chief author of a law 
establishing a national databank for compiling actions taken against 
physicians the databank is expected to go into operation this fall 
since the law was passed in 1986 most states have implemented or 
strengthened statutes requiring mandatory reporting of actions taken 
against physicians kusserows report said 
most states now require hospitals to report their actions against 
physicians and 33 states require insurance companies to report 
medical malpractice cases 
but federally supported peer organizations that review medicare 
claims account for only a small number of cases referred to state 
boards even though they could be a major source of leads about 
doctors who should be disciplined the report said 
in the few instances where these peer groups do refer cases 
state boards dont consider them useful sources of information 
because the review groups have limited authority to release case 
details the report said 
although officials dont know how many complaints are referred to 
state medical boards each year signs that the number is increasing 
are widespread according to the report 
the federation of state medical boards reported the number of 
actions state boards took against physicians rose 29 percent from 
2019 in 1985 to 2597 in 1987 the latest year for which figures 
were available 
however the inspector general estimated that only about 
threequarters of those were initial disciplinary actions against 
physicians the figures do not represent the number of physicians 
disciplined since action by three states against one physician 
would be reported as three actions 
currently there is no way to measure how many physicians warrant 
disciplinary action for delivering improper or substandard care the 
report said 
but some recent studies suggest quite strongly that the 
universe of potential actionable events far exceeds the number of 
disciplinary actions actually imposed by the boards the report 
said 
the report also found that states vary widely in the number of 
actions taken by their medical boards from 1985 to 1987 statewide 
rates of board actions taken ranged from 26 per 1000 physicians to 
322 the median was 143 per 1000 physicians 
the report recommended that states use all revenues from medical 
licensing fees exclusively to support their medical boards it also 
listed changing medicaid and medicare regulations as among the steps 
federal health agencies could take to help coordinate and foster 
cooperative investigative efforts among states

a bomb in a plastic bag exploded in 
a crowded square saturday barely a week before national elections 
injuring about 15 people including tourists enjoying a concert 
witnesses and news reports said 
one witness said scores were injured but that could not be 
independently confirmed 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility and police refused 
to provide details saying it was too early to establish a motive 
with emotions running high ahead of parliamentary elections next 
friday and saturday some people on the scene blamed the explosion 
on attempts to disrupt the democratic process that toppled hardline 
communists last fall 
the governments ctk news agency reported a bomb placed by an 
unknown person in a plastic bag exploded on old town square causing 
light injuries to between 10 and 15 people 
the brief dispatch said the explosion occurred at 416 pm 
old town square is one of pragues bestknown historical 
rendezvous points for tourists as well as a site of frequent rallies 
and weekend concerts 
witnesses who examined the explosive device said what appeared to 
be a pipe bomb was placed close to a statue in the middle of the 
square with a detonation mechanism that included batteries hooked up 
by wires 
it was not clear whether the bomb had a timing device or whether 
it was activated by a person on the scene 
while a music band was playing the bomb exploded injuring 
scores of people including foreign tourists children and women 
present said richard nygryn of prague 
i saw cut lead glass balls on the scene as the cops were 
investigating it nygryn 36 told a reporter a shop widow 
nearby had a large hole in it as if shot through with a cannon 
a man injured by the explosion told me he was just walking by 
when it happened and before he knew anything he was lying on the 
ground with his face covered in blood said 
people at the scene shortly after the blast were blaming 
everybody from the interior minister to the stb for this nygryn 
said 
interior minister richard sacher a christian democrat has been 
accused by opponents of shielding former agents of the stb the 
secret police of the former communist regime led by milos jakes

tens of thousands of communist supporters 
rallied in the east german capital saturday to protest the 
governments decision to take control of the ousted partys vast 
holdings 
in the sort of demonstration that was sometimes harshly dealt 
with by the former stalinist government protesters rallied in a 
park to denounce what they called the fascist action of the 
democratic leadership 
first pds banned second books burned third auschwitz 
read a banner at the rally seeking to compare the government to 
hitlers nazi regime 
pds stands for the party of democratic socialism the 
reconstituted communist party that lost power last year after 
demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of people 
the government news agency adn estimated the crowd at about 
65000 people 
the protesters were angry about the decision by parliament on 
thursday to put the vast holdings of the defunct communist party in 
trust pending an investigation by an independent commission of their 
value and ownership 
the former communists amassed perhaps billions of dollars in 
houses businesses and property during their four decades in power 
lawmaker gregor gysi leader of the former communist faction that 
holds 66 seats in the 400member parliament has accused the 
government of seeking to eliminate his party by seizing its assets 
although the party finished a distant third in east germanys 
first democratic elections on march 18 it enjoys its strongest 
support in the capital where many people owe their careers to loyal 
party membership 
the step by parliament was part of the process of moving east 
germany to a system of private ownership east germany is to combine 
its economy with west germanys by july 2 a prelude to full 
unification expected next year 
the action also was aimed at preventing former communists from 
benefiting financially from german unification by disposing of their 
assets in a free market economy 
the law passed by parliament will allow prime minister lothar de 
maiziere to form a commission in coming days that will have broad 
powers to search houses interrogate witnesses and seize evidence 
east germanys economic minister meanwhile said in a newspaper 
interview saturday that the nation will experience massive unrest 
during the difficult early stages of moving to a free market 
i predict a hot autumn in the gdr gerhard pohl was quoted as 
saying in the west berlin newspaper berliner morgenpost 
many statesupported enterprises are certain to close when forced 
to compete with more efficient western companies and others will 
have to lay off workers to survive 
anywhere from 500000 to 4 million people will lose their jobs in 
the first two years of unification according to estimates the 
country has about 10 million workers 
unrest among the populace cannot be avoided pohl said 
east germany is wrestling with how to dispose of the socalled 
peoplesowned enterprises of the old communist regime 
pohl said 168 such enterprises have been converted to some sort 
of joint private ownership 200 are being considered for similiar 
status and 8000 are still stateowned he said all should be moved 
to the private sector by late october

a group that monitors the helsinki accords on 
saturday began two days of hearings on past soviet human rights 
abuses in a test of whether the kremlin would tolerate public 
discussion of its record 
the hearings coincide with the superpower summit in washington 
where human rights issues were on the agenda of president mikhail s 
gorbachev and president bush 
officials of the international helsinki federation for human 
rights said they decided to hold their annual meeting in moscow to 
gauge the citys suitability for hosting the 1991 conference on 
security and cooperation in europe 
we wanted to see if it is possible to hold a private meeting in 
the soviet union without an official invitation or an official 
sponsor said jeri laber the groups director 
so far she said there have been a few problems especially with 
visas for soviets living abroad including former political prisoner 
yuri orlov 
the problems have been solved but not without lots of fights 
and discussions she said 
gerald nagler a conference organizer said many delegates 
particularly those from eastern europe had to wait until the last 
minute before receiving soviet visas 
laber and nagler said that since arriving in moscow the 
delegates had not been harassed or mistreated by authorities 
the helsinki federation was founded in 1982 and is the umbrella 
group for the 17 national helsinki watch committees it monitors 
compliance with the final provisions of the 1975 helsinki accords 
which covered european security issues economic cooperation and 
human rights 
moscow has been accepted as the site for the federations 1991 
meeting but organizers said it was important to find out early 
whether it was possible to hold a meeting in the soviet capital 
without political or bureaucratic interference 
before its public session saturday the group heard private 
reports from delegates including rosalynn carter wife of former 
us president jimmy carter and yelena bonner the widow of 
activist andrei sakharov 
the group later took testimony from soviets about political 
prisoners psychiatric abuse prison conditions legal changes and 
freedom of the press under the reforms initiated by gorbachev 
findings will be presented at a meeting in copenhagen june 67

irish republican army member joe doherty isnt 
leaving prison but hes getting a new address one his supporters 
hope will refocus attention on his case as he starts his eighth year 
in a federal jail 
the city council this week is prepared to rename the street 
corner below his cell joe doherty corner the plan to honor doherty 
the convicted killer of a british army sergeant in 1980 has angered 
british officials who condemn him as a terrorist and a murderer 
supporters of the name change which is to remain in effect until 
doherty is released hope it will help free him 
it is an abomination that doherty should be held in a prison in 
our city as long as he has been said carolyn maloney the city 
councilwoman who proposed the change 
a city council committee and a local community board already have 
approved the proposal the full council is expected to pass the 
measure at its tuesday session 
supporters hope to hold the official ceremony renaming the corner 
on june 18 the beginning of dohertys eighth year at the jail 
hes lived here as long maybe longer than most of the people 
in this neighborhood said paul goldstein district manager of the 
community board that approved the name change 
indeed he has been in the metropolitan correctional center 
longer than any other inmate in its history longer than most of its 
guards his seventhfloor cell and an orange prison jumpsuit are the 
fixtures in his life 
doherty was unaware of the move to rename the intersection until 
last week when his lawyer mary pike told him about it 
he was visibly delighted hes touched and delighted that 
the people of the city have seen fit to address the injustice of his 
situation pike said 
the 35yearold prisoner has been the focus of a legal battle 
since his arrest at a manhattan bar in 1983 
three years earlier doherty was convicted of murder in the 
machinegun slaying of a british army captain during an ira ambush 
in northern ireland doherty escaped from a belfast prison before 
his conviction used a false passport to enter the united states and 
avoided capture for two years 
the british want him returned to finish his prison term the 
reagan and bush administrations have supported their request but 
deportation has been blocked in the courts 
supporters say doherty is a freedom fighter entitled to political 
asylum and the list of those supporters is impressive mayor david 
dinkins cardinal john j oconnor and more than 100 members of 
congress have called for his release 
the almost exclusively roman catholic ira is fighting to push the 
british out of protestantdominated northern ireland join it with 
the republic of ireland and set up an allireland socialist state 
doherty has never been charged with a crime in the united states 
hes been held without bail that entire time his lawyers were back 
in court on friday arguing for his release pending resolution of his 
status 
courts have ruled that he was entitled to a hearing on whether he 
should be given political asylum but us attorneys general edwin 
meese and dick thornburgh have refused to grant him such a hearing 
the whole matter is still being weighed in federal court in 
manhattan 
north of the prison in midtown manhattan is the british 
consulate where reaction to the honor for doherty was a mixture of 
surprise and disgust 
hes a murderer the vast majority of the people in 
northern ireland will feel somewhat bewildered and puzzled by the 
decision to name a street after him said brian kirk information 
director 
its not the first time city officials used a street sign to send 
a political message 
last year the corner of 42nd street and 12th avenue the site 
of the chinese consulate was renamed tiananmen square a section 
of first avenue opposite the united nations was christened raoul 
wallenberg walk in 1985 after the swedish diplomat who died or 
disappeared in soviet custody after world war ii 
the victory by doherty supporters does not mean he will be able 
to see a street sign through the jails tiny windows 
the irony is though the sign will be literally right outside 
joe will not see it said pike

eisenhower and nikita khrushchev forged the spirit of camp

were very hopeful baker told reporters 
shevardnadze said we are also quite ready for that i have my 
pen ready he took a pen from his pocket and waved it over his 
head 
after two days of meetings major differences still divided bush 
and gorbachev 
the soviet leader concerned about the military strength of a 
united germany has opposed bushs demand that the new nation be a 
full member of nato including its military command 
despite us concerns gorbachev also has showed no sign of 
easing coercion of lithuania which is struggling for independence 
from the soviet union 
gorbachev told reporters that the main subject at camp david was 
regional disputes which includes afghanistan the middle east

as the energy department prepares to resume 
making nuclear warhead triggers at the rocky flats weapons plant 
concern remains about 62 pounds of plutonium in the plants air 
ducts 
at issue whether enough plutonium has accumulated to lead to 
criticality the point at which a nuclear reaction become 
selfsustaining 
phil warner general manager at rocky flats for plant operator 
egampg inc said the plutonium in the air ducts poses no threat but 
state officials and environmentalists want the plutonium removed 
from the air ducts before plutonium processing resumes at the plant 
energy secretary james watkins suspended plutonium operations at 
rocky flats in november and said they only resume when safety 
problems are solved rocky flats 16 miles northwest of denver has 
been operating since 1953 
the plutonium discovered in the air ducts earlier this year got 
into them over many years because filters that were supposed to 
catch the plutonium sometimes failed to work and sometimes were 
removed after becoming clogged officials said 
egampg scientists have said that in a worstcase scenario the 
plutonium in the air ducts could release neutrons that could 
injure or kill within 10 feet warner said 
to my knowledge theres never been a criticality accident that 
involved a nuclear explosion said robert w terry senior health 
physicist for the colorado department of health 
the hazard is to the plant workers in the immediate vicinity of 
the accident he said its not the type of accident likely to 
create a widespread environmental hazard to the offsite 
population 
witnesses to nuclear criticality elsewhere say that when the 
nuclear reactions occurred they saw a blue flash followed by 
ovenlike heat 
workers within the deadly 10to15 foot radius are bombarded with 
neutrons and gamma radiation their skin reddens and severe nausea 
sets in quickly in extreme cases the victim becomes comatose 
within 20 minutes and death follows in a few hours or days 
the plutonium accumulation is the latest in a nearly chain of 
problems that began in june 1989 when the fbi and environmental 
protection agency raided rocky flats looking for evidence of 
illegal disposal of hazardous wastes 
a federal grand jury is examining evidence gathered during that 
raid but has not issued indictments 
late last year the energy department replaced rockwell 
international as the plant operator with egampg as the controversy 
over hazardous waste disposal at the plant heated up egampg took over 
jan 1 
egampg has completed its external radiation measurements of the air 
ducts said doug croucher director of nuclear safety for egampgrocky 
flats 
samples from two of the ducts have been sent to the governments 
los alamos laboratory in new mexico to determine what form the 
plutonium is in and if there are other hazardous substances present 
when weve taken the samples from all of the ducts and know 
whats in there then well end up with our plan on what well do 
warner said 
well never get rid of all of it but i think well find a way 
to deal with the air duct plutonium said victor stello jr the 
energy departments deputy assistant secretary for facilities 
stello said if the plutonium is in an easily removable form such 
as dust it may be vacuumed out he said in other cases the entire 
duct could be removed and replaced 
gov roy romer other elected officials and environmentalists are 
concerned the plant will be restarted too soon 
energy department inspections planned in late june and july could 
lead to resumption of production by fall 
romer wants the air duct problem resolved before production is 
resumed and he has asked colorados congressional delegation to 
hold hearings on whether the suspension of production at rocky flats 
has jeopardized the nations security 
his concern is if they are pushing too hard to restart 
production at rocky flats there might be a chance that corners will 
be cut and we dont want that to happen said john haggard rocky 
flats program manager for the colorado department of health 
but melinda kassen of boulder lawyer for the environmental 
defense fund maintains that the federal governmentreally hasnt 
made a case they have to restart at rocky flats for the purpose of 
national security 
so if it isnt absolutely necessary that they restart for 
national security then why dont they use this opportunity to get 
into compliance with health and safety laws while theyre shut 
down she said 
critics also fear what would happen if fire would hit in those 
plutoniumcontaminated ducts as it did in the plants plating 
laboratory two weeks ago the blaze caused more than 100000 in 
damage but no one was injured

sir rex harrison the english actor whose charm 
graced plays and films for half a century and made him the 
quintessential henry higgins in the musical my fair lady died 
today at age 82 
attorney harold schiff said the actor died of pancreatic cancer 
in his sleep about 445 am at his manhattan residence 
knighted only last summer and still at work on broadway three 
weeks before his death harrison was hailed as one of the most 
gifted comedians of his time hes the best light comedy actor in 
the world noel coward once said next to me 
harrison created the role of henry higgins in the broadway 
premiere of my fair lady in 1956 invented a style of 
halftalking halfsinging called soft singing and won a tony 
award as best actor he won an academy award for the same role in 
the 1964 film version which also won the oscar as best picture and 
revived the role on the stage in 1981 
he had appeared in his last play the circle a revival of a 
1920s comedy by w somerset maugham on broadway until last month 
he missed the last nine days of the run because of illness said 
jeffrey richards a spokesman for the plays producers 
elliot martin who produced the circle and three other shows 
harrison starred in said he had noticed the actor was losing weight 
and did not look well in the final weeks that he performed 
he said well these gallstones are acting up and ill be all 
right after i have a bit of a rest martin recalled 
he died with his boots on no question about it he said 
schiff said harrison wasnt told about his cancer and didnt 
want to know i saw him on friday he was ok he was just fading 
away fortunately there was no pain at all 
when he was knighted last summer harrison said he had no 
intention of retiring because i wouldnt know what to do 
i think they rather like to leave awarding honors until you get 
to a certain age he said it was a marvelous moment kneeling 
there and getting tapped on each shoulder 
among his films were doctor dolittle 1967 and the yellow 
rollsroyce 1964 
but his most famous film appearance was his reprise of his stage 
role as the stuffy language professor higgins in my fair lady 
who falls in love with a cockney waif after teaching her how to 
speak proper english 
the alan jay lernerfrederick loewe musical known for such songs 
as the rain in spain and i could have danced all night was 
based on the george bernard shaw play pygmalion 
married six times harrison said he brought much of himself to 
playing higgins who at first is cold and imperious with eliza 
doolittle 
i wouldnt call it a hardness exactly but in the piece i was 
trying to train this girl eliza and she irritated the hell out of 
me harrison said in a 1989 interview with a london newspaper 
women can irritate the hell out of me i dont tell women what 
to expect out of me they learn to adjust i suppose either that or 
they walk away which has happened throughout my life 
he was like all very great stars he was temperamental he was 
excitable and he was very funny his agent lawrence evans said 
in london 
he had the best sense of humor of almost any actor i have ever 
known said evans who worked with the actor for more than 40 
years he was a lovable irascible man 
the actor last appeared on the london stage in the admirable 
crichton in 1988 
he has now become a gently feathery presence who potters 
benignly about with little of the tenor bark that was once his 
trademark wrote a critic for the guardian newspaper 
harrison was born reginald carey harrison in huyton near 
liverpool on march 5 1908 he joined the liverpool repertory 
theatre in 1924 
his first appearance on the london stage was in 1930 and by the 
end of the decade he emerged as a star having played in rattigans 
french without tears from 1936 to 1938 
the first of his six marriages was in 1934 to collette thomas a 
french teacher 
marriage number two was to actress lili palmer in 1943 and she 
accompanied him as he began his american career 
asked what sort of a husband he was miss palmer once said he 
was a mans man an englishman lets face it englishmen dont like 
women 
after that marriage was dissolved in 1957 harrison married 
actress kay kendall who died of leukemia in 1959 
playwright sir terence rattigan said of those times i realized 
rexs great courage he made the last two years of kays life the 
best years 
years later harrison starred in rattigans in praise of 
love the story of a man whose wife is dying of an incurable 
disease and is forbidden by doctors from telling her 
harrison married english actress rachel roberts in 1962 they 
were divorced in 1976 he then married elizabeth harris and later

memorial be called a celebration and that there be jazz

when mikhail s gorbachev visits the brand family 
farm in minnesota on sunday the soviet leader will see a 
pictureperfect 240acre operation profitably run by four people 
an utterly alien concept at home 
by contrast the dzerzhinsky collective farm on the outskirts of 
moscow has 140 acres and a staff of 1300 
as a vegetable farm with greenhouses for winter crops the 
dzerzhinsky operation could be expected to have a few more workers 
than the brands who raise alfalfa corn soybeans and 75 dairy cows 
on their spread in farmington 
but the soviet farm also has its own stores in moscow its own 
drivers and trucks to haul produce to the stores its own 
construction workers to build farm buildings and housing for the 
staff 
president gorbachevs reforms allowed it to sell onethird of its 
crop at market prices last year so the farm spent the profits on 
its own fully staffed hospital 
under the communist system of bureaucratic distribution it is 
difficult to obtain nearly everything from building supplies to 
the services of a skilled stonemason there is no such thing as 
renting a spare tractor or running down to the local feed store for 
a few supplies 
so state businesses have evolved into huge selfcontained 
communities hoarding scarce resources like trucks and construction 
workers so they will be available when needed 
the result is massive inefficiency 
soviet farms employ more than eight times as many people as 
american farms and they produce far less food even using the 
production statistics that soviets now admit are inflated 
many soviet farms resort to oldfashioned barter to obtain needed 
materials pravda the communist party newspaper reported saturday 
that one collective farm traded 30 tons of meat and 50 tons of 
potatoes to a dnepopetrovsk factory for metal wire fencing and 
other products 
gorbachev himself has said 25 percent of his countrys crops are 
lost in harvest and storage 
soviet farming also has taken a toll on people 
working and living conditions in isolated villages drive some 
residents to drink heavily the government newspaper izvestia 
reported saturday in an article about eight farmers from tula who 
died after downing a poison they thought contained alcohol 
gorbachev is bringing needed change to soviet agriculture he 
promises a switch to a market system albeit slowly he pushed 
through reforms to allow family farming on land leased from the 
state for up to 50 years and he has allowed more produce to be sold 
directly to consumers 
but he still wont allow a soviet family to own their own farm 
that idea veers too closely to capitalism 
gorbachev tried to raise grain production and reduce imports last 
year by promising to pay soviet farmers in foreign currency for 
exceeding planned production newspapers reported the program a 
failure most farmers disbelieving the offer ignored it 
last month gorbachev doubled the price paid to farmers for their 
grain and bread prices are expected to triple on july 1 to help 
cover that change 
as gorbachev said in washington on friday he was naive to think 
that minor tinkering with the soviet system would fix the economy 
there was no incentive there was no motivation for people to 
work he said 
but many soviets question gorbachevs intentions on agricultural 
reform there will be no radical change reformers say as long as 
the key communist party post in charge of agriculture is held by 
yegor ligachev an ardent believer in collective farming

when soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
climbed aboard marine one for a 30minute flight to camp david on 
saturday it may have been his first ride in a helicopter in the 
past he has avoided them 
most foreign leaders who visit washington and arrive by jet at 
andrews air force base in suburban maryland take a short helicopter 
ride to the white house 
but on his arrival last wednesday for a fourday summit meeting 
with president bush gorbachev traveled into the city by motorcade 
and made his formal appearance at the white house the following 
morning 
during his december 1987 summit with former president reagan 
gorbachev declined an offer to take a helicopter from andrews to the 
white house 
all us presidents since dwight eisenhower have made frequent 
use of helicopters both for speed and to avoid tying up washington 
street traffic with motorcades 
but gorbachev who has flown in many jets has never been known 
to use a helicopter either inside or outside the soviet union 
a leading soviet journalist novosti press agency head albert i 
vlasov said he believed saturdays flight was the soviet leaders 
first in a whirlybird 
soviet diplomats said they did not know whether gorbachev has an 
aversion to choppers but one official said it would not be strange 
if he did 
so who does like helicopters said the soviet official who 
requested anonymity they shake they whirl around they make 
noise a car is much better if you can take one 
as helicopters go however the presidential version a modified 
military h3 is relatively comfortable it is vipequipped with a 
dozen seats bush sits in a captains type chair facing another 
one which gorbachev presumably used there is a pull down table 
that can be opened between them or left up for more leg room 
the rest of the seats are benchstyle along the sides to give 
barbara bush and raisa gorbachev the same comfortable seats their 
husbands got they flew to camp david in a separate but identical 
helicopter departing from the south lawn of the white house 10 
minutes after the two heads of state

three major issues and possibly that old 
nemesis star wars still block the way to a landmark treaty to cut 
us and soviet longrange nuclear missiles 
despite optimistic summit statements by president bush and 
mikhail s gorbachev indicating the treaty can be concluded this 
year roughly 30 issues remain unresolved 
ever since 1982 when president ronald reagan reversed his 
skepticism of the arms control process and proposed deep cuts in 
globegirdling nuclear bombers missiles and submarines american 
and soviet negotiators have been grappling with a multitude of 
thorny issues 
one of the most difficult was the us strategic defense 
initiative known informally as star wars the reagan dream of 
mounting a defense in space against soviet ballistic missiles 
moscow threatened to delay cutting offensive arms unless the united 
states abandoned that program 
last year the soviets relented but they did not swear never to 
try again 
and last week as negotiators working at the state department 
burrowed into the toughest remaining offensive weapons issues the 
soviets tried again to establish what the experts call linkage 
a senior us official describing the attempt said friday 
night we thought we had this problem straight and then the 
soviets made proposals that unraveled it and that sort of slowed us 
up on the pace that we were on because we had to push them back onto 
the ground that had been agreed which we managed to do 
the tactic that worked was deferring the issue to a second round 
of negotiations to be held immediately after the strategic arms 
reduction treaty start is signed 
in the future talks the two sides will discuss strategic 
stability issues of interest to them a joint statement issued 
friday night said including the the relationship between 
strategic offensive and defensive arms 
that appears to mean the star wars genie is back in the bottle 
but it has a way of escaping 
in the meantime american and soviet negotiators must confront 
three tough issues when the bargaining resumes june 11 in geneva 
they are 
the kinds of restrictions to impose on the 154 heavy 
groundbased ss18 intercontinental missiles the soviets will retain 
under the treaty 
secretary of state james a baker iii proposed last month in 
moscow very limited testing but the soviets are demanding more 
freedom to improve their deadliest nuclear weapon 
whether the soviet backfire bomber is to be classified as a 
strategic weapon as the united states demands that would mean 
counting backfires against numerical weapons limits established in 
the treaty 
the soviets have offered to make a declaration that the bomber 
would not be used on intercontinental missions and they are willing 
to restrict inflight fueling as the soviets offered to do 13 years 
ago 
the restrictions to be imposed on us and soviet transfers of 
weapons barred under the treaty to allies from the united states 
to britain for instance 
surveying the road ahead of him a senior us official speaking 
on condition of anonymity acknowledged so weve got our work cut 
out for us but he added we can continue with the presidents 
commitment to finish a treaty this year and we intend to do so 
apart from the three tough issues and a lot of unfinished work 
on how inspectors will make sure the cuts are faithfully executed 
there are more than twodozen other issues to be ironed out 
also there is the vexing problem of the text itself 
more than 400 pages have been compiled already in geneva but the 
wordage will mount as negotiators come to closure on unsettled 
issues and then will come the lawyers poring over the language for 
loopholes 
it is a serious task as the debate in the reagan years over the 
meaning of the 1972 ussoviet antiballistic missile treaty showed 
the treaty restricted antimissile defenses as a means of 
deterring a nuclear attack the theory was a potential aggressor 
would not risk devastating retaliation by launching a first strike 
however the advent of the strategic defense initiative marked a 
change in us strategy the reagan administration the senate 
which had ratified the 1972 treaty the soviet union and the arms 
control community examined the text under a magnifying glass 
proponents looked for evidence the program was legal opponents for 
proof it was not 
the administration insisted the treaty did not prohibit the 
development of an antimissile system using nuclear weapons in 
space the soviets and american critics including all the former 
us negotiators except paul h nitze said star wars was in confict 
with the treaty 
the debate has subsided with bush administrations muted 
enthusiasm for reagans dream 
but the seeds of disagreement are firmly planted 
initially the treaty was advertised as massively cutting us 
and soviet longrange nuclear weapons by 50 percent 
that claim is not made any more in the negotiations the two 
sides have cut various deals to allow them to hold on to favorite 
weapons through a variety of strategems 
for instance the united states can pack 20 airlaunched cruise 
missiles aboard a b52 bomber but the warheads will be counted as 10 
apiece on the first 150 bombers 
jack mendelsohn deputy director of the private arms control 
association said saturday that the treaty as it stands now would 
result in a 30 percent reduction in us ballistic warheads 
the soviets would have to destroy 50 percent of their warheads 
as well as 50 percent of their 308 ss18 missiles and the 
throwweight or deliverable power of the missiles mendelsohn 
said in an interview 
but the treaty also will give the two sides enough leeway to 
rejigger their strategic weapons arsenals in a way that will result 
in an overall reduction of no more than 10 to 20 percent he said

the irish republican army on saturday claimed 
responsibility for the shooting deaths of two british soldiers 
striking less than a week after it killed two tourists in the 
netherlands 
gunmen of the group fighting british rule in northern ireland 
killed a british army major saturday outside his home in dortmund 
west germany and wounded a police officer when they got away during 
a chase 
in the central english town of lichfield police hunted for two 
men who shot and killed a soldier and wounded two others waiting for 
a train friday afternoon 
while british troops remain in ireland such attacks will 
continue the ira said in a statement distributed to news media in 
dublin ireland 
on sunday ira gunmen killed two londonbased australian lawyers 
in the town square in roermond the netherlands the ira later said 
it had mistaken the men for soldiers 
there is no argument or reason in this it is simply that they 
are out to kill defense secretary tom king said saturday in an 
interview with press association the domestic news agency 
they are out to cover the humiliation of their mistake in 
killing two young australians in holland he said 
the attacks in the netherlands germany and england continued an 
ira strategy of attacking soft targets associated with the 
british army such as offduty soldiers or recruiting centers 
the ira a mainly roman catholic group seeks to unite ireland 
under a socialist government it is outlawed both in the 
predominantly catholic republic of ireland and in northern ireland 
a british province where paramilitary protestant groups side with 
london 
rolf hannich a spokesman for the west german federal prosecutor 
said maj michael john dillonlee was shot several times in the head 
as he returned to his home in a british army housing area in 
dortmund just after midnight 
he had parked his car and gotten out when one of two persons in 
a mazda car shot him hannich said quoting a dortmund police 
report his wife was in the car but was not hurt 
the suspects silver mazda was spotted a short time later in 
dortmund and two police cars tried to stop it 
shots were fired from the mazda at the police cars chasing it 
and one policeman was hit in the foot hannich said the car was 
later found abandoned in hammboenen about 15 miles east of the 
murder scene 
it was the second ira killing in less than a year in dortmund 
home to about 10000 british soldiers on sept 7 an ira unit 
killed heidi hazell 26 the germanborn wife of a british soldier 
about five hours before the west german attack two men with 
handguns shot the three soldiers at the lichfield city rail station 
about 100 miles northwest of london then fled across the tracks 
the ministry of defense identified the dead man as 19yearold 
pvt william robert davies of pontarddulais south wales the 
wounded men were robert parkin 20 and neil evans 19 the ministry 
of defense said 
the attacks followed a spate of reports last week that peter 
brooke the top british official in northern ireland was making 
progress toward arranging negotiations on a new political agreement 
for the province 
brookes delicate initiative is intended to open negotiations 
between protestant parties and the mainly roman catholic social 
democratic and labor party sinn fein the ira political wing 
which draws about a third of the catholic vote in northern ireland 
is excluded from the negotiations 
the ira and other republican splinter groups fighting british 
rule have caused more than half of the nearly 2800 deaths in 
northern ireland since the british army entered the province in 1969 
in addition the ira has killed at least 14 people in europe and 
several dozen in england including 21 in pub bombings in birmingham 
in 1974 and 11 marine bandsmen in deal kent in september 
loyalist paramilitary groups associated with protestants in 
northern ireland are responsible for about onefourth of the deaths 
while 12 percent are blamed on the police and army according to a 
study published last year by irish journalist michael mckeown

cambodias prince norodom sihanouk whose rebels are 
fighting the countrys communist regime arrived saturday for peace 
talks but he said other guerrillas may not honor a proposed 
ceasefire 
there will be a dangerous situation after the signing 
sihanouk said in beijing before boarding a plane for tokyo there 
will be peace on paper but not on the ground 
the three days of talks toward ending the 11yearold civil war 
are mired in dispute even before their scheduled start monday the 
hun sen government supported by vietnam refuses to consider giving 
an equal voice to sihanouks powerful communist allies the khmer 
rouge 
vietnam invaded cambodia in 1978 to end three years of rule by 
the chinesebacked khmer rouge whose repressive policies are blamed 
for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of cambodians 
sihanouk who also represents two noncommunist guerrilla groups 
supported by the united states said in beijing that he will sign 
the ceasefire accord with premier hun sen to show the good will 
of the resistance and in order to show that i am in favor of a quick 
return of peace in cambodia 
but he said the khmer rouge the strongest of the three guerrilla 
factions have told him they are unhappy with the agreement crafted 
by thailands defense minister gen chavalit yongchaiyudh 
the khmer rouge claim vietnamese troops still occupy cambodia 
despite a massive pullout last year and that vietnam has annexed 
cambodian territory 
so there will be a possibility that in tokyo the khmer rouge 
will more or less sabotage the peace process sihanouk said 
he also criticized hun sen for saying that khmer rouge leader 
khieu samphan should not be allowed to sign the peace accord by 
ostracizing the khmer rouge leader sihanouk said indirectly hun 
sen encourages the khmer rouge to go on fighting 
sihanouk said there will be no effective body to oversee the 
ceasefire and he called for reconvening the paris conference on 
cambodia which ended in failure last year 
resistance forces led by the khmer rouge have launched major 
attacks in recent days in a drive to expand areas under their 
control before the june 46 tokyo meeting 
guerrilla leaders and diplomats say the khmer rouge have made the 
most substantial gains but the prohanoi government of hun sen also 
has been active on the battlefields 
sihanouk 67 was not available to reporters upon arriving in 
tokyo he held a 55minute meeting with prime minister toshiki kaifu 
and thanked him for agreeing to a thai suggestion to host the 
conference a foreign ministry official told reporters 
speaking on condition of anonymity the official said sihanouk 
told kaifu he had made a major compromise in recently proposing that 
two sides his guerrilla coalition and the hun sen government 
make up a national council to prepare for elections

true there were some 11thhour 
negotiations but the seeds of president bushs decision to grant 
trade concessions to the soviet union were sown in his renewal of 
trade benefits for the chinese and his refusal to impose sanctions 
against moscow over lithuania 
bushs action meant that for the second time in as many weeks he 
was ignoring widespread congressional opposition to a trade 
agreement with a regime whose human rights policies have been 
sharply criticized 
bushs earlier renewal of trade benefits to china and his 
decision not to slap economic sanctions on moscow over its hardline 
approach in the baltic states made it harder for him to say no to an 
anxious gorbachev some aides are suggesting 
if bush won any private assurances from gorbachev on lithuania in 
exchange for the trade deal neither side was letting on 
us officials insisted that bush did not extract any such 
commitment from gorbachev and soviet officials continue to 
characterize the stalemate as an internal dispute that they will 
resolve themselves 
us sources said that even though soviet officials balked at 
the last minute at signing a grain deal bushs mind was not made up 
by this last minute soviet attempt at haggling 
instead gorbachevs fervent direct appeal for the agreement and 
bushs desire to help strengthen the hand of the embattled soviet 
leader at home had more bearing on his decision the officials 
it was quite obvious that gorbachev was seeking something on 
the economic front its obviously something that he wanted to take 
home said one official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the soviet leader himself made it clear in his comments to 
congressional leaders on friday at the soviet embassy that he sorely 
wanted the trade pact 
and in fact gorbachev himself raised the specter of the 
tiananmen square crackdown in noting that the united states had 
extended its mostfavorednation trade hand to beijing but not to 
moscow 
gorbachev pressed the same points in meetings with bush both on 
thursday and on friday said an administration official at one 
point bush even expressed frustration that the supreme soviet had 
not yet acted onlong pending legislation to codify moreliberal 
emigration policies sources said 
the soviet leader told bush he would make an even harder effort 
to get the law passed the sources said 
sources said gorbachevs forceful pleas together with bushs 
historical bias against economic sanctions helped the soviet leader 
win his case 
as bush and gorbachev relaxed at the us presidential retreat 
here in the cactoctin mountains of maryland on saturday the 
divisive trade decision was behind them and they went on to other 
issues 
but the bush administration still faces a likely battle in 
congress as the president tries to win approval of the new 
agreement a tough battle is also expected on the china move 
with china bush renewed already existing mostfavorednation 
status for another year but the soviet union has not had 
mostfavorednation status since 1952 when it was revoked by 
congress the jacksonvanik amendment to the 1974 trade act requires 
a country to have both a trade agreement with the united states and 
a law allowing free emigration before it can be granted 
mostfavorednation status 
in giving gorbachev the trade agreement the first part of the 
equation bush also attached a short string he told the soviet 
leader he would not even send the measure to congress for approval 
until the supreme soviet passes the emigration law 
however the strings extended only to emigration policy not 
lithuania and the absence of any soviet concessions on lithuania is 
what is likely to stir the most opposition the senate passed a 
resolution may 1 urging bush to hold off granting 
mostfavorednation status to the soviets until they lifted the 
blockade against lithuania 
administration officials are backpeddling trying to assert that 
there never had been a link between trade and lithuania 
secretary of state james a baker iii said friday there has 
been no formal linkage by anybody in this administration that i am 
aware of between the two issues baker didnt place it there but 
the emphasis clearly was on the word formal since before the 
summit one official after another had informally linked the trade 
pact with progress on two fronts the soviet emigration law and 
lithuania

a proplo palestinian leader in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip said saturday that us targets in the 
region might be attacked as antiamerican sentiment intensifies 
im thinking of people who will just want to express their 
anger both against american symbols and american institutions 
palestinian intellectual sari nusseibeh said in an interview 
he said he and others who have urged restraint are becoming 
increasingly isolated 
palestinians are angered by washingtons veto of a un security 
council resolution calling for a councilappointed team to be sent 
to the occupied lands to report on israeli abuses 
us embassy spokesman don cofman said us officials are aware 
of the mood in the territories but he declined comment when asked 
whether additional steps had been taken to protect americans 
the us state department issued a travel advisory for the middle 
east on thursday urging americans to use extreme caution the 
advisory cited the recent upsurge of violence 
cofman also refused comment on reports confirmed by israeli 
officials that the us embassy in tel avivs beachfront hotel 
district was one of the targets of palestinian guerrillas 
intercepted by israeli forces off the coast wednesday four 
guerrillas were killed and 12 captured in the failed sea raid 
the palestine liberation front of mohammed abbas claimed its 
guerrillas were involved 
the front is a faction of the plo and on saturday kuwaits 
alwatan newspaper quoted abbas as apologizing for not informing plo 
leader yasser arafat in advance of the failed attack abbas said 
however that more attacks will be launched against israel 
arafat has disassociated the plo from the operation but has 
stopped short of condemning it outright the us state department 
has left open the possibility that the operation could affect the 
usplo dialogue begun after arafat renounced terrorism in december 
1988 
wednesdays incident was the latest in an upsurge of violence 
that began with the may 20 massacre of seven arab laborers by an 
israeli gunman israeli security forces killed 16 palestinians and 
hurt hundreds in subsequent protests 
two israelis were killed in retaliation including a 72yearold 
man who died in a bomb explosion in jerusalem 
in the gaza strip on saturday five palestinian teenagers were 
wounded by army gunfire in clashes arab doctors said an army 
official said he was checking the reports 
jerusalem police spokesman uzi sandori said saturday that police 
dismantled a bomb attached to a gas balloon in a jerusalem 
restaurant the bomb was discovered after police noticed four masked 
youths near the restaurant and began searching the area he said 
on the northern outskirts of jerusalem ultraorthodox jewish 
youths gathered along a main thoroughfare and stoned arabowned 
cars israel radio said 
nusseibeh described by israel as one of the heads behind the 
30month palestinian uprising said young arab activists are 
increasingly pressuring for more violence against israel 
he said the arabs in the occupied lands are rapidly losing hope 
that a peace settlement can be reached he blamed hardline israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir who has rejected us proposals for a 
palestinianisraeli dialogue 
there is going to be a rapid deterioration into a cycle of 
bloodshed and violence nusseibeh told the associated press in a 
telephone interview saturday 
i believe more and more palestinians will turn to using guns 
and explosives i assume that the unified leadership will probably 
go with the people said nusseibeh referring to the underground 
umbrella group of various plo factions coordinating the uprising 
its quite possible that there will also be attacks against 
american targets he said 
until now the uprising leadership has ordered activists to stick 
to stones and firebombs saying that the use of firearms would only 
give israel an excuse to crack down harder 
on friday palestinian leaders including nusseibeh declared a 
boycott on contacts with us diplomats and called on the arab world 
to boycott usmade goods to protest the us veto in the security 
council 
in response the 15000member gaza strip trade union federation 
on saturday called on workers in the arab world to refuse servicing 
us planes and ships on tuesday that day marks the 23rd 
anniversary of the start of the 1967 middle east war in which israel 
captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from egypt

americas oldest lake worthy of its name it would establish an 
algae abatement district similar to mosquito abatement 
districts water districts and fire districts 
with an average depth of about 35 feet clear lakes warm water 
is host to a delicate ecosystem and more than 100 varieties of 
algae including three kinds of bluegreen nuisance algae 
usually the algae goes unnoticed by scores of bass anglers and 
tourists who flock to the lake for fun and fishing 
all we need is a good afternoon breeze to blow it away said 
bob mingori president of the lake county chamber of commerce 
generally its the sign of a healthy lake 
but every so often on no particular schedule the algae 
blooms creating a thick smelly oillike slick when it rots 
it creates methane gas that kills fish and the stink chases away 
tourists 
fed up with debates and studies sylvia savage modeled measure a 
after another nuisance the mosquito 
savages proposal would require lake county to set aside money 
for algae cleanup i want to immediately start reducing it by 
getting boats and water barges and vacuuming that algae up said 
savage 
she said that a similar effort in 1985 cleaned a onemile area 
and scooped up more than 200 pounds of algae in less than one hour 
but critics of measure a fear it could drain county funds 
instead residents hardest hit by the algae outbreaks can control 
the problem privately by pumping air into the water or spraying it 
down with hoses they maintain 
county supervisor karan mackey said it would be irresponsible to 
create a second special district when the mosquito district could 
handle the algae challenge 
we are not trying to make this lake clear mackey said it 
has never been clear

two men posing as army officers on 
saturday kidnapped a local journalist reporting on the moslem 
separatist movement in kashmir for western news organizations 
officials said 
hours later a moslem shopkeeper also was abducted in a similar 
manner said the officials who cannot be identified under briefing 
rules no one claimed responsibility for the alleged kidnappings 
and it was not immediately clear if the two incidents were related 
the kidnappings occurred during a break in a curfew hundreds of 
people have died in violence since a government crackdown on 
separatists began in january 
officials said journalist yusuf jameel a kashmiri moslem who has 
reported for time magazine the british broadcasting corp and 
reuters was led away from his home in srinagar the city is the 
summer capital of jammukashmir state and the cradle of the movement 
to secede from mostly hindu india 
a servant of jameel hakim din said two men wearing army 
officers uniforms arrived at the house in a jeep similar to ones 
used by the military and demanded to meet the reporter 
jameels colleague photographer mehraj uddin who also lives in 
the house said jameel told him i am being arrested by the army 
take care of yourself 
the government denied jameel was arrested or taken away by any 
of the security forces or the army for helping any investigation 
a state government spokesman who cannot be identified under 
briefing rules said officials suspect foul play by people bent on 
maligning the administration and the security forces 
he said the police registered the case as a kidnapping and 
started investigations in the right earnest to trace out mr 
jameel and culprits 
jameel also has reported for the telegraph a major indian daily 
based in calcutta 
four hours after jameels disappearance two men wearing military 
uniforms who arrived in a jeep took away a shopkeeper ghulam 
mohammad gujwari in another srinagar neighborhood the government 
officials said 
residents on saturday used the curfew break the first in 12 days 
in srinagar to stock up on sorely needed food supplies a 
combination of roundtheclock curfews imposed by the government and 
strikes ordered by moslem militants have made daily life difficult 
in the city 
at least 486 people have been killed since january in kashmir 
the scenic valley comprising srinagar and neighboring districts 
most of the victims were militants or supporters of the separatist 
campaign 
kashmir was divided along a stilldisputed frontier between india 
and pakistan after british colonial inida became independent in 1947 
and was partitioned along religious lines 
india and pakistan have fought two wars over the territory in 
194748 and 1965 
relations between the two nations have sunk to their lowest point 
in years over the kashmir issue india accuses pakistan of funding 
and training the militants pakistan denies the claim and says india 
is crushing a movement for selfdetermination 
about 64 percent of the 6 million people in indiagoverned 
jammukashmir are moslem nationwide moslems account for 12 percent 
of indias 880 million people while hindus comprise 82 percent

accuse the bettereducated mohajirs of taking the best jobs and most 
valuable land

qami movement which is demanding that the mohajirs be recognized as 
pakistans fifth nationality along with the pathans punjabis 
baluch and sindhis

measures including indefinite curfews and checkpoints manned by

ethipian rebels said saturday they will 
release a cuban physician and nurse to us diplomats five months 
after the two were captured in the fall of a town near the sudanese 
border 
the us embassy will take custody of the two on thursday and fly 
them to london said t ebba spokesman for the rebel oromo 
liberation front the cuban government will take charge there he 
said 
in cairo egypt counselor abdulrahman hamza of the sudanese 
embassy who first announced the planned release said he was not 
told how the united states came to be involved in the case the us 
embassy in khartoum was closed for the weekend and officials could 
not be reached for comment 
cuba a supporter of ethiopias marxist government and an 
opponent of the united states has diplomatic relations with sudan 
but no embassy in khartoum in cairo cuban ambassador jorge cubiles 
hernandes said he knew nothing of the plan 
the captive cubans dr pedro ulaka 35 and jolanda hernandez 
23 both of havana disappeared in the first week of january with 
four other cuban medical personnel 
all six were working at asosa in far western ethiopia just east 
of the sudanese border when the area came under attack from 
antigovernment forces 
the oromo liberation front a tribal resistance group active 
since the early 1970s claimed the asosa victory 
two of the cubans were released in april in sana yemen 
hamza said two will remain captives after thursdays release but 
that the sudanese government was still trying to gain their release 
they are in good health he said 
hamza said the us embassy in khartoum already has acted as 
gobetween once this year previously in the release of poles held 
by ethiopian rebels 
us diplomats teamed with polish government representatives in 
january to free 30 poles held for 20 days by rebels from eritrea in 
northeastern ethiopia they were seized from a ship that came under 
fire because rebels suspected it was running guns to the addis ababa

quality standards at va medical centers 
generally lagged behind those of other hospitals in a survey made by 
a national accrediting group officials confirmed saturday 
veterans affairs department officials said saturday they were 
concerned about the results of the survey by the group that 
accredits most of the nations hospitals and will move quickly to 
make changes where problems can be remedied 
the joint commission on accreditation of health care 
organizations based in oakbrook terrace ill studied 116 of the 
172 va centers that provide medical care to 35 million veterans 
annually 
it found the centers at least 20 percent more likely than other 
hospitals to fall below quality standards in the areas of emergency 
services special care services surgery and anesthesia services 
surgical case review alcohol and drug treatment planning and fire 
safety it did not name any centers 
the los angeles times in editions last week quoted william 
jessee the commissions vice president for accreditation surveys 
as saying the va had a seriously aging infrastructure in its 
health care facilities 
jessee said the va had not been adequately funded to bring 
these physical plants up to current lifesafety standards 
va spokesman don smith acknowledged that a number of problems 
were found at centers on the west coast particularly in the area of 
recordkeeping 
we recognize a necessity to keep better records smith said 
in an interview saturday we havent been doing it in some 
instances and we need to do that 
smith said however that recordkeeping problems were not the 
same as deficiencies in providing care he added that he did not 
think that the recitation of the commissions findings will shake 
the system to its roots 
i dont want to excuse them though and i dont think the 
system wants to excuse them he added 
don avant a special assistant to the commission president said 
in a telephone interview there were many good people in the 
veterans health care system but he added that the department was 
bureaucratic 
the department asked the commission to make the study in response 
to a request from sen alan cranston dcalif 
on a system with a maximum score of 100 the average for the 
veterans centers was 698 while that of the average of 5182 other 
hospitals was 77 hospitals are surveyed every three years for 
accreditation purposes 
under the system a score of 90 merits a commendation rating 
while anything lower than 50 puts a hospital on a probationary 
status 
six percent of veterans hospitals received 875 points or more in 
the study compared with about 25 percent of other hospitals but 16 
percent of the veterans institutions scored 575 or fewer points 
compared with 4 percent among other hospitals 
smith said six veterans medical centers are on conditional 
accreditation status long beach sepulveda and palo alto in 
california portland and roseburg in oregon and walla walla in 
washington 
he said all veterans hospitals are accredited

what seemed like a good idea to genevieve 
mclaughlin donating the 1200 her retirement party would cost to 
charity failed to go over with a committee appointed by her 
employer independence blue cross 
spokesman dick mendenhall announced the panels decision friday 
saying the nonprofit health insurance company would not donate the 
money but will continue to pick up the tab for retirement lunches at 
a fancy hotel for employees of a decade or more 
the 1200 lunches are complete with flowers photographs and a 
100 gift certificate the guest of honor can invite up to 35 
coworkers and a handful of managers attend 
ms mclaughlin thought a better use for the money would be 
donations to her favorite charities st johns hospice and her 
grandsons little league team 
mendenhall explained why the committee which was appointed to 
study the issue disagreed 
the point of this sort of luncheon is to honor the person 
through a gathering of associates and friends for reminiscence 
camaraderie and so on said mendenhall these luncheons are 
entirely voluntary if the person doesnt want a luncheon then 
we dont have one 
mendenhall said donating the money would defeat the purpose 
the intent of the recognition is to encourage interaction with 
other employees 
ms mclaughlin 64 believes she won despite the decision 
i brought this to a head and i know that between the news 
reports other companies are going to read about it and maybe 
somebody out there is going to have a heart and say were going to 
let the employees have what they want she said 
maybe somebody will even want to sponsor a little league team 
blue cross told ms mclaughlin she could still have a goingaway 
luncheon but shes still not interested 
the former medicare claims adjuster made a few waves with her 
request after her story was reported in the philadelphia daily 
news a reader wrote the paper suggesting that she think about 
running for local office 
another letter writer a 15year blue cross employee worried 
that the company might decide to drop the lunches altogether 
i want mine she wrote

the sound of a battering ram used in a 
drug raid at a neighbors apartment spooked a man who hopped out his 
window into the waiting arms of a police officer in the right place 
at the right time 
poor balance combined with bad timing to aid in the arrest when 
the man tossed a small bag of cocaine to the ground while fleeing 
then looked back to see where it was and he tripped police 
cmdr rudy legenza said saturday 
legenza arrested the man friday for investigation of cocaine 
possession and resisting arrest thought to be an undocumented 
alien the man was being held by immigration authorities his name 
was withheld 
we were going for apartment 5 but apparently the man in 
apartment 4 thought his apartment was being raided legenza said 
he jumped out through a window and landed on me 
the arrest of the man dashing from his firstfloor apartment was 
an easy catch so to speak he said 
three people from the other apartment were arrested for 
investigation of various drug charges police said 
police knew of no links between the neighbors

a new procedure using healthy muscle cells 
may help correct the protein defect that causes the most common 
childhood form of muscular dystrophy a researcher said saturday 
in a preliminary study the genetic therapy called myoblast 
transfer produced a protein whose absence due to a gene defect 
causes duchenne muscular dystrophy said dr peter k law of the 
university of tennesseememphis at the muscular dystrophy 
associations meeting here 
the degenerative neuromuscular disease strikes young boys almost 
exclusively 
until now we have been dealing with children that are dying 
a disease that so far has had no hope no treatment and no cure 
law said for that reason i feel that the development of this 
work is very important 
the procedure involves injecting healthy muscle cells of an 
adult often a sibling or parent into the youth with duchenne 
dystrophy researchers said 
law said the therapy as the first effective treatment for 
duchenne but not as a total cure because it is still unknown how 
much function children will develop with it or how much longer they 
will live 
duchenne victims usually die in their teens or young adult years 
laws study found that a bigtoe muscle injected with healthy 
immature muscle cells produced dystrophin the protein missing from 
those with the disease 
our intention is to furnish the muscle with the missing 
formula the missing recipe the blueprint said dr leon i 
charash a neurological specialist in new york who is the chairman 
of the mdas medical advisory committee the concept is giving the 
cells what they missed 
the researchers noted that the studies were still very 
preliminary but said research on the therapy in canada has produced 
similar results 
these are the first known clinical tests in the world of this 
therapy so the results will require extremely cautious and lengthy 
analysis law said but if all goes as planned if our work 
remains on schedule we hope to bring this forth as a widespread 
treatment by 1992 
law said no adverse effects from the procedure or the 
antirejection treatment were reported 
charash said the therapy if successful eventually could be 
applied to other dystrophies 
he also noted however that the therapy has been done on the 
smallest of levels and will next be tried on larger muscles as the 
canadian researchers have begun 
myoblast transfer holds great promise as a potential therapy 
for muscular dystrophy and other devestating hereditary muscle 
diseases charash said many more questions must be answered and 
much remains to be done before the procedure can become a treatment 
but dr laws finding is an exciting first sign of success 
laws research along with others is funded by the mda which 
oversees research treatment and care for people with 40 
neuromuscular diseases 
the organization based in new york is moving its national 
headquarters to tucson

the palestinian leader who claimed responsibility 
for last weeks failed raid against israel said plo chief yasser 
arafat had no advance knowledge of the attack a newspaper reported 
saturday 
mohammed abbas leader of the palestine liberation front also 
pledged to carry out more raids against the jewish state 
we vow to continue the struggle until the objective of our 
people in independence and liberation is achieved abbas said he 
was speaking in an interview with kuwaits alwatan newspaper the 
daily did not say where he was interviewed 
we mean what we say this operation is the beginning of a 
combat effort against the israeli enemy he said 
abbas also known as abul abbas was the mastermind of the 1985 
hijacking of the italian cruise liner achille lauro in the 
mediterranean an american passenger in a wheelchair was killed in 
that raid 
the palestine liberation front led by abbas is a faction within 
the plo but is not considered to be directly controlled by arafat 
abbas was quoted as saying that arafat had no knowledge of 
wednesdays foiled attack on israel 
its true the plo has nothing to do with the operation abbas 
said we are under no obligation to inform abu ammar beforehand 
about any operation abu ammar is arafats nom de guerre 
arafat has disassociated the palestine liberation organization 
from the operation but has stopped short of condemning the failed 
raid 
arafat has also rejected washingtons demand that he expel abbas 
from the plos ruling executive committee in december washington 
began talks with the plo after arafat renounced terrorism 
arafat said the expulsion of abbas could only be done by the 
palestine national council the plos parliamentinexile 
abbas also said the seaborne raid was not planned with libyan or 
iraqi help israel has charged that libya assisted in the planning 
of the raid 
abbas said the foiled attack in which four gunmen were killed 
and 12 captured before they reached a beach crowded with israeli 
bathers cost 3 million and had been planned for two years 
he said the raid was launched as a message to the superpower 
summit in washington and to avenge the slaying of seven unarmed 
palestinian workers by an israeli gunman near tel aviv on may 20 
he said the raid carried two messages to the united states and 
the soviet union that the palestinian people are determined to 
continue their struggle until the liberation of palestine and the 
achievement of independence and that they should be fully aware 
that the influx of jews into palestine is a crime against 
palestinian human rights 
hundreds of thousands of soviet jews are expected to immigrate to 
israel in the coming years

saturday saying the gentle actorknight will be remembered as much 
for his civility and urbanity as for his versatility and skill as an 
actor 
actor edward fox said harrisons talent was like the sun its 
difficult to give a name to but you know when its out 
harrison died in new york early saturday of pancreatic cancer at 
age 82 
he was the master of a certain kind of acting in which he 
really was incomparable said dame wendy hiller 77 
there isnt anybody to put alongside him his subtlety and 
skill and technical expertise she said 
she first starred with him in the 1941 film major barbara 
based on the george bernard shaw play 
they most recently appeared together in a british television 
adaptation of the kingfisher a play in which harrison performed 
on broadway in 1978 
over the years dame wendy said she called harrison liverpool 
virus and propridden harrison joking references to his 
background and his fastidiousness with props during filming 
we sort of agreed to disagree dame wendy said recalling 
their goodnatured sparring matches 
in new york julie andrews who performed with harrison in my 
fair lady for three years said to watch him and to work with 
him was a joyful experience i doubt there was anyone before like 
him the theater has lost an extraordinary one of a kind 
audrey hepburn who played eliza doolittle opposite harrisons 
professor henry higgins in the movie version of my fair lady 
remembered him as a superb actor the quintessential actor 
he was always thoughtful and helpful and fun and i really 
adored every minute i worked with him she said from switzerland 
claudette colbert who starred with harrison in arent we 
all on broadway said in new york i am terribly sorry i think 
it was a great loss to the theater he was a great great 
comedian 
actress lynn redgrave who also starred in arent we all in 
1985 called harrison the master of high comedy playing 
nobody knows how to do what he did he gave high comedy a 
danger accuracy and razor sharpness and at the same time it 
appeared to be completely effortless you could never see the joke 
coming she said from san diego 
edward fox who costarred with harrison in his final london 
stage appearance a 1988 revival of the admirable crichton said 
he was that very rare thing a great actor 
i remember him with great affection and with great 
admiration said fox who called harrisons london performance as 
chekhovs platonov in 1960 one of the great evenings in the 
theater 
michael winner the film director and a longtime acquaintance 
called harrison the last of the oldstyle sophisticates he had 
this great great star quality of charm 
when an actor like sir rex dies then you realize its the 
passing of a style that wont come again said rosemary harris 
who starred with harrison in london and on broadway in 198384 in 
shaws heartbreak house 
the play afforded harrison one of his finest roles as the 
bearded ever philosophical captain shotover presiding over the

he was sublime harris said of harrisons performance in the 
play 
she said she last saw harrison six weeks ago in new york when she 
presented him with a special drama league award for outstanding 
achievement in the theater 
preparing for the presentation harris said she was struck by the 
unexpected breadth of harrisons career

has allowed the family of a highlevel defector to go abroad to 
visit him and it is considering letting him return from china an

civil war and other barriers to normalizing ties between vietnam and 
china

the decision was made by the politburo the highest body of 
vietnams ruling communist party he said 
the official also said the chinese government last month asked 
vietnam to let hoan return home no decision has been made the 
official said 
but he added people tend to think its about time to take him 
back even some highranking officials think so 
hoan a member of the politburo from 1957 to 1976 was the first 
top vietnamese leader to defect to china 
hoan disappeared at karachi airport in pakistan in july 1979 a

wanted to punish vietnam for invading cambodia and toppling the 
chinesebacked khmer rouge government 
china continues to arm the khmer rouge and two other guerrilla 
groups now fighting the vietnameseinstalled government in cambodia 
however relations with china have improved during liems three

marketing dat technology in the united states even though it has 
been available for at least three years 
technics has also teamed with movie director george lucas to 
produce home thx an advanced sound system designed by one account 
to have spaceships whizzing by your ears while you sit watching 
star wars in your easy chair 
the price of such pleasure is expected to be 8000 to 10000

detonated a nuclear device saturday at its testing site in the south 
pacific the first time in 15 years it had made such a public 
declaration 
since 1975 france had maintained a policy of official silence on 
its tests at the atoll of mururoa customarily the world first

nuclear program from an observation station in the cook islands

defuse criticism of its testing program another initiative has 
involved inviting foreign researchers to visit mururoa to test 
frances claims that there has been no severe environmental damage 
frances high commissioner in french polynesia jean montpezat 
said the undergound test was carried out saturday morning with a 
device unleashing about 15 kilotons of energy equivalent to the

in russian monopoly rubles replace greenbacks 
and a moscow shopping mall stands in for the coveted boardwalk so 
the games maker sees a visit from the ultimate soviet bigwig as a 
natural promotional peg 
hoping to distribute the game throughout the soviet union tonka 
corp decorated 1000 copies of the russian games with a special 
seal to commemorate soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs visit to 
minnesota 
the games are being distributed by the minnetonkabased firm to 
visiting soviet dignitaries and members of the soviet news media in 
anticipation of gorbachevs arrival sunday 
tonkas parker brothers subsidiary developed the russian version 
of the game and printed 10000 copies two years ago to help promote 
the 1988 world monopoly tournament in london said company spokesman 
bj french said 
part of whats fun about this is that monopoly is part of the 
ultimate capitalist thing french said its part of americana 
the commemorative editions with the seal showing the us and 
soviet flags superimposed on the state of minnesota arent for sale 
but russian monopoly is available at specialty game stores in the 
united states french said 
were proud of the fact that gorbachev is coming to minnesota 
and since we have our roots here too we want to be part of the 
celebration french said this game is helping us to do that 
and thats just the beginning 
we would like to establish the game in the soviet market 
said patricia mcgovern spokeswoman for parker brothers which is 
based in beverly mass we need a company in the soviet world that 
would be interested in publishing and distributing the game there 
the russian version of monopoly is available in the soviet union 
only in dutyfree and hard currency shops where rubles have no 
buying power ms mcgovern said 
in addition to the 10000 russian games manufactured by parker a 
french company produces the games for sale in europe 
most of the people who buy the russian monopoly in finland are 
soviet diplomats she said i have received quite a few letters 
from people in the soviet world that have it and absolutely love 
it 
the russian version of monopoly is parker brothers 23rd foreign 
edition the games are distributed in more than 30 countries 
worldwide ms mcgovern said 
in its russian form the monopoly board was altered to reflect 
moscows cityscape with boardwalk becoming arbat the mall where 
president reagan walked with gorbachev during the 1989 summit 
rubles replace american dollars and all references to stocks were 
changed to bonds becauses stocks do not exist in the soviet union 
the community chest card in the american version that refers to a 
christmas club was changed to lottery in the russian game 
because there are no official holidays with religious connotations 
in the soviet union

nelson mandela announced 
saturday he had a benign cyst removed from his bladder but expected 
to leave this week on a 13nation tour to fight apartheid 
his news conference came after five days of speculation on his 
true condition officials at the park lane clinic in johannesburg 
had said he underwent a minor operation there on monday but they 
refused to provide any details 
he is a very fit young man for his age said the 71yearold 
black leaders doctor gus gecelter on saturday 
the african national congress leader was admitted to the clinic 
may 27 for what anc officials described as a routine physical 
examination aside from the announcement he had undergone a minor 
operation monday no other details were provided until saturday by 
doctors his family or anc representatives 
mandela though looking at bit tired at the news conference that 
day i feel on top of the world and im looking forward to the 
trip with eagerness 
gecelter mandelas doctor since 1985 confirmed at the news 
conference the cyst on mandelas bladder was benign 
he said mandela had no problems before or after the operation 
mandela said he was eager to begin his sixweek 13nation tour 
to tell the world no significant changes have been made in south 
africas apartheid system of racial separation 
president fw de klerk who freed mandela from prison in 
february and launched other reforms has been arguing that other 
nations should lift sanctions on south africa because of the changes 
it is making 
mandela had been imprisoned since 1962 on a life sentence for 
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government his anc is 
the leading group fighting apartheid 
anc president oliver tambo suffered a stroke late last year 
though mandela is deputy president of the anc many people have 
viewed him in recent months as the groups de facto leader 
mandela was expected to leave the clinic this weekend and spend 
at least one night at his home in the soweto township outside 
johannesburg before he begins his tour monday with a stop in 
botswana 
he will then visit the united states britain france germany 
canada ireland switzerland italy ethiopia uganda kenya and 
mozambique 
at his news conference mandela described the governments 
proposal last week to scrap the separate amenities act which 
racially segregates public facilities as quite insignificant 
it is not the real issue over which we are fighting the basic 
issue in this country is whether blacks are going to have the right 
of selfdetermination he said 
de klerk has initiated talks with the anc and other black groups 
to give the black majority a political role however he has not 
said he would accept majority rule

the soviet unions fear of a reunified germany 
is grounded in a bitter national memory of millions lost in war and 
a sober recognition that a historical enemys rise might parallel 
its own decline 
the roster of russian dead in world war ii 75 million by 
unofficial estimates dwarfs the losses of other nations and is 
roughly 18 times higher that of america which was spared combat on 
its home soil millions of soviet civilians also perished as german 
forces penetrated deeply into russian territory 
yevgeny primakov a top adviser to soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev said saturday that the lingering fear of germany not 
the soviet economy was paramount in the minds of soviets 
whenever our children play war he said the two opposing 
sides to this day are the soviets and the nazis the germans 
despite all the years of tension between the united states and 
the soviet union soviet children playing such games have never 
posed as americans he said 
you can judge from that how deep are the fears of germanys 
military might our people have survived two wars started by the 
germans in this century 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney with gorbachev at his 
side told reporters in ottawa last week all of the nations 
suffered greatly in the second world war but none none suffered 
more dramatically than the soviet union 
said former nato ambassador robert f ellsworth today the 
germany question is completely different from what it has been 
before because it is the russians that are weak and uncertain 
so the german issue unsurprisingly hovered over gorbachevs 
talks with mulroney and loomed menacingly as a possible albatross 
around the necks of gorbachev and president bush his summit host 
indeed the summits risk of failure may have been averted by their 
acknowledgements at the outset that the german question couldnt be 
resolved in four days of talks here 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater briefing reporters on the 
pairs talks saturday at camp david md said that both bush and 
gorbachev felt their germany discussions were quite productive 
in the sense that the superpower leaders did reach a better 
understanding of their positions 
germany was divided into eastern and western zones after world 
war ii but the western powers remained committed to its eventual 
reunification despite the puppet east german government set up by 
the soviet union 
germanys omnipresence as an issue at eastwest summits is richly 
documented 
when president harry truman and soviet premier josef stalin met 
with british leaders in potsdam in 1945 it was in part to carve 
up the germany that the allies had just conquered 
by 1959 when soviet leader nikita khrushchev met with president 
dwight d eisenhower trouble was brewing over the potsdam 
agreement khrushchev was proposing to terminate allied rights in 
west berlin posing the threat of a major eastwest confrontation 
but in subsequent superpower talks the german issue receded into 
the background as arms control questions came to fore that is 
until last years toppling of the communist government of east 
germany in the wave of democratic reform that swept through central 
and eastern europe 
west german armed forces number about 494000 east german forces 
totaled about 173000 last year although they may have been cut 
some since and it is unclear how many of them might be absorbed 
into the unified german military force 
against this background and with the sovietled warsaw pact 
disintegrating bush made it clear last week that he favors a united 
germany as a full member of the usled nato alliance the soviets 
balked and gorbachev exhorted the west to find a new melody 
georgi arbatov director of the soviet institute for us and 
canada studies said that a military alliance against the soviet 
union thats the way we see nato 
in his meeting with bush gorbachev proposed that the military 
role of a united germany be decided by a new council of all 
europe in which both the united states and the soviet union would 
participate diplomatic aides are to pursue the idea in copenhagen 
denmark this week and in berlin two weeks later 
ellsworth the former nato ambassador who now is vice chairman of 
the private american council on germany predicted the issue could 
still remain a thorny one for the united states and the soviets 
russians are saying we have the memory of these fears left 
over from world war ii said ellsworth its totally 
understandable but i just dont think that we in the west can 
conduct our politics on the basis of providing psychiatric therapy 
for the russians neurotic memories of world war ii valid as they 
are 
when the germans get unified they are going to have to make 
these decisions as a sovereign people or otherwise it wont work 
he said they will have to be part of the picture but not in 
their present legal status as the defeated power in world war ii

the leader of solidaritys rival trade 
union on saturday attacked the governments economic plan for 
creating unemployment and appealed for a social security plan to 
protect workers 
alfred miodowicz leader of the opzz trade union alliance that 
communist authorities formed in 1984 told delegates at the unions 
second national congress that the country needed to prepare for a 
fiveyear battle for the existence of poles 
opzz claims 65 million members and the congress is being held in 
warsaw to discuss the solidarityled governments plan to introduce 
a free market economy 
the dismantling of the centrally planned economy threatens jobs 
in inefficient staterun industries and public service sectors where 
many opzz members work 
the governments radical reform plan designed by finance 
minister leszek balcerowicz and introduced jan 1 has cut subsidies 
to major enterprises lifted price controls and maintained a tight 
wage policy over 400000 people are officially receiving 
unemployment benefits 
balcerowiczs plan is faulty because it assumes a reduction of 
jobs unemployment from the very start miodowicz told the 
delegates 
he also stressed the need for social justice in the economy 
opzz was formed while solidarity was still illegal and has never 
enjoyed the prestige of solidarity opzz was humiliated last week 
when solidarity leader lech walesa managed to end an opzzbacked 
strike by railway workers that disrupted train service for a week 
also saturday the congress reelected miodowicz as chairman

true there were some 11thhour 
negotiations but the seeds of president bushs decision to grant 
trade concessions to the soviet union were sown in his renewal of 
trade benefits for the chinese and his refusal to impose sanctions 
against moscow over lithuania 
bushs action meant that for the second time in as many weeks he 
was ignoring widespread congressional opposition to a trade 
agreement with a regime whose human rights policies have been 
sharply criticized 
bushs earlier renewal of trade benefits to china and his 
decision not to slap economic sanctions on moscow over its hardline 
approach in the baltic states made it harder for him to say no to an 
anxious gorbachev some aides are suggesting 
if bush won any private assurances from gorbachev on lithuania in 
exchange for the trade deal neither side was letting on 
us officials insisted that bush did not extract any such 
commitment from gorbachev and soviet officials continue to 
characterize the stalemate as an internal dispute that they will 
resolve themselves 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater briefing reporters 
saturday on bushs talks with gorbachev at the maryland presidential 
retreat was asked what the united states got in return for signing 
the trade pact 
well we got out of it what we put into at malta summit 
which was the recognition that as the superpower and leader of the 
western alliance that we are leading the way to help the soviet 
union integrate itself into the international economic community 
certainly signing the trade agreement from our point of view 
is a symbol and a way to encourage further development to try to 
help out with that process of economic reform he said 
us sources said that even though soviet officials balked at 
the last minute at signing a grain deal bushs mind was not made up 
by this last minute soviet attempt at haggling 
instead gorbachevs fervent direct appeal for the agreement and 
bushs desire to help strengthen the hand of the embattled soviet 
leader at home had more bearing on his decision the officials said 
senate republican leader robert dole said it was clear that 
gorbachev wanted some give on the trade side i think he feels 
that if he doesnt get it hes going home emptyhanded 
the soviet leader himself made it clear in his comments to 
congressional leaders on friday at the soviet embassy that he sorely 
wanted the trade pact 
and in fact gorbachev himself raised the specter of the 
tiananmen square crackdown in noting that the united states had 
extended its mostfavorednation trade hand to beijing but not to 
moscow 
gorbachev pressed the same points in meetings with bush both on 
thursday and on friday said an administration official at one 
point bush even expressed frustration that the supreme soviet had 
not yet acted on long pending legislation to codify more liberal 
emigration policies sources said 
the soviet leader told bush he would make an even harder effort 
to get the law passed the sources said 
yevgeny m primakov a top gorbachev adviser told reporters 
saturday that the emigration law is on the finishing line 
sources said gorbachevs forceful pleas together with bushs 
historical bias against economic sanctions helped the soviet leader 
win his case 
as bush and gorbachev relaxed at the us presidential retreat 
here in the cactoctin mountains of maryland on saturday the 
divisive trade decision was behind them and they went on to other 
issues 
but the bush administration still faces a likely battle in 
congress as the president tries to win approval of the new 
agreement a tough battle is also expected on the china move 
with china bush renewed already existing mostfavorednation 
status for another year but the soviet union has not had 
mostfavorednation status since 1952 when it was revoked by 
congress the jacksonvanik amendment to the 1974 trade act requires 
a country to have both a trade agreement with the united states and 
a law allowing free emigration before it can be granted 
mostfavorednation status 
in giving gorbachev the trade agreement the first part of the 
equation bush also attached a short string he told the soviet 
leader he would not even send the measure to congress for approval 
until the supreme soviet passes the emigration law 
however the strings extended only to emigration policy not 
lithuania and the absence of any soviet concessions on lithuania is 
what is likely to stir the most opposition the senate passed a 
resolution may 1 urging bush to hold off granting 
mostfavorednation status to the soviets until they lifted the 
blockade against lithuania 
administration officials are backpeddling trying to assert that 
there never had been a link between trade and lithuania 
secretary of state james a baker iii said friday there has 
been no formal linkage by anybody in this administration that i am 
aware of between the two issues baker didnt place it there but 
the emphasis clearly was on the word formal since before the 
summit one official after another had informally linked the trade 
pact with progress on two fronts the soviet emigration law and 
lithuania

a homeowner shot and killed a naked man who 
charged through a glass door during a neighborhood rampage police 
said saturday 
the man earlier smashed his head or hand through windows at three 
other homes late friday terrorizing residents but not harming them 
there was no explanation for the bizarre assault on the san 
fernando valley neighborhood police were awaiting the results of 
coroners tests to determine if the man was on drugs said detective 
rick swanston 
the dead man was identified as gene brian hollaway 23 who lived 
about a mile away from the neighborhood where he was killed and did 
not know any of the people who were terrorized swanston said 
we are looking at it as a justifiable homicide he said 
hollaway had been unemployed for about a year since being 
discharged from the army 
the rampage ended when homeowner james bruner 38 shot hollaway 
as he reportedly advanced toward bruners wife elizabeth after 
breaking into their house 
police were called to the bruner home about 11 pm bruner 38 
told police he was at home with his wife and child when he heard a 
noise in the back yard went outside and was confronted by a 
bloodcovered naked man 
they struggled until bruner got back inside his house and locked 
a sliding glass door behind him he told his wife to call police and 
armed himself with a shotgun 
hollaway then threw his body through the glass door and bruner 
fired twice as hollaway moved threateningly toward mrs bruner 
swanston said 
simultaneously three breakins were reported nearby 
residents said an intruder shoved his head through a closed 
bathroom window at one house and began yelling the detective said 
the man smashed a fist through a window in the front door of a 
second house unlocked the door confronted a woman entered her 
bedroom then threw himself out a front window 
a bedroom window was smashed at a third house but hollaway did 
not enter instead he went into the back yard and disrobed before 
proceeding to the bruner house 
bruner was questioned but was not arrested

the bodies of the women keep turning up two in 
one weekend nine over the past 14 months 
eight were white seven were known prostitutes 
three young women were suffocated within five days of each other 
last week their bodies found in suburban virginia 
every new murder renews the question is there a serial killer on 
the loose targeting prostitutes who work several blocks from the 
white house 
the police arent talking 
were looking at all the possibilities said mike rocconi an 
arlington county va police spokesman echoing statements by other 
police departments 
i dont believe they are at the point where they are going to 
say they are all related said lucy caldwell a virginia state 
police spokeswoman 
but the women who walk the streets once frequented by at least 
seven of the victims know that someone is killing white blond 
prostitutes they say they are taking precautions even though two 
local police officers who knew all the dead women say business seems 
to be proceeding as usual 
im having the guys follow me in a taxi said one blond 
selfdescribed whore identifying herself only as susan i 
quit working at night 
marie a 22yearold brunette with a 3yearold baby to support 
said she no longer gets into a customers car but she recognizes 
such precautions may be useless 
if hes a serial killer nothings going to help us said 
marie dressed like a college coed out for a jog a couple of the 
girls hes gotten so far were fighters he must have some sort 
of scars on him because at least two of them wouldnt have given up 
their lives without a fight 
the nine cases have similarities and differences 
seven are known prostitutes who worked in the district the 
identities and the occupations of the other two were not yet known 
eight victims were white including the seven prostitutes one 
was black 
the three victims found last week in virginia two in arlington 
over the weekend and one in alexandria on wednesday were 
suffocated three other victims were shot in the head two were shot 
in the chest one was killed by a blow to the head 
six victims were found in the virginia suburbs three in the 
district 
a criminologist said different killing methods and locations 
dont necessarily mean several killers are at work 
it might mean hes trying to screw up the cops said robert 
o heck an architect of the fbis serial killing unit he stressed 
he was discussing such killers in general not the washington cases 
different types of killing is nothing said heck who now 
works for the justice departments juvenile justice office even 
geographics could change vastly with a serial killer twenty miles 
is nothing to some of them 
the many police jurisdictions involved are sharing information 
and they held a meeting thursday that included the fbi but no task 
force has been formed that would indicate the agencies believe the 
slayings are linked 
prissy williamsgodfrey a selfdescribed madam and spokeswoman 
for prostitutes said she is outraged at what she considers police 
inaction 
i never thought i would see white women in america being 
treated like this said williamsgodfrey who is black theyre 
being treated that way because of their sexual preference they 
police think these women are getting exactly what they deserve 
instead of sending out male decoys to catch female prostitutes 
she said police should put women decoys out to catch the killer 
the fact that most of the victims have been prostitutes should 
not ease the fears of those who arent streetwalkers said merlyn d 
doug moore a professor at sam houston criminal justice center 
in huntsville texas 
a prostitute is a more likely candidate just because of the 
nature of her business moore said 
however he said the assumption is that the individual who is 
killing is only killing prostitutes and we dont know that how 
many other homicides might there be but we havent found them yet 
prostitutes know danger comes with the territory 
if you put yourself out here on the street trying to make 
money what can you expect said cindy 25 rubbing a bruise 
inflicted by a customer 
the frecklefaced blonde from sacramento said prostitution has 
paid her bills for 11 years the last four in washington some 
streetwalkers claim to make 1500 to 2000 a week here 
although she knew seven of the murder victims she plans to keep 
working 
washington is a good town cindy said theres a whole 
bunch of money here for prostitutes 
police meanwhile were trying to determine the identities of two 
victims 
one found suffocated wednesday near an office complex in 
alexandria was described as white under 20 5foot3 to 5foot4 
about 130 pounds with brown eyes and brownishblond hair she was 
wearing a black leather and suede jacket a turquoise and black top 
and black spandex pants 
a black woman who was shot five times several times in the head 
was found may 9 on a curb in falls church va 
the seven victims who worked the same washington corridor 
according to authorities or fellow prostitutes are 
sandra rene johnson 20 found may 27 in her apartment in the 
country club towers in arlington she was suffocated 
sherry kay larman 26 of lanham md found may 26 on the top 
level of parking garage on south highland street in arlington she 
was suffocated 
lisa colleen grossman 29 of fairfax county va found march 
18 on south pickett street in alexandria va she died from a blow 
to the head 
carolen marie wallace 22 of forestville md found feb 14 in 
a fairfax county storm sewer near i495 she was shot in the head 
roxanne lynn johnson 23 of baltimore found oct 1 outside 
ballou high school in southeast washington she was shot in the head 
cori louise jones 29 found aug 12 on a street in the

after hours of chaos due to police 
protests former attorney general francis x bellotti won the 
endorsement for governor at saturdays state democratic convention 
and john silber won a spot in the primary 
lt gov evelyn murphy who had predicted she would win the 
endorsement also locked up a spot in septembers primary with a 
secondplace finish state rep john flood was eliminated 
silber on leave as president of boston university qualified for 
the primary by a razorthin margin of 22 votes in the first round of 
balloting 
a police picket outside springfield civic center to protest 
decaying police equipment delayed proceedings for more than three 
hours when thousands of delegates remained outside to honor the 
picket line gov michael dukakis farewell speech was pushed from 
early morning into the afternoon 
democratic officials finally obtained an injunction to keep the 
picket line away from the convention center some democrats accused 
the police of playing politics and trying to spoil the event since 
the union supported george bush in the 1988 presidential election 
the 5000 delegates gave dukakis a standing ovation before and 
after his remarks 
the 1988 democratic presidential candidate urged the party to 
stick by its agenda of affordable housing environmental protection 
universal health care and job training an agenda he set in three 
terms as governor 
this is the first statewide election in nearly a quarter of a 
century where i wont be with you in your living rooms and at your 
plant gates asking giving working and always caring dukakis 
said its been a long and winding road full of highs and lows 
full of thrills and chills and more than a few spills 
you are my extended family he told the crowd some of whom 
waved proud of dukakis signs 
on the first ballot silber collected 746 votes or 1546 
percent from the 4824 delegates fifteen percent was needed to 
qualify for the primary 
we were sweating blood said silber who promptly withdrew 
his name from further balloting allowing his delegates to move on 
to other candidates 
flood received 45 percent in the first round bellotti 429 
percent and murphy 37 percent bellotti and murphy were already 
assured of making the ballot based on results of party caucuses 
earlier this year 
under convention rules balloting continued until a candidate 
received more than 50 percent the low candidate would be dropped 
starting with the second ballot 
in the second round bellott won the endorsement with 51 percent 
of the 4613 delegates voting murphy received 40 percent and flood 
was eliminated with 85 percent 
police had been threatening to picket the convention for weeks 
union president robert jacobson said officers have been forced to 
use decaying squad cars and other equipment 
on friday night the union and democratic party announced a 
compromise whereby the police would only conduct an informational 
picket if springfield mayor mary hurley agreed not to address the 
convention but jacobson claimed hurley violated the agreement by 
entering the convention center friday night 
hurley dismissed the unions charges saying no agreement existed 
for her to stay out of the convention center she apologized to the 
delegates for saturdays events 
still some democrats said the police union simply was trying to 
embarrass the democratic party 
some party officials noted that alexander tennant state gop 
executive director and ron kaufman who headed bushs massachusetts 
campaign were both in springfield for the convention 
i dont know if they instigated it said state sen lois 
pines but i think theyre happy about it 
republican party officials could not be reached for comment and 
jacobson insisted politics were not involved in the protest

a jury awarded 287 million to a 5yearold boy 
who contracted aids through an unauthorized blood transfusion and 
his parents in what his attorney believes is the largest award of 
its kind 
the maricopa county jury on friday awarded 267 million to alex 
edwards and 1 million to each of his parents roy and pat edwards 
the jury on may 23 found dr abraham kuruvilla and the 
neonatology associates ltd liable for alexs aids infection through 
the unauthorized transfusion shortly after the boys birth in 1985 
duane olson the phoenix attorney representing kuruvilla and the 
clinic said he would file an appeal immediately olson said the 
award was worse than i ever could have dreamed 
alex can neither walk nor talk and needs 24hour care due to 
damage to his nervous system from the disease 
jurors said they didnt know how how long the boy would live but 
that they wanted to make sure he had enough to provide for his needs 
whats going to happen if he lives to be 30 or 40 asked jury 
foreman ray howell alexs parents wont have the money to care 
for him he said 
were just real happy and pleased that the jury worked together 
and came up with a reasonable sum roy edwards told reporters 
the boy dressed in blue jeans and a yellow tshirt was cuddled 
by his mother as jurors announced their decision holding her son on 
her lap she sometimes kissed his forehead and stroked his blond 
hair 
kuruvilla was not present 
judge david r cole had dismissed two other defendants blood 
systems inc the parent company of the firm that provided the 
blood and samaritan health services which runs the hospital where 
the transfusion was administered after a settlement was reached in 
february 
alex was born suffering from severe respiratory problems due to 
fluid in the lungs when he was transferred to good samaritan 
hospital where kuruvilla ordered the transfusion that corrected 
the fluidrelated problems olson said during the trial 
olson argued that mrs edwards signed a consent form allowing 
doctors to treat her son as they saw fit 
but the edwards attorney r douglas dalton argued that not 
enough was known about the risk of aids by transfusion and that 
kuruvilla should have received consent from the boys parents for 
the procedure 
the boys father testified that the couple expressed concerns 
about aids and offered to donate their own blood when the boy was 
given a previous transfusion 
the boy tested positive for the aids virus in 1987 
dalton said the largest previous jury award he was aware of for 
an aidsrelated case was 12 million awarded march 8 in columbus 
ohio to an 8yearold girl who received the aids virus in a 1985 
blood transfusion

the conservative party nominated new york 
university professor herbert london for governor saturday while the 
liberal party chose incumbent democrat mario cuomo 
the minor parties met in manhattan to make their choices which 
can be important in close elections although neither has been a 
deciding factor in recent races 
the antiabortion righttolife party is to hold its convention 
sunday in albany 
the liberal party which feuded with cuomo last year over its 
endorsement of republican rudolph giuliani in the new york mayoral 
race chose cuomo unanimously said party spokesman carl grillo 
the liberals also nominated democratic lt gov stan lundine and 
democratic state attorney general robert abrams for reelection 
meanwhile the conservatives traditional allies of the 
republicans in recent statewide races altered history a bit by 
nominating london for governor 
london is the only clear alternative to cuomo said party 
spokesman michael long spokesman for the party 
the republicans last week chose political neophyte pierre rinfret 
as their cuomo challenger the canadianborn economist favors 
abortion rights a major factor in his rejection by conservative 
party leaders london 51 is antiabortion 
the split between republicans and conservatives is expected to 
ease cuomos reelection bid 
cuomo is to be nominated monday at the democratic state 
convention for reelection to a third fouryear term 
the conservatives nominated anthony diperna a retired school 
administrator and conservative party official from suffolk county on 
long island for lieutenant governor bernard smith the gop 
candidate for attorney general won conservative support

the government said saturday that 
iranians are welcome to take part in this years islamic pilgrimage 
to mecca but they would not be allowed to demonstrate 
saudi arabia broke off diplomatic ties with iran in april 1988 
after iranian pilgrims clashed with this kingdoms police during the 
preceding years pilgrimage the battles killed 402 people mostly 
iranians 
the iranians boycotted the 1988 and 1989 pilgrimages and some 
iranian officials have said they were boycotting the 1990 season 
iran has also claimed saudi officials were preventing iranians 
from taking part this year 
however saudi arabian authorities stressed saturday they are 
welcoming iranians to this years pilgrimage known as the hajj 
the official saudi arabian press agency quoted an unidentified 
government spokesman as saying the country still welcomes the 
iranian pilgrims to perform the hajj rites and will present them 
with all facilities it accords to their brethren from around the 
moslem world provided they abide fully by the correct rules and 
conduct of the hajj 
but the source was quoted as saying the kingdom cannot show 
any leniency in any matter that undermines islamic sharia law or 
infringes on security such as holding of rallies and staging of 
demonstrations 
the agency also quoted the source as saying he regrets irans 
continuous rabid campaigns that are escalating day after day in a 
desperate attempt to convince the iranian moslem people that the 
kingdom of saudi arabia is preventing the iranians from performing 
the hajj 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said saudi officials 
even told an iranian envoy last month that they were prepared to 
raise their quota for iranian pilgrims from 45000 to 60000 
but the envoy apparently insisted on the iranian right to 
demonstrate at the hajj the diplomats said 
that visit by deputy foreign minister mohammad ali besharati of 
iran was the first by an iranian official since the kingdom ruptured 
diplomatic ties with tehran accusing iranian rulers of terrorism 
and subversion 
after their 1979 islamic revolution the iranians had been trying 
to mount demonstrations almost annually at the hajj the clashes at 
the 1987 pilgrimage followed a demonstration by some of the 150000 
iranian visitors that year 
nearly all iranian moslems are shiites a minority sect at odds 
for 1300 years with the majority sunnis who include the saudi 
royal family and 85 percent of all moslems 
 
the late iranian spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
accused the saudi arabians of being unfit as keepers of islams holy 
sites about 2 million moslems from around the world gather for the 
annual rites that culminate this year in early july

wisconsin republicans rejected an attempt 
saturday to adopt an antiabortion party platform plank that would 
have called for the legal protection of all human beings from 
conception on 
but a short time later delegates endorsed a resolution opposing 
abortion as a method of birth control or for the mothers 
convenience 
the action by about 1000 delegates and alternates at the partys 
oneday annual convention appeared to disatisfy prochoice and 
antiabortion delegates alike 
it appears to make us look schizoid said fred patz a 
prochoice delegate from milwaukee 
alan d jaberg a member of the republicans for choice said he 
believed assembly speaker thomas loftus a candidate for the 
democratic nomination for governor would pounce on the issue and 
run with it against republican gov tommy g thompson 
thompson seeking a second fouryear term was not present when 
the votes on the platform and resolution were taken he had said he 
planned to take no part in the conventions abortion debate 
state party chairman michael grebe said he saw no political 
problem emerging from the action of the delegates on the issue 
i think the party platform shows that were a party with a 
diversity of views on abortion and that we are tolerant of those 
opinions grebe said 
as for the resolution grebe said it shows that on the 
specific issue a majority of delegates supports a strong prolife 
position 
the platform plank says that while americans have a diversity of 
views on abortion republicans decry the conditions in 
contemporary society that have swelled the number of abortions 
performed 
we support the fostering of responsible attitudes toward 
sexuality and the promotion of selfesteem it says calling for 
child adoption as an alternative to abortion 
the plank remained in the platform after delegates rejected 
16981521 a plank that would have declared republican support for 
legislation that would establish the legal protection for all 
human beings from conception on 
its disappointing that the party wants to become neutral on 
this said nick alioto of milwaukee sponsor of the rejected 
version 
thompson has declared his opposition to abortion except in cases 
of rape or incest or to save a womans life 
loftus has said he intends to make abortion a key issue in his 
bid to unseat thompson

governing institutional revolutionary party of trying to rig a 
special mayoral election in the second largest city in politically 
volatile michoacan state 
the vote in uruapan was set for sunday after allegations of fraud

voters from registration lists and of adding phony names to be used 
by people recruited to vote for the party 
people go to pick up the credentials and they arent there 
said juan antonio chavez mendoza a member of the revolutionary 
democratic party he said the governing party distributed 5000 
voting credentials to party loyalists

revolutionary party denied the allegation and said his party is 
confident of an unchallengeable clear and irrefutable victory he 
spoke in guadalajara the countrys second largest city on friday

anarchy because it has little chance of winning 
revolutionary democratic supporters seized city halls in 21 
communities after the dec 3 elections to protest the results 
army troops using armored vehicles firing tear gas and spraying 
protesters with fire hoses forced them out four months later no 
injuries were reported most of those arrested were released a few

they shed their ties lounged on the patio 
and zipped around in a golf cart saturday but george and mikhail 
still call each other mr president and mr president and probably 
always will 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater gave that account of 
the boundaries of cordiality as presidents bush and gorbachev held 
informal relaxed talks at the presidential retreat in the maryland 
mountains highlighted by some beginners luck at horseshoes 
fitzwater described a halcyon summit day in the countryside that 
he said was not for policy decisionmaking but to kind of lean 
back and reflect on the relationships between their nations no 
first names though 
they have a very warm and personal relationship but they still 
refer to each other as president and i suspect they always will 
fitzwater said thats just the nature of the two men 
they settled into the surroundings by removing ties and seated 
themselves around the large patio table which overlooks the 
backyard he added 
the two world leaders leaned back on the terrace and chatted 
while overlooking a view of the panoramic countryside he said 
joined by their four closest aides they enjoyed a very casual 
and lively give and take he said 
both presidents seemed quite pleased with the conversations 
fitzwater went on both laughing intermittently at humorous asides 
and enjoying the warm catoctin mountains sunshine 
they then took a tour of the grounds on the retreat with 
gorbachev at the wheel of one of the camp david golf carts they 
stopped at various sites around the camp including the gym where 
both presidents had a brief discussion with marines who were working 
out there at the time 
after lunch in the camps aspen lodge the gorbachevs went for a 
stroll around the grounds and stopped to throw a few horseshoes 
fitzwater said horseshoes is one of bushs favorite sports and one 
in which he delights in engaging his visitors 
before leaving bush said it was a great day no neckties very 
relaxed 
the only thing that went wrong is i pride myself as a 
horseshoe player and president gorbachev picked up a horseshoe 
never having played the game to my knowledge and literally 
literally all you horseshoe players out there threw a ringer the 
first time really 
bush said gorbachev explained later over dinner that a 
horseshoe in the soviet union when posted in ones house 
symbolizes warmth and friendship and that made an impression on 
me 
fitzwater said there were no specific agreements reached by the 
presidents just lots of understanding about feelings emotions 
where people are coming from and possible avenues for solutions 
theres a lot of understanding the two men are getting 
this afternoon is really an opportunity for them to just lean 
back and reflect on how they might help what their differences are 
what their areas of mutual understandings are 
there was even giftgiving to add to the days apparent idyll 
bush gave the gorbachevs matching navy london fog usmade 
windbreaker jackets with us emblems and their names on them

student interests hazel said 
under the agreement the students pledged to vacate the building 
in return for several concessions including amnesty from

troops from neighboring angola bush and gorbachev also discussed 
possible cooperation on endin civil wars in afghanistan and 
cambodia where each supports different sides but spokesmen said no 
formal agreements were reached 
the need for cooperation is particularly acute in ethiopia where 
4 million to 5 million people are in danger of hunger as a result of 
a prolonged civil war and successive droughts 
the united states approached the soviets with the idea of a joint 
airlift several months ago 
to ease the hunger problem us food will be transported on 
soviet aircraft to demonstrate our joint commitment to responding 
to this tragic humanitarian problem the communique said 
the soviet union reeling under domestic economic woes has 
significantly scaled back its economic and military aid to ethiopia 
prompting president mengistu haile mariam to look elsewhere 
in an effort to win approval from the west mengistu agreed 
recently to let relief shipments into the country after suspending 
them in a bid to punish rebels in northern ethiopia 
the two countries welcome the ethiopian governments agreement 
to permit relief food to enter northern ethiopia through the port of 
massawa under a unsponsored relief effort and they believe that 
such operations would not compromise the unity and territorial 
integrity of ethiopia said the joint statement 
the two sides also hailed ethiopias agreement to have un 
representatives attend negotiations between the ethiopian government 
and eritrean rebels seeking independence in one of the continents 
longest civil wars 
an attempt earlier this year by former president jimmy carter to 
mediate between ethiopia and the eritreans failed to yield concrete 
results

a mohawk indian who 
views casino gambling as an economic boon to the reservation 
unseated the tribes antigambling incumbent chief in an election 
saturday 
the election amounted to a referendum on gambling an issue so 
divisive among mohawks it led to bloodshed may 1 when two indians 
were shot to death in a clash between pro and antigambling 
factions since then new york state and canadian police have 
occupied the 28000acre reservation which straddles the 
international border 
norman tarbell received 637 votes to defeat his distant cousin 
incumbent harold tarbell who got 538 votes in his attempt to win a 
second threeyear term according to acting tribal secretary stacey 
terrance twelve votes were ruled invalid she said harold tarbell 
said he would appeal alleging voting improprieties 
with norman tarbells election the threeman tribal council 
ruling the us side of the st regis indian reservation will 
unanimously support casinos on mohawk land the other council chiefs 
are lincoln white and l david jacobs 
norman tarbell is to become junior chief on the council on july 
1 at that time jacobs becomes head chief and white second chief 
norman tarbell said saturday that his first priority as a chief 
would be to put our people back to work 
traditionalists such as harold tarbell claim the eight casinos on 
the us side of the reservation breed drugrunning prostitution 
and other crime white jacobs and norman tarbell say the casinos 
bring badly needed jobs to the reservation where the unemployment 
rate is about 30 percent 
about 3400 mohawks were eligible to vote in the election on the 
st regis indian reservation 
harold tarbell said saturday night he would contest the election 
on the grounds that jacobs and white excluded us mohawks living on 
the canadian side from voting in past elections mohawks living 
there were allowed to vote 
well i havent quite lost yet because there were so many 
improprieties were going to have to sort that out in the next 
couple of months harold tarbell said he characterized the voting 
as chaos and said it made no sense to protest so were 
going to have to appeal it 
jacobs and white adopted a list of eligible voters based on 
tribal rules that allow only indians living on the us side to 
vote a state supreme court judge upheld the list friday 
sixtytwo people were turned away from the polls saturday on 
grounds they werent on the list said franklin county attorney 
brian stewart who served as an election official most if not all 
those people were supporters of harold tarbell 
in addition to stewart three federal mediators were on hand and 
franklin county sheriffs deputies were stationed at the tribal 
headquarters which was the only polling place 
harold tarbell who lives on the us side said he wasnt on the 
official voting list but was allowed to vote anyway he alleged that 
the many people not on the list were also allowed to vote 
norman tarbell said no challenge would overturn the election 
a hundred votes is a hundred votes they dont have anything to 
stand on even if they do challenge it he said 
most of the us indians living on the canadian side are gambling 
opponents and likely would have voted for harold tarbell as many as 
500 us indians living in canada would have been eligible to vote 
harold tarbell said 
the casinos have been closed while tribal leaders negotiate with 
state and federal mediators to end the gambling war

a man who already faces life sentences 
for three other rapes broke into a wide grin saturday after a jury 
found him guilty in the kidnapping rape and murder of a 12yearold 
girl 
robert power 29 also was found guilty of robbing orange county 
deputy sheriff richard welty of his gun and radio in the field where 
angeli bares body was found hogtied and bleeding the day of her 
death 
the lee county jurors took less than five hours to find power 
guilty of firstdegree murder in the oct 6 1987 attack near 
angelis south orange county home 
prosecutors said they would emphasize powers prison record in 
seeking the death penalty 
one of powers attorneys f wesley blanker said persuading the 
same jury next month to recommend a sentence of life in prison with 
no parole for 25 years will be unlikely 
angelis stepfather gary butch bare was relieved by the 
verdict 
its a big hurdle in the grieving process bare said it 
gives me somebody i can point my finger at and say you did it 
this was bad enough as it is but it would be worse if the person 
who did it went free 
power who already faces 10 consecutive life sentences in prison 
for rape convictions in seminole and osceola counties blinked and 
then grinned immediately after the verdict was read 
he doesnt look real upset one juror said before the panel 
was escorted from the courtroom 
blankner explained his clients reaction mr power was 
prepared for the worst in this situation we didnt kid him we knew 
it would be tough to convince a jury otherwise 
circuit judge gary formet set the sentencing phase of the trial 
for sometime next month 
powers attorneys hope that his prison record he has spent all 
but two years of his adult life in jail will help him 
the jury will hear that he hasnt done well in the outside 
world blankner said but hes demonstrated that hes done well 
in a controlled environment hes been a model inmate 
blankner also said he will present evidence that power was 
physically abused and sexually assaulted as a child 
prosecutors meanwhile have said they will use powers previous 
convictions and details of angelis slaying to try to persuade the 
jury to recommend death for powers 
power was convicted of raping two kissimmee sisters ages 12 and 
16 and a longwood woman all within a month of angelis death 
formet barred prosecutors from using that evidence during the 
twoweek trial which was moved to lee county because of publicity 
angeli was found halfnaked hogtied and gagged in the field 
bleeding from both the rape and a fatal stab wound in her neck she 
had been punched in the face and her glasses were broken 
welty identified power from the witness stand as the man who 
stole his radio and gun radio parts one bearing the same serial 
number as weltys radio were found in the house where power was 
arrested eight days after the murder 
blankner and powers other attorney joerg jaeger said they will 
appeal if power is sentenced to death the florida supreme court 
will automatically hear the appeal

cuban detainees in the avoyelles parish 
jail rioted to get publicity about their status and the likelihood 
that they will be sent back to cuba the sheriff said friday 
they have newspapers tv and telephones sheriff bill belt 
said sources in the jail told us that with all the media 
attention on overcrowding it gave them an opportunity to make news 
to further their cause 
a federal judge has ordered louisiana sheriffs not to take in any 
more outofstate prisoners which bring the jails more money 
because of overcrowding 
thursdays 20minute riot occurred in a dormitory housing 72 of 
211 inmates held for the immigration and naturalization service 
federal court papers showed that as of last week the jail also 
held 57 inmates for the city of washington dc 11 state 
prisoners 22 inmates awaiting trial five parish inmates and three 
city prisoners 
belt said two guards and four prisoners suffered minor injuries 
during the melee and some guards and all 72 prisoners in the 
dormitory were treated for inhalation of smoke and tear gas 
the inmates smashed a cinderblock wall with metal footlockers 
set fires in trash cans and threw chunks of concrete at guards 
before authorities used tear gas to regain control deputies said 
last week us district judge frank j polozola gave belt and 
other sheriffs one month to return prisoners they are housing for 
the city of washington he also ordered them not to take any more 
ins detainees 
the judge criticized sheriffs for putting profit ahead of the 
states interests 
the ins pays parishes 45 a day per prisoner and washington 40 a 
day compared with louisianas 1825 a day for each state inmate in 
parish jails 
belt said the money for holding outofstate inmates has helped 
boost his budget tenfold since 1979 
belt coordinates placement of washington prisoners in louisiana 
jails court records show that in addition to the 57 in avoyelles 
tangipahoa and lafayette parishes hold 20 each and east feliciana 
parish has four 
the ins says seven louisiana jails hold a total of about 500 
illegal aliens 
the dormitory where thursdays riot took place was the site of a 
june 1988 skirmish in which nine deputies and 14 cubans were hurt 
afterward some inmates went on a hunger strike that lasted more 
than a week 
bergeron said the detainees involved in thursdays incident came 
to this country in the freedom flotilla boatlift from the cuban 
port of mariel in 1980 
mariel cubans were sent to various parish jails in louisiana 
after november 1987 riots in the federal detention center at 
oakdale in eight days of rioting while 28 employees were held 
hostage much of the 17 million complex was burned down it was 
rebuilt 
the cubans are waiting for ins hearings because crimes have put 
their resident status in jeopardy

religious and church celebrations drawing huge crowds 
a powerful earthquake on dec 23 1972 damaged much of managua 
including the cathedral whose roof caved in and walls cracked

much of the international aid money to rebuild the capital and the 
issue eroded his popularity he was toppled by the sandinistas in a 
broadbased 1979 uprising 
last year monahan said he was going to give up some of his 
responsibility at the ann arbor michbased fastfood chain to

of a sovietdesigned nuclear power plant in northern east germany 
because of grave safety problems 
environmental minister karlhermann steinberg made the 
announcement at a news conference in east berlin criticizing 
management at the greifswald plant near the baltic sea 
he said the plant management had permitted operation of a 
powerproducing block at the plant even though a leak had been 
discovered in what he called its cleaning system 
the block was ordered shut down because of grave safety 
deficiencies the east german official said 
steinberg who was accompanied by west german envoronmental 
minister klaus toepfer did not give details on safety at the plant 
but past news reports have said the sovietdesigned operation was 
sloppily managed and poorly constructed 
the west german magazine der spiegel reported in january that a 
nuclear accident had narrowly been averted at greifswald in 1976 
when fire destroyed some electrical cables disabling all but one of 
12 watercooling pumps in one of the plants four powerproducing 
blocks

shut down for safety reasons

the environmental protection agency said friday 
it will require refineries to lower the volatility of gasoline again 
in 1992 to reduce smogcausing evaporation 
the agency said it was not imposing the new requirements for this 
summer because oil companies need more time to retool refineries and 
provide adequate supplies of fuel 
the compounds in gasoline vapor are a principal raw material for 
the chemical reactions in the atmosphere that produce ozone the 
major constituent of smog 
the greater the volatility of gasoline the more vapors are 
released to the atmosphere from fuel tanks fuel systems and 
refueling especially in the summer 
the epa last year began limiting summer gasoline volatility to 
90 pounds per square inch to 105 psi according to the standard 
reid vapor pressure test depending on the region of the country 
starting in 1992 summer volatility will be limited to 78 psi to 
90 psi

the naval surface warfare center began tests 
with a 16inch battleship gun friday to determine whether an 
accident might have caused the april 1989 explosion aboard the uss 
iowa that killed 47 sailors 
last week a test at the center along the potomac river 
determined that propellant bags for the big guns can ignite when 
subjected to unusually high pressure but tests inside a gun are 
needed to determine whether that could have happened on the iowa 
the tests using a gun on land are based on new information from 
sandia national laboratories of albuquerque nm which studied 
possible causes of the iowa explosion for the senate armed services 
committee 
the sandia labs reported they failed to find evidence to support 
the navys official explanation that the fatal explosion was 
probably the work of a disgruntled suicidal gunners mate using a 
detonator 
the labs managed to come up with a possible accidental cause 
which the navy had ruled out 
after a test at the surface warfare center last thursday 
initially confirmed the sandia labs findings the navy reopened its 
investigation of the blast and suspended all live 16inch gun 
firings on battleships 
in last weeks test experimenters dropped a weighted stack of 
propellant bags onto a steel plate seventeen such tests were done 
with no result but on the 18th test the bags ignited 
representatives of the sandia labs came to virginia to 
participate in the tests here said lt dave wray a navy spokesman 
tests using the 16inch gun will be conducted without crew using 
mechanized gadgetry to load bags into the gun and fire wray said

mayor marion barrys attorney on friday said 
i dont rule out a possible plea bargain over drug and perjury 
charges and sources close to the case said discussions have 
included terms of the mayors possible resignation 
barry 54 is scheduled to go on trial monday on 10 misdemeanor 
cocaine possession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy 
charge and three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his 
alleged drug use he has pleaded innocent to all charges 
defense attorney r kenneth mundy and us attorney jay stephens 
have held several discussions on a possible plea bargain according 
to sources close to the case who spoke on condition of anonymity 
mundy in court for a pretrial hearing was asked friday whether 
he was ruling out a plea bargain i dont rule out anything he 
said he added all our efforts will be devoted toward a 
fullfledged fullblown trial 
stephens said we are prepared to go to trial but refused to 
comment on the plea bargain issue 
later however stephens spokeswoman judy smith issued a 
onesentence statement in his name contrary to some media 
reports mr barrys resignation is irrelevant to the prosecution of 
this case 
barry made no comment he met with his cabinet over lunch during 
the day 
if he pleads there would have to be a resignation said one 
source familiar with negotiations between mundy and stephens 
there are a variety of combinations out there but that is a 
constant 
sources familiar with the case said prosecutors have been 
informed the mayor will not agree to any arrangement that requires 
him to plead guilty to a felony 
pleading guilty to a felony would bar barry from finishing his 
term or running for elected office again federal sentencing 
guidelines also require that barry would spend at least six months 
in a halfway house if he accepted a felony plea 
barry has not publicly revealed his political plans but has held 
a number of campaignstyle appearances around the city since 
returning in march from seven weeks of treatment for substance 
abuse he has been mayor of the nations capital city since 1979 
among matters still to be discussed are whether a videotape made 
of the mayors jan 18 arrest would be sealed and whether a plea 
agreement would preclude prosecutors from charging barry with 
additional crimes in the future according to the sources according 
to court filings the videotape shows barry smoking crack cocaine 
provided to him by for a woman friend cooperating with an fbi sting 
operation 
stephens has said the probe that produced the 14count indictment 
against barry is continuing 
at the public pretrial hearing us district judge thomas 
penfield jackson set the ground rules for a series of questions 
potential jurors will be asked when the case opens on monday

the government says it will set aside 
900000 acres of rain forest to study ecologically safe methods of 
using the virtually untouched tropical reserve 
the project will be launched tuesday and is a joint effort with 
the commonwealth an association of britain and the governments of 
its former colonies 
guyana offered the land in the potaro district in central guyana 
at last years commonwealth heads of government conference in 
malaysia as the nearly 50 heads of state who attended looked for 
ways of slowing the effects of global warming 
the district is in the essequibo region an area that makes up 
twothirds of guyana and has been disputed with neighboring 
venezuela which has claimed jurisdiction over the territory since 
the 1960s 
venezuela claims it was cheated of the essequibo region in a 
treaty signed in 1899 between britain the united states and russia 
that established the borders between the territories the dispute is 
currently before un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
winston king chairman of the guyana natural resources agency 
said may 17 the land belongs to guyana and that venezuela only has 
to be informed about the plans for the project 
about 400000 acres of the total area to be set aside have been 
identified for a wilderness preserve to allow scientists 
worldwide to study the environment and develop ways to show how 
conservation commercial and community forestry can coexist 
the independent newspaper the stabroek news reported wednesday 
that the commonwealth scientists are eager to participate in the 
project because it offers them the chance to be among the first to 
find solutions to the global warming 
ms swaminathan an indian scientist who leads the commonwealth 
group that will coordinate the project said it will be the biggest 
ecological project of its kind 
the fourphase project will involve the setting up of an 
amazonian rain forest research training and communication center 
and the rain forest wilderness resort swaminathan said 
the united nations the world bank and other agencies will be 
approached for at least 50 million needed to finance the project 
king said legislation will be prepared to make the area 
offlimits to unauthorized persons and to give project 
administrators authority over it 
he said however that from aerial and ground inspections the 
area is never permanently inhabitated and it remains in its 
virtually untouched form except for a portion of the georgetown 
railroad that passes through it

a new cell bank will collect genetic material 
from victims of alzheimers disease and distribute it to researchers 
seeking the ailments causes the indiana university medical center 
announced friday 
the director of the alzheimers clinic at the medical center said 
the repository will spur research needed to trace the genetic and 
environmental causes of the fourth leading cause of death among the 
elderly 
this is terribly important not just to establishing the genetic 
patterns of the disease but to find out the biological 
mechanisms said hugh hendrie chairman of the department of 
psychiatry at the school 
alzheimers disease is a degenerative disorder of the human 
central nervous system that usually begins late in life victims 
gradually lose memory and intellectual functions and many of them 
must be institutionalized death usually occurs five to 10 years 
after symptoms first appear there is no known treatment 
people in the united states and canada who have two or more 
living family members who suffer from the disease were urged to call 
a tollfree number 18005262839 to determine if their family 
fits the profile the alzheimers genetic repository needs for blood 
donations families with a greater prevalence of the disease are 
more valuable 
the repository will then provide white blood cells and dna 
material to researchers at 15 research centers funded by national 
institute of aging in the united states as well as other scientists 
worldwide said p michael conneally the director of the repository 
he said it will be the first such repository in the country 
devoted to research on a single disease 
there are three types of alzheimers disease under type 1 which 
is inherited symptoms first occur between ages 30 and 50 under 
type 2 which may or may not be inherited the onset of symptoms 
occurs at age 55 or older fewer than 10 percent of victims suffer 
from types 1 and 2 
the most common form of the disease appears after age 80 and is 
believed to be nonhereditary 
the first genetic material will be available in six months to a 
year from now and will be provided free of charge to qualified 
researchers 
the repository is being funded through a 500000 grant from the 
national institute on aging part of the national institutes of 
health the grant is renewable for five more years conneally said

joseph shabalala sits in an office at 
warner bros records alternately looking out the window and back at 
his questioner he is contemplating how ladysmith black mambazo 
became an overnight sensation after only 30 years in the music 
business 
yes we are still amazed even now he says in melodious 
south africanaccented english the softspoken but gregarious 
shabalala who looks much younger than his 49 years is the founder 
lead singer composer and spiritual guide of perhaps the most 
popular singing group to ever come out of south africa 
it has been wonderful it has been gratifying to be doing 
gods gift he said after all his group has been touring and 
recording almost constantly since its 1986 appearance on paul 
simons grammywinning graceland album 
and after two hit records a grammy of their own and concerts in 
europe the united states and japan there is much for shabalala and 
the nine other members of ladysmith black mambazo to smile about 
but it wasnt always so 
on this recent day as the group prepared for its fourth us 
concert tour shabalala and fellow singer albert mazibuko reminisce 
about another time when the group could only be heard on south 
africas radio zulu when it could only play in front of black 
audiences when it was south africas bestkept musical secret 
that was a lifetime before appearances on saturday night live 
and the tonight show starring johnny carson and the adulation of 
audiences of all colors 
it was a time of crisscrossing south africa for the joy of 
performing of singing all night on saturday and all day on sunday 
in places such as durban or soweto then driving all night to get 
back to work in their hometown of ladysmith 
the 42yearold mazibuko smiled as he remembered how those 
allnight song festivals once cost him his job with a construction 
company 
we would always come to work very late on mondays because we 
had been out singing all night he said one monday we arrived 
very very late but since then ive been able to make my living 
singing so it worked out 
but even if it hadnt just the singing the opportunity to blend 
10 voices as though they were an orchestra of instruments and to 
sing better than anybody in the township always made it worth it 
said shabalala 
it took me 10 years to develop the group he recalled all 
along we were singing in the townships in the halls all night 
long with maybe 20 other groups and when you won the gold medal 
you knew you were the biggest the best group there and black 
mambazo won many gold medals 
then came the records the group recorded 27 on south african 
labels selling millions of copies although the music was only 
heard on radio zulu a black station 
the songs almost always performed a cappella and often about 
daytoday life in black south africa are heard around the world 
now and are praised as being uncommonly beautiful the praise has a 
familiar ring to it 
during the graceland tour the groups first in america 
people wrote that we were a joyous voice from africa shabalala 
recalled i thought when my people in soweto used to say things 
like that it was because they understood the language but even 
people who dont understand they say the same thing 
for years it wasnt the language barrier but apartheid south 
africas policy of racial separation that kept black mambazo from 
the rest of the world 
simon discovered the group through a south african friend in the 
mid1980s as captivated as everyone else he tried to call 
shabalala who was on a tour of the townships at the time 
when i came home my wife said theres a white guy from america 
who keeps calling shabalala said chuckling at the memory 
the two met and decided to record together but first shabalala 
had to convince the others in black mambazo that this white outsider 
was really all right hed never even been that trusting of whites 
himself 
but i was trusting of him right from the beginning he said 
i dont know why except that he was softspoken he was very 
polite and he looked me right in the eye 
and so graceland gave black mambazo to the world its own 
grammywinning record shaka zula followed as did journey of 
dreams and the soontobereleased two worlds one heart 
along with a new worldwide audience has come acceptance among 
whites in south africa 
they even promote us to white audiences now shabalala said 
when we sing in the townships now sometimes people ask me what is 
this singing in front of white people i tell them its freedom

the aging chairman had said he would retire 
eventually but never specified a date or certain successor his 
likely replacement abruptly resigned leaving the future leaders 
identity even murkier 
that may sound like a politburo political intrigue that could 
only haunt the inner sanctums of the kremlin or beijings great hall 
of the people but it happened in a den of capitalism this past 
week chrysler corps headquarters in highland park mich 
vice chairman gerald greenwalds unexpected departure from 
chrysler to head an employee buyout of airline giant ual corp came 
as a surprise not only to company outsiders but also evidently to 
chairman lee a iacocca 
iacocca was vacationing at his italian villa retreat when 
greenwald personally delivered the news they flew back together for 
the official announcement 
greenwald said he was pursuing a new challenge rather than 
fleeing uncertainty and frustration in an industry that is under 
severe competitive pressure he also denied suggestions of internal 
dissension at the top 
but management experts said greenwalds resignation had the 
effect of raising basic questions about whether chryslers own 
management team had longterm faith in its future he was the third 
senior executive to quit in a month if someone at that high level 
who is in line to be the ceo prefers another ceos job in a 
different kind of industry it makes you wonder why he made that 
jump said richard m cyert president of carnegie mellon 
university in pittsburgh thats a worrisome thing id worry very 
much as a chrysler stockholder as an american i worry about it 
greenwald 54 had been considered the leading candidate to 
replace iacocca after the 65yearold chairman and chief executive 
officers contract expires in october 1991 
iacocca who helped save chrysler from bankruptcy a decade ago 
and is trying to stem the no 3 automakers latest decline had 
dropped hints he might retire but left it ambiguous so questions 
have persisted about who might succeed him and when 
the uncertainty was reinforced by chryslers response to the 
greenwald departure it expanded the duties of two other 
seniorlevel managers robert a lutz and robert s miller jr to 
fill the void they both evidently are now the leading candidates to 
lead chrysler after iacocca but that remains unclear some outside 
management experts said chryslers scrambled reaction was a signal 
that the company had no contingency arrangement to handle an 
unexpected event like the greenwald resignation 
thats not surprising said gilbert e dwyer president of 
the dwyer consulting group a new yorkbased management consulting 
and executive recuitment firm once youve made it clear to an 
individual that hes going to be the next ceo you really dont 
expect hes going to change his mind 
gerald c myers a management expert and former chairman of 
nowdefunct american motors corp acquired by chrysler three years 
ago declined to comment specifically about the company because of 
his personal relationship with its executives but he said that in 
general management succession is one of the most critical problems 
any company can face 
theres a need to as early as possible designate the time of 
succession the people who will be involved and those who wont 
said myers who wrote when it hits the fan a book about 
management crises 
the infighting the unhappiness the ulcers the bad media all 
these things boil out if its not clear he said 
in other business and economic news this past week 
contradictory evidence emerged over the state of the economy a 
widely followed monthly survey of purchasing managers suggested the 
nations manufacturing improved in may but government figures 
showed private job growth stalled in may and construction spending 
and factory orders fell in april indicating persistent 
sluggishness the markets rallied on the bad news because it implied 
interest rates will decline making stocks and bonds more valuable 
two leading us exporters signed major deals with communist 
superpowers boeing co sold jetliners to china in an arrangement 
worth at least 2 billion and possibly 4 billion international 
business machines corp using the sovietus summit as a backdrop 
announced it would provide 13000 personal computers to soviet 
schools for an undisclosed amount 
cocacola co put the lid on magicans its biggestever 
advertising promotion the campaign featured coke cans that 
contained money or prize certificates but they were plagued by 
mechanical problems by some estimates the company may be left with 
500000 magicans it cant use

as they tally their profits from the stock 
markets upsurge to record highs over the past five weeks many 
stockmarket investors acknowledge a debt of gratitude to mutual 
funds 
funds that invest in stocks have brimmed over lately with new 
money from investors virtually forcing them to step up their buying 
in the marketplace 
an awareness of that development seems to have increased other 
traders enthusiasm for stocks at a time when many uncertainties 
persist about the outlook for the economy 
indeed to some observers the resurgent popularity of stock 
funds hints at a positive change in the attitude of the public 
toward investing in the market 
individual investors again form a growing constituency for 
equities says greg smith strategist at prudentialbache 
securities 
the mutual fund industry has been booming for years its total 
assets around 100 billion as the 1980s began soared to the 1 
trillion mark by last winter 
much of that growth however occurred in funds that put money to 
work in places other than stocks moneymarket investments for 
example or treasury bonds or new vehicles on the financial scene 
like mortgagebacked securities 
stock funds were generally thought to have reached and passed 
their peak as a stock market force during the gogo years of the 
1960s when some managers of highrisk funds temporarily achieved 
the status of cult heroes 
today most analysts agree its still far too soon to tell 
whether anything like a replay of that era is in store 
but for the past few months market analysts have been paying more 
and more attention to an influx of money into stock funds 
especially since it began during a period of sluggish market 
performance before stock prices took off this spring 
through the first four months of the year investors put 78 
billion more into stock funds than they took out surpassing net 
sales of 58 billion for all of 1989 
the publics subscription to equity mutual funds may not be a 
lasting phenomenon said michael sherman at shearson lehman hutton 
inc 
if it is however it is certainly coming at an odd time apart 
from all the fundamental factors affecting stock prices the 
mentality of this new buyer may affect market behavior for the 
foreseeable future 
excitement over the funds new clout helped propel stock prices 
to new highs in the past week the dow jones average of 30 
industrials climbed 8005 to 290097 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 432 to 19803 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
854 to 46214 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 399 at 36383 
volume on the big board averaged 17262 million shares a day 
against 16347 million the week before 
a good many observers speculate that investors have turned to 
stock funds partly because their ardor for several types of 
competing investments has cooled 
for example credit worries have taken a little of the edge off 
investors keen appetite for moneymarket funds as the housing 
market has cooled in many areas of the country analysts have 
questioned whether real estate will work the same kind of 
wealthbuilding wonders in the 1990s that it did in the 70s and 
80s 
equities are looking better by comparison says smith 
proof of my hypothesis about the change in valuation benchmarks 
will come in the form of continued net positive inflows to equity 
mutual funds through the summer 
and with lower interest rates we could have a lot of fun in 
the equity market in the summer of 1990

inland empire paper co plans to purchase 
equipment by the end of next year that will enable it to produce 
half of its paper from recycled newspapers a company official says 
the move reflects market demand for recycled newsprint from the 
100ton capacity plant at millwood east of spokane said clyde b 
anderson inland empire president and general manager 
the equipment which would remove ink from old newspapers so that 
they can be recycled more easily is expected to be in place by the 
end of 1991 he said thursday 
anderson declined to give the specific cost of the equipment but 
said the equipment will cost about 150000 per ton of daily 
capacity that would be about 15 million at the 100tonaday plant 
the decision to purchase the deinking equipment stemmed in part 
from requests from the companys largest customers the seattle 
times and two san francisco newspapers to use more recycled paper 
anderson said 
inland empire is a whollyowned subsidiary of the cowles 
publishing co which publishes the spokesmanreview and spokane 
chronicle newspapers 
in addition to the newsprint mill the company owns and manages 
more than 100000 acres of forest land in eastern washington and 
northern idaho

panasonic announced friday the first rerecordable 
optical storage disc for computers that uses a new technology 
designed to make it work faster 
optical storage discs hold much more information than the more 
common magnetic discs used for computer data storage but most can 
only be recorded once 
rewritable optical discs are a relatively new technology they 
allow the discs to be used many times 
most optical discs are based on a technology called 
magnetooptical they store the ones and zeros of computer data as 
magnetized or unmagnetized sections of the disc 
to read one of these discs light from a laser is bounced off the 
disc while it is spinning the magnetic orientation of the different 
spots of the disc causes the light which is polarized to rotate 
slightly this rotation is then read by the machine as either a one 
or a zero 
the technology used by panasonic which is part of japans 
matsushita electric industrial co ltd is called phase change 
instead of changing the magnetic orientation of the disc it uses a 
laser to change the nature of the discs material into a crystalline 
form which is highly reflective or to leave in it a 
noncrystalline form which does not reflect light the differences 
in reflection are read by the laser as ones or zeros 
the advantage of the phasechange system is that a disc can be 
rerecorded in one pass of the laser by comparison to record over a 
magnetooptical disc the laser first must erase the original data 
in a separate operation before it can record new data 
optical disc storage is used primarily with personal computers 
it is particularly useful for storge of images as opposed to words 
or numbers since images are composed of vastly more data said jay 
bretzmann an analyst at international data corp a hightechnology 
research firm 
panasonic said its new storage device will be available this fall 
at the suggested list price of 5000 rewritable optical discs are 
expected to cost about 250 the company said
