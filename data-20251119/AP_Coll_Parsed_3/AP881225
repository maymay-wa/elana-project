defense officials now say the savannah river 
plants three nuclear reactors probably wont be fully operational 
until late 1989 according to a federal report 
energy officials had said they hoped to get the three reactors at 
the aiken sc facility back in operation for tritium production 
by late spring or midsummer 
an executive summary of the department of energys defense 
complex modernization plan said that in spite of planned safety and 
maintenance improvements the plants reactors may not be able to 
achieve acceptable production efficiencies according to a story 
published sunday in the augustabased morris communications corp 
newspapers 
on thursday energy secretary john s herrington said doe has 
decided to use ultrasonic testing to check for cracks in the vessel 
of the savannah plants k reactor a move that probably will keep 
the reactor down until at least june k reactor one of three at the 
plant has been targeted to restart first 
according to the report obtained by the newspaper group the 
existing production reactors at their current power limits have 
limited operational capability 
those reactors are one example of the fact that many facilities 
throughout the weapons complex are approaching the end of their 
useful lives the report said 
as much as 81 billion will be needed over the next 21 years to 
modernize and clean up doe defense facilities the report said 
the energy department operates a number of facilities that help 
produce materials for nuclear weapons the savannah plant located 
across the georgiasouth carolina border from augusta is one of 
several that have been plagued recently with reports of safety 
lapses and other problems 
the three srp reactors currently are the nations sole production 
source of tritium a radioactive isotope that enhances the explosive 
power of nuclear warheads tritium decays 55 percent annually and 
must be regularly replenished in warheads

the view from the wearmouth bridge is 
a melancholy one the last shipyard is closing and the river wear 
once smothered in coal dust and bustling with boats lies silent 
waiting for landscapers to turn its banks into parkland 
the other side of this eerie elegiac metaphor for a greening 
postindustrial britain lies just up the road where a sprawling new 
shopping center has replaced the clang of hammers on steel with the 
chirp of busy cash registers 
britain once the workshop of the world is being transformed 
into a nation of shopkeepers tourist guides bankers and hightech 
entrepreneurs and nowhere is this more evident than in northeast 
england 
seventy years ago at the height of empire british yards built 
onethird of the worlds tonnage and gruff grimy noisy sunderland 
was the detroit of shipbuilding 
but like most western ship industries britains has shrunk with 
the onset of far east competition of 1528 ships launched worldwide 
last year just 31 were british 
now with the governments announcement dec 8 that it is closing 
north east shipbuilders ltd sunderlands 600yearold shipbuilding 
industry has reached its end 
the 2400 jobs lost will bump sunderlands male unemployment 
above the 20percent mark after a steady fall in the past two years 
from 236 percent to 191 percent 
i never imagined this could happen i thought thered always be 
a yard here said ernie hunter 56 a short broadshouldered man 
who went to work as a ships plumber at the age of 14 
but all over the northeast in former citadels of heavy industry 
like newcastle sheffield and sunderland new life is sprouting amid 
the rubble of the smokestack industries 
coal steel shipbuilding and textiles are being supplanted by 
computer manufacturing japanese auto plants retailing tourism a 
northern counterbalance to the financial markets of london that have 
blossomed under the freemarket doctrines of prime minister margaret 
thatcher 
the bridges sunderlands glittering new indoor shopping center 
is one example even more striking is the metrocentre a short train 
ride away which claims to be europes largest combined shopping and 
leisure complex with three miles of shopping malls 10000 parking 
spaces and an indoor amusement park complete with roller coaster 
north east shipbuilders compensation package includes 80 
million to redevelop the docks and teach workers new skills the 
future of the new britain depends on whether men in their 40s who 
have spent their lives in overalls welding hammering plumbing and 
riveting can find new lives as shopkeepers computer programmers 
and hotel keepers 
the response so far seems lukewarm 
its closure on the cheap a bloody insult to a skilled 
workforce said alan milburn a researcher who is heading a 
campaign to save the shipyards 
many of the men are hoping the campaign will succeed and of a 
dozen interviewed at random during the dying days of north east 
shipbuilders none appeared to have given any thought to acquiring a 
new skill 
brian brown a welder asked sardonically whether sunderland 
needed 2400 extra shopkeepers while another welder kenny downes 
noted that the failure rate for new businesses is more than 50 
percent 
the closure came as no surprise 
we always knew that in shipbuilding theres boom times and 
slack times said brown sitting amid the christmas decorations in 
his living room but then it started to get less and less boom and 
more and more slack and the writing was on the wall by the early 
80s 
men like brown stand to receive about 33000 on average in 
severance pay his mortgage is paid off his children almost grown 
but that does not make life on the dole more attractive for a 
vigorous 49yearold man who was born and bred in sunderland and 
wants to stay here 
the unions insist nesls modern facilities can still turn a 
profit they point to studies predicting a global upturn in 
shipbuilding in the 1990s 
to write the united kingdom as a maritime trading island nation 
out of the world shipbuilding market is industrially economically 
and strategically crazy said milburn 
most british shipyards were nationalized by harold wilsons labor 
government in 1977 and since mrs thatchers conservatives came to 
office in 1979 they have been steadily winding down the industry 
with nesls demise the state will no longer own any shipyards 
milburn accuses the government of being so ideologically obsessed 
with denationalizing and winding down heavy industry that it 
deliberately resisted outside offers to buy the yards 
but industry minister tony newton told parliament none of these 
offers constituted a viable future and i was not prepared to 
pretend something provided a future when i didnt think it did that 
would have been the worst service i could have provided for the 
people of sunderland 
sunderland a city of 200000 was never a garden spot a 
19thcentury travelers handbook described it as enshrouded in the 
blackest gloom of smoke while a french doctor wrote in 1831 of 
a picture of wretchedness filth and poverty 
shipbuilding recorded in sunderland as far back as 1346 was its 
lifeblood its ships kept britain in touch with its empire and even 
afterward in the 1970s it produced the sturdy and highly popular 
sd14 cargo ship the boeing 747 of the modern shipping age more 
than 150 of which were launched 
today the selfassuredness of industrial might has given way to 
uncertainty as its municipal museum illustrates in the recorded 
commentary accompanying a slide show of its history 
sunderland it says is no longer the grimy pulsating 
industrial metropolis it was its cleaner less clouded much 
healthier but not perhaps much happier the heart is not there now 
the busy river that gave life to the town is an emptiness that 
the planners seek to fill to landscape for leisure the banks that 
were once crammed with industry commerce homes and life 
sunderland is a town with a great past now were looking for a 
new kind of future

a cloud of thick red dust stirred by 
strong winds significantly reduced visibility in the capital sunday 
and marred christmas celebrations for many sudanese who 
traditionally spend the day picnicking 
mohamed mussa an official with the sudanese meteorological 
department told the associated press the dust storm and winds would 
last at least through the day 
mussa said visibility was 200 yards which surely means planes 
cannot land in the airport today until the dust has been blown 
away the weather also created huge traffic jams 
the dust storm started saturday making breathing difficult for 
many sudanese and covering everything including people with thick 
red and white dust 
although more than 90 percent of the sudanese are moslems many 
join their christian friends in christmas celebrations by driving 
into the countryside outside of khartoum for picnics

attorneys for two american indians charged 
with kidnapping in the takeover of a newspaper office are urging new 
york authorities to investigate corruption charges in a north 
carolina county 
we are hopeful that gov mario cuomo will respond positively 
to the phone calls and telegrams hes been getting said allen 
gregory an attorney for christic institute south which is 
representing timothy jacobs we hope he will have his attorney 
general investigate drug trafficking and corruption in robeson 
county 
jacobs 20 fled to new york after being indicted on 14 counts of 
seconddegree kidnapping by a special session of the robeson county 
grand jury dec 6 he was arrested in oneida ny a week later and 
released to the onondaga indian nation reservation under 25000 
bond an extradition hearing is scheduled jan 12 in new york 
eddie hatcher 31 who was indicted on the same charges said a 
week ago that he had also fled to the reservation because his life 
had been threatened in robeson county he had been arrested dec 6 
and was freed on 25000 bond he is scheduled to appear jan 16 at 
the robeson county superior court in lumberton 100 miles south of 
raleigh 
the national council of churches paid bonds for both men 
the indictments came less than two months after they were 
acquitted of federal hostagetaking charges in the feb 1 takeover 
of the robesonian newspaper in lumberton 
up to 20 people were held as hostages for 10 hours while hatcher 
demanded an investigation of alleged drug trafficking by law 
enforcement officers and corruption in local government 
the siege ended after gov jim martin agreed to form a state task 
force to investigate the charges but martin said last week all the 
task force found was rumors and gossip 
martin said hatcher jacobs and their supporters were attempting 
to win public sympathy by claiming that they are the victims of 
political persecution all of the rhetorical excess in the world 
is not going to persuade me that they should not face those 
charges martin said what they did was endanger the lives of 
those people 
but attorneys for jacobs say an investigation of robeson county 
by new york authorities would show that jacobs was telling the truth 
about corruption there and that he would be in danger if he was 
extradited back to north carolina 
cuomo was not in his office this week and other new york 
officials declined to comment on the request for an investigation 
lawyers for christic institute south of carrboro met with north 
carolina attorney general lacy thornburg after the federal trial to 
ask for an investigation of robeson county but thornburg told them 
the county had been part of a longrunning investigation of drug 
trafficking 
assistant us attorney john bruce who prosecuted the two 
indians in federal court said their efforts had hindered federal 
investigations 
hatcher and jacobs have charged that the state indictments are a 
vindictive act by district attorney joe freeman britt a 
frequent target of minority critics britt who leaves the 
prosecutors office jan 1 to become a superior court judge has 
called the charge ridiculous 
richard townsend an assistant district attorney named last week 
to succeed britt said he intends to continue the prosecution but 
said he has had little time to study the kidnapping case 
obviously were going to proceed with the extradition of mr 
jacobs he said

incisors and the bicuspids 
gilmore recently performed a root canal on hasso the meridian 
police departments drugsniffing german shepherd it was 
preliminary work for a crown to be done in about three weeks 
police patrolman jb rocco one of several officers in the 
citys threedog k9 patrol unit said hasso fractured a tooth 
during a demonstration earlier this month the tooth the officer 
said was broken when hasso bit down on a metal pipe 
the pipe was used to reward hasso for good work he loves to 
play with it thats his reward rocco said 
normally we would just pull the tooth but were talking about 
the business end of a 6000 dog rocco said we just didnt 
want to take any chances of having it break off any more 
besides the patrolman said gilmore likes dogs the crown work 
would normally cost more than 500 but is being done free as a 
service to the city

hasso should soon be snapping back into action 
hes going to look pretty wicked when he growls with that

the government has refused to comply with a 
european court of human rights ruling that says a law allowing 
terrorism suspects to be held up to a week without charges violates 
the european convention on human rights 
home secretary douglas hurd announced the decision to parliament 
on thursday 
in a test ruling last month the european court of human rights 
based in strasbourg france said terrorist suspects should be 
charged and brought before a court within four days 
it said the detention by british police in 1984 of four men 
without charge for more than four days breached the human rights 
conventions 
britain is a signatory to the conventions and has formally 
accepted that rulings by the court regarding the convention shall be 
binding 
but the conventions allow a country to opt out in cases where its 
government claims the measure in question is vital in time of war 
or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation 
referring to strifetorn northern ireland this is what the british 
government has claimed 
there is a public emergency within the meaning of these 
provisions in respect of terrorism connected with the affairs of 
northern ireland in the united kingdom hurd said 
members of the opposition labor party denounced the decision by 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government not to 
comply with the court ruling 
marjorie mowlam one of labors northern ireland spokeswomen 
said the government seemed intent on dragging britains reputation 
through the mud 
the government has missed a chance to make progress toward 
restoring respect for the rule of law in northern ireland she 
said 
the law is used mostly against suspects from both sides of the 
sectarian divide in northern ireland where the irish republic army 
is fighting to end british rule 
the mainly roman catholic ira wants to unite the predominantly 
protestant province with the republic of ireland under socialist 
rule protestant hardliners reject all talk of union with the 
republic

a sixmonth series of new england telephone co 
commercials that touched viewers hearts with a story about a father 
and daughters attempts to reconcile reached a happy ending on 
christmas day 
not that the outcome was really in doubt 
were the telephone company said advertising director 
geraldine obrien we dont do unhappy endings 
the story which had unfolded since july on television and radio 
in five new england states had prompted intense audience interest 
and speculation about how the fatherdaughter standoff would be 
resolved 
priests delivered sermons derived from the commercials a 
billboard urging daughter jill to call dad appeared talk show 
hosts threw open their microphones to listeners with an opinion on 
the family drama and at least one troubled family produced its own 
videotape takeoff on the tearjerker 
some people take it very seriously which as an advertiser 
amazes me ms obrien said people are participating in it as 
if its real life 
in a dispute apparently sparked by the man in her life jill and 
her dad had not spoken in two years the first spot saw sister kathy 
making a stab at bringing them back together only to have dad hang 
up at the mention of his estranged daughters name 
in subsequent ads dad called back to apologize for his rash 
response but refused to bury the hatchet and kathy pleaded with her 
sister to make amends before it was too late 
in the campaigns climax sunday jill at last picked up the 
telephone and in a gesture of apparent holiday good will called 
home dad responded by tearfully admitting i was wrong i had no 
right to interfere in your life like that 
ive missed you so much dad jill returned as the camera 
panned over various grinning family members 
the 5 million campaign exposed themes of vanity and false pride 
said the rev philip mcgraw of our lady comforter of the afflicted 
in waltham mass who recently gave a sunday sermon inspired in 
part by the commercials 
ive used the slogan reach out and touch someone many times 
as i think we all have the roman catholic priest said and this 
was similar i used the commercial in the context of compassion 
if we dont do the right things like make the effort to solve 
family quarrels we diminish ourselves he said it takes so 
little effort to make others feel better that it would be 
unthinkable not to try 
gregory payne chairman of emerson colleges communications 
department said the aura of reality helped make the advertisements 
so successful 
its the first time people are taking a miniseries soap opera 
approach its demanded a coactive response from the audience 
payne said adding that the campaigns timing was no coincidence 
its especially effective at a time like christmas when 
families are drawing together because people want to forgive and 
forget he said 
its a pretty subliminal message many people will say to 
themselves hey its been awhile since ive seen the old man and 
give it a try of course what will happen to those of us who act 
that out isnt revealed in the ad 
ms obrien said most customers asked said they considered the 
telephone among the best ways to mend fences 
i dont want to get too psychological but sometimes its 
easier to reconcile by phone she said sometimes if youve had 
an argument as often happens in families theres the fear of a 
rebuff or rejection face to face its easier to make up by 
telephone 
although ineligible for a nielsen rating the family radio 
and tv spots proved more than an expression of good will for the 
telephone company 
carolyn smith vice president of bostons cabot advertising said 
marketing surveys show consumer awareness of the telephone companys 
advertising increased more than 58 percent since the campaign was 
launched 
we were the first to use this format but i think its a 
trend she said adding that new england telephone has been 
contacted by other telephone companies interested in running the 
same or similar spots in other parts of the country mci and nissan 
have also launched similar campaigns 
its hard to equate in dollars and cents but the main reason 
you advertise is to increase sales of your product ms obrien 
said weve had a real outpouring of letters and calls and 
interest by our subscribers

a bitter fivemonthold strike at a 
sawmill has traumatized a logging towns 1200 residents splitting 
apart families friends and union members who find themselves on 
opposite sides of a picket line 
divisions within the town 55 miles northeast of seattle have run 
deep since 177 summit timber co mill workers went on strike aug 1 
after a threeyear contract expired and the towns largest employer 
hired replacement workers 
twentythree union members also returned to work while 90 who 
once were paid as much as 13 an hour remain on the picket line at 
60 a week others have left to find other jobs 
friendships in the small town are now measured against which side 
of the picket line people are on 
oh no oh no hes one of them said gary ensley a striking 
worker as he watched a pickup truck drive into the summit plant 
hes one of those who went back his bills caught up with him and 
he started losing things so he went back i dont like him 
anymore 
nancy stull 43 a 13year summit employee and her husband a 
22year mill veteran walked out together with her two brothers 
one brother found another job and with his first paycheck 
bought her 250 worth of groceries she said the other now 
referred to as her exbrother crossed the picket line about six 
weeks into the walkout 
when she and her family drive to her parents home for a 
traditional christmas dinner she said if my exbrother is there 
we wont stay we will just turn around and go home and have our own 
dinner 
no talks have been scheduled since the last bargaining session 
between summit and lumber production and industrial workers union 
local 2860 ended sept 15 
strikers say they helped the secondgeneration family owned 
business through tough times accepting a 25 percent pay cut in 1982 
and another cut in 1984 in the latest contract according to union 
officials the company wanted to retain a 20 percent pay cut it 
instituted in 1986 
lloyd johnson a union business agent said the economic issues 
could have been worked out but the strike was called over a company 
demand that union membership no longer be mandatory 
terry mullane summit personnel manager said the union struck 
after giving the company a takeitorleaveit proposal 
the strike is sad it didnt have to happen mullane said 
we were forced to take an action for survival purposes 
while the company hired replacements two weeks after the strike 
started union members around the state have rallied to support the 
striking workers 
all the striking families have been adopted by other 
snohomish county union members who have provided food and gifts for 
the children thousands of others around the state also have sent 
money food and toys 
linda morgan said she and her husband charles a sevenyear 
summit employee were given a 20pound turkey 10 pounds of 
hamburger about 150 worth of groceries and several presents for 
their 6yearold daughter katie 
we have always had extra and been able to give to others i 
guess we have learned to receive because we sure received last 
saturday she said 
she said her husband found work at a mill in alaska but she 
called him home after a month 
id rather starve than live like that it wasnt fair to her 
katie she said every time her father would call she would 
get on the phone and say when are you coming home dad

when the gifts are gone and the tinsel 
tucked away what do you do with your christmas tree throw it in 
the yard and watch it rot put it on the curb for the garbage truck 
this year the state of vermont wants residents to do something 
different try recycling 
the agency of natural resources is sponsoring the 5000 
experiment under which vermonters will bring their trees to one of 
nine locations there state and city workers will chop the tree into 
chips for use in parks or other landscaping projects 
were hoping for a positive response particularly from the 
areas where its more densely populated where people dont have big 
backyards where they can dump their christmas trees to degrade by 
themselves said connie leach the agencys chief of recycling and 
resource conservation section 
trees that are tossed out with the trash can overload garbage 
trucks and landfills leach said 
a lot of people throw them away and its a problem for the 
haulers that have packer trucks because if you can imagine a tree 
getting into that packing mechanism it really gets jammed leach 
said

lt gen william odom spent much of his 
army career immersed in the soviet union including three years as 
head of the supersecret national security agency that eavesdrops on 
us adversaries 
in retirement hes still pursuing his lifes interest writing 
scholarly articles watching the changes in the soviet union 
preparing to teach soviet politics at yale university and reading 
his favorite russian literature 
as director of national security studies at the hudson institute 
a think tank with offices near washington odom writes on relations 
between the soviet unions civilian and military leaders a longtime 
expertise that has taken on new urgency because of mikhail 
gorbachevs reforms of the red army 
odom emerged from bureaucratic shadows into national headlines in 
may 1986 when he gruffly warned the news media not to speculate on 
details of secrets that former nsa employee ronald w pelton was 
convicted of selling to the soviets 
nowadays odom whose 34year army career included teaching 
russian history at west point has a professorial demeanor lacing 
his conversation with scholarly references but he has not changed 
his tough views toward the soviet union and is reserving judgment 
about whether gorbachev can hold on 
i am waiting with bated breath to see whether gorbachev can 
make it stick odom said in an interview the situation as i see 
it is that the lines are drawn on the military issue between the 
general staff and gorbachevs reformers 
odom 56 said that after retiring from the army and leaving his 
job as nsa director last july he has found time to enjoy two of his 
favorite russian writers anton chekhov and mikhail zoshchenko 
as he prepares to begin teaching at yale in january he continues 
to write scholarly articles including one for foreign policy 
magazine on gorbachevs efforts to reform the red army 
that article attracted attention in the wake of gorbachevs 
announcement on dec 7 that he was cutting soviet forces by about 10 
percent and withdrawing 50000 troops from eastern europe 
odoms interest in russia began in 1953 during his third year as 
a student at west point studying the reforms of peter the great 
16721725 
he was assigned to the us 6th cavalry in west germany in 1956 
when that unit prepared to mobilize during the hungarian uprising 
but stayed put as soviet tanks crushed the rebellion 
my view of my duty as a second lieutenant was that i was in 
europe to hold up the iron curtain and to make sure that it did not 
fall on western europe odom said 
his interest in the soviet union grew and he studied the nation 
and the russian language in the mid1960s he spent two years at the 
military liaison office in potsdam east germany where he had a 
brief chat with the commander of the group of soviet forces in 
germany 
you have very interesting work i know what your job is the 
soviet told odom it is to keep track of the daily activities of 
the soviet army and report to your headquarters 
as a lieutenant colonel odom spent a year in vietnam working 
for the military assistance command on pacification understanding 
why it wouldnt work and being a secret critic of the us role in 
vietnam 
i was never an enthusiast for the policy there but for reasons 
extraordinarily different from those of most people he said 
at columbia university in graduate school i learned there 
was a sinosoviet split and when i looked at the eurasian land 
mass it occured to me that it was not in the us interest to 
contain china but that it was in soviet interest 
i found it very difficult to explain why we would commit a half 
a million troops to suit soviet foreign policy he said as a 
lieutenant colonel you do not really influence policy and i was 
not sufficiently naive to be believe that i could 
after vietnam odom wrote an article for which he is famous among 
sovietologists a response to a theory by rand corp analyst roman 
kolkowicz that communist party officials and military officers 
have a conflict relationship 
odom responded by noting that most senior military officers were 
also communist party members and that although there are some 
differences of opinion party discipline prevails 
in 1972 still a lieutenant colonel odom was assigned to the 
us embassy in moscow from which he traveled through each of the 
15 soviet republics staying abreast of the soviet military i 
spent a lot of time on trains 
in 1977 he went to the white house as military aide to zbigniew 
brzezinski national security adviser to president carter he made 
brigadier general in 1980 stayed at the white house into the reagan 
administration then went to the pentagon to serve as assistant 
chief of the army staff for intelligence 198185

the plo will urge the united states to 
recognize it as the sole representative of the palestinians and will 
push for an international peace conference in future usplo talks 
palestinian sources said sunday 
the plo executive committee met for a second day in baghdad to 
review issues that included the formation of a provisional 
palestinian government and the state of the yearold uprising 
against israeli rule in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
sources close to the discussions said members of the clandestine 
committee organizing the uprising in the occupied territories are 
participating in the meetings but they refused to elaborate 
no official statements are expected until the meetings scheduled 
end late monday 
a palestinian spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the deliberations sunday focused on future talks with the united 
states 
earlier this month washington reversed a 13year ban on contacts 
with the palestine liberation organization talks were held in 
tunis tunisia several days later 
the spokesman said the 15member executive committee reviewed a 
report from members yasser abdrabboo and abdullah hourani on the 
talks with the us ambassador to tunisia robert h pelletreau jr 
he said the committee instructed the two to continue the talks 
stressing the priority of pushing further the effort to hold an 
international conference on the middle east 
sources close to the talks who also refused to be named said 
the plo will urge the united states to recognize it as the sole and 
legitimate representative of the palestinian people 
the committee also broached the topic of forming a provisional 
government in the occupied territories the spokesman said adding 
that the issue needed further discussion 
two committee members bishop lia alkhouri and mustafa elzibri 
of the marxistoriented popular front for the liberation of 
palestine did not attend the meetings in arafats residence in a 
tightly guarded compound on the outskirts of baghdad 
neither absence was officially explained but elzibri has been 
sharply critical of arafats peace initiative 
there has been growing opposition by radical palestinian factions 
and some figures within the plo to arafats recognition of israel 
and renunciation of terrorism both of which were conditions set by 
the united states to open a dialogue 
it is not clear to what extent opposition exists within the 
executive committee to arafats moves 
elzibri is the pflps sole representative on the committee 
which includes three members of arafats mainstream fatah faction 
the largest of the six guerrilla groups in the plo 
he declared last week in damascus syria that arafats 
recognition of israel and renunciation of terrorism were only 
arafats personal opinion and are incompatible with resolutions 
passed by the palestine national council the plos 
parliamentinexile when it declared an independent state last 
month 
we will continue to exercise our legitimate rights in 
struggling against the occupation by all means available including 
armed struggle elzibri said 
palestinian dissidents based in syria warned last week they would 
continue the armed struggle against israel to thwart arafats 
peace moves and also would seek to oust him from plo leadership 
the united states has said it will break off the dialogue with 
the plo if the group is found to have carried out terrorist attacks

ten opposition members of parliament were 
dragged from a conference hall on sunday after they stood on chairs 
and complained about policemen taking seats reserved for the 
presidium 
irwine ho secretarygeneral of the assembly said the 
unprecedented removal was necessary because the politicians were 
trying to disrupt the meeting 
the disruption began when tsai shihyuan of the democratic 
progressive party and his colleagues found plainclothed security 
guards sitting in front of them in the assembly hal 
they yelled that the guards were taking up seats reserved for the 
presidium standing on their chairs they shouted that the guards 
should leave the hall or they would stop the meeting 
about 40 policemen ran into the noisy hall grabbed tsai and nine 
other opposition members and put them in two seperate rooms 
one of those expelled huang tsaohui smashed windows of the 
room he was kept in and shouted that the governing nationalist party 
had arrested them illegally 
earlier opposition members were barred from carrying into the 
hall a banner reading new president new parliament they said 
they wanted to challenge president lee tenghui in the meeting to 
discuss when all seats in the parliament can be open to elections 
the opposition has been urging the retirement of old lawmakers 
and assemblymen to clear the way for national elections 
more than twothirds of the national assemblys 894 members were 
elected on the chinese mainland before the nationalists lost a civil 
war to the communists and fled to taiwan in 1949 
the octogenarians have been frozen in office to support the 
nationalists claim to represent all china 
many of the elderly assemblymen have said they would not accept a 
proposal that has been put forward under which they would 
voluntarily retire and get a pension

snowy owls a solitary species of beautiful birds 
from frozen tundra far to the north are returning to their winter 
home near one of the nations noisiest airports and one of its most 
polluted harbors 
the unusual gathering seems largely due to reminders of home and 
an abundant food supply at the 1800 acres of open field at logan 
international airport said bradford blodget of the state division 
of fisheries and wildlife 
massachusetts is probably one of the best places in the entire 
country to see snowy owls blodget said probably the largest 
concentration in the state is out at logan 
in addition to providing a curious counterpoint to the modern 
surroundings the white birds are doing their part to clean up the 
muchmaligned boston harbor by feasting on the water rats populating 
the grasslands between the runways and the water 
more than 35 of the solitary 20inchlong often brownspecked 
owls perched on radio towers and swooped silently out over the water 
and runways during their last decembertomarch visit 
norman smith of the massachusetts audubon society banded 36 
snowy owls at logan for the first time last season the birds which 
travel individually start their trek south in november and continue 
to migrate until january 
so far this year smith has sighted three birds the small number 
could be part of a migratory pattern or more birds could come as 
the season progresses he said 
smith is the states snowy owl expert but he concedes it is 
difficult to say what draws them from the quiet desolation of the 
tundra in greenland and northern canada to the chaotic environment 
of the airport 
nobody really knows why they migrate smith said some 
people try to correlate it to the drop in the lemming supply which 
the owls feed on some try to correlate it to the weather 
smith said he believes its just a normal migratory pattern that 
draws the snowy owls south to the airport where the noisy planes 
dont disturb the birds 
for the most part they ignore them he said owls have 
sensitive hearing but the jet noise doesnt seem to phase them at 
all 
the owls go about their lives at the airport much like they would 
in the barren expanses of home with a few extra activities smith 
said 
they roost primarily on the ground and they seem to be most 
active just before sunset and very active at night smith said 
sometimes they perch amid discarded ramps buses and structures 
rusting in an isolated section of the airfield and occasionally the 
owls venture out to the harbor islands 
in the evenings ive actually seen them fly to downtown 
boston smith said adding that the owls perch on roof tops and 
eat the rats scurrying near open dumpsters in alleys 
although the noise from the planes doesnt bother the owls bob 
dentremont an airport employee since 1971 who has watched the 
falcons blue heron and geese that populate logan said the airport 
is not always safe for the owls they often sit on the white lines 
of the runways to blend in 
we lose a couple a year a couple get hit said dentremont 
who said he has spotted snowy owls at logan since 1975 
logan is not the only place snowy owls congregate in the united 
states the birds travel along the seaboard and live along marshes 
and fields a large seasonal population can be found at plum island 
off newburyport 
a logan owl was once tracked to rhode island and john f kennedy 
international airport in new york reports five or six snowy owls a 
year

by the time i got back the only thing i saw was them pulling her 
out her face covered with soot john dzialowy recalled sunday 
we were facing a rough christmas as it was i was out of work 
and we couldnt afford much anyway nothing seemed to be going 
right and now this he added his voice cracking 
lord i dont know where we go from here 
fire department spokesman bill crowley said officials believe the 
fire was caused by a space heater in the familys southwest side 
apartment he said a safety glass panel that should have covered the 
front of the heater was missing and flames apparently touched off 
some items nearby 
flames and smoke were shooting out windows when firefighters 
arrived crowley said when they learned the mother who had 
escaped ok had gone back inside several firefighters went in to 
search for her 
mrs dzialowy was found beneath a window in the rear bedroom and 
firefighters attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation at the scene 
she was taken to st anthonys hospital 
there the dzialowy 31 and his children mary 8 kristin 7 
and john jr 5 maintained a vigil mrs dzialowys mother kathy 
kisla said the children told their mother mommy get up we want 
you to come home and have christmas with us 
she never regained consciousness a hospital spokeswoman said 
dzialowy said he and his children are staying with his parents in 
suburban palos hills 
my biggest problem right now is to find a job and scrape 
together enough money for a decent burial and a place for us to 
live dzialowy said 
luck is one thing we never had much of we were married nine 
years through good and bad he added and we always tried to 
stay together as a family thats why she went back in

vice premier milos milosavljevic 
warned sunday that some of the economic reforms before lawmakers 
likely will not be passed until the middle of next year the 
official tanjug news agency said 
the series of laws to introduce marketoriented reforms are 
designed to turn around the faltering economy and bolster premier 
branko mikulics muchcriticized cabinet 
yugoslavias inflation rate the highest in europe is running 
at close to 300 percent and the country is grappling with a 21 
billion debt and rising unemployment 
this year there have been a record 1000plus strikes to demand 
higher wages and protest sinking living standards 
expectations and even demands are unrealistic that dozens 
of laws regulating the economic reform could be passed before dec 
31 tanjug quoted milosavljevic as saying 
yugoslavias parliament was meeting through the weekend to pass 
at least nine laws considered crucial to the reform 
the rest would be passed by mid1989 milosavljevic said 
mikulics government has been harshly criticized for its 
unsuccessful antiinflation policies and failure to halt the 
economic decline leading to speculation that the government may 
soon be forced to resign 
the sarajevo daily oslobodjenje commented that the inflation rate 
hangs like the sword of damocles over mikulics cabinet 
vecernje novosti belgrade daily on saturday charged mikulic 
sowed unfounded hope that his government would win the battle for 
economic reform and threw in despair every honest worker who 
could no longer cope with the inflation

two french girls held captive for 13 
months will be released as a christmas present to the worlds 
children a spokesman for the radical palestinian kidnappers claimed 
sunday 
walid khaled of the fatahrevolutionary council did not set a 
date for the release of marielaure 7 and virginie 6 
the group said they will be freed in response to appeals from 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi chief backer of the organization 
headed by terrorist leader abu nidal 
khaled showed a news conference videotapes of people captured 
with the girls their mother jacqueline valente and five belgians 
they apparently will remain held 
the decision to free them is basically related to the 
responsibility of the french government khaled said without 
elaborating 
on tape all the captives said they were well cared for 
the fatahrevolutionary council declared nov 8 1987 it had 
seized them aboard a french yacht off the gaza strip and accused 
them of spying for israel 
however israeli press reports said the yacht was hijacked off 
libya the groups main base 
we will release the two girls as a christmas gift for the 
children of the world and their family khaled told reporters at 
his office in west beiruts mar elias palestinian refugee camp 
they will be released outside lebanon thats why the operation 
is taking time khaled added 
that raised the possibility they could be freed in libya or 
algeria which has offered to host the release 
khaled said the other captives were in good health and well 
treated 
the belgians are fernand houtekins his brother emmanuel and his 
wife godelieve and their two children laurent 17 and valerie 16 
in the tapes the six said they were filmed dec 20 they started 
by giving their names and wishing merry christmas and happy new year 
to relatives and friends they did not relay any demands of their 
kidnappers 
im pregnant and in good health after our release i intend to 
live in another country than france to build up my future there 
ms valente said 
fernand houtekins referred to ms valente as my wife 
for the second time my wife is pregnant while we are with the 
palestinian fighters everything is proceeding smoothly he said 
khaled said last christmas that ms valente had given birth to a 
baby girl after a sevenmonth pregnancy from an illegal 
relationship with fernand houtekins 
emmanuel houtekins said the kidnappers were providing us with 
wine and beer our accommodation is good and we have heating we 
have no problems 
mrs godelieve houtekins thanked the belgian government for all 
the help exerted to facilitate our release 
valerie houtekins said she hoped to receive letters from 
relatives and friends soon 
her brother laurent revealed we are all at the same big 
apartment 
the videotapes were released after khaled met for an hour with 
ms valentes mother brigitte valente her former husband pascal 
betille and brotherinlaw andre metral who are in beirut to

paramilitary forces killed 12 sinhalese 
extremists just hours after antigovernment militants raided a tea 
plantation and set fire to 10 tamil homes police said sunday 
it was the worst burst of violence since prime minister 
ranasinghe premadasa was elected president in dec 19 elections he 
takes office jan 2 
premadasa a sinhalese has said his victory would help curb 
ethnic violence on this indian ocean island particularly by the 
peoples liberation front an extremist sinhalese group that opposes 
the governments peace overtures to the tamil minority 
a police spokesman said a group of sinhalese extremists raided a 
tea plantation in matale on saturday and torched 10 tamil homes 
more than 300 other tamils fled the estate after the attack and 
sought refuge in a hindu temple according to the police spokesman 
who did not want to be identified matale is about 65 miles north of 
colombo 
later in the day members of the peoples revolutionary red army 
retaliated by killing 12 sinhalese men in separate attacks in the 
southern towns of hakmana wellawaya and akuressa the spokesman 
said 
the victims all were members of the front he said 
the peoples revolutionary red army comprised mainly of members 
of paramilitary forces has blamed the front for killings of 900 
government supporters and security personnel in the past 17 months 
tamils who are mostly hindu make up 18 percent of the islands 
16 million people and say they are denied jobs and education by the 
predominantly buddhist sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the 
population 
moderate tamils have been demanding selfrule in the northern and 
eastern provinces while tamil extremists wage a guerrilla war for a 
separate tamil homeland more than 8500 people have died in the 
fighting 
the peoples liberation front abhors a peace accord signed in 
july 1987 and aimed at ending the 5yearold tamil insurgency the 
front contends the government granted too many concessions by 
offering limited automony to the tamils

a multimilliondollar soviet space probe hurtling 
toward mars apparently is having serious mechanical problems that 
could cause a severe setback for the soviet space program a 
newspaper reported sunday 
there is enough smoke that i suspect there is a little fire 
said sam keller deputy associate administrator for space science 
and applications for the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
you cant tell how serious it is but there is no question they 
are having problems keller told the houston chronicle in 
recent years they have had a history of planetary missions that 
did not work 
four months ago word leaked that the soviet union lost phobos i 
the first of the twin unmanned mars probes because of a computer 
problem 
phobos i and phobos ii were launched in july they were scheduled 
to orbit mars january 29 and then begin circling phobos in may or 
april bombarding the little moons pitted surface with laser and 
particle beams they also were to deploy landers on phobos to 
perform chemical and physical tests of the surface 
what i have heard is that some of the phobos ii instruments 
allegedly have failed keller said how critical the problem is 
i dont know 
my guess is that they are trying right now to figure our their 
situation said keller who has worked closely with the soviets 
and their planetary space program 
another knowledgeable source told the newspaper there is no 
prospect of any science data return from phobos ii and that it was 
common knowledge among some us scientists familiar with the phobos 
ii problem 
if true that would be the end of a billiondollar experiment 
the most ambitious of the soviet unions planetary science probes 
paving the way toward eventual exploration of mars

shiite moslem militiamen in lebanon to stop fighting saying they 
should unify against the united states and israel the official 
islamic republic news agency reported 
the lebanese have a common enemy and should consolidate their 
ranks against imperialism zionism and their mercenaries by

fighting the proiranian hezbollah or party of god for control of 
lebanons 12 million shiites six days of fighting in moslem west 
beirut last month left 40 people dead and 87 wounded by police

iran iraq and syria rallied behind libya 
sunday after the united states said it was considering destroying an 
alleged chemical weapons plant in libya 
the arab league scheduled a meeting monday to discuss the issue 
according to an official iraqi report 
president reagan said thursday the united states and its allies 
are considering using military force against a factory in libya that 
he said produces chemical weapons 
the united states bombed libya in 1986 in retaliation for a 
terrorist attack on a berlin disco that left a us serviceman dead 
and 204 other people wounded 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi on sunday denied libya built a 
chemical weapons plant and said the country was committed to un 
efforts to ban such weapons libya has said the plant manufactures 
pharmaceuticals 
in iran tehran radio on sunday quoted deputy foreign minister 
hosseyn sheykholeslam as saying his government supports libya and 
will take a firm stand in the face of americas threats and 
propaganda attacks 
the official syrian news agency sana quoted an unidentified 
government official as saying syria expresses its deep concern 
and strong denunciation as to this unjustified campaign against 
libya 
the official iraqi news agency ina said iraq agreed to 
participate in the extraordinary session of the 22membernation 
arab league called by its secretarygeneral chedli klibi 
libya asked for the meeting after reagan made his threat it said 
by shouting these threats against the libyan people the 
american administration is trying to impose the logic of terrorism 
and aggression in solving bilateral and international issues the 
governmentowned daily aljoumhouriya said in an editorial 
tehran radio criticized the united states for its failure to act 
against iraq which earlier this year used chemical weapons against 
its own dissident kurdish minority 
during the iraniraq war iran supported kurdish guerrillas 
fighting for autonomy iraq started an offensive against kurds soon 
after iran agreed to a ceasefire in the 8yearold war in august 
 
about 5000 kurdish civilians in the northeastern iraqi town of 
halabja were killed by the chemicals 
if the american government is really concerned about the 
production of chemical weapons why did it not react to the repeated 
use of these weapons especially by the iraqi regime tehran radio 
asked

guyanese for intestinal and skin diseases the newspaper said 
defense department spokesman william caldwell said sunday he knew

relations have improved since president desmond hoyte took office 
after burnhams death in 1985 in september hoyte made a 12day

communist rebels sunday released six 
soldiers captured in two separate september raids and predicted the 
total victory of their revolution within the next decade 
euclides abcede a former mayor who negotiated the release said 
the six sergeants were freed in malinao village about 70 miles 
southeast of manila 
he said they were in good condition soldiers took the six to 
lucena city 20 miles west of the release point where they were 
reunited with their families he said 
the freed men included five members of an engineering battalion 
who were abducted sept 25 in atimonan town where they were to 
deliver the unit payroll the sixth soldier a philippine 
constabulary sergeant was captured in a raid three days later on 
the town of san andres 
abcede said the army kept relatives of those freed away from the 
release point apparently to play down the affair 
last august rebels in the same province freed four lieutenants 
and a sergeant after protracted negotiations which were widely 
reported in the manila press their release ceremony won lots of 
publicity and relatives of the freed soldiers were quoted last 
august as expressing gratitude and admiration for the rebel new 
peoples army 
military officials later complained the press had given the 
insurgents a propaganda victory 
the central committee of the banned communist party of the 
philippines on sunday predicted victory within the next decade so 
long as no grave errors of ideological subjectivism political 
opportunism sectarianism and laxity are committed 
in twenty years of existence the party remains at the center 
of the national political stage no matter how the united states and 
its reactionary agents try to marginalize it through violence and 
deception the committee said in a statement on the eve of the 
20th anniversary of the founding of the maoist party there is no 
way the united states can defeat a resolute protracted peoples war 
in the philippines 
the statement claimed the party had grown from 60 red 
fighters on dec 26 1968 to 35000 full time members and a 
10millionstrong mass base or sympathizers operating in 63 of 
the 73 provinces

leader called on leftist rebels sunday to give up car bombings in 
their war against the government because the blasts have killed 
civilians 
rebels set off four car bombs friday near the heavilyfortified 
defense ministry and joint chiefs of staff headquarters in san 
salvador during one of their most dramatic attacks in the 9yearold 
conflict they also launched bombs by catapult over the 20foothigh 
walls 
three people all civilians were killed and 38 wounded in the 
attack 
we characterize the attack on the joint chiefs of staff as a 
terrorist act because all the victims were civilians mons 
gregorio rosa chavez the auxiliary archbishop of san salvador said 
sunday 
since the first use of car bombs in april the church raised 
its voice to denounce it as a negative development because it raised 
the level of danger for the civilian population he told reporters 
at the capitals catholic cathedral after a morning christmas mass 
we believe it is an unjustifiable form of war and that it must 
stop he said 
rebels have detonated at least nine car bombs this year the 
rebels say the latest attack showed their strength but the military 
says the terrorist tactics by the rebels demonstrate their weakness

soldiers and volunteers spent 
christmas scouring the countryside for clues and victims from pan am 
flight 103 taking a break from the grim search to join saddened 
townspeople at somber church services 
no more bodies were found sunday as dismal weather grounded 
search helicopters said deputy chief constable paul newall 
continual drizzle combined with lowlying clouds to reduce 
visibility 
lots of our people are getting fairly tired he said he said 
some search dogs were retired for the day because dogs dont go on 
as well as human beings 
we still have areas that are almost impregnable newall said 
referring to the wooded and hilly terrain but he said the search 
area had been extended about 15 miles east of lockerbie 
sixtyone relatives of victims most of them americans were in 
lockerbie on christmas day said leslie jardine spokesman for 
social workers in the town police spokesman angus kennedy said some 
were taken to the search areas 
no bodies have been positively identified and police were unable 
to tell relatives when bodies might be available for burial 
police said 239 bodies had been brought to temporary morgues so 
far including 84 on christmas eve there were 258 people aboard the 
pan am flight which originated in frankfurt with a change of 
planes before heading on to new york 
police still have not accounted for 10 townspeople and the 
occupants of two cars destroyed by wreckage that rained on the area 
during wednesday nights crash police said sunday the driver of one 
of the cars was identified as a yorkshire man driving a company car 
two us officials in washington speaking on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press on saturday that the cias 
chief in beirut had been among the jets passengers but that was 
denied in washington on sunday by oliver revell the fbis executive 
assistant director 
we cannot comment on intelligence community personnel but i am 
authorized to say that the station chief in beirut was not on that 
aircraft he said in an interview with cbs radio 
during a church service on sunday in lockerbie the roman 
catholic bishop of galloway the rev maurice taylor brought a 
message that jesus christ is alive today in this town and in the 
hearts of the people 
two pews were reserved at the holy trinity roman catholic church 
for relatives of crash victims who had come from the united states 
at all saints church a small anglican parish two relatives 
stood silently while the congregation sang o come all ye 
faithful the rev alan neal parish rector said the two were a 
father and a son who both lost wives in the crash 
the strain of the disaster and the attention it has brought to a 
quiet corner of southwestern scotland began to show sunday police 
admitted only parishioners and relatives of the dead to mass 
keeping reporters and cameras in a cluster across the street 
on a day traditionally devoted to celebrating the nativity 
sermons turned to thoughts of death and why such disasters occur 
father if youre the god of love why did you let this 
happen asked taylor why did you allow the destruction of 
hundreds of innocent lives the 10 who were citizens of lockerbie 
the many dozens who had never heard of lockerbie but whose lives 
ended so appallingly in the streets and fields of this part of 
scotland 
and why do you permit so many people to have to suffer the 
cruel tragic burden of bereavement the answers to these questions 
how to make sense of the pieces of this seemingly senseless jigsaw 
god alone knows he said 
taylors words were echoed by the rev derek rawcliffe the 
anglican bishop of glasgow and galway who preached at all saints 
church 
i dont know why but one thing i do know he said my 
response must be love to all the victims and love shown in a 
practical way 
if it turns out that the plane was brought down by saboteurs 
rawcliffe said then we have to do the difficult task of forgiving 
them 
authorities have said that a bomb or structural failure are the 
most likely causes but investigators from britain and the united 
states have reached no conclusion the jumbo jet apparently broke up 
at 31000 feet showing flaming debris over the scottish countryside 
soldiers most dressed in fatigues and muddy boots filled three 
rows of the small church 
for most of the army and royal air force personnel in lockerbie 
there was a lunch break for turkey soup turkey mince pie and if 
they wanted it a can of beer 
isabelle robertson of the womens royal volunteer service said it 
had been a sad christmas dinner for a lot of very tired young men 
who have seen dreadful things

inmates in the desperately 
overcrowded hall county jail rioted to make sure officials knew 
how miserable they were the sheriff said sunday 
basically they were saying if we cant be home for christmas 
with our families you wont be home with yours sheriff dick 
mecum said after the saturday night disturbance which caused no 
injuries but did extensive damage to the maximum security cellblock 
authorities calmed the prisoners within three hours and 
transferred about 70 rioters to another north georgia prison 
lowering the population in the hall jail to 175 it was designed to 
hold only 145 
mecum said the riot began about 830 pm when inmates began 
burning mattresses blankets and other flammable items in their 
cells electrical and duct work in the ceilings was vandalized and 
some windows were broken 
mecum said the worst damage occurred in the maximum security 
block but some rioting spilled over into another block 
authorities went in first with the hall county swat team mecum 
said and by 11 or 1130 pm the last of the prisoners had given 
up 
hall county administrator mike bryant said it was too early to 
give a damage estimate 
coincidentally mecum wrote a guest column for the sunday 
editions of gainesvilles daily newspaper the times taking the 
state department of corrections to task for allowing prisons and 
jails to become dangerously overcrowded like many county jails in 
the state the hall jail houses many inmates for whom there is no 
room in state prisons 
county jails are desperately overcrowded every day faced with 
riots fights injuries and near loss of control of our individual

some of the 12000 spectators 
shouted go get em george as the flotilla of boats crossed the 
delaware river sunday to reenact george washingtons famed 
christmas crossing 
the crowd offered an enthusiastic contrast to the stately james 
gallagher who portrayed the father of his country with his red 
and blue cape fluttering in the wind and his white wig and 
threecornered hat highlighted by the sun 
wearing a colonial uniform of blue and buff gallagher stood 
erect in a 40foot durham boat in sundays annual commemoration of 
the revolutionary war generals famous crossing 
gallagher looked like the painting by emanuel gottlieb leutze 
that recreated that day 212 years ago but sundays event had more 
than 12000 people watching and cheering 
i must say it was exciting gallagher said as he was rowed 
across from pennsylvania to new jersey on a sunny windswept day 
with temperatures more like autumn than winter 
the crowds were exceptionally motivated and greeted george with 
lots of remarks like go get em george and you look like just 
the president said gallagher whos planning to ride the boat 
again next month in the inaugural parade of presidentelect george 
bush 
the boat will be pulled on a trailer when it is in washington on 
jan 20 
history records that washington in the darkness of night and 
during a terrible winter storm crossed the river with 2400 troops 
200 horses and 18 cannon to surprise britishhired hessian soldiers 
in 1776 for a victory in trenton that some consider a turning point 
in the war for american independence 
he had a miserable night said gallagher 60 who was 
portraying washington for the fourth time 
gallagher went across with 120 men in four boats and did it in 25 
minutes despite a low river that forced cautious rowers to be wary 
of rocks protruding from the river bed the real washington took 
more than nine hours to get his men and equipment across 
it was really exciting to see such a crowd gallagher said 
when its colder there are a lot less people but the weather was 
just beautiful and it made the crossing fabulous

it has been a deadly year for southern 
california money messengers 13 armored car holdups three possibly 
related bank robberies two slayings and the theft of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars 
the fatal shooting of an armored car guard during a stop at a 
supermarket dec 15 was the latest in the rash of heists that have 
often occurred during busy daytime hours and frequently ended in 
gunfire

its for very few minutes until your next stop said nick 
scarpelli a guard who quit after a friend at armored transport of 
california was slain in october 
the crimes began dec 18 1987 and have involved 13 armored 
cars a bank and two savings and loans in los angeles riverside and 
ventura counties three police departments two sheriffs 
departments and the fbi are investigating 
the amount stolen in every robbery has not been revealed but los 
angeles police detective norman roberge said the total is in the 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in one theft two gunmen held up a 
guard leaving a universal city theater and took 166000 
there have been sporadic robberies in recent years past but 
none where its as organized as this i mean a rash of armored car 
robberies in what appears to be a small nucleus of individuals 
roberge said wednesday 
were looking at them with possibly the same suspects being 
involved in some of these robberies he said were also looking 
at avenues where some of these robberies may have been committed by 
some imitators 
two men have been arrested for investigation of a june robbery at 
a supermarket in los angeles and 29yearold steven bernard young 
was arrested and booked friday for investigation of robbery in the 
armored car probe police said a brief police statement issued 
sunday said young was one of the main suspects in some of the 
heists but gave no details

presence of bystanders police said

the san fernando valley on oct 14 patrick rooney 35 was killed 
at midmorning as he picked up cash at a supermarket in suburban

killing roberge said it was uncalled for 
joel curnutt director of operations for armored transport of 
california said the company had no comment while the robberies were 
under investigation 
scarpelli said he quit two days after tecson was slain and he 
said about 20 other guards have also either quit or given notice 
my family couldnt take it anymore said scarpelli he said 
each armored car should have a crew of three so that the one 
carrying money bags can be covered by an unencumbered guard leaving 
a third man to stay in the truck

temporary loss of a huge oilstorage 
vessel damaged in a north sea storm could halt production for months 
at three oilfields in the region a shell uk official said sunday 
at current prices of 15 per 42gallon barrel the estimated 
combined daily output of 210000 barrels is worth 315 million it 
represents 10 percent to 12 percent of britains north sea 
production 
the modified tanker contained 100000 tons of oil when it broke 
free in high seas and 60 mph winds saturday and drifted for five 
hours carrying its 34 crewmembers 13 miles and threatening 
neighboring platforms two tugboats brought the floating storage 
tank under control after five hours 
the vessel nearly a quartermile long provided storage for 
200000 tons of crude it acted as a central loading point for the 
output of the fulmar and auk fields operated by shell and the 
clyde field operated by britoil now part of british petroleum co 
ltd 
a shell spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said a 
remotecontrolled videoequipped submarine inspected the vessels 
damaged loading system sunday he said production will be halted for 
weeks possibly months 
the rigs must stop pumping because they have no place to store 
their oil 
north sea oil production was already running 10 percent below 
potential because of the loss caused by the piper alpha disaster 
that oil rig owned by occidental petroleum corp caught fire 
and exploded july 6 killing 167 men the rig was destroyed and the 
wells plugged with cement 
shell said saturdays shutdown will have an impact on the company

for the first time in 20 years the united 
states has chosen a career diplomat as un ambassador rather than a 
highprofile political appointee 
as presidentelect george bush has moved away from the kind of 
appointments that gave the un post to daniel patrick moynihan 
andrew young jeane kirkpatrick and bush himself all members of 
the presidents cabinet 
on dec 7 bush named thomas pickering the us ambassador to 
israel to replace vernon a walters a former deputy director of 
the cia 
some former ambassadors made it clear they reported to the 
president himself not the state department but pickering unlike 
his predecessors will not be in the cabinet and will report to the 
assistant secretary of state for international organizations 
bushs said his choice symbolizes the importance i place on the 
united nations as well as the foreign service 
pickering is the first career diplomat to get the posting since 
charles yost was appointed in 1969 they are the only two career 
officers to hold the position since it was established 43 years ago 
ambassadors have included henry cabot lodge adlai stevenson 
arthur goldberg george ball john scali and william scranton 
although usun relations have been strained during the 
eightyear reagan administration bush has said the global situation 
makes the un a more positive arena for constructive us action 
than it has been in recent years offering greater opportunity for 
vigorous us leadership in dealing with critical global problems 
the choice of pickering reflects the new importance the united 
states accords the 159member organization which this year scored 
successes from afghanistan to the persian gulf to southern africa 
us relations with the united nations evolved from a love affair 
to estrangement in the 1960s and 70s when the soviet bloc and 
developing nations united to denounce the imperialist west 
today however is an era of good feelings respect for the world 
body and no more namecalling improved ussoviet ties make the 
united nations an increasingly effective vehicle for tackling 
international problems 
pickering 57 has served as ambassador in jordan and his 
experience gives him extra credibility on the middle east issue 
which figures prominently on the un agenda 
the cabinet status for un ambassador originated with lodge a 
former presidential candidate who served from 1953 to 1960 since 
then no un envoy except yost settled for less in prestige 
salary and access to the president 
but few observers see pickerings posting as a downgrading of the 
position 
ed luck president of the un association of the united states 
a proun group said it signifies a return to normalcy and a 
commitment to use the united nations to carry out foreign policy 
objectives 
he wont just give speeches defending our honor and 
principles he told the associated press 
in the past he said there frequently has been some tension 
between the un envoy and the administration state department or 
congress 
ms kirkpatrick was known for her combative speeches which 
frequently pointed out the hypocrisy of some totalitarian regimes 
criticizing the united states 
mark franz policy analyst at the conservative heritage 
foundation which frequently criticizes the world body said 
pickerings appointment shows that mr bush will be in charge 
un policy will not be made by an individual charismatic person

the first time in a century sunday prompting authorities to 
evacuate about 2000 people 
flor verdugo a school teacher in malalcahuello who owns the only 
telephone in the town said the lonquimay volcano began to erupt 
about 415 pm 215 pm est after the area was rocked by three 
strong earthquakes according to state television in santiago 
there were no reports of injuries from the eruption or the 
quakes temblors can often precede volcanic activity 
the governments national emergency office said the evacuation of 
virtually the entire population of malalcahuello was only a 
precaution and that the town about 415 miles south of santiago was 
not considered in danger 
the government said three craters opened on the 8400foot 
volcano two of them emitting only heavy smoke however the largest 
crater with a radius of about 100 feet spewed a thick carpet of 
lava 
ms verdugo said a number of quakes have been felt in the area 
for several days the seismic activity which has affected an area 
of about 30 square miles became more intense sunday morning she 
said there were no immediate richter scale readings 
pedro riffo a specialist of la frontera university in temuco 
the largest city in the area told local reporters the eruption did 
not threaten any populated area he said malalcahuello the closest 
town is surrounded by a chain of mountains that would serve as a 
natural defense 
riffo said three other volcanoes exist in the area but only one 
of them the llaima has shown some activity in recent years 
the last registered eruption of the lonquimay volcano occurred in 
1889 riffo said

custody 
a nayarit state judicial official reached by the associated press 
on sunday confirmed the men are now dead and said he did not know 
how they could have died after being arrested 
officials at the prison at tepic the state capital about 500 
miles northwest of mexico city said the death toll during the 
twoday uprising was 23 with 19 of the deaths occurring friday 
night during two assaults by police 
but a videotape shot by an nbc news camera crew and reviewed by 
the associated press indicates there was only one assault and shows 
at least 13 prisoners alive flat on the ground being questioned by 
police 
five can be heard giving their names those names are on a list 
of dead given to the associated press on saturday by an official 
spokesman 
a woman who had been held hostage told the ap in a telephone 
interview sunday that she was freed hours before what officials said 
was the final gunsblazing assault 
they the prisoners surrendered said brenda margarita rubio 
gonzalez a prison records clerk 
one witness told the ap that gunfire was heard inside the prison 
after prisoners and then commandos went back inside the prison 
i dont know what to say said ernesto medina assistant 
director of criminal investigations when asked about the videotape 
on sunday i dont know anything about that 
medina said he could not explain how the men could have died 
after they were interrogated he said that he had gone to the prison 
at 11 pm friday night and the prisoners were already dead when he 
got there 
efforts to reach other state and federal officials by telephone 
for comment were unsuccessful on sunday christmas day 
the uprising began thursday with a mutiny by prisoners angry that 
they had been denied pardons the prison warden was fatally wounded 
at that time officials said 
the venustiano carranza prison was surrounded and two special 
police teams the fox and scorpion squads were flown in from mexico 
city 
according to the official version of events friday night the 
commander of the fox squad jorge armando duarte badillo was shot 
to death by the mutinous prisoners while he was trying to talk them 
into surrendering 
officials said the commando teams then launched an assault at 
about 6 pm friday that was repulsed and finally launched another 
attack at 11 pm friday night that retook the prison administration 
area and freed 19 hostages 
however nbc producer oscar i delgado said a network camera crew 
videotaped prisoners in custody at about 830 pm on friday the 
prisoners had been brought into a park outside the prison delgado 
said 
questioned on sunday medina told the associated press that there 
was only one assault but it lasted a long time 
the death toll was initially given friday night as six but on 
saturday morning jumped to 22 then 24 with six listed as seriously 
injured 
the official death toll is now set at 23 medina said sunday 
including the warden the police commander and 21 prisoners 
the videotape reviewed by the ap lasts a little over two minutes 
at least 13 prisoners can be seen lying on the ground surrounded by 
police as officials move among them taking down their names 
although some of their clothing is ripped and at least two of the 
prisoners appeared to have been wounded one had a bloody hand and 
another a bloody face all were alive lifting their heads to gaze 
at the camera or answering questions from police 
sometimes a police officer can be heard kicking or poking a 
prisoner asking for a name or confirmation of a name as it is 
written down at one point a police official tries to halt the 
taping putting a hand over the camera 
five prisoners can be heard giving their names benjamin gambero 
anzaldo jose luis parra leyva arturo torres casillas ricardo 
hermosillo guzman and enedino de la cruz simon 
all five are on a list of dead provided saturday to the 
associated press by state spokesman francisco flores and confirmed 
on sunday by medina 
a witness to the events at the prison who spoke on condition his 
name not be used said the prisoners were taken back into the 
prison this witness said that members of the fox group reentered 
the prison at 1000 pm and that shortly thereafter more than 30 
shots were heard 
medina said sunday that authorities were still questioning four 
prisoners and three guards suspected of helping stage the riot they 
also were searching for two men who reportedly smuggled guns into 
the prison by posing as lawyers 
the prisons other 1200 inmates remained under control 
throughout the uprising

for the third time in five years 
volunteers spent christmas cleaning oilsoaked birds in western 
washington as the death toll of birds from a 70000gallon oil spill 
continued to climb 
workers had recovered 570 live birds and more than 200 dead birds 
by sunday evening said pam miller a state biologist in charge of 
the search and rescue effort the live birds were kept in cardboard 
boxes spread throughout a schools gymnasium locker rooms and 
hallways 
the birds mostly openocean birds such as murres were tubefed 
twice a day with smelt and it could be days or weeks until they can 
be returned to the wild ms miller said most were pretty well 
coated with oil from head to toe when they arrived she said 
the birds were picked up by search crews covering a 30 to 
40mile section of the washington coast following an oil spill that 
occurred after a tugboat struck the fueloil barge it was towing to 
grays harbor on thursday 
an emergency patch could not be placed on the barge until early 
saturday because of high seas the barge was taken to astoria ore 
on saturday but not before spewing a 30mile long oil slick on 
sunday it was moved to portland ore for further repairs 
about 50 volunteers worked on the bird cleanup on sunday at the 
makeshift bird hospital noisy with the sounds of squawking birds 
tapping on their boxes it took about an hour for each bird to be 
cleaned by a pair of volunteers 
oil ruins the insulating effect of a birds feathers which can 
cause it to die of cold ms miller said the bird can also be 
poisoned if it ingests oil while it cleans its feathers she said 
the search for birds will resume monday she said 
a department of ecology spokesman said earlier that oil came 
ashore along a threemile stretch of beach from the entrance to 
grays harbor northward to ocean shores 
there are two remaining strips of oil between five and 15 miles 
offshore but officials expect the oil to break up or sink and not 
come to shore said wildlife department spokesman doug zimmer 
the biggest known spill in washington state waters was when 
239000 gallons of oil spewed from the tanker arco anchorage in port 
angeles harbor dec 21 1985 bird losses were conservatively put at 
1600 marine fowl and 475 ducks 
there was also an oil spill in puget sound in 1984 that kept 
volunteers cleaning birds over christmas said ron holcomb 
department of ecology spokesman 
in the most recent spill sause bros ocean towing of coos bay 
ore the barges owner hired a company to begin cleanup operations 
saturday dick lauer manager of bulk products for sause bros said 
sunday that he had no cleanup cost estimate and did not expect to 
get one before late monday
