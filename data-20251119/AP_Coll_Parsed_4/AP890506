a former russian language specialist for the air 
force 34yearold was arrested friday on espionage charges accused 
of trying to give us military secrets to the soviet union 
ronald craig wolf 34 was arrested without incident by the fbi 
on a warrant charging him with gathering or delivering defense 
information to aid a foreign government authorities said 
he was being held at lew sterrett justice center and was to 
appear before a us magistrate officials said if convicted wolf 
could face life imprisonment 
the fbi said wolf formerly a russian specialist for the air 
force never actually made contact with anyone from the soviet 
union but believed he was doing so when he handed over classified 
materials to an undercover agent 
wolf who worked occasionally as an automobile salesman was 
unemployed and living in a dallas rooming house at the time of his 
arrest the fbi said 
as a specialist who monitored and transcribed sensitive 
communications wolf had been granted a top secret clearance 
that gave him access to classified air force documents and 
programs vital to the defense of the united states according to 
an affidavit by fbi special agent james w evans 
wolf was discharged from the air force in 1981 upon a 
recommendation from superiors that he was financially irresponsible 
in march wolf contacted someone he believed was a soviet 
undercover agent but was actually an undercover fbi agent 
officials said over the course of five conversations wolf 
allegedly discussed his military background and made it clear that 
he would sell military secrets and also wanted to defect 
according to the fbi his motivation was not only money but 
also to get revenge for his treatment by the united states 
government 
he later sent two letters containing material to a post office 
box in maryland the fbi said the material was later determined by 
air force investigators to be sensitive information about air force 
operations and programs

a crowd of about 1000 opponents 
of indian spearfishing treaty rights gathered friday night and more 
than 100 were arrested after protesters surged across a police line 
police used vans and a school bus to haul those arrest away from 
a boat landing at trout lake just hours after a federal judge 
refused to order the chippewa indians to stop their spearfishing 
a crowd mainly protesters but including some treatyrights 
supporters gathered on the eve of the states general 
hookandline sports fishing season opener 
at about 815 pm a group of protesters many of them waving 
american flags and some shouting equal rights crossed the 
police line 
the spearfishing supporters who were not involved in the 
activities that led to the arrests appeared at the boat landing to 
show support for the chippewa who exercising fishing rights 
retained in 19th century treaties in which the tribe gave up its 
title to the northern part of wisconsin 
the protest came after us district judge barbara crabb refused 
friday to grant a state request for an order to halt the spearing 
before sport anglers open their season saturday 
state officials made the request because of concerns about the 
ability of police to maintain public safety because of the tensions 
over the traditional chippewa fishing 
tribal members have faced crowds of hundreds of protesters some 
shouting racial slurs and throwing rocks during the spearing 
season that began april 23 there had been more than 100 arrests 
before fridays 
this is the fifth year wisconsins six chippewa bands have 
speared walleye from northern wisconsin lakes since a federal court 
ruled the tribe retained the rights to hunt fish and gather wild 
grain under 19th century treaties that ceded land to the united 
states 
tensions over the spring spearfishing have increased each year 
they have heightened this year after the state reduced the 
sportfishing walleye catch limit on the 254 lakes the tribe has 
targeted for possible spearing

the foreman of the oliver north jury says the 
jurors were caught in a war between the democrats and the 
republicans and should have received the testimony of president 
bush and former president reagan 
nevertheless i think it was a fair trial denise anderson 
34 told reporters at a news conference in her living room friday 
24 hours after the jury convicted north of three irancontra 
charges and acquitted him of nine others 
asked whether the trial was fair even though reagan was not 
called to testify about the events that shook his second white 
house term ms anderson said it was fair to a certain degree 
i feel as though reagan and i could go on to elaborate on who 
else should have been down there she said 
she did not elaborate on who else but when asked if she 
included bush she replied im not leaving him out 
asked if she would like to have heard reagans testimony ms 
anderson said yes because he knew a lot about what was going 
on 
both bush and reagan have said they told investigators all they 
knew about the irancontra scandal which occurred while reagan was 
president and bush vice president 
the defense subpoenaed both of them to testify but judge 
gerhardt gesell quashed the subpoena he cited court precedents 
against requiring the testimony of a sitting president and said 
the defense had not shown that reagans testimony was needed 
documents in the trial suggested a bigger role for bush than 
revealed earlier concerning the solicitation of other countries 
support for the contra rebels in nicaragua at a time when us 
military aid for them was banned by law but bush who visited 
honduras president in early 1985 declared thursday the meeting 
had not been part of any deal to provide honduras with expedited 
us aid in return for help for the rebels 
asked whether the trial was worth the money it cost the jury 
foreman said i think in a way it was a waste of taxpayers 
money i think it was a war going on right here in our congress i 
see it as a war between the democrats and the republicans 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater turned away 
questions about a pardon for north saying he asked bush about it 
and the president replied i havent discussed it with anybody 
fitzwater said bush preferred not to have any comment at this 
time on the verdicts 
north said thursday he would appeal 
earl f williams 65 an unemployed former security guard who 
served on the jury expressed sympathy for north an exmarine who 
served as a national security council aide in the reagan white 
house 
i think in my heart that he thought he was doing the right 
thing williams said and i think there were people higher who 
gave him authority to do a lot of things and then when he got 
caught out there high and dry no one came to help him 
ms anderson a clerical worker at a hospital said none of the 
jurors favored convicting north on all counts because they the 
prosecution didnt have the proof and the facts to back it up 
but she said she believed north should do some time in prison 
for the counts he was convicted of 
north faces a maximum of 10 years plus a fine of up to 750000 
gesell said he would pass sentence on june 23 
asked if she was impressed with the testimony of norths 
secretary fawn hall who broke down in tears as she defended her 
former boss ms anderson said no at all 
all that crying she did down there shes just trying to 
get a piece of the action the jury foreman said 
juror tara king 35 said in interviews that she had been using 
cocaine until three or four months before the trial but she 
said it did not affect her work as a juror king said she did not 
tell the trial judge about her previous use of drugs because he 
didnt ask me

the nuclear regulatory commissions muted 
response to revelations of silenceformoney deals between 
nuclear plant builders and workers is fueling a drive on capitol 
hill to replace the commission with a new agency 
sen john breaux dla plans to introduce a bill next week 
that would dissolve the nrc and create a nuclear safety agency 
breaux aide bob mann said friday 
unlike the fivemember commission the new agency would be 
headed by a single administrator it also would have an independent 
board to investigate reactor safety problems 
its a long overdue change said john ahearne an nrc member 
for five years and its chairman from 197981 
a similar bill in the last congress easily passed the senate but 
died in the house 
at a hearing thursday on the silenceformoney issue breaux 
said the commissions inability to agree on the legality and 
acceptability of such deals was clear evidence that it should be 
abolished in the best interests of the industry 
the commission fails to send coherent and timely 
regulatory signals to the nuclear industry and the public breaux 
said this must be changed 
breaux slammed the commission for not publicly disavowing an 
agreement signed by brown amp root the builder of the comanche peak 
nuclear plant in texas and a former electrician who claims he was 
dismissed for questioning plant safety the worker was paid 
15000 plus 20000 for his attorneys in exchange for agreeing 
to drop his complaints and not testify at nrc licensing hearings 
breaux said his subcommittee had evidence at least one other 
such agreement existed between a builder and a worker he said even 
if these deals were legal they hurt the nuclear industry by giving 
at least the appearance of bribery 
lando w zech jr the nrc chairman said commission members 
disagreed on the legality of such arrangements and the commission 
intended to study the matter further 
sen alan simpson rwyo said it already was clear the nrc had 
outlived its usefulness 
it doesnt work it never has and we had better jettison it 
simpson said 
the main beefs against the commission are that it is slow to act 
and that its members are too cozy with the utilities whose plants 
must be licensed by the nrc 
when the nrc was created in 1974 as part of legislation that 
abolished the atomic energy commission the purpose was to separate 
the regulators from those in government who were promoting the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy critics in recent years have said 
the nrc is too vulnerable to promotional influences 
a 1984 report by the nonprofit union of concerned scientists 
assessing the nrcs first decade said its lack of skepticism about 
the nuclear industry had blinded the agency to fundamental safety 
defects that hurt the industry and consumers 
plans to replace the nrc with an agency headed by a single 
administrator along the lines of the environmental protection 
agency have been proposed but died many times in the past the 
nuclear utility companies have opposed the legislation 
mann said breauxs bill cosponsored by simpson will include 
these main provisions 
abolish the commission and establish the nuclear safety agency 
headed by an administrator appointed by the president and subject 
to confirmation by the senate 
create an office of inspector general headed by a presidential 
appointee to investigate allegations of wrongdoing within the 
agency a separate office of investigations would probe possible 
wrongdoing at nuclear plants 
create a safety investigations board to conduct independent 
investigations of significant safety problems at licensed nuclear 
facilities

five companies have sold wheat to the soviet 
union under the new subsidized grain deal announced by president 
bush 
in all the agriculture department is expected to approve 
subsidies on 15 million metric tons of wheat destined to the 
soviet union the first 300000 tons were announced on friday 
christopher e goldthwait acting general sales manager for the 
departments foreign agricultural service said the sales by five 
exporting companies call for shipment later this month 
goldthwait said the subsidies averaged 846 per ton or about 
23 cents per bushel of wheat the total for the 300000 tons would 
be about 25 million 
the soviet union had bought more than 4 million tons of us 
wheat for 198889 delivery at prices subsidized under the 
departments export enhancement program or eep but the previous 
authorization had virtually run out with the last sale march 13 
bush under pressure from usda and farmstate members of 
congress announced a new authorization on may 2 of 15 million 
tons half of what had been sought however according to wheat 
people and others the soviets agreed to buy an additional 15 
million tons of wheat later in the summer at regular market prices 
members of congress want the bush administration including the 
office of management and budget to clarify the role of the subsidy 
program and to explain why there has been a slowdown in new 
authorizations 
in addition to the wheat usda said the soviet union bought an 
additional 200000 tons of corn for delivery during the current 
marketing year which runs through sept 30 
the latest sales brought to a record 191 million tons the total 
corn and wheat sales to the soviet union for delivery this year 
under terms of the longterm supply agreement between the two 
countries the old mark of 186 million tons shipped to the soviets 
was reached in 198485 
corn which is not subsidized makes up almost 15 million tons 
of the current total with wheat at 413 million tons in addition 
the soviets have bought 450000 tons of soybeans 137 million tons 
of soybean meal and 757400 tons of grain sorghum 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 300000 tons of 
wheat would be about 11 million bushels and the 200000 tons of 
corn about 79 million bushels 
wheat prices have been averaging about 415 per bushel at the 
farm level according to the latest usda fiveday average meaning 
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around 46 million 
the corn sale at around 256 per bushel would have a current 
farm value of 20 million 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition 
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
goldthwait said the new subsidized wheat sales were handled by 
ferruzzi usa inc 50000 tons central states enterprises inc 
50000 peavey co 120000 union equity exchange 50000 and 
richco grain ltd 30000 
the identities of firms selling corn or other commodities not 
awarded usda subsidies are not disclosed

secretary of state james a baker iii will 
propose to the soviet union next week in moscow that the 
superpowers reopen negotiations in june to sharply reduce strategic 
nuclear weapons us officials said 
baker will suggest the geneva talks basically pick up where they 
left off in november when they were recessed with about 90 percent 
of the work completed on a treaty to reduce us and soviet 
arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent 
but baker does not intend to outline to the soviets the position 
the united states will take on specific issues at the bargaining 
table said the officials who spoke friday on condition of 
anonymity 
essentially we are looking for continuity and keeping arms 
control on a fast track an official said 
the negotiations had been tentatively scheduled to resume in 
midfebruary but president bush after taking office in january 
ordered an indefinite postponement while the administration 
reviewed us arms control and weapons policies 
the proposal to resume talks the third week in june and a 
decision to try to maintain the momentum that produced agreement on 
some weapons ceilings resulted from the review 
the negotiators have some tough problems to grapple with 
though among the unsettled issues are whether to try to restrict 
mobile missiles and how to verify such elusive weapons as cruise 
missiles fired from airplanes and submarines 
meanwhile a senior aide to baker said the administration had 
ruled out any deal with the soviets to impose a coalition 
government in afghanistan 
the official briefing reporters on the may 1011 talks said 
the united states had neither the inclination nor the power to 
persuade the afghan rebels to strike a deal with president 
najibullah 
calling for the sovietbacked leaders ouster the official 
said we do not believe we will have peace in afghanistan as 
long as najibullah is in power

the bush administration has met with the big 
three automakers to discuss legislation that would help bring about 
commercial production of vehicles that burn methanol and other 
gasoline substitutes 
the head of the environmental protection agencys clean air 
programs william g rosenberg discussed possible legislation in 
late april with the big three automakers 
were giving it serious consideration epa spokesman david 
cohen said friday he said the administration considers the 
technology new and exciting 
the proposals if adopted would be included in president bushs 
draft of broad revisions to the clean air act cohen said 
cohen said that rosenberg in meetings with the automakers 
outlined the benefits of methanol to the environment the 
alcoholbased fuel has been presented as a means of cutting 
emissions of gases that cause smog as well as a way of reducing 
us dependence on foreign oil 
inevitably the point was made that if alternative fuels prove 
to be as effective in terms of their environmental benefits as we 
think they may be it will relieve a bit of the pressure to explore 
other control options cohen said 
the discussions were general and focused only on environmental 
benefits of alternative fuels cohen said 
there has never been any talk about specific emissions 
equipment or reductions cohen said there has never been any 
talk of a time frame 
rosenberg discussed alternate fuels with executives of general 
motors corp ford motor co chrysler corp and the motor vehicle 
manufacturers association a trade group representing the us 
makers cohen said 
gm through spokesman john anderson said the discussions were 
routine part of the normal process of helping policymakers make 
informed decisions 
were not negotiating anderson said were exchanging 
information 
there was no immediate comment friday from ford and chrysler 
the auto industry has been working on alternative fuels 
technology for years but prospects for commercial production have 
been clouded by the lack of a national distribution system for 
methanol and concerns about poor performance and other barriers to 
customer acceptance 
the three major us automakers have produced prototypes of cars 
that can run on a mixture composed mainly of methanol and some of 
the vehicles are capable of switching from methanol to pure 
gasoline

the defense department is standing firm in its 
decision to cancel the v22 osprey weapon program and is warning 
the two companies working on the project to honor their current 
contract 
the two companies in turn said friday they had decided against 
laying off employees and promised they would keep working with 
sympathetic members of congress to win more money for the 
tiltrotor aircraft 
the current contract with bell helicopter textron inc and the 
boeing helicopter co expires sept 30 the end of fiscal year 1989 
we expect them to honor their commitments said lt cmdr 
jim kudla a pentagon spokesman our position on this program has 
not changed 
the two companies had warned the pentagon they considered friday 
the deadline for receiving a commitment of additional federal 
dollars 
but a bell spokesman terry arnold announced late in the day 
the two companies had suspended their threat of layoffs for the 
moment 
pleased with strong bipartisan congressional support for the 
v22 program bellboeing officials said today theyre continuing 
to meet with senior defense department management seeking their 
support for the osprey tiltrotor program arnold said 
bellboeing has reached no decision on a future course of 
action at this time we are continuing to work on the program 
another company official who asked not to be named told the 
associated press the contractors were still hopeful of getting more 
money from the pentagon 
defense secretary dick cheney in fashioning a fiscal 1990 
military budget to honor a white housecongress budget compromise 
last week announced 10 billion in cuts to the original spending 
plan of the reagan administration 
in making those cuts cheney ordered the osprey program canceled 
outright saying the pentagon simply couldnt afford the plane and 
that the marine corps could do just as well by ordering additional 
and cheaper helicopters 
the pentagon had planned to spend 259 billion on 663 ospreys 
including 13 billion in 1990 the department has already invested 
2 billion in the program over a nineyear period 
one senior defense official who likewise insisted on anonymity 
declared the decision has been made that theres not going to be 
any more money 
the v22 osprey described by the marine corps as its most 
important weapon program is a revolutionary aircraft designed to 
take off like a helicopter and fly like an airplane to do this it 
utilizes special propellers at the tip of each wing that can swivel 
upward and back 
the marine corps wants to use the planes to improve its ability 
to conduct surprise longrange amphibious assaults the first of 
the planes just recently began flight tests in texas 
the problem facing bellboeing is that the contractors already 
have received all the pentagon money due them under their fiscal 
1989 development contract and are experiencing overruns thus in 
order to continue work on a program that cheney has vowed to kill 
on oct 1 the companies would have to sink their own money into 
the project for the next five months 
the pentagon has estimated the overruns at roughly 25 million a 
month

charges of fraud and us meddling 
have replaced panamas social and economic problems as the main 
issues in sundays presidential election 
a threeparty coalition hoping to unseat the government and its 
de facto leader gen manuel antonio noriega claims a substantial 
lead in polls but charges the government plans to steal the 
election 
the strongly antiamerican government has trumpeted reports that 
the cia funneled 10 million to the opposition campaign washington 
declines to comment on the reports which the opposition denies 
noriega is not a candidate but the election is seen as a 
referendum on his rule since he assumed control of panamas defense 
forces in 1985 
voters cast ballots sunday for a president two vice presidents 
67 legislators and hundreds of local officers 
a recent poll by the civil opposition alliance gave its own 
presidential candidate guillermo endara a lead of 58 percent to 
26 percent for governmentbacked carlos duque 
the information we have is that the government polls show them 
to be worse off than ours do said willy cochez vice president 
of the alliances christian democratic party 
the government has not published its polls 
cochez said alliance supporters have discovered attempts to rig 
the election 
we have detected about 60000 cedulas voter identification 
cards with the same numbers but different names on them cochez 
said in an interview between 150000 and 200000 cards were 
duplicated meaning hundreds of thousands of the 11 million 
registered voters can vote more than once he claimed 
cochez also said progovernment activists are visiting houses 
that display opposition symbols and offering to buy voters cards 
there may be five people who can vote in the house and they 
are offered 50 each if the family is poor it might not ever see 
that much money at one time again what is this person to do 
cochez asked 
government officials frequently told opposition voters seeking 
cards that the camera for identification photographs was broken or 
that there was no film said cochez all lies he added 
the us government also predicts fraud american officials are 
discussing not who will win but what they should do in the face of 
the expected vote manipulation 
the polls are so bad that noriega will have to steal it big 
time said rep pat schroeder dcolo 
noriega was indicted by two federal grand juries in miami last 
year on drugtrafficking charges charges he denies thenpresident 
eric arturo delvalle tried to fire him but was ousted himself by 
noriega 
the united states has frozen 140 million in panamanian bank 
deposits and canal payments hobbling the banking industry and 
leaving the government illequipped to meet payrolls or fund basic 
social programs 
such sanctions hit hard in a country where one in every eight 
workers has a government job and the government relies heavily on 
the poor and the public sector for support 
government officials say the election will be clean and legal 
but acknowledged sunday that was not always the case 
we must not repeat the phenomenon of the elections of 
1984 in which the national tabulation board in a sad omissconsequences 
could be described as deadly to the image of the 
electoral tribunal tribunal president yolanda pulice de 
rodriguez said sunday 
he was referring to the victory of nicolas ardito barletta 
in 1984 after the government stopped the vote count 
progovernment newspapers have played heavily on reports of the 
alleged 10 million cia donation to the opposition which has 
access to some radio stations but whose press noriega closed more 
than a year ago 
the 10 million is only the part that we know about acting 
president manuel solis palma told a cheering crowd in the atlantic 
coastal city of colon last week we have information that it 
could be more 
guillermo ford one of two opposition vice presidential 
candidates retorted we dont need money from anybody to run our 
campaign 
the reports gave some credence to government charges that the 
united states wants to reduce panama to a colony invade militarily 
and renege on the 1977 panama canal treaties which give panama 
control of the canal in 2000 
for the government the charges could not have come at a better 
time enlivening a dull campaign but many panamanians say the 
election will not solve their countrys problems noriega has 
survived everything the opposition and the united states have been 
able to throw at him 
it doesnt matter who wins the future will remain 
uncertain said carmen black a 26yearold housewife 
people are afraid and a lot of people arent going to vote 
said 40yearold publicist sara villamonte

president bush stands behind his appointments 
of donald gregg and john negroponte to key ambassadorships despite 
questions in congress over their roles in the irancontra affair 
the white house says 
the president feels both of those nominations are very 
important to carrying out the policies of the government in the 
areas in which he has asked them to serve white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said friday he is very proud of both 
appointments and thinks they are outstanding men who should be 
confirmed 
gregg bushs national security adviser when bush was vice 
president has been nominated as ambassador to south korea 
negroponte honduran ambassador when bush was vice president has 
been tapped as the bush administrations emissary to mexico 
fitzwater said trial documents which have caused some lawmakers 
to express reservations about negroponte and gregg would not cause 
bush to back away from the nominations 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the senate foreign 
relations asia subcommittee is said to have asked secretary of 
state james a baker iii to reconsider greggs nomination because 
documents raised doubts about greggs past assertions that he did 
nothing illegal or improper in his contacts with north and other 
irancontra figures 
greggs relationship with felix rodriguez a key figure in 
norths private aid network to help the contras during the 
congressional ban on aid was a controversial topic throughout the 
irancontra investigations gregg has repeatedly bolstered bushs 
assertion that as vice president he did not know the extent of 
norths clandestine efforts 
greggs confirmation hearing is scheduled for next week 
the foreign relations committee delayed a vote on negropontes 
nomination last month after some democratic senators requested more 
time to review whether as ambassador to honduras he was involved in 
a quid pro quo arrangement to entice honduras to help the rebels 
john sununu bushs chief of staff has cited a cable from 
negroponte as proof that bush did not engage in a discussion of 
such arrangements for the contras when he met with honduran 
president roberto suazo in early 1985 
fitzwater said the appropriate congressional committees would be 
briefed on confidential cables that described bushs activities in 
that regard 
bush on thursday denied being involved in any quid pro quo 
arrangement nd denied knowing of any such effort by others in the 
administration 
documents from the north trial had bush and suazo meeting at a 
time when internal reagan administration memos suggested a plan in 
which continuing us aid to latin american countries would be 
linked to assistance for the rebels 
the document never asserted that bush discussed a quid pro quo 
arrangement with suazo but it said he explained to the hondurans 
that they were to receive a great deal more us economic and other 
aid aid the document said was part of a deal approved by 
thenpresident reagan

third world countries stand to suffer 
regardless of whether farm subsidies are eliminated says an 
international research group 
we in the north subsidize prosperous areas and send the 
subsidized food to the south at prices so low their farmers cannot 
compete said robert a pry the american director of the 
international institute of applied systems analysis 
on the other hand the higher prices that consumers pay when 
subsidies are eliminated can lead to hunger the group said 
pry was briefing staff members from congress and others on 
friday 
he said trade negotiators in geneva should consider whether 
compensation should be given to countries that will suffer 
economically as a result of lower subsidies 
he also said third world countries not taking part in the 
negotiations ought to attend the trade talks in their own interest 
wouter tims a member of the institutes council said that the 
united states would benefit from lower domestic prices for food and 
more sales abroad if subsidies were reduced 
exports of us wheat and coarse grains would dominate the 
market with a share of 90 percent by the year 2000 he was 
quoted as saying in the institutes monthly options 
the outcomes for developing countries such as kenya nigeria 
argentina and thailand are positive but for others such as 
brazil mexico egypt and possibly indonesia and india there are 
significant net losses he added 
pry said experts from his headquarters at laxenburg austria 
will go later this month to geneva where representatives of nearly 
100 countries are working on trade agreements they hope to complete 
by the end of 1990 on thursday the senate finance committee 
recommended confirmation of rufus h yerxa as the chief american 
negotiator 
major governments have agreed to reduce farm subsidies 
substantially but not to eliminate them entirely by the year 2000 
as the united states has asked 
the institute has published two volumes of a massive 
threevolume study called toward free trade in agriculture 
harvey brooks chairman of the us committee for the institute 
said it cost 4 million just to get agreement on the basic figures 
used 
the third volume to be published later this year will deal 
with hunger 
the average per capita calorie intake in the developing 
countries decreases under agricultural trade liberalization by 
western industrial countries and consequently the incidence of 
hunger increases the report said 
trade liberalization means reduction of subsidies 
so far there has been little public discussion on these 
subsidies 
national governments are spending over 120 billion per year 
subsidizing surplus production and the cost of its disposal the 
study said 
some developing countries benefit from the subsidized disposal 
of surplus cereals on the world market this however is only a 
short term gain 
low prices are a disincentive to their own producers and lead 
in the long run to an unsustainable dependence on imports as is 
the case in many parts of africa 
the group has 16 member countries including the united states 
and the soviet union

a newly released document from the trial of 
oliver north shows high us officials had intelligence reports in 
1986 spelling out the inflated prices north and richard secord were 
charging for arms sold to iran 
the threepage stipulation of evidence was unsealed friday in 
censored form as a result of a lawsuit filed by 10 news 
organizations and settled by agreement with the justice department 
the document which had been released to the jury said 
intelligence gathered in a 15month period beginning in september 
1985 provides information regarding the pricing and delivery of 
missiles and military material sold to iran and the release of 
american hostages held in lebanon 
norths lawyers used the document in their closing argument in 
an effort to show that thencia director william casey and 
thennational security adviser john poindexter knew that hawk 
missiles were aboard a november 1985 shipment sent from israel to 
iran with assistance by the cia 
north was found guilty of three felony charges thursday 
including the preparation of a false chronology for congress 
stating that no one in the government knew until january 1986 that 
missiles were in the november 1985 shipment norths defense on the 
charge was that casey and poindexter knew at the time what was 
aboard but participated in covering up that fact 
the document spelled out that the 17 recipients of the 
intelligence reports exclusively were poindexter and his 
predecessor in the job robert mcfarlane north casey defense 
secretary caspar weinberger and other senior intelligence officials 
the reports contained information about pricing of this 
material and those recipients of the reports at the cia national 
security council and the department of defense who knew the actual 
cost of this material to the dod could have known the iranians were 
being significantly overcharged the paper said 
the reports of very late november and early december 1985 
revealed that hawk missiles were shipped to iran from israel in 
connection with recovery efforts 
stillclassified reports on the intelligence were gathered by 
various methods of surveillance and show individuals 
involved including general secord the document adds north 
enlisted secord to run arms to the contras and also had the former 
air force major generalturnedbusinessman assist arms shipments to 
iran for the reagan administration 
north and secord diverted profits from the iran arms sales into 
bank accounts controlled by secord and some of the diverted money 
was funneled to the contras the diversion originally formed the 
heart of the criminal indictment against north but the us 
intelligence community refused to declassify key documents 
addressing those charges and they were dropped

despite assurances by exxon executives 
the oil company has not been paying tourismrelated losses 
attributed to the nations worst oil spill state officials and 
business operators say 
ron clarke a special assistant to gov steve cowper said there 
are wide disparities between what top exxon officials are saying 
publicly and what is happening to the claims of tourism operators 
depending on who you talk to you get different answers 
clarke said thursday 
bill tribble manager of exxons valdez claims office said the 
company gives priority to onthewater claims and that claims 
covering tourism losses on shore will be handled later 
tourism is a billiondollarayear industry in alaska many 
segments already are taking a beating from the spill which fouled 
hundreds of miles of beaches along prince william sound and the 
southern alaska coast 
sport fishing guides tour boat and bus tour operators are 
reporting a run of cancellations and a sharp decrease in the 
number of bookings they normally would be taking this time of year 
exxon agreed this week to finance a 4 million media blitz aimed 
at key markets across the country that contribute about onethird 
of the states visitors each year 
but that general assistance apparently isnt being translated to 
individual situations 
glenn williams who runs bus tours out of eagle river to homer 
seward and prince william sound said he submitted two claims 
totaling more than 30000 for tours canceled as a direct result 
of the spill 
he said his claims were rejected by exxon and he was told by a 
claims adjuster that nobody in touristrelated businesses falls 
under the reimbursement guidelines at this time 
i know theres a lot of people losing a lot of bookings 
williams said our phones just stopped ringing about three weeks 
ago 
exxon spokesman tribble insisted no such claims have been 
denied but acknowledged they havent been paid either he said the 
companys emphasis at this point is to take care of commercial 
fishermen and tour boat operators 
we havent addressed any type of offwater claims yet said 
tribble im not saying were not going to 
tourism in alaska is much bigger than me or you or this man 
with his 21day tour tribble said i dont have the authority 
to make that decision 
asked who did have the authority tribble replied i dont 
know 
clarke said he couldnt see any difference between a commercial 
fishermans claim and one from a bus tour operator like williams or 
a sport fishing guide who lost clients because of the spill 
clarke said the problem has been particularly severe in cordova 
a community almost entirely dependent on commercial fishing 
he said exxon had announced earlier thursday that it would pay 
claims only to fishermen and processors and not to main street 
businesses like restaurants grocery stores and hardware stores 
even though they are totally dependent on fishermen 
after considerable haranguing from a lot of quarters exxon 
reversed itself and said it would pay claims for those businesses 
in cordova clarke said 
he said the state has a written agreement with exxon promising 
to pay the secondary claims in cordova 
clarke said the governors office will continue to try to make 
claims officers follow the policies enunciated publicly by exxon 
executives 
when it gets right down to filing claims it is something very 
different clarke said of exxons actions theres a little 
fancy footwork going on 
clarke said the spill chill has stretched as far south as 
ketchikan where sport fishing guides have reported cancellations 
even though the oil is 700 miles to the northwest 
the lack of knowledge of alaska geography is working against 
us clarke said

the white house says president bush and west 
german chancellor helmut kohl have failed in their latest round of 
longdistance diplomacy to resolve major differences over nuclear 
weapons in europe 
bush and kohl spoke by telephone for 20 minutes friday about the 
west germans proposal to soon open eastwest talks on eliminating 
shortrange nuclear weapons in europe the white house said bush 
was unchanged in his opposition to such negotiations 
the bushkohl conversation came amid a flurry of developments on 
other foreign policy fronts in other news 
the white house announced bush will visit poland and hungary in 
july before going to the annual sevennation economic summit in 
paris to be held july 1416 he will be the first president to 
visit eastern europe since 1977 from paris bush will travel 
elsewhere in europe probably stopping in portugal and the 
netherlands 
over the objections of panama bush named a 14person 
commission to observe what he predicts will be fraudulent elections 
there sunday the observers led by rep john murtha dpa leave 
today and fly to a us air base in panama to avoid that nations 
visa requirements 
us officials said secretary of state james a baker iii will 
propose to the soviet union next week that negotiations to sharply 
reduce strategic nuclear weapons be resumed in june in geneva he 
will suggest that the talks pick up where they left off in november 
the dispute between bonn and washington on shortrange nuclear 
weapons missiles and artillery shells threatens to mar the 
harmony of a nato summit scheduled may 2930 in brussels 
the united states opposes any negotiations on grounds that nato 
needs nuclear weapons to compensate for the overwhelming 
superiority of sovietbloc tanks artillery soldiers and other 
conventional forces 
the united states posture has not changed white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said after the telephone call it does 
not appear that a basis for agreement is there but well continue 
to discuss it and see 
fitzwater said we would like to reach an agreement before the 
nato summit but if we cant its not the end of the world 
well go to the summit and well discuss it there he added 
if we dont get an agreement at the summit then well go on and 
discuss it after the summit 
the spokesman voiced sharp skepticism about peace initiatives 
proposed by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and said the 
soviets are seeking to exploit the current nato rift 
the soviets have worked assiduously to try to divide the 
alliance fitzwater said general secretary gorbachev has made 
any number of proposals trying to convince people that there is no 
longer a threat from the soviet union and we are very wary of that 
approach 
in vienna soviet and east german diplomats used fridays 
resumption of eastwest talks on conventional weapons to emphasize 
warsaw pact support for parallel talks on reducing shortrange 
nuclear weapons 
east german ambassador klausdieter ernst insisted such 
negotiations are vital to germans telling a news conference the 
shorter the range of the rockets the more dead germans 
the bush administration wants to modernize the aging arsenal of 
lance missiles clustered in western europe most of them in west 
germany 
of fridays bushkohl phone conversation fitzwater said i 
would not characterize it as moving the situation one way or 
another 
norwegian prime minister gro harlem brundtland who met with 
bush this week predicted a solution would be found at the summit 
that links cuts in conventional and shortrange nuclear arms agreed 
on by the allies last year 
speaking at the national press club brundtland said friday 
we can negotiate for lower levels both in conventional and 
shortrange weapons and i do think it is possible to reach 
common ground on that basis

the attorney for a group of hispanic fbi 
agents in a discrimination suit against the agency called a judges 
order a victory for all agents 
a federal judges ruling friday ordering changes in the way the 
fbi promotes minorities makes the bureau a better place for 
everyone regardless of ethnic origin or sex said antonio silva 
attorney for the 311 hispanic agents in the classaction suit 
the changes that have been ordered are lasting he said 
the effort is to eradicate discrimination within the fbi to make 
it a place where decisions on promotion and career advancement are 
made on merit and ability and nothing else 
us district judge lucius bunton called the fbis current 
system of promotion excessively subjective and lacking means of 
review but he decided against instituting a quota system for the 
agency and awarding the agents back pay or other monetary damages 
the case stemmed from a discrimination suit filed in 1987 by 
agent bernardo m mat perez 
ruling on damages in the suit after finding in september that 
discrimination existed bunton said the fbi can take other steps to 
make sure hispanics who make up less than 5 percent of the fbis 
9000 agents get the experience they need for career advancement 
the imposition of quotas or preferential promotion are drastic 
remedies which should be ordered only upon a showing that the 
discriminating employer has resisted less intrusive reforms 
bunton said 
bunton ordered appointment of special masters to determine 
whether individual hispanic agents in the suit were wrongfully 
denied promotions within the fbi up to 200 hispanic agents could 
be eligible for promotion under the ordered reforms 
the judge also reinforced the power of the fbis national career 
board and stripped local fbi agents in charge of the power to 
override career board decisions 
bunton acknowledged the fbi has taken significant steps to 
curb discrimination since his initial ruling against the bureau in 
september but said they were not enough 
he said that some fbi reforms already instituted while 
wellintentioned are finetuning of a system that requires more 
dramatic repair 
agent paul magallanes one of three lead plaintiffs in the case 
said friday in los angeles that the ruling will benefit all agents 
by requiring the bureau to use objective criteria for promotion 
he also said the fbi will benefit 
they were depriving themselves of the talent that hispanic 
agents offer the fbi in terms of management in terms of 
intelligence in terms of our culture said magallanes who told 
reporters he had been passed over for promotion half a dozen times 
since 1971 
the 21year fbi veteran said he and others were assigned to a 
taco circuit of assignments including lowlevel field work in 
hispanic neighborhoods and translation duties 
in a prepared statement fbi director william s sessions cited 
improvements the bureau has made in career development language 
services and equal employment opportunity programs for minorities 
and women 
we are looking with care at judge buntons ruling with an eye 
toward building further on the many improvements already undertaken 
in the fbis personnel practices sessions said

the fbi agent who sued the bureau for 
denying him promotions believes the door is open for him and other 
hispanics to advance but bernardo m mat perez concedes the 
door had to be kicked down 
we hispanics as any other american citizens have a 
contribution to make and we want to believe in the american 
system he said after a federal judge ordered changes in the 
agencys promotional system and established a procedure for 
promoting hispanics wrongly denied advancement 
all we want is an equal chance now were going to get it 
because hispanics do the same jobs as other fbi agents they 
deserve to obtain management positions the 25year veteran said 
us district judge lucius bunton after ruling in september 
that the fbi discriminated against hispanics ordered a special 
panel to be appointed to evaluate the claims of other hispanic 
agents in the classaction suit that they lost promotions 
perez the no 2 agent in el paso and the agencys 
secondhighest ranking hispanic filed suit in 1987 after a series 
of demotions and fruitless internal complaints about his treatment 
formerly agent in charge in san juan puerto rico he was dropped 
to assistant agent in charge in los angeles 
there he claimed agent in charge richard bretzing disliked him 
because he was hispanic 
when perez testified against richard miller the only fbi agent 
ever convicted of espionage bretzing accused perez of committing 
perjury and forced him to transfer to el paso a place perez says 
the fbi considers a dumping ground 
perez thinks he would have been an fbi executive assistant 
director if he had not been discriminated against i think i can 
do a lot more than ive been doing here for the past few years in 
el paso he said 
more than 300 hispanic agents eventually joined the classaction 
suit because of fridays ruling the fbi must promote perez to the 
next level in the bureau within 45 days 
additionally fbi director william s sessions must report to 
the court every 90 days on promotional decisions regarding perez 
until the agent becomes a special agent in charge or is named to a 
job with similar responsibilities 
perez said the promotion is a small one and wont affect his 
salary already at the top level 
i was not held back moneywise and that was not my 
contention he said i was not promoted within the fbi 
bunton denied any monetary damages to perez who claimed more 
than 600000 in back pay and for damages for retaliation against 
him by the fbi 
in december bunton ruled the agency had misused a federal grand 
jury subpoena to investigate perez in retaliation for filing the 
suit 
and perez said he may see more retaliation result from the 
latest ruling 
i would not be surprised if it comes he said i hope 
sessions will look upon it as a challenge his friend judge 
bunton has tried to be nonintrusive 
before he was named fbi director in 1987 sessions was a federal 
judge in the western district of texas and a colleague of bunton 
despite discrimination and retaliation perez said he does not 
blame sessions for the racial problems within the fbi 
i think he was given a bag by former director william 
webster perez said webster put this system in place

voters in texas today were choosing mayors in four 
cities three where it was expected to be no contest and in el 
paso where six candidates were vying to replace volatile 
millionaire jonathan rogers 
incumbents in dallas and fort worth were virtually assured 
reelection and a former mayor was expecting to return to the post 
in san antonio 
political observers in el paso were anticipating a runoff in the 
race for rogers seat rogers who served four twoyear terms is 
prevented by law from seeking a fifth 
city council members suzie azar and ed elsey and state rep paul 
moreno were the favorites to advance to a may 27 runoff ms azar 
has won the endorsement of the border citys two newspapers 
some candidates passed out campaign literature and shook hands 
with voters amid rushhour traffic in el paso friday the most 
vigorous activity at the end of a lowkey campaign season 
in dallas mayor annette strauss and her leading challenger 
attorney peter lesser attended cinco de mayo festivities 
a poll last week showed strauss was favored by 53 percent of 
those surveyed lesser who leads a pack of three challengers was 
next with 6 percent according to the poll for the dallas morning 
news but the poll also found 37 percent were undecided 
we think its going to be a horse race kevin kennedy a 
spokesman for lessers campaign said friday we think were 
going to surprise a lot of people theres definitely antistrauss 
people out there its going to come down to who gets their forces 
out 
in san antonio former mayor lila cockrell led a field of seven 
candidates 
the absentee turnout was really low and were trying to send 
out messages that we need to get the vote out said ms 
cockrells campaign spokeswoman stacy mcghee ms cockrell feels 
it will be a victory if there is a good turnout 
my guess is that the smaller the turnout the better it is for 
me said carl mauthe an insurance executive who is considered 
ms cockrells main opposition for the seat 
ms cockrell was mayor of the city from 1975 to 1981 preceding 
current mayor henry cisneros who decided last year against running

the roman catholic church and 
international observers led by two former us presidents urged 
panamanians to vote peacefully and asked the government to conduct 
free and fair presidential elections sunday 
about 11 million panamanians are registered to vote in an 
election that also will pick two vice presidents a 67member 
national assembly and 510 municipal council members 
relations between panama and the united states strained over 
the confrontation between the us government and strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega are the main issues in the campaign 
president bush and panamas domestic opposition have claimed the 
government plans to rig the elections to gain victory for its 
candidate carlos duque a close business associate of noriega who 
is backed by an eightparty progovernment coalition 
duques rival is guillermo endara nominated by the threeparty 
opposition coalition 
both sides have warned of possible violence following the 
election 
already the oppositions news media have been closed down by the 
government their access to radio and television outlets too is 
limited 
the winner will take office sept 1 replacing acting president 
manuel solis palma who took power after noriega engineered the 
ouster of president eric delvalle in february 1988 delvalle still 
recognized as president by the united states tried to fire noriega 
after the general was indicted on drug trafficking charges last 
year in florida 
former presidents jimmy carter and gerald ford are in panama as 
part of a delegation from the private council of freely elected 
heads of government which carter heads the council was invited by 
the panamanian government to serve as observers 
carter signed with thenpanamanian dictator gen omar torrijos 
the 1977 canal treaties that grant panama total control over the 
waterway on dec 31 1999 when the united states is to abandon its 
military installations in panama 
we come here as friends of panama to bear witness to what we 
hope will be a free and fair election carter said friday this 
election is so crucial for the people of this country and for all 
of us interested in democracy and good relations between the united 
states and panama 
the former president refused to discuss us policy when asked 
about his opinion of the economic sanctions imposed by the united 
states which include freezing panamanian government funds in the 
united states and withholding panama canal fees 
carter said he felt that democratization of panama one of the 
goals of torrijos has not been fulfilled yet free and fair 
elections provide an opportunity to move toward these goals by 
promoting national reconciliation 
carter and his delegation met with the leaders of the two 
presidential tickets friday night 
also late friday a group of young military officers led by 
capt ricardo sanchez galan went on national television to urge 
people to get out the vote 
the officers statement said panamanians should vote to avoid 
fighting between brothers and not fall victim to provocation 
meanwhile mons marcos mcgrath archbishop of panama also 
called for free and fair elections and said it was a crucial hour 
for panama that could be our last opportunity to resolve our 
differences peacefully we know how terrible it would be to seek a 
solution by force of arms by violence provoked internally or 
externally 
he asked the defense forces headed by noreiga to watch over 
the security and tranquility of the electoral process 
mcgrath is scheduled to meet carter and his delegation today in 
washington bush named an official delegation of congressmen and 
private citizens to monitor the elections but panamanian officials 
refused to recognize it 
the delegation was expected to come to howard air base a us 
installation near panama city because it would not need panamanian 
visas recently required of all visiting americans to land there 
panamanian government officials said it was not likely the us 
representatives would be allowed to visit the polling places 
the panamanian government has invited observers from latin 
america some caribbean countries and europe the opposition also 
invited a group of politicians from other countries

attorney general dick thornburgh is 
threatening to end the american bar associations role in screening 
prospective federal judges unless it agrees not to consider 
political or ideological beliefs 
the abas standing committee on federal judiciary would no 
longer screen prospective nominees unless the bar group keeps a 
commitment that it made to made to thornburgh says david runkel a 
senior aide to the attorney general 
the aba denies it made such a commitment 
as he left the justice department on friday night thornburgh 
said we expect them to honor an agreement to revert to pre1980 
language in the abas judicial screening guidelines 
the 1977 version does not contain any exception to the statement 
that political and ideological views are not considered 
subsequent versions of the guidelines contain an exception that 
such views are considered if they bear on the candidates ability 
to be a fair impartial and openminded judge 
it is this language that thornburgh and others cite as evidence 
that the aba has been using political and ideological views as 
yardsticks for a candidates fitness for the federal bench 
the aba says it never agreed to what thornburgh described in 
testimony tuesday to the house judiciary committee the dispute 
broke out that day when aba leaders took issue with thornburghs 
statement 
the justice department fired back on friday 
runkel said the screening panel would be allowed to resume its 
traditional role of helping the president screen prospective 
judicial candidates as soon as the statement made by the attorney 
general to the house judiciary committee is accepted by the 
aba runkel said 
in a statement friday night aba president robert raven 
reiterated the bar groups position that the federal judicial 
committee does not examine and make value judgments about 
candidates political or ideological views 
problems of wording and problems of perception are curable 
raven said we look forward to working out mutually acceptable 
language with the attorney general 
thorburgh replied they got our language go back to what it 
was in 1979 thats what they agreed to and we expect them to honor 
it 
the issue is especially ticklish for thornburgh because his 
choice for deputy attorney general robert b fiske jr has come 
under fire from some conservative republicans for the role he 
played chairing the standing committee from 1984 to 1987 
sen gordon humphrey rnh charges that fiske leaked the 
names of prospective nominees the panel received from the white 
house to a liberal advocacy group 
the advance information humphrey charges enabled the group to 
mount campaigns against individuals even before their candidates 
were nominated 
in apparent attempt to mollify humphrey and others thornburgh 
credited fiske with negotiating the agreement when he made his 
announcement to the house committee 
the abas involvement in judicial screening which dates back to 
the eisenhower administration has become a heated one for 
conservatives since the 1987 senate vote against confirming robert 
bork to the supreme court 
four members of the bar panel found bork unqualified and harold 
r tyler jr the panels chairman explained at the time the 
dissenters were concerned about what they regarded as borks 
comparatively extreme views on constitutional issues 
the senate judiciary committee has planned to hold hearings on 
the whole issue of the abas involvement in judicial screening 
including the ratings it announces during confirmation proceedings 
sen joseph biden ddel the panels chairman friday 
postponed the may 11 hearing so that it would not conflict with 
thornburghs schedule thornburgh is now expected to testify along 
with representatives of the aba and interest groups

within 10 years the world may be rid 
of a range of chemicals that have been part of daily life since the 
refrigerator replaced the icebox 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs are used to make foam cushions for 
car seats furniture and carpet underlays they go into styrofoam 
packaging hamburger cartons and throwaway coffee cups 
they are used in refrigerators freezers and air conditioners 
they are found in heating pumps and building insulation 
dry cleaners use cfcs computer companies rely on cfcs to clean 
tiny electronic components cfcs go into varnishes and metal 
cleaners 
the problem is that when cfcs rise 15 to 25 miles into the 
atmosphere they destroy the earths precious shield of ozone 
scientists say less ozone means more ultraviolet radiation from the 
sun streams to earth increasing skin cancer causing eye disease 
and damaging marine and plant life which treatens the food chain 
a fourday unsponsored conference on protecting the ozone 
layer ended friday it called for a worldwide ban on the production 
and use of cfcs by the end of the century even though cfcs have an 
atmospheric life of up to 100 years 
the conference also called for phasing out halons gases used in 
firefighting equipment but it gave no deadline 
in some cases the cfc ban may hardly be noticed 
in the united states for example aerosol cans using cfcs as 
propellants have been banned since 1978 except those used for 
medical needs similar measures have also been adopted by canada 
sweden norway and finland 
however 80 percent of aerosol sprays in western europe still 
contain cfcs aerosol sprays also are common in mexico and south 
america as well as in japan which produces about 10 percent of the 
worlds cfcs 
without the compounds the world may find life generally a 
little less comfortable and more expensive 
scientists reported to the conference attended by 81 nations 
and over 100 nongovernment observers on efforts to develop 
alternatives for the compounds 
we do have a lot of substitutes available said victor 
buxton of canadas ministry of environment 
but we dont have the technical options right now to 
completely eliminate cfcs that doesnt mean we might not have it 
next year or the year after said buxton 
if you ask me what is the achilles heel of this program i 
think it is refrigeration and existing equipment were not talking 
about comfort here but about preserving food supplies he said 
buxton said cfc consumption could be sharply cut immediately 
through good housekeeping such as plugging leaks in air 
conditioners and ending such frivolous uses such as making 
party streamers 
other changes could be made water could be used instead of cfcs 
to clean circuit boards on computers and metals could be washed in 
acid baths as they once were refrigeration can be done with 
ammonia or helium 
scientists are scrambling for new technologies major companies 
have joined to test a family of halogenated cfcs or hcfcs 
the new compounds dump far less ozonedamaging chlorine into the 
air but show many of the useful properties of cfcs said kevin fay 
head of the alliance for responsible cfc policy 
in theory hcfcs could be used to replace cooling liquid in 
refrigerators thus new equipment would not be needed 
fay said us industry alone has spent up to 10 billion 
researching hcfcs but he said not much is known about them yet if 
they prove inadequate he said the cfc phaseout target of 1999 
would be impossible to meet 
in addition the environmental group greenpeace opposes the use 
of hcfcs it says the atmosphere cannot absorb more chlorine even 
at a reduced rate 
the developing countries at the conference said they need help 
to develop alternative technologies and products delegates agreed 
to set up a world climate fund but they left the financing up in 
the air

president bushs personal emissary at the 
alaska oil spill told exxon to hasten its cleanup and said the 
company should put a lot more people to work scrubbing the 
oiltainted shores 
adm paul a yost jr the commandant of the coast guard and the 
ranking federal official in the oil spill zone also said friday 
that exxons may 10 deadline to have the worst of the cleanup 
completed on five islands in prince william sound may be in 
jeopardy 
a beach at smith island one of the five targeted islands is 
not yet anywhere near clean he said i cant see when it will 
be clean it may be that we have to bypass that beach for two or 
three weeks and then return to it 
contamination on the islands is of special concern to state 
officials and environmentalists who fear the annual seal pupping 
cycle may be affected 
what i said to exxon this morning is that they are going to 
have to produce a significantly greater effort the admiral said 
adding that exxon should also expand its beach cleanup to areas 
outside prince william sound 
how many people yost said im not ready to give them a 
number yet 
exxon has about 4900 people involved in the cleanup effort 
according to figures supplied by the oil company and the state 
the tanker exxon valdez struck a charted reef in the sound on 
march 24 spilling more than 10 million gallons of crude the 
captain joseph hazelwood of huntington ny has been accused of 
operating the vessel while drunk and he faces trial june 20 in 
valdez an alaska grand jury has also begun a felony investigation 
into hazelwoods role in the accident 
hazelwoods attorney said friday the fired tanker captain was 
not drunk when he left the vessel in command of his third mate 
prior to the shipwreck 
the oil has moved about 500 miles southwest of valdez fouling 
the shore at several sites including the katmai national park 
wildlife refuge 
id like to state right now for the people of alaska we dont 
have hundreds of miles of heavily impacted beaches outside of 
prince william sound yost said 
yost must approve exxons cleanup plan before it goes into 
effect but said he has not yet made a decision 
earlier this week yost criticized the revised plan which exxon 
submitted may 1 as poorly drafted and lacking in specifics the 
state also has criticized it and urged extensive changes but on 
friday he called the plan workable but it needs expansion 
some of the cleanup is difficult to the point that one wonders 
if restoration will ever be possible yost said 
restoration will probably be done by the lord in the next few 
years i dont think restoration is going to be done by exxon in 
the next few months on all of the beaches he said its not 
possible 
under exxons proposal 364 miles of coastline would be cleansed 
by sept 15 although nearly 200 of those miles may be left 
untouched to be scoured by wind and wave action the worst of the 
spill damage in prince william sound is to be cleaned by may 10 
according to the plan 
the proposal seeks to dispose of waste by burying it burning it 
or discharging it through a wastewater treatment plant in valdez 
the company has asked for permission to bypass some environmental 
laws in order to dispose of the wastes

a winery worker pleaded innocent to 
killing his wife two daughters and four others while his fellow 
inmates raised 900 for another daughter who survived the bloody 
rampage 
ramon salcido appeared glum and unshaven in a heavily guarded 
courtroom where he entered his innocent pleas on the seven murder 
counts friday 
he also pleaded innocent to three counts of attempted murder and 
denied a special circumstance allegation that could send him to the 
gas chamber 
one of the attempted murder counts is for an attack on salcidos 
3yearold daughter carmina her father allegedly slit her throat 
during the april 14 killing spree in the bucolic wine country north 
of san francisco 
concern for the little girl prompted hundreds of prisoners at 
the sonoma county jail where salcido is being kept to collect 
900 during two days of peace wednesday and thursday 
these guys dug down to every cent they literally had in their 
pockets they are going to go without cigarettes and other basic 
necessities because they want to reach out of their anger and 
despair and direct something positive to carmina said the rev 
bob gutleben 
gutleben runs covenant connection a nondenominational ministry 
to inmates and exconvicts he said 90 percent of the jails 690 
prisoners participated in the collection and the twoday pledge of 
nonviolence 
the fundraising idea came from an inmate counseling group run 
by gutleben he noted the inmates normally have an unofficial code 
calling for the maiming or killing of child murderers 
ive had enough of violence and what was done to her was pure 
evil said gabriel menjou 42 an inmate serving time for 
forgery i wanted her to know that men dont have to be mean and 
cruel but to know that they can be loving kind and caring 
sheriffs deputies have been concerned about salcidos safety 
since he was captured in mexico on april 19 he was brought back to 
the county jail the next night where a furious crowd of 200 people 
shouted kill him 
weather stripping was added to his cell door to prevent inmates 
from slipping harmful items inside authorities also put up a large 
metal plate to keep other inmates from looking into salcidos cell 
through an interior window 
when he is moved from this thirdfloor cell for showers 
exercise or court appointments all of the 50 to 60 inmates on the 
floor are locked in salcido also is under a 24hour suicide watch 
about 20 sheriffs deputies stood guard inside and outside the 
courtroom searching bags and passing metal detectors over 
spectators as they entered 
the 28yearold winery worker is charged with killing carminas 
mother and two sisters his motherinlaw and her two young 
daughters and a coworker he told detectives he believed was 
having an affair with his wife 
he also is charged with the attempted murder of carmina and of 
trying to kill another coworker and the mans wife 
salcido listened to the proceedings through a courtprovided 
interpreter but answered the judge in english saying yes your 
honor in a barely audible voice 
in addition to pleading innocent to all charges salcido also 
denied a special circumstance allegation of multiple murder which 
could bring a death sentence or life in prison without parole 
municipal court judge knoel owen scheduled a preliminary hearing 
for sept 11 and refused to lift a gag order deputy district 
attorney peter bumerts said lifting the order would almost 
certainly force a change of venue

when the 1400 soviet soldiers 
stationed in this base 42 miles from berlin pack up and move out 
they will leave with few memories of germany 
from russianlanguage films at the enlisted mens club to 
borzhomi mineral water brought in from soviet georgia the soldiers 
have lived an entirely selfcontained existence and they say 
theyve had virtually no chance to commune with the locals 
the soviets who tinkered with their freshly painted equipment in 
a carefully orchestrated show for foreign journalists friday are 
among the 50000 troops and 5000 tanks the kremlin is withdrawing 
from eastern europe in a disarmament gesture aimed at spurring 
similar concessions from nato 
the hurriedly organized tour of the base that houses the 
vislensky tank regiment comes in advance of the pullouts start on 
may 17 and appeared intended to cast the kremlin in a peacemaking 
role during an internato dispute over the pace and course of 
disarmament 
but the visit for 118 journalists offered a rare glimpse into 
the everyday life of soviet soldiers abroad and confirmed longheld 
beliefs that the lot of these foreignbased fighting men is one of 
isolation and monotony 
asked if enlisted men could spend their free time outside the 
concreteslab walls surrounding barracks bordered by skeletal trees 
killed by acid rain 19yearold vasily yamkovoi replied rarely 
he and others said army regulations prevent them from leaving 
the compound except for officially organized excursions to sights 
like berlins world war ii memorials 
a cocoon of soviet life is spun around the grim encampment from 
the framed photographs of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
hanging over the rows of cots to the barracks reading rooms stocked 
with communist party literature and political works by sanctioned 
soviet writers 
soldiers said they are allowed to send home two letters per week 
and mail boxes are bolted to the wall at the barracks entrance one 
for letters and the other for letters that have already been 
read 
col alexander kireyev head of the base political department 
described the second letter drop as a sort of diplomatic pouch to 
protect official communications posters adorning the walls warn 
the soldiers to guard against unwitting disclosure of military 
secrets 
the mess hall favors russian dishes like fried cabbage borsch 
and solyanka a spicy broth afloat with fatty sausage and pickled 
vegetables 
entertainment according to soldiers like oleg tarabychkin of 
kiev is a free hour to write home or a night at the base movie 
theater 
for the enlisted men its a lonely life they serve twoyear 
terms with no home leaves and their families must remain behind 
the soviet base like others abroad employs no local workers and 
the only women on the site are the wives of their commanding 
officers 
the weaponry under the control of the vislensky regiment has 
been dismissed by western officials as outmoded nato has contended 
its removal will make little difference in the balance of forces 
between east and west 
but the chief of staff for soviet forces in east germany lt 
col valery i fursin claimed the t64 tanks antiaircraft guns 
tactical missiles and other arms to be withdrawn are modern and a 
significant sacrifice 
we have always contended we have parity with the west he 
replied when asked how the reductions would affect the conventional 
weapons balance 
the cutback of soviet forces from east germany czechoslovakia 
hungary and poland was announced by gorbachev last december in a 
speech to the united nations western experts estimate the kremlin 
has 500000 soldiers in eastern europe so the withdrawal is 
expected to reduce that force by about 10 percent yet still remain 
numerically stronger than nato 
the 94 tanks stationed with the vislensky regiment were having 
their guns removed in preparation for the return to soviet 
territory on flatbed train cars that is to begin heading east on 
may 17 
fursin said more than 4000 tanks would be removed from east 
germany by the end of next year or about 40 percent of the 
number now deployed 
of the 50000 soldiers leaving the east bloc about 10000 will 
come out of east german bases he said 
political officer majgen vasily kazachenko deflected 
suggestions that the unusual base visit was aimed at scoring some 
public relations points during a dispute among nato members about 
whether the united states should open early talks on shortrange 
nuclear missiles with the kremlin 
washington would negotiate only after significant reductions in 
soviet conventional weapons while west germany where most of the 
shortrange missiles are based favors talks now

the state has taken custody of a couples 
15monthold son while the pair is investigated in the death of a 
daughter they reported abducted under circumstances mirroring 
another daughters death three years ago 
the boy might be in jeopardy police said 
robert and paula sims are the focus of the investigation in 
the death of 6weekold heather sims whose reported disappearance 
was similar to that of her sister in 1986 
we feel very strong that we will eventually make an arrest in 
this case sgt rick mccain said friday 
at this point in the investigation we have found no evidence 
of a kidnapping he said 
sims 37 was questioned for six hours thursday night at alton 
police headquarters after an autopsy confirmed that an infant found 
in a trash barrel in missouri was heather 
mrs sims was questioned for a few minutes mccain said 
the parents had never been ruled out as suspects mccain said 
because of the similarities between heathers disappearance and the 
disappearance of their firstborn daughter loralei in 1986 
their son was taken by the illinois department of children and 
family services a decision based upon information that we 
received last night that randy sims might be in jeopardy he said 
the case has dominated conversation in this town of 40000 
across the mississippi river from st louis 
mccain said investigators have found no evidence to support the 
simses claim that a masked gunman knocked out mrs sims and 
abducted the child late last saturday a near duplication of their 
report of loraleis disappearance in 1986 
no charges were filed in that case which remains unsolved 
a fisherman found heathers body wednesday night it was wrapped 
in a black plastic bag and placed in a trash barrel at a west 
alton mo recreation area along the mississippi river 
the baby died of asphyxiation mccain said the autopsy revealed 
she was killed about the time she was reported missing by her 
parents 
police searched the couples home thursday and collected hair 
and various fibers for laboratory analysis mccain said 
black plastic bags similar to one in which the infants body 
was found were confiscated and sent to the fbi crime lab in 
washington 
the couple told police that a masked gunman had approached mrs 
sims while she was taking out trash forced her back into the home 
knocked her unconscious and took the infant sims said he was at 
work at the time 
in june 1986 the simses who then lived in nearby brighton 
reported to authorities that an armed intruder barged into their 
home while sims was at work and took their 13dayold firstborn 
remains believed to be loraleis were discovered a week later 
near the couples home no one was charged

a man who disconnected his comatose son from life 
support equipment wasnt motivated by the mounting medical costs 
because the family couldnt have paid the bills anyway an attorney 
said 
the man is indigent kevin smith said of his client rudolfo 
linares the man doesnt have the means to pay anyway so there 
is no financial motivation at all in mr linares action 
the chicago tribune had reported friday that linares who is 
charged with murder unhooked his 16monthold son from the 
breathing apparatus just four days before the state was set to cut 
off medical benefits that had covered more than 100000 in medical 
costs for the child 
smith said a cutoff of public aid would not have significantly 
increased the familys already overwhelming financial burden 
adding that the hospital had picked up about 500000 worth of 
bills that were uncovered by the state and which the family was 
unable to pay 
on april 26 linares pulled out a gun in his sons hospital room 
and kept hospital staff and police at bay while samuel died in his 
arms when the boy was dead the tearful linares handed over the 
gun and the childs body 
linares 23 is free on bond 
in another development cook county medical examiner robert 
stein ruled the manner of samuel linares death undetermined 
saying friday he needs to research hospital records before making a 
final decision 
ive never come across a case where if the medical examiner 
did not determine there was a homicide you could come up with 
murder smith said 
on a section of the boys death certificate stein declared the 
immediate cause of samuels death to be a lack of oxygen to the 
brain caused by the boys choking on a balloon last summer 
it was that aug 2 1988 accident that sent the boy into the 
irreversible coma

a special prosecutor made freedom permanent 
for a man who served 21 years in the poisoning deaths of his 
children and the longtime inmate said he planned to celebrate in 
the gulf of mexico 
i want to take a swim and admire myself in the water james 
j richardson said in a telephone interview from fort walton beach 
ill go deep down in the water i will wade in it to be baptized 
again and refresh my life 
prosecutor janet reno said friday that she found reasonable 
doubt that richardson killed his children and indicated he probably 
was wrongfully accused she said the state would not put him on 
trial again 
richardson described the decision as splendid 
shes doing her job he said shes doing it like it 
should be done it should have been done 21 years ago 
the 53yearold former orange picker was released from prison 
april 25 after retired circuit judge clifton kelly accepted ms 
renos recommendation that his 1968 trial was unfair 
ms reno the dade county state attorney appointed by gov bob 
martinez as a special prosecutor found evidence of substantial 
trial errors and perjured testimony attorneys for richardson 
contended he was framed 
it is apparent after a review of all evidence obtained in the 
original investigation and the ensuing investigation that not only 
could the state not prove that james richardson was guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt but that james richarson was probably wrongfully 
accused she wrote 
she also faulted the murder investigation as totally 
inadequate and incomplete 
obvious leads were never pursued critical questions were 
never answered glaring inconsistencies were never resolved 
standard investigative procedures were never followed she said 
the only evidence linking richardson with the crime is the 
testimony of three jailhouse inmates which we find totally 
unreliable 
frank schaub who prosecuted the case in 1968 and retired in 
january lashed out at ms reno and said there is still strong 
evidence against richardson 
how about prosecuting her for dropping the case schaub 
said shes incompetent to prosecute its ridiculous i dont 
think they ever convict anybody down there in miami they have 
the most lawless community in the world 
but ms reno said it would be impossible to reopen the case 
because evidence has been lost or destroyed and some witnesses have 
died or become incapacitated 
richardson orginally was jailed on charges of poisoning all 
seven of his children to collect 14000 in life insurance but he 
stood trial in 1968 only for the slaying of his oldest 
stepdaughter 8yearold betty jean 
the children ages 2 to 8 died after eating a meal of hog 
jowls rice peas and grits tainted with the pesticide parathion 
oct 25 1967 
sworn affidavits have implicated the familys baby sitter but 
kelly said the killer will quite likely never be known 
ms reno said she was probing whether anyone involved in the 
investigation could be charged with criminal misdeeds but she 
noted that the statute of limitations could hinder any prosecution 
richardson was sentenced to death after his conviction but the 
sentences was commuted to life in prison when the us supreme 
court struck down the death penalty in 1972 
richardson has entered a diet clinic run by former comedian dick 
gregory in fort walton beach he said his celebration also would 
include trips to chicago and to the grocery store 
im looking to get a pineapple upsidedown cake what i cant 
eat im going to rub in my face he said

a former savings and loan executive has testified 
that house speaker jim wright offered to block legislation that 
could hurt thrifts in exchange for 250000 in contributions to a 
political action committee 
david r farmer was testifying friday in the trial of three 
former savings and loan executives on charges that they allegedly 
participated in what federal prosecutors say was a conspiracy by 
the thrifts to evade federal laws by channeling corporate 
contributions to political campaigns 
wright was not named in the federal indictment against the three 
defendants robert hopkins morton hopkins and john harrell who 
were charged after investigations by the dallas bank fraud task 
force 
the three are former executives of commodore savings association 
farmer former senior vice president and chief financial officer 
of commodore said he gave a 1000 donation to the east texas 
first political action committee in 1985 then was told to file a 
false expense report to get the money back 
farmer said it was understood that wright the democratic 
majority leader at the time had guaranteed that specific 
legislation unfavorable to savings and loans would be blocked from 
making it out of committee the former commodore executive did not 
cite the legislation 
in return for the contributions jim wright guaranteed the 
legislation would not get out of committee farmer said both 
john harrell and myself were amazed that as high ranking an 
individual in the congress as he wright would be involved in 
something like this 
under questioning farmer said 10 savings and loans were 
contributing a total of 250000 to the political fund 
in other testimony this week witnesses said commodore employees 
gave donations to a political action committee and were given 
raises in return 
a commodore secretary testified that some of the money donated 
to the political action committee was laundered through vernon 
savings and loan on one check the words for jim wright were 
written on the memo line she said 
calls from the associated press to wrights washington and fort 
worth texas offices went unanswered late friday night wright 
spoke in his hometown of fort worth friday to the tarrant county 
bar association and the fort worth rotary club 
the allegations against wright in the federal trial came as the 
speakers business transactions have been under fire by the house 
ethics committee

residents of this tiny town were shaken but 
no one was injured when an air force f16 jet accidentally dropped 
a 500pound bomb during a training exercise 
the device contained about 200 pounds of explosives and was as 
real as wed go to war with said col james moseby deputy 
commander for operations at moody air force base at valdosta where 
the fighter is based 
bobby foster 53 a propane gas deliverer said he was resting 
on his sofa when he heard an explosion on thursday 
i thought it was an earthquake it knocked pictures off my 
wall i ran to the door and saw smoke he said 
foster said military planes often fly low over his home and he 
had been concerned that one day a bomb might fall 
if the bomb had fallen a second later it would have been up 
there and i wouldnt be here today foster said gesturing toward 
his mobile home about onequarter mile from the bomb site 
the blast occurred while four armed jets were participating in a 
bombing exercise at fort benning near columbus officials said 
the pilot who was not identified had tried to drop the bomb 
over fort bennings kilo impact area during the exercise but the 
bomb did not release about 315 pm when the plane was circling 
back to the base for another attempt to release the bomb it 
accidentally fell said moseby 
the bomb hit a pine tree and exploded about 40 feet above the 
ground in a remote area near brantley a west georgia community of 
about 80 people trees within 100 yards of the explosion were cut 
and scarred but there was no impact on the ground 
the air force and the army are investigating the accident 
moseby said adding that the plane has been grounded as part of 
the investigation he said the jet will be taken apart and 
examined 
i dont see any pilot error that made it come off he said 
moseby said the bombing exercises are part of moodys regular 
training program and are conducted in choreographed situations 
at benning the planes avoid flying over areas with structures on 
the ground he added 
he said the air forces track record is good 
the bombs are pretty stable moseby said we dont strap 
bombs on the bottoms of airplanes that are just going to blow up 
this is one of those incidents that lowers the guarantee of 
safety from 999999 percent to 99999 
moseby said he did not know how fast the jet was traveling but 
normally a plane on such a mission would be going about 375 mph 
it was not the first time an f16 from moody has been forced to 
drop bombs in georgia capt cindy nelson a spokeswoman for the 
base said that on jan 27 an f16 dropped six bombs in lanier 
county as it prepared for an emergency landing at moody 
the bombs landed on grand bay weapons range but exploded close 
enough to some homes to blow windows out she did not know the 
sizes of those bombs

shouting racial slurs and throwing rocks since the spearing season 
began april 23 there had been more than 100 arrests before friday 
this is the fifth year wisconsins six chippewa bands have

ruled the tribe retained the rights to hunt fish and gather wild 
grain under 19th century treaties that ceded land to the united

security sources in southern lebanon said 
today they had no new leads on the whereabouts of a west german 
relief worker who was abducted two days ago 
the whole case of markus michael is a mystery said a source 
at the nasserite sunni moslem militia which is in charge of 
security in sidon 
there has been no claim of responsibility in thursdays 
incident which is believed linked to the trial of a lebanese 
hijacker in frankfurt west germany 
the 25yearold was kidnapped by five unidentified gunmen on 
sidons southern edge along with two fellow relief workers from the 
asmehumanitas agency heinrich struebig and petra schnitzler 
struebig 48 and schnitzler 26 were released friday they met 
the nasserite militias leader mustafa saad in sidon for 10 
minutes but refused to talk to the press struebig is an 
administrator and schnitzler a nurse 
the released two havent donated any significant information 
about the captors or their motives the source said he refused 
to be named 
they only said they wanted to talk to their headquarters in 
germany and to their government it seems they wanted to relay some 
information to germany the source added 
the west german embassy refused comment on the case 
in bonn west german foreign ministry spokesman hans schumacher 
noted that struebig and schnitzler had disappeared for two days in 
lebanon under similar circumstances a year ago 
he said he considered the latest 10hour disappearance a bit 
strange 
the three worked from a base between the palestinian refugee 
camps of ein elhilweh and mieh mieh on sidons eastern edge the 
sidon region 25 miles south of beirut is a plo stronghold 
lt col wajih abu ali commander of the plos military police 
in the sidon region and in charge of protecting the asmehumanitas 
base also said the two who were released have refused to cooperate 
with investigators 
they refused to give us any information about the kidnappers 
their demands if any and the place where they were held abu 
ali told reporters in mieh mieh they only said they were 
threatened 
on friday abu ali said struebig and schnitzler told him the 
kidnappers have threatened to kill michael if they divulged any 
information about the abduction 
the daily newspaper alliwaa which publishes in moslem west 
beirut said the captors wanted a lenient sentence for mohammed 
ali hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem terrorist held in frankfurt 
it cited no source for the report 
west german prosecutors have demanded a life sentence for hamadi 
for involvement in the 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner in which a 
us navy diver was shot to death and his body tossed onto the 
airport tarmac two us men were severely beaten and 37 other 
passengers were held hostage 17 days 
abu ali refused comment on the newspaper report but a deputy 
said friday the two released told him the kidnapping was linked to 
hamadi 
the source at the nasserite militia said i find it strange 
if the kidnappers want to pressure the germans then why did they 
release two german hostages 
a verdict in hamadis case is expected within two weeks 
hamadis elder brother abdulhadi heads the security apparatus 
for the iranianbacked extremist group hezbollah or party of god 
which is the umbrella organization for underground proiranian 
factions holding western captives 
in addition to michael there are 15 foreigners held in lebanon 
nine americans three britons an irishman an italian and a 
belgian 
the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985

ten governors have urged energy secretary james d watkins to 
set a national policy for cleaning up radioactive and hazardous 
waste at the nations nuclear defense plants within 30 years 
the cleanup and disposal of defense wastes has been 
deferred too long the governors said in the cover letter to a 
sevenpage report they delivered to watkins friday 
the defense waste problem is national in its scope and 
severity the letter said its resolution is a national 
obligation it must also be a national priority 
each of the governors has a doe research or defense facility in 
his state the proposal requests the setting of a firm timetable 
for cleaning up all doe sites within 30 years and creation of a 
trust fund to guarantee adequate resources to complete the job 
without a firm schedule there is no assurance that the 
critical cleanup work will be completed in a timely manner if at 
all the report said we feel that a commitment to clean up all 
facilities within 30 years is both essential and achievable 
the federal government has estimated defense waste cleanup will 
cost between 110 billion and 130 billion over the next 50 years 
less than 1 billion was authorized in the current federal budget 
mainly for waste management and temporary storage rather than 
cleanup and permanent disposal 
the competition for funds between production and cleanup 
activities must end the report said funding priorities for 
cleanup must be driven by the risks posed by waste problems and not 
the need to maintain production operations 
the paper was signed by govs ned ray mcwherter of tennessee 
richard celeste of ohio booth gardner of washington cecil andrus 
of idaho carroll campbell of south carolina garrey carruthers of 
new mexico roy romer of colorado bob miller of nevada neil

two north korean students who defected 
in poland said upon arrival today that only after viewing the seoul 
olympics on television did they see they had been lied to by their 
communist government 
we were taught to believe that north korea is the best country 
in the world to live in but once in the outside world we realized 
that we had been deceived said kim un hwak at an airport news 
conference 
kim and dong young hoon both 24 said they were surprised when 
they saw television footage in poland showing a developed south 
korea during last years summer olympics 
in north korea we had been taught to believe that south korea 
is shambles and a very poor country but it was a lie dong said 
kim and dong who defected to the west late last month through a 
european country were escorted to south korea by government 
officials 
the two said they were sorry for their families in north korea 
but they were happy to be in south korea which they believe is 
also part of our homeland 
foreign ministry spokesman chang hoon said dong had been 
studying at gdansk university and kim at warsaw engineering college 
when they sought political asylum at a south korean embassy in a 
western european nation 
under an international convention the south korean embassy had 
no power to grant asylum to the north koreans so authorities of 
the european nation were asked to intervene he said 
the european nation involved asked not to be identified for now 
hoon added 
it was the second time this year that north korean students in 
east europe had defected to south korea through west europe 
on feb 9 two north korean students cho sung gun 22 and kim 
un chul 22 who had been studying in czechoslovakia defected to 
south korea

classes began returning to normal friday 
meanwhile a newly formed student group representing at least 24 
universities sent an appeal today to the government for talks on 
democratic reform and an end to corruption

talks and requested they be open to the media the students 
said they would return to government offices monday to hear the 
response of the leadership which has insisted talks must be 
conducted through officially established student unions

independent student union that has organized three weeks of 
protests including several mass demonstrations 
the protests have been the largest in 40 years of communist rule 
shen tong general secretary of the new group said its goals 
were the same as the united association of beijing universities an 
umbrella group linking independent student unions on more than 40 
city campuses

could not take part in thursdays march 
zhao and premier li peng indicated after the march that the 
government planned talks with the students they gave no specifics 
however 
zhaos statements on the student movement were the most 
conciliatory yet by any government leader and included an 
acknowledgement that the protesters were correct in demanding 
that we fix maladies in our work 
but one beijing university activist dismissed zhaos speech as 
lacking substantial content its just talk he said 
the state press today hailed the return to classes of most of 
the students but several acknowleged that students were not 
satisfied with zhaos speech and believed he underestimated the 
extent of corruption 
a railway worker who took part in violence triggered by an april 
22 student march in xian was convicted of arson and theft and 
sentenced to death the legal daily reported zhang jun was on 
trial with more than 900 other people accused of attacking

christian heartland north of beirut today as the arab league 
struggled to deploy an observer force to monitor a widely ignored 
truce 
police said artillery and rocket salvos fired sporadically from 
syriancontrolled west beirut landed at the shoreline between the 
ports of jounieh and byblos christian army units did not return 
fire 
no casualties were reported at least 278 people have been 
killed and 1010 wounded since the current round in lebanons 
14yearold civil war began march 8 pitting christians against an 
alliance of syrian and druse forces 
a police spokesman said the shelling kept the only escape routes 
closed for the 1 million christians in the 310squaremile 
christian enclave 
two cypriotflagged ferry boats that occasionally have been 
running the gantlet of syrian fire to transport christians from 
jounieh and byblos to larnaca cyprus suspended their shuttles 
again thursday 
druse and leftist moslems allied with syria have declared they 
will stop the coastal shelling only when the observer force from 
six arab nations is in place along beiruts dividing green line and 
neighboring hills

are received by the mainly christian troops of the army commander 
gen michel aoun 
iraq syrias main arab foe expressed support for aoun when he 
declared in march his war of liberation against syria which 
maintains 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate 
aoun who has agreed to lift his military blockade of illegal 
harbors run by moslem militias south of beirut has denied 
receiving any arms from iraq

thousands of blacks and whites 
thronged to a cathedral today for the funeral of assassinated white 
activist david webster then followed his coffin in one of the 
largest antiapartheid marches of the 3yearold state of emergency 
mourners jogging behind the hearse and packed into buses gave 
clenched fist salutes to passersby and chanted the initials of the 
outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement as they 
headed through central johannesburg toward a cemetery six miles 
away in a whitesonly suburb 
webster 44 was killed outside his home monday by a man firing 
a shotgun at close range from a passing car police have issued 
sketches of three unidentified white men suspected in the killing 
which provoked grief and outrage throughout the antiapartheid 
movement 
webster a professor of anthropology was one of the few senior 
white members of the predominantly black united democratic front a 
nationwide antiapartheid coalition 
he was a prominent critic of the governments policy of 
detention without trial and had researched the numerous unsolved 
killings and abductions of antiapartheid activists that have 
occurred over the past decade 
he helped us blacks realize there are white people who are 
human beings said the rev frank chikane a black church leader 
at the threehour funeral service his life should be a message 
to all white south africans to rediscover the humanity that could 
make this country free 
about 2000 people filled st marys anglican cathedral for the 
funeral while hundreds more stood outside singing freedom songs 
during the service 
eulogies for webster were interspersed with performances by 
white and black singers and a black jazz group the mourners 
included diplomats from more than a dozen western countries human 
rights activists from across south africa residents of a remote 
zulu community where webster conducted research and fellow 
supporters of a soweto soccer team the orlando pirates 
the crowd included raymond suttner another white 
antiapartheid academic who was released last year after more than 
two years in detention and johnny clegg south africas most 
successful pop music star who flew back from a tour in the united 
states to pay tribute to a man whom he credited for helping to 
inspire his zulustyle rock n roll 
mohammed valli moosa secretarygeneral of the united democratic 
front described webster as a gallant soldier whose determination 
to fight apartheid was more important than his life 
he said websters work in support of detainees over the past 
three years a period when about 30000 activists have been held 
for varying times without charge denied the government the 
ability to break our spirits 
it is widely suspected that the assassin is a member of the 
police force maybe on duty outside this cathedral valli 
moosa said 
helen joseph an 84yearold white activist the south african 
media are not allowed to quote said the guilt for davids death 
lies squarely on the shoulders of the national party government 
hundreds of policemen including some in helicopters were 
deployed to monitor the funeral and the route along which 5000 
marchers and busriders traveled to west park cemetary 
antigovernment parades are not allowed in south africa and 
police have restricted most funerals of slain activists placing 
limits on the number of mourners the content of speeches and size 
of the funeral procession 
but at websters funeral policemen watched impassively as 
hundreds of black youths marched and drove past chanting in support 
of the african national congress

a major nato dispute over shortrange 
nuclear weapons reflects a growing west german disenchantment with 
a defense strategy that would destroy this frontline nation if war 
broke out in europe 
the issue probably will be resolved with a compromise on what to 
do about the shortrange missiles on west german territory but 
washington cannot afford to ignore the stirrings of its strongest 
military partner 
the days are over when you can sell a defense policy to 
germans that clearly threatens to turn their country into a smoking 
pile of ruins said peter danylow a domestic and foreign policy 
expert with the bonnbased foreign affairs institute 
there is growing public impatience with nato demands on west 
germany which has 400000 foreign troops on its soil as well as 
conventional hardware and the bulk of the western alliances 
shortrange missiles 
chancellor helmut kohl aware of the public mood and worried 
about his political survival called on washington and moscow to 
negotiate the reduction of shortrange stockpiles 
us and nato strategists oppose a new round of negotiations on 
those missiles until the warsaw pact has reduced its advantage in 
conventional armaments bonn has balked on that point causing rift 
in the alliance 
those charting public opinion say the majority of west germans 
support the government 
the west german public has realized as never before that these 
weapons would spell the certain destruction of their nation if they 
were ever used said heinz timmermann a defense and foreign 
policy expert at the colognebased institute for eastern and 
international studies 
in an era of warming relations with the soviet bloc many west 
germans cannot understand why this strategy should continue 
timmermann told the associated press 
most of the north atlantic treaty organizations shorrange 
nuclear arsenal is deployed in west germany 76 lance missiles 
with a range of about 75 miles should war break out and sovietled 
forces invade west germany those nuclear weapons would be used 
almost exclusively on west and east german soil 
they are part of what nato officials say is a vital flexible 
response strategy that combines conventional forces with the threat 
of using battlefield nuclear weapons 
but west germans increasingly view the policy as obsolete 
especially with president mikhail s gorbachev offering friendship 
to western europe bonn now says it believes the warsaw pact 
military threat has diminished because of the reform and detente 
policies of gorbachev 
kohls government has also said it wants to delay a decision on 
the deployment of new missiles to replace the aging lance systems 
until at least 1991 after the 1990 election 
the new rockets would have a significantly longer range up to 
300 miles and west germans to a degree share the kremlin view that 
their deployment would constitute a rearmament step 
kohl and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher have stood firm 
on the demand for prompt talks insisting soviet overtures be met 
with a western readiness to compromise 
genscher the architect of the current arms reduction effort 
has won widespread public support for his contention that gorbachev 
should be taken at his word 
the foreign minister who was born in what is now communist east 
germany has argued consistently over his 20year cabinet career 
that it is as much in the wests interest as in the easts to 
pursue all opportunities to improve ties between europes political 
blocs 
still president bush said last week he opposes early 
shortrange talks prime minister margaret thatcher of britain has 
taken the american side in the dispute 
sen william s cohen a maine republican said in washington 
last week the united states should reconsider its policy of keeping 
a large military force in west germany 
i think if the west german people have come to the conclusion 
they can place more faith and reliance on gorbachevs words and 
assurances than they can upon sound nato strategy then it would be 
very difficult for me to continue to commit the size of the forces 
we have under those circumstances 
while kohl has said he is optimistic a compromise can be found 
before a nato summit in brussels may 2930 he has also made it 
clear that he wants west germanys special situation and 
interests acknowledged in an overall nato policy statement 
the west german people want to see real progress in 
disarmament negotiations on issues that directly affect the fate 
and future of this country said renate koecher a researcher at 
the national polling institute in allensbach 
but pollsters and researchers say the overwhelming desire for 
progress in eastwest weapons talks has not seriously shaken the 
nations commitment to nato 
most west germans dont want their country to bolt from 
nato said koecher but there is a strong sentiment in the 
country that nato should be able to adjust to the changes that have 
occurred in recent years in eastwest relations 
many see natos reluctance on the shortrange missile issue as 
part of a broader unwillingness to gradually shift to political 
solutions to eastwest issues 
willfried penner a defense expert for the opposition social 
democratic party said us and british intransigence on the 
shortrange missiles makes nato look increasingly like a military 
fossil 
some analysts predict the conflict is only the first salvo in 
what promises to be a long and difficult debate over west germanys 
place in the alliance and its role in europe

astronauts awakened to their alma 
maters school songs today and resumed a light work schedule while 
the robot magellan probe they had launched earlier raced onward at 
7000 mph on its 15month voyage to venus 
the five astronauts aboard the shuttle atlantis began work on 
routine tests aboard the orbiter including one that calls for 
photographing night lightning strikes in the clouds below 
their day began shortly before 8 am cdt with a medley of 
military and schools tunes played for them by mission control 
good morning houston thanks for the great music atlantis 
commander david walker said we did sleep well and were ready to 
roll today 
the songs played were anchors aweigh for walker a navy 
captain the air force song off we go into the wild blue 
yonder for pilot ronald grabe and mission specialist mark 
lee both air force academy graduates and the school songs for 
colorado state mission specialist mary cleaves alma mater and 
florida state which mission specialist norman thagards attended 
except for a minor difficulty during breakfast atlantis 
remained in good shape as the astronauts began their second full 
day in orbit 
all systems on atlantis are functioning very well mission 
control commentator jeffrey carr said were starting the day 
with a very clean bird a very clean slate 
the astronauts had a little difficulty with breakfast when a 
galley water device malfunctioned dispensing almost any amount 
of water it wanted despite a precise setting lee said 
it must be poetic justice to have a galley mal malfunction 
with a maggot on board walker joked members of lees astronaut 
class named themselves maggots 
after some unsuccessful tinkering with the device the 
astronauts attached a hose to it so they could control the flow of 
water some of the freezedried food packages need a dose of hot or 
cold water 
earlier today while the crew members slept cargo bay cameras 
provided spectacular views of the middle east and africa the 
cameras were maneuvered by a ground controller and could be seen on 
nasa television 
the magellan planetary probe which will travel 806 million 
miles before reaching venus was on a near perfect path and was in 
excellent condition officials said 
it was only half a degree off normal but that deviation was 
expected and will be adjusted may 21 when a ground station sends a 
signal to trigger a small motor firing on the probe they said 
magellan gently ejected thursday night from the shuttles cargo 
bay began its journey at a rate of 25000 mph but had slowed 
gradually to a cruising speed of about 7000 mph this morning it 
was expected to pass the plane of the moon some 240000 miles from 
earth 
when it reaches venus in august 1990 the tug of the planets 
gravity will have increased the speed again to about 25000 mph 
once in orbit the probe will use its high resolution radar system 
to map up to 90 percent of the venusian surface 
those images enhanced by computers are expected to show 
features as small as a football field and be 10 times clearer than 
pictures obtained by earlier spacecraft the pictures should 
provide an avalanche of data that could help scientists discover 
how venus evolved so differently from earth 
the 550 million mission is the first us planetary project in 
11 years and the first to be deployed from a shuttle 
the astronauts workload has been light because the heavy weight 
of magellan and its rocket booster totaling 45000 pounds 
restricted the number of experiments they could carry on the 
fourday mission the probe weighs 7600 pounds 
the crew members methodically went about their work friday 
talking only sparingly with ground controllers at the johnson space 
center 
walker took some time out to thank the tracking station crews at 
guam and santiago chile who are covering their last shuttle 
mission 
the stations are among several being phased out because of the 
completion of a network of communications satellites that allows 
ground controllers to have nearly constant contact with shuttle 
astronauts 
thanks for all the good work walker told the santiago crew 
late friday night 
earlier friday the astronauts worked with a 128pound 
metalsprocessing furnace the size of a small microwave oven 
samples of indium and selenium were melted and resolidified in the 
furnace to see how they react in weightlessness 
potential applications for such spacemade materials include 
advanced electronic and optical devices 
also on board are medical experiments and several cameras for 
photographing the earth and lightning systems photographs of such 
lightning strikes may one day help scientists improve weather 
forecasting methods 
flight director ron dittemore said the shuttles systems were in 
excellent condition and the only problems were just annoyances 
a facsimile machine being tested for sending documents to the 
shuttle was shut down when its paper jammed and a machine for 
measuring blood pressure failed he said 
atlantis which rocketed away from kennedy space center on 
thursday afternoon is scheduled to land monday at edwards air 
force base calif

foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher has been the driving force in forming a new west german 
position on nuclear missiles that has caused a rift in the nato 
alliance 
genscher has been the designated architect of west german 
foreign policy for 15 years the longestserving foreign minister 
in the west 
he has charted the course for the nations steady drift to the 
east expressing an eagerness for every chance to close the 
capitalistcommunist chasm and he has stood guard over the gains 
of ostpolitik the strategy forged by former chancellor willy 
brandt a generation ago to foster better relations between the 
german states 
behind the 62yearold politicians quest for better eastwest 
relations is a life deeply influenced by germanys tragic past 
genscher was born in the saxon town of halle now part of east 
germany and returned to the sovietoccupied sector of his homeland 
after capture by americans and imprisonment in britain until the 
end of world war ii 
after studying law at leipzig university and growing 
disenchanted with the new socialist state he escaped to the west 
in 1952 and entered politics by joining the small liberal free 
democratic party 
now firmly in place as one of the nations most popular 
politicians genscher has been at the forefront of a west german 
scramble to take advantage of new opportunities for eastwest 
cooperation brought about by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
impervious to warnings from other nato allies that it may be too 
soon to match initiatives from a kremlin that remains better armed 
than the west genscher has been pushing for a new round of 
superpower talks aimed at removing shortrange missiles from west 
german territory 
he has appealed to the allies to trust gorbachev and take him 
at his word 
he has made clear he aims for a dismantling of the divisions of 
europe in particular the concrete and barbedwire border dividing 
the two germanies 
in a speech to the federal parliament last week genscher stated 
that his responsibility for guiding german policy does not end at 
the border running through the middle of germany this obligation 
includes my home the city in which i was born 
noting that germans brought about the world war that left the 
continent sharply divided into two opposing political blocs 
genscher has often observed with a note of contrition that europe 
is our fate 
critics have accused him of seeking a break with the western 
alliance or of trying to give west germany the first foot in the 
door of potential economic deals with east bloc countries 
solidifying west germanys role as the primary economic power in 
europe 
but genscher has steadfastly said he wants a peaceful and 
prosperous europe and a freer exchange between the two germanies 
genscher has the specific interests of western europe in 
mind said heinz timmermann of colognes institute for eastern 
and international studies it has nothing to do with the 
government wanting a special path nothing to do with neutrality 
long troubled by health problems including tuberculosis and 
three heart attacks genscher has rebounded from his most recent 
bout with illness and the death a few months ago of his 88yearold 
mother 
he was hospitalized in march for surgery to correct a 
urinarytract problem but his staff reports he has returned to his 
grueling 16houraday schedule and has shown no signs of tiring

mob violence that has cost the lives of 
hundreds of senegalese and mauritanians in each others countries 
is rooted in the ancient conflict of nomad and farmer and in the 
river that is a lifeline for both 
long before a country named senegal existed before the enormous 
colony called french west africa was created the black toucouleur 
people farmed the fertile basin on both sides of the senegal river 
arabberber people known as moors living to the north in what 
became mauritania were proud wanderers herders of camels and 
goats who had no interest in a sedentary life on the land 
when the french left and the two nations were created the river 
became their border 
dams have made the basin more valuable attracting moorish 
investors senegalese are being forced from land their forebears 
tilled and new restrictions are being applied to what once was 
relatively free crossborder grazing mostly by mauritanian herds 
in diawara a riverbank village a burst of gunfire april 9 
killed two senegalese farmers some say mauritanian border guards 
did the shooting others say mauritanian tribesmen 
the incident inspired a spree of reprisal lootings beatings and 
killings in many areas of both countries particularly the 
capitals dakar in senegal and nouakchott in mauritania 
neither government has given casualty figures unofficial counts 
indicate about 60 people were killed in senegal and 200 in 
mauritania and that thousands were wounded 
so bad did the violence become that senegal and mauritania 
organized an air shuttle to bring their expatriates home france 
algeria morocco and spain contributed planes 
neither government wants the conflict mustapha ould 
abedarrahman mauritanias information minister said in an 
interview we and senegal are condemned to cooperate there are 
an enormous amount of things that unite us 
senegalese living in mauritania do nearly all the fishing 
operate taxis and work as manual laborers 
mauritanians have a nearmonopoly on small retail business in 
senegal every neighborhood has its corner mauritanian who 
sells products in even the tiniest amounts a single cube of sugar 
or a handful of rice 
both economies are fragile in a process of restructuring 
decreed by the world bank and international monetary fund and will 
suffer from the trouble 
historically peasants in podor and other villages along the 
river have crossed to farm on the mauritanian side 
that land has belonged to us for centuries said mamadou 
solih wone the moslem religious leader of podor and also a farmer 
a moor doesnt farm wone said sitting amid village elders 
in a crumbling building on a street of red dirt you will never 
see one on the land 
i have felt this coming for years said taifour ibra wane 
mayor of the dusty town of 12000 
last year mauritanian authorities began preventing senegalese 
from farming the other side of the river villagers acknowledge 
they are crossing an international border but say they have worked 
that land for centuries and should be compensated if they are 
thrown off it 
a senegalese will tell you the historic border was 35 miles or 
more north of the river a mauritanian will say the frontier was 
south of it 
and if it hadnt been for the french an official in 
nouakchott said the moroccans would have controlled the whole 
territory 
mauritanian officials say the river is the border north of the 
river is mauritania they say and if mauritanians want to farm the 
land they have every right to do so 
all mauritanian land is in the public domain and the government 
will give it to any mauritanian who wants to develop it 
farmers from senegal say moors dont want to get their hands 
dirty by farming that they are forming large agricultural 
companies and becoming agribusinessmen profiting from land 
developed by senegalese 
dams built near the mouth of the senegal river at diama and at 
manantali in mali have brought vast changes no longer must 
farmers hope for an annual flood to soak the land the dams 
guarantee a flood each year 
irrigation is possible farther back from the river making more 
land arable and enticing investors the prospects are of great 
interest to mauritania which is 99 percent desert 
the white mauritanians want to take the land from the 
toucouleurs said an agricultural technician who has worked in 
the area for 25 years they want all of a sudden to become 
farmers and use the blacks as labor as they did with their old 
slave system 
senegalese frequently point out that mauritania did not abolish 
slavery until 1980 and that it continues in some areas of the 
country

defense secretary dick cheney faces a major 
battle with congress over the cancellation of the v22 osprey 
aircraft which not only is a favorite of the marine corps but on 
capitol hill as well 
of all the cuts cheney has proposed the most difficult to get 
is the v22 house armed services chairman les aspin dwis 
said friday hours before the pentagon announced it would not spend 
additional funds to continue the program for another five months 
stay tuned aspin said 
lawmakers had responded with outrage to cheneys initial 
announcement that he would eliminate the 259 billion program 
after investing nine years and 2 billion in the battlefield 
aircraft designed to take off like a helicopter and fly like an 
airplane 
cheney called the decision painful but said the program would 
have to go as he slashed 10 billion in fiscal 1990 spending under 
the budget compromise reached by the white house and congress 
hopes of congressional supporters were raised thursday when 
deputy defense secretary donald atwood jr indicated the pentagon 
was considering a reprieve for the aircraft as bell helicopter 
textron inc and boeing helicopter co threatened to halt work on 
the project 
late friday however the pentagon said the v22 would remain on 
the fiscal 1990 budget cutting floor and warned the contractors 
that they were expected to complete the work required under their 
fiscal 1989 contract that contract does not expire until sept 30 
the contractors meanwhile said they had suspended their threat 
of layoffs for the moment citing the strong bipartisan 
congressional support for the v22 program 
that support for the osprey is emerging from the powerful marine 
corps lobby on capitol hill and the concerns of influential 
lawmakers the ranking republican on the house armed services 
committee said friday 
the marine lobby per se is as tough as the nra national rifle 
association said rep bill dickinson of alabama who noted that 
after the considerable investment the corps does not want to see 
a wasted effort on their part 
rep frank mccloskey dind a member of the house armed 
services committee said that year after year the marines have 
made the v22 their highest priority its vital to marine 
aviation 
the v22 is a revolutionary aircraft that the marine corps wants 
to use to improve its ability to conduct surprise longrange 
amphibious assaults the pentagon had planned to spend 259 
billion on 663 ospreys including 13 billion in 1990 
the contractors are located in texas and pennsylvania both of 
which have large and powerful delegations on capitol hill 
bell helicopter textron is in fort worth texas home district 
of house speaker jim wright boeing helicopter co is in the home 
state for two active defense lawmakers rep john murtha dpa a 
marine corps veteran and sen arlen specter rpa 
i very definitely hear a building crescendo dickinson said 
friday i raised that point with dick cheney the hottest and 
most political issue will be the v22 i told him to be ready and 
expect a firestorm 
but lawmakers have begun to suggest other sources of funding to 
keep the osprey program 
star wars said mccloskey the thinking is that too much 
money is spent on sdi for 3 billion you can get all the research 
and development you need 
sen john mccain rariz a member of the senate armed services 
committee said it was too early to tell where the money would come 
from but then mentioned that everybody always looks at the sdi 
money like the fox looking at the hen house

sen pete v domenici spent six years as 
chairman of the senate budget committee fighting off attempts to 
derail the spending plans he produced 
but last week the former chairman whos still central to any 
budget deal dared other senators to take him on i welcome those 
who have something better to offer i hope they will bring it down 
here said domenici rnm 
almost nobody did and those were brushed away by by 
overwhelming margins in the house debate was more carefully 
scripted but the results were the same 
the deficitreduction agreement reached last month between 
president bush and congressional leaders has been accepted by the 
rank and file 6831 in the senate and 263157 in the house 
although fine details remain to be worked out between the two 
chambers the final budget for fiscal 1990 will claim to reduce the 
deficit by about 28 billion 
there are no daring cutbacks in spending only some slower 
growth not a hint that any federal program will be eliminated 
federal assets would be sold government fees raised and a call 
for 53 billion in new tax revenues maybe can be done without 
violating bushs no new taxes campaign pledge 
calling 53 billion in new taxes something other than a tax 
should be a snap for president bush said senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine recalling the dozen or so times president 
reagan was able to accomplish that rhetorical feat 
the budgets claim to reach the grammrudman laws requirement of 
a deficit no larger than 100 billion in the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 but critics argue that the unspecified tax boost is just 
one of many instances of hocuspocus in the budget documents 
billions of dollars of savings are nothing more than 
bookkeeping changes such as declaring the postal service 
offbudget and deeming a halfbillion dollars in old 
unredeemed food stamps as no longer a government liability 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of congress joint economic 
committee described the white housecongressional alliance as 
this they provide the smoke and we provide the mirrors 
sen james sasser the chairman of the senate budget committee 
acknowledged the shortcomings of the plan and said he hoped more 
deficit reduction could be accomplished later 
i have sat through hours and hours and hours of sincere debate 
between honest and honorable men on virtually every possible 
approach to the budget problem and this is the best that we can do 
at this particular time in our history said sasser dtenn 
stan collender a former congressional budget staff member who 
now follows fiscal issues for a private accounting firm said the 
lawmakers were just giving their constituents what they wanted 
people believe the deficit is a serious problem but no one 
wants you to cut spending or raise taxes he said 
as a result congress must resort to gimmickry and optimistic 
deficit figures that make it seem like they are attacking the 
deficit 
they feel compelled to deal with it in a way to make it appear 
theyve dealt with it in a serious way he said 
carol cox head of the committee for a responsible federal 
budget disputes assertions that the general public isnt ready to 
sacrifice in order to reduce the economic threat of the deficit 
the publics so far ahead of their political leaders on this 
one its a stitch said cox who conducts public meetings around 
the country to explore budget options 
the politicians are using their budget deals to provide cover 
for one another to avoid dealing with the harsh realities of 
life she said the process is so far along theyre not even 
embarrassed about it any more she said

from a faint picture of twin windmills on 
montmartre taken in 1839 to a blazing david hockney collage 
depicting the california desert of the 1980s the national gallery 
of art is saluting the history of photography with a mammoth new 
exhibition opening sunday 
the show was touted by gallery director j carter brown as 
probably the biggest and most ambitious of any museum 
exhibition marking the 150th anniversary of photography this year 
it contains 430 photographs by 200 of the worlds best 
photographers from french pioneer louis jacques mande daguerre to 
the likes of henri cartierbresson alfred stieglitz ansel adams 
edward weston walker evans edward steichen and man ray the show 
fills 13 rooms in the gallerys west building 
the shadowy photograph of the montmartre windmills captured by 
a french civil servant and inventor named hippolyte bayard is so 
delicate that its frame is covered by a brown velvet curtain that 
can be lifted by viewers in a dimly lighted room of the gallery 
similar treatment to minimize damage is accorded two other early 
images by englands william henry fox talbot who developed the 
first primitive photographic printing process and who described his 
discovery as the art of fixing the shadow 
the exhibition is drawn from private and public collections 
around the world and is underwritten by a major grant from eastern 
kodak co after it closes in washington on july 30 the show will 
appear from sept 16 to nov 26 at the art institute of chicago 
which helped organize the show the final stop of the tour will be 
the los angeles county museum of art dec 21 to feb 25 
in conjunction with the photo exhibition titled on the art of 
fixing a shadow 150 years of photography the national gallery 
is sponsoring a summertime film series highlighting the connection 
between photography and cinematography 
among the 24 films to be shown from may 27 through aug 13 are 
the original uncut version of abel gances 1927 classic 
napoleon accompanied by the original live piano score and 
newly restored prints of victor sjostroms the outlaw and his 
wife of 1918 and dw griffiths way down east of 1920 
a companion exhibition titled the photography of invention 
which opened recently at the smithsonian institutions national 
museum of american art explores revolutionary techniques by 
american photographers of the 1980s 
the 185 nontraditional works by 90 artists many of whom were 
trained in other disciplines frequently use computer technology 
and the visual vocabulary of advertising in their photographic 
images 
one work commissioned for the museum show nancy bursons the 
president was created by feeding blackandwhite images of 
presidents nixon ford carter and reagan into a computer to 
produce a single portrait of a generic president with president 
bushs features incorporated later 
the national gallery show features an impressive display of 
creative talent in a medium so popular among professional artists 
and amateur hobbyists that an estimated 50 billion pictures will be 
taken this year says kodak vice president raymond h demoulin 
amateurs who will account for 42 million of the total also are 
represented in the exhibition snapshots taken during the late 19th 
century by such notables as french impressionist painter edgar 
degas and englands queen alexandra are included 
among the shows four historical sections are landscapes of the 
american west by timothy osullivan battlefield scenes from the 
civil war and 20th century portraits by social reformers of child 
laborers and migrant farm workers contemporary artists include 
warhol and his sixteen jackies portraits of jacqueline onassis

no leaders have been toppled after three weeks of 
the largest prodemocracy protests in communist china marching 
students have won no promises of reform 
but the tens of thousands of students have succeeded in breaking 
through the accepted barriers on political discourse and have 
altered perhaps permanently the terms in which chinese speak of 
their leaders 
the students shouted at the portals of the powerholders things 
that most chinese previously were afraid to whisper even in private 
maybe senior leader deng xiaoping is crazy 
premier li peng is dengs puppet he has no ability 
china has no press freedom 
the leaders are corrupt they are dictators 
the students put up posters listing the high government posts 
held by sons and daughters of top leaders 
no one was sacred 
the 84yearold dengs wheelchairbound son deng pufang was 
referred to as prince pufang and charges of tax evasion and 
other misdeeds by a company linked to him were recounted 
instead of being hauled off for education through labor the 
usual treatment for political critics the students were merely 
talked at first harshly then with care as the extent of popular 
support for them became evident 
in dealing with the student activities we must be very 
prudent government spokesman yuan mu told an unusual news 
conference last week in which he and education minister he 
dongchang acknowledged government errors had caused widespread 
discontent that was tapped by the students 
the students huge april 27 march on tiananmen square in which 
they and workers who joined them formed a mass 150000 strong 
implictly established their right to march despite beijing city 
restrictions 
when the students next marched may 4 the government made no 
threats and no serious efforts to stop them 
the first march began in an atmosphere of fear but the may 4 
march had a matteroffactness about it that subtly illustrated how 
much government limits had been pushed back in just one week 
the student movement also revealed in the general public a 
voracious appetite for political discussion several students said 
they sought to destroy apathy and raise consciousness and here 
they clearly succeeded 
one month ago only a few bold intellectuals such as 
astrophysicist fang lizhi were openly calling for democracy after 
the students began marching it seemed everyone was 
the main thing we created was an atmosphere said wang 
zhixin one of the protest leaders we have brought the word 
democracy into the lives of the people of china and given the 
people new confidence in criticizing the government 
hundreds of ordinary citizens joined in pickup political 
discussion circles near the campuses over the past few weeks 
reveling in the pleasure of speaking their minds 
even a few weeks ago no one would have dared to do this 
said a young government employee watching one such group outside 
the peoples university a week ago chinese have been ignorant 
for years this is an education 
some breakthrough also appears evident in the official media 
which at first was silent on the student protests after many 
chinese reporters put unprecedented pressure on their bosses and 
about 300 joined in the may 4 march several papers described the 
students protests in sympathetic terms 
what remains to be seen is how long these effects will linger 
now that students with bullhorns have given tiananmen square back 
to the ice cream vendors and kiteflyers 
the students say they are determined to continue their democracy 
movement in quieter ways by setting up their own independent 
newspapers holding political forums and distributing political 
pamphlets on the streets 
such activities have been banned by beijing police and if the 
students are allowed to continue them this alone will constitute a 
major breakthrough in a political system where the communist party 
has long held a monopoly on political discussion 
college students however make up only half a percent of 
chinas 12 billion people unless further heavy pressure is put on 
the government it remains inconceivable that workers for example 
will be allowed to put out their own newspapers or pamphlets 
at a minimum students hope their pleas for democracy have been 
noted by western goverments that regularly apply pressure on the 
soviet union to democratize but not china 
why do westerners look down on chinese and think they dont 
want freedom wondered a 37yearold entrepreneur who applauded 
the students chinese americans japanese we are all the same 
we all want freedom

the oliver north trial had been in progress 
for more than two months and his name had been woven through the 
testimony like thread through cloth when north finally was called 
to the stand 
so youre colonel north said his lawyer 
yes sir said north with a tight smile 
its traditional to start with your full name prompted his 
lawyer brendan sullivan 
oliver laurence withau north said the defendant 
so began six days of questioning in which the 45yearold north 
tried to convince his jury that he was unjustly charged that the 
crimes laid to his feet had honorable roots that his motives were 
righteous and that his actions carried out the wishes of none other 
than the president of the united states 
that he largely succeeded was borne out by thursdays verdict 
which seemed to signal the jurys belief he should be punished only 
for those things in which he had total control nobody ordered 
north to accept an illegal gift the security fence around his 
home and nobody ordered him to mutilate documents that would 
expose his machinations 
did you intend to violate any law by receiving the security 
system without paying for it asked sullivan 
no i intended to pay for it 
but did you ever pay for it 
no i did not said north 
even on the third conviction creating false chronologies of the 
irancontra affair for congress the jury found only that he 
aided and abetted not that he was the principal in that 
charge too altering and shredding documents was an element north 
had testified that one of his bosses former national security 
adviser robert mcfarlane had ordered the doctored version 
mcfarlane said it wasnt so 
the oliver north on the witness stand was not the oliver north 
seen by millions on television who told congress i did a lot of 
things and i want to stand up and say im proud of them neither 
was he the oliver north of last weeks television fiction who so 
idolized powerful men that he wound up as everybodys patsy 
after two years under the irancontra cloud north had changed 
the boyish brown hair had grayed his passionate patriotism hadnt 
dimmed but in court it was muted he was being talked about as if 
he had left the room and north reacted by busying himself taking 
miles of notes with his left hand he still knew who the enemy was 
four days in a row prosecutor john keker said good morning mr 
north and the witness pointedly remained mute 
the six rows of ribbons silver star for conspicuous gallantry 
bronze star marked with v for valor for heroism purple heart for 
being twice wounded in action had given way to dark suits and 
ultraconservative ties there was nothing either to replace the 
presidential service badge that had adorned his right breast in 
1987 
the jury got to know more about north through his own testimony 
than through the testimony of others 
how many engagements with the enemy would you have encountered 
during your time in vietnam asked sullivan 
oh i dont know that i never really kept track north 
replied roughly 100 i would suppose 
he said that when congress passed the boland amendment in 1984 
forbidding military aid to the guerrillas fighting nicaraguas 
leftist government it was clear that they wanted to find some 
way of continuing the support they being the white house 
the cia he said had been providing everything from the 
little tents that they lived in to the homes that they had for 
their children to the food they ate the weapons they carried the 
bullets they had everything had come form the cia all of the 
intelligence all of the operations planning 
q what did you understand your assignment to be 
a i understood it very clearly to be that i would be the one to 
replace the cia for each of these activities 
but what about the boland amendment i talked to director 
casey i talked to mr mcfarlane i talked to the nsc lawyers 
none of them thought that it applied to the nsc

north said william casey the cia director told him a man to 
help him accomplish what he was after was richard secord a retired 
air force major general with expertise in running covert supply 
operations 
he started out basically delivering munitions i mean that 
was the first step he became a person who arranged for the 
shipping of the munitions out of europe it then expanded to 
include air delivery of those munitions he was eventually in the 
process of building warehouses at various airfields around central 
america that could do these things because we couldnt use any of 
the us government facilities that had been set up under the cia 
we tried very hard to stay within the line that was drawn by 
boland 
casey also gave him the names of people to work with in central 
america 
q whenever you had such a contact with an official of a 
neighboring country in central america would you always have the 
permission of your superiors 
a yes sir i never made a single trip down there never 
made single contact with anybody down there without the permission 
express permission of either mr mcfarlane or admiral poindexter 
and usually when i could with the concurrence of director casey 
and asked sullivan did president regan himself act to help the 
freedom fighters for example by calling the presidents of 
foreign countries 
yes sir said north 
what about the fundraising he was accused of 
i was told specifically that i could not personally me 
ollie north ask them for money that i was a government official 
i never recall a single instance where a donor a person who 
has shown up now in these lists of names who gave money ever gave 
money in my presence was ever asked to give money in my presence 
q you are accused in this case colonel north of conspiracy to 
commit a tax fraud did you do so 
a no sir i did not 
north said that when congress asked for information in 1985 
about his activities mcfarlane then the national security adviser 
told him to alter six memos dealing with raising money from third 
countries and details of nsc military assistance to the contras 
he said he didnt get around to doing that until the irancontra 
connection became known a year later when he said mcfarlane 
asked did you ever take care of that other stuff way back when 
what did you do with that or words to that effect 
i said well i havent taken care of it yet but i will and 
then i went and had the documents pulled from the files and altered 
them consistent with what he had earlier asked me to do 
sullivan did you believe it was unlawful to do that 
north no i had written those documents i had prepared them 
for him they were his documents it never occurred to me that that 
could be unlawful 
sullivan when you didnt disclose information they were looking 
at did you believe your conduct was unlawful 
north i was raised to know the difference between right and 
wrong i knew it wasnt right not to tell the truth on those 
things but i didnt think it was unlawful 
others had hesitated to attack north because of his war record 
but not prosecutor john keker who was like north wounded as a 
marine officer in vietnam 
keker needled north by intimating he had violated the honor code 
he was taught at the us naval academy 
in the united states naval academy you would be kicked out for 
this wouldnt you he asked at one point 
in the united states naval academy nobody taught me how to 
deal with running a covert operation mr keker north shot back 
nobody taught me how to run a covert operation in the marine 
corps i was trying my everloving best to get it done and the fact 
is that nobody in the united states naval academy teaches you about 
the internecine political warfare that was going on in washington 
from 1983 to 1986 
keker did any moral bell go off in your head 
north it wouldnt be proper for me to describe it as a moral 
bell i thought it was extraordinarily immoral to have fielded a 
force the contras put it in the field equipped it trained it 
fed it clothed it armed it sent it into combat and then left it 
in the lurch i thought it was heinous 
north seemed particularly stung by kekers assertion in his 
closing argument that north and mcfarlane had been following 
adolf hitlers old strategy the victor will never be asked if he 
told the truth 
on thursday after the verdict north read a statement to 
reporters recalling that keker has likened me to adolf hitler 
said north as a marine i was taught to fight and fight hard 
for as long as it takes to prevail we will continue this battle

the pentagon needs to improve military schools 
for intermediate and senior officers by upgrading faculties and 
making coursework tougher according to a report by a house armed 
services panel 
what i would like to see us do to is return these schools to 
their former premier positions that we had before world war ii 
said rep ike skelton dmo the chairman of the panel which 
spent a year studying the graduate schools operated by the four 
military services and the pentagon 
the panel released saturday a 206page report calling for a 
greater focus on formal military education and increased 
cooperation among the services 
in military strategy terms there has not been a determination 
of the center of gravity in the curricula on which each level of 
schools should focus the report said 
it said the system now is marked by a diffusion of efforts and 
unnecessary redundancy 
skelton called the study the first comprehensive review by 
congress of the five intermediate command and staff colleges which 
traditionally are for majors or lieutenant commanders and the five 
senior war colleges which are for colonels and lieutenant colonels 
or navy commanders or captains 
about 3000 us officers attend the programs each year 
although skelton described the overall system as sound he 
said there were significant shortcomings 
the report called for tougher coursework as well as more graded 
examinations papers and reports and small discussion seminars 
instead of large lecture classes 
the report criticized the two air force schools for having the 
most classroom hours with passive education such as auditorium 
lectures symposiums and films at the seniorlevel air war 
college 62 percent of the core curricula relied on passive 
learning compared with 10 percent at the armys intermediate 
school at fort leavenworth kan 
more civilian teachers should be hired at some schools the 
report said it urged more emphasis in the military on teaching as 
an important assignment most officers now see command and 
headquarter staff duty as the way to the top 
in some instances its the kiss of death to be named to teach 
in some of these schools skelton said 
the panel intends to introduce legislation to give all of the 
military services the ability to fix independent pay scales for 
civilian teachers something only the navy can do now skelton said 
removing pay limits will clear the way for recruiting top civilians 
who otherwise would teach in universities 
not enough navy officers attend the schools with only 8 percent 
going to both the intermediate navy command and staff college and 
the seniorlevel college of naval warfare the report said it said 
the best officers generally go only to the senior school 
theyre beginning to change that but its still not any where 
close to where it should be said skelton thats a serious 
problem 
the navy contends that the demand for officers has grown with 
the expansion of the fleet leaving fewer available for 
professional schooling 
last fall the panel issued preliminary recommendations that 
included revising the national war college and making it the 
national center for strategic studies focusing not only on 
military strategy but political economic and diplomatic matters

make confidential reports on the spread of aids in their countries 
to encourage more accurate information on the disease a news 
report said saturday 
lobe monekosso the un world health organizations director 
for africa said current reporting on the spread of aids in africa

monekosso said the number of people in africa infected with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome could be as high as 1 million 
last month who reported 10918 cases of aids in africa 
there is no known cure for aids which attacks the bodys immune 
system

to male homosexuals hemophiliacs and intravenous drug abusers in

servicesector growth in the economy soon will 
slow dramatically leaving the nation little choice but to restore 
its manufacturing might or risk creating an underclass dependent on 
declining wages according to a leading economist 
the united states is probably at a fundamental turning 
point lester thurow of the massachusetts institute of technology 
concluded in a study released saturday 
for the past 40 years service employment has supplied the 
bulk of the new jobs in the united states and for the past 10 
years all of them in the decade ahead this pattern is apt to 
change he said 
the government on friday reported the slowest monthtomonth 
growth in the service sector in nearly three years although it 
still expanded while manufacturing posted declines 
according to thurow dean of mits sloan school of management 
the downward trend in manufacturing has to end for a number of 
reasons primarily the need of the united states to erase its trade 
deficit running at an annual rate of 115 billion so far this year 
eventually the dollar will fall to whatever level is 
necessary for the united states to balance its international 
accounts thurow concluded in the study at that point the 
united states will either export more manufactured goods or replace 
imported manufactured goods with domestically made alternatives 
foreign debt has cost the united states more than 4 million 
manufacturing jobs thurow projected saying the formula for 
solving the trade defict was restoring those manufacturing jobs in 
addition to any added by general economic growth 
as a practical matter thurow said those jobs also will be 
necessary to prevent higher unemployment because of his projected 
halt in servicesector growth 
thurow cited a number of factors to support the projection 
among them 
intensive efforts to rein in health care costs which in turn 
would cut demand for workers 
a natural end to restaurant growth because most meals now are 
eaten away from home as well as a decline for sales personnel 
because of a natural limit to longer shopping hours those two 
factors in turn would result in lower demand for real estate and 
building maintenance 
a peak in demand for white collar workers which in turn would 
adversely affect office construction 
sinking demand in financial services because of growing 
pressure on american financial institutions as the marketplace 
becomes increasingly global and foreign institutions offer cheaper 
loans and other products 
taking those factors into account thurow concluded that the 
united states has little choice if it wants to erase its trade 
deficit and avoid high unemployment 
these jobs have to come in manufacturing since they can come 
in nothing else he wrote 
at the same time he called for a reexamination of the lowwage 
structure of the us service economy 
in a background paper included in the thurow study louise 
waldstein an associate at klein and co inc a management 
consulting group said wages in portions of the servicesector that 
traditionally offer low pay need to be raised in return for 
productivity gains 
millions of people are in the growing industries of retail 
trade or building services and earn less than the wages necessary 
to support a satisfactory standing of living waldstein wrote 
such a large proportion of american workers are in these low paid 
jobs that we may be creating an entire group of working americans 
unable to support themselves adequately on on fulltime earnings 
clearly increasing lowwage employment contributes to a decline in 
the standard of living 
thurow pointed to the poor productivity of american 
servicesector workers compared to those of west germany and japan 
while there has been some increased demand for services 
particularly health care because of the aging population thurow 
attributed the majority of job growth in most of the sector to 
falling or sluggish productivity growth 
in contrast producivity among servicesector workers in west 
germany and japan has increased dramatically with the foremost 
factor the higher wages paid for service jobs in those countries 
thurow said 
factors behind the higher wages include higher minimum wages 
enforcement of those wage floors and greater unionization he said 
had american productivity growth mirrored that of germany he 
said the united states would have added only 36 million of the 
155 million new service jobs generated between 1972 and 1983

the bush administration anticipating that 
gen manuel antonio noriega will try to rig national elections in 
panama is considering additional punitive measures against the 
military leader after sundays balloting according to us 
officials 
the officials said the options range from an effort to seize 
noriegas assets abroad to enlisting the support of friendly 
democratic countries in a campaign to increase panamas 
international isolation 
there is no possibility of no response said one official 
alluding to the alleged efforts by the panamanian government to use 
fraudulent means to defeat the opposition slate in the elections 
according to the official there have been discussions within 
the government about the possibility of taking legal action to 
seize noriegas assets in the united states and europe 
the official who asked not to be identified said there are no 
reliable figures on the amount of these assets but they are 
believed to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
noriega was indicted last year by two florida grand juries on 
drug smuggling charges 
for more than a week there has been a steady drumbeat of 
administration allegations that noriega has been laying the 
groundwork for a rigged process aimed at ensuring victory for his 
handpicked presidential candidate carlos duque 
on friday state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
expressed suspicion about a huge increase in the 
officiallyannounced numbers of registered voters over the past 
five years suggesting that the figures were falsified 
panamanian authorities meanwhile have been accusing the united 
states of meddling in the election seizing on published reports 
that the administration secretly provided 10 million to the 
opposition coalition 
the reagan administration imposed a series of sanctions against 
panama last year after noriega and his allies ousted president eric 
arturo delvalle among other actions 50 million in panamanian 
government assets in the united states were frozen 
the united states continues to recognize delvalle as the 
legitimate authority in panama and has said there can be no 
normalization of relations with any panamanian government dominated 
by noriega 
the officials cautioned that no concrete decisions have been 
made on future punitive action if as expected a fraudulent 
election is held 
over the medium term one decision that will be forced on the 
administration concerns the appointment for the first time of a 
panamanian as administrator of the panama canal commission which 
is responsible for running the waterway 
the canal treaties specify that panama later this year will 
nominate a candidate to head the commission subject to us 
approval and senate confirmation 
the nominee would take office next year but would be subject to 
policy guidelines issued by the canals board of directors where 
us members are in the majority 
the official said his personal view is that the administration 
will not accept a norieganominated candidate but the final 
decision on that issue has not yet been made 
if the us refuses to allow a panamanian to lead the 
commission this could leave the administration open to charges of 
violating the canal treaties for the time being however the 
administration position is that it has every intention of abiding 
by the terms of the treaty 
noriega a 52yearold ustrained military man has gone from 
a favorite of us antidrug and intelligence agencies to an 
outcast whom the us now accuses of corruption drug trafficking 
and internal repression 
noriega was intelligence chief under the late dictator omar 
torrijos and as such collaborated with us agencies for years 
like torrijos he has maintained contacts with latin governments 
and military leaders not too friendly to the united states 
his backers maintain the united states would have been better 
advised to work with noriega in exploiting those ties than trying 
to oust him 
the us government has acted in a very stupid manner maj 
edgardo lopez a spokesman for noriega said recently in panama 
city the drug charge against noriega is a cover the us does 
not care about drugs if it did it would fight consumption at home 
they want noriega out because he opposed an invasion of nicaragua 
and the training of contras in panama and because he opposes plans 
by the united states to keep its forces here beyond the year 2000 
besides freezing panamanian government funds in the united 
states the bush administration has withheld panama canal fees of 
more than 90 million and has refused to pay panamanian taxes the 
canal commission withholds from its panamanian employees salaries 
even so us expenditures in panama total more than 500 
million a year largely from the 12000 us soldiers at military 
installations of the southern command that gives the united states 
considerably more leverage for increased economic pressure if it so 
desires

derision from outside experts hasnt 
wilted hometown enthusiasm for tabletop experiments to create 
fusion at room temperature or dampened state political support for 
the utah chemist whose claim startled the scientific world 
there was criticism of pasteur when he didnt handle his 
things exactly the way conventional wisdom said he should handle 
them said republican gov norm bangerter who persuaded the 
legislature last month to appropriate 5 million for additional 
fusion research at the university of utah 
like louis pasteur the 19th century chemist who refuted such 
accepted theories as spontaneous generation and developed 
pasteurization and the anthrax and rabies vaccines utah scientists 
hope to have a hand in developing a process with great economic 
significance 
theres a lot of money at stake theres certainly a great 
deal of professional jealousy said bangerter 
stanley pons a utah chemistry professor and martin 
fleischmann a chemist at the university of southampton in england 
announced march 23 they had sustained a controlled fusion reaction 
by running current through a palladium electrode dipped in heavy 
water water made from a variant of hydrogen called deuterium 
they contend that their experiments produce 10 times the amount 
of energy they consume enough to boil water and conceivably spin 
turbines to produce electricity such cold fusion cold in 
comparison with the ultrahigh temperatures scientists have thought 
were necessary to achieve fusion could provide the world with a 
relatively safe and virtually inexhaustible energy supply 
if the experimenters are wrong their work could join the 
permanent artificial heart also a utah invention as a curiosity 
in the annals of failed science 
scientists and editorial writers have chastised the university 
for trumpeting unconfirmed claims the utah response has been to 
close ranks 
bangerter and lawmakers insist the 5 million which is to be 
spent only when an advisory council appointed by the governor is 
satisfied the fusion claims have merit is a prudent investment in 
the states future in washington rep wayne owens dutah is 
pushing a bill to create a 25 million fusion research center in 
salt lake city 
criticism at am american physical society meeting tuesday in 
baltimore bordered on ridicule physicists from massachusetts 
institute of technology stanford university and other prestigious 
scientific centers declared that pons and fleischmann had made 
fundamental errors in calculating the heat generated by their 
experiment 
the denunciations stunned even brigham young university 
physicist steven jones who also claims to have achieved cold 
fusion in a jar but has criticized utahs claims of excess heat 
i was suprised at the ponsfleischmann criticism and actually 
a bit shocked at some of the comments said jones whose own 
work which produced far less energy received much kinder 
treatment at the conference 
frankly i think it was too strident but i dont think 
theyre motivated by professional jealousy theyre opinionated 
people jones said of the critical physicists many of whom have 
spent years working on thermonuclear or hot fusion 
ray hixson chairman of the states newly created fusionenergy 
advisory council said academics dont take this sort of thing 
very easily they react by protecting their own turf and own 
research 
the council will meet may 19 to establish criteria for 
determining whether the experiment has been confirmed hixson said 
he wants to see the utah claims duplicated at two or three other 
institutions before any of the 5 million is spent 
nevertheless he said he is convinced there is fusion in the 
utah test tubes 
the question in our minds is can it have a practical value 
hixon said what they did they did and they measured it 
correctly 
owens said enthusiasm in congress for cold fusion was chilled by 
the baltimore meeting but james brophy the universitys vice 
president for research predicted opinions will change after a 
meeting of the electrochemical society in los angeles on monday 
he said several universities that have at least partly confirmed 
the utah results will present papers as will pons and fleischmann

thousands of black and white 
mourners saturday staged the largest antiapartheid march of the 
3yearold state of emergency chanting through whitesonly suburbs 
in a funeral procession for an assassinated white activist 
young blacks gave clenched fist salutes waved banners and sang 
in support of the outlawed african national congress guerrilla 
movement as they jogged in unison behind the hearse or perched atop 
overflowing buses for a sixmile journey from a downtown cathedral 
to a cemetery 
david webster 44 was killed outside his home monday by a 
shotgun blast fired at close range from a passing car police have 
issued sketches of three unidentified white men suspected in the 
killing which provoked grief and anger throughout the 
antiapartheid movement 
a professor of anthropology webster was one of the few senior 
white members of the predominantly black united democratic front a 
nationwide antiapartheid coalition he was a leading critic of 
detention without trial and had researched the numerous unsolved 
killings and abductions of antiapartheid activists that have 
occurred over the past decade 
he helped us realize there are white people who are human 
beings said the rev frank chikane a black church leader at a 
threehour funeral service at st marys anglican cathedral his 
life should be a message to all white south africans to rediscover 
the humanity that could make this country free 
more than 2000 people of all races filled the cathedral 
hundreds more stood outside singing freedom songs 
hundreds of policemen some in helicopters monitored the 
funeral and the route which the roughly 5000 marchers and 
busriders took to west park cemetery police stayed away from the 
gravesite where four young blacks unfurled a large anc flag after 
hiding their faces 
other youths joined clergymen in sprinkling dirt onto the wooden 
coffin after it was lowered into the grave said one of the 
ministers veteran white activist beyers naude david is saying 
stop the violence stop the killings stop the injustice 
antigovernment parades are illegal in south africa and most 
funerals of slain activists have been restricted by police during 
the emergency with limits placed on the number of mourners 
content of speeches and size of the funeral procession 
but websters funeral was not restricted and policemen watched 
impassively as throngs of militant mourners paraded past them 
at the cathedral eulogies were interspersed with performances 
by white and black singers and a black jazz group the mourners 
included diplomats from the united states and other western 
countries human rights activists from across south africa 
residents of a remote zulu community where webster conducted 
research and fellow supporters of a soweto soccer team the 
orlando pirates 
those in the crowd included raymond suttner a white 
antiapartheid academic freed last year after two years in 
detention johnny clegg south africas most successful pop music 
star who flew back from a us tour to honor webster and winnie 
mandela wife of jailed anc leader nelson mandela 
mohammed valli moosa a united democratic front official and 
former detainee described webster as a gallant soldier whose 
determination to fight apartheid was more important than his life 
he said websters support of detainees during the emergency in 
which about 30000 activists have been held without charge for 
varying periods denied the government the ability to break our 
spirits 
helen joseph an 84yearold white activist whom south african 
media are not allowed to quote was the first speaker 
the guilt for davids death lies squarely on the shoulders of 
the national party government she said

faye prater embraced the idea of 
japanesestyle management and its benevolent attitude toward 
workers when she went to work for nissan at its new hightech plant 
six years ago 
today shes on longterm disability at 60 percent of her pay 
having poor balance and headaches from being struck with a 50pound 
chunk of sheet metal she says she expects to be fired when her 
disability pay expires in december though the company says it has 
no such plans her case is being highlighted in a union organizing 
campaign 
im thoroughly for the union mrs prater 47 said tuesday 
from her home in mcminnville 
im like a lot of people down there its the best job they 
ever had in their lives everybody down there loves everybody but 
if you ever get hurt its out the door the people need a union 
the united auto workers is preparing to ask the national labor 
relations board to conduct an election to let 3200 production 
workers at nissan motor manufacturing usas only plant decide 
whether to join the union 
the uaw has a mixed record at japaneseowned auto plants in the 
united states the union withdrew its organizing petition at a 
honda plant in marysville ohio general motors agreed to union 
representation at its joint venture with toyota in freemont 
calif and the union represents workers at the diamond star plant 
a joint venture between chrysler and mitsubishi in bloomington ill 
in smyrna the union is handing out fliers with the pictures and 
stories of employees who say they are off the job because of 
injuries 
mrs prater who was injured more than 18 months ago said 
nissan promised to find her a job performing lighter work than her 
assemblyline job but none has been offered yet 
rick sommer nissan vice president for manufacturing and a 
former ford engineer said a lightduty job should be waiting for 
mrs prater when shes ready to return 
he would not say she absolutely will have such a job but said 
i can think of only two times where a person has not returned to 
work in the eight years ive been here 
maxey irwin a communications consultant hired by the uaw was 
much less optimistic 
when people get hurt in that plant theres no other place for 
them to go at a uaworganized plant theres other jobs for them 
to do but at this place they give their bodies to nissan and 
nissan does not have a job for them irwin said 
union organizers portray nissan managers as transplanted detroit 
executives who subscribe to antiquated management style and abuse 
employees by continually speeding up the assembly line 
nissan says the japanese participatory style of management 
which encourages worker involvement and teamwork with management 
does not include third parties like the uaw 
the company says workers are happy with salaries that range from 
1255 to 1719 an hour and benefits that equal those of 
uaworganized auto plants 
nissan came in here with the japanese style of management but 
nissans 15000 miles away the people who run this plant are old 
ford people said irwin 
uaw organizers said they should be ready to file an organizing 
petition with the nlrb in about two weeks which could lead to an 
election in june or july 
nissan says the organizing efforts are disruptive and the uaw 
should speed up the process 
weve had a number of questions from people whove been 
badgered even at home sommer said 
the uaw has a national membership of just under 1 million union 
spokesman frank joyce of detroit said uaw membership peaked in 
1979 at about 15 million since then about 120000 canadian 
members branched off to form the canadian auto workers union joyce 
blamed the rest of the losses on industrial cutbacks 
nissan announced an expansion april 3 that will add 2000 jobs 
and boost annual production to 440000 cars and light pickup trucks 
a year the company says that would make the smyrna plant the 
nations largest automobile production factory by 1992

be drunk on the night the ship ran aground a newspaper reported 
saturday 
there was no indication there was anything wrong third mate 
gregory cousins told the tampa tribune in his first interview since 
the march 24 accident 
cousins who exxon has said was operating the 987foot ship when 
it hit the charted reef has been on leave at home in tampa 
preparing his testimony on the 10 million gallon crude oil spill 
for a national transportation safety board hearing may 16 in 
anchorage alaska 
cousins who described ship capt joseph hazelwood as 
extremely competent defended similar statements from other 
crew members about hazelwoods apparent sobriety when the tanker 
grounded 
its not like were circling the wagons its just the 
truth cousins said 
hazelwood of huntington ny was fired by exxon when tests 
conducted more than 10 hours after the accident showed a 
bloodalcohol level above the 04 percent permitted under coast 
guard regulations he faces trial june 20 in valdez on charges of 
operating the vessel while drunk 
cousins who was not certified to navigate prince william sound 
faces a coast guard review of his license and must testify at state 
and federal trials resulting from the spill 
the associated press was unable to reach cousins on saturday 
because he has an unlisted telephone number 
in the interview he did not make specific comments on his role 
during the accident he told the newspaper he is eager to tell his 
side of the story but his attorney has advised him to wait for the 
ntsb hearing 
i think all the pieces have been reported but they havent 
been put together right said cousins who was responsible for 
safety and emergency equipment on the tanker 
he spent two days after the accident in valdez listened to 
public reaction and was disturbed about misperceptions about tanker 
crews 
its a tragedy of some enormity you cant blame people for 
being outraged he said emotions were running high 
cousins called the spill damage sickening but said he believes 
exxon is doing all it can with cleanup no matter what anyone 
says 
the oil has moved about 500 miles southwest of valdez fouling 
the shore at the katmai national park wildlife refuge and other 
areas 
cousins said the past six weeks have been stressful for him and 
his wife michelle 
were trying to stabilize things around here michelle has 
been harassed by constant questions he said she didnt know 
what was going on those first few days when i wasnt around i was 
very worried about her welfare

students at beijings most prestigious university 
voted saturday to continue a twoweek class boycott for democratic 
reforms despite calls by protest leaders to drop the strike 
the developments indicated that chinas fledgling student 
movement the biggest in its 40year history faces serious 
organizational problems 
the united association of beijing universities an independent 
group that has organized three weeks of demonstrations urged that 
students head back to class and continue their campaign through 
speeches plays and pamphlets 
more than 70000 beijing students have been boycotting classes 
since april 24 and students at many schools began returning to 
class friday following a huge protest at tiananmen square 
but at beijing university students ignored the plea 
each dormitory room received a ballot and the final tally was 
865 rooms to 303 in favor of continuing the boycott with more than 
100 rooms abstaining each dormitory room sleeps six to eight 
students 
some students at beijing normal university also said they would 
stay out of school 
activists said they wanted to continue the strike because they 
were not satisfied with the results of the student movement 
we must continue to pressure the government and struggle until 
the movement is victorious said one student leader the 
government has given us nothing they still call us illegal 
but members of the united association said they were satisfied 
with the results of the campaign and did not think it would be 
possible to hold any new protests 
the main thing we created was an atmosphere said wang 
zhixin a student leader from the college of politics and law we 
have brought the word democracy into the lives of the people of 
china 
another student group representing at least 24 universities sent 
an appeal to the government and ruling communist party on saturday 
for a dialogue on the students demands for democracy and an end to 
corruption 
the twopage appeal was sent two days after communist party 
chief zhao ziyang made a conciliatory call for dialogue 
the new group the student dialogue representative group was 
formed after the government refused to meet with the united 
association which it declared illegal 
also saturday the legal daily reported that a railway worker 
was sentenced to death for participating in violence triggered by 
an april 22 student march in xian 
the sentence was the first report of punishment meted out since 
the demonstrations began april 15 after the death of ousted 
communist party leader hu yaobang 
the daily said zhang jun was on trial with 900 other people 
accused of attacking government offices in xian following a student 
march it did not say if anyone else was sentenced

hanif sutton never had a chance 
his father was in jail his mother had taken in a convicted drug 
addict who allegedly forced her into prostitution neighbors 
suspected hanif was being beaten but didnt speak up and a state 
social worker didnt detect any danger during repeated visits with 
the boy and his mother 
hanif died last week at the age of 3 
randolph scott who was living with hanif and his mother 
rosalyn rochester has been charged with the childs murder and 
with assault and battery of both hanif and rochester 
i personally havent ever handled anything so gruesome said 
lowell police inspector david tousignant and all the veteran 
detectives who have been here awhile they say this is one of the 
most horrifying cases theyve seen 
investigators say that scott 38 left prison in late january 
and moved in with rochester a short time later forcing her into 
prostitution to support his heroin habit as he had done with 
several women in the past 
they shared a cramped ramshackle house with four other families 
in this former mill town of 90000 just south of the new hampshire 
border 
as time went on authorities say scotts violence toward the 
boy and his mother escalated by the time of hanifs death police 
said the boys back looked like leather from repeated beatings and 
burns and there were three big bruises on his face 
scott told investigators that he hit the boy because he was 
wetting his pants and he was lazy tousignant said 
why didnt the 23yearold mother get help she was in total 
fear of scott almost a paralyzing fear said tousignant 
tousignant said he found the case frustrating because so many 
people had a chance to speak up and didnt 
the only ones who tried were an anonymous tipster who complained 
to authorities that the boy was not getting needed medical care 
and hanifs 5yearold cousin who lived in the same building and 
was hanifs best friend 
my son came running to me when i got home crying mommy 
mommy my cousins getting hit too much said the 5yearolds 
mother 
he got hit with a belt buckle and a shoe the boy said 
the boys warning to his mother came april 28 when the woman 
returned home from a threeweek jail term the boy had stayed with 
hanif and his mother for two weeks while his own mother was in jail 
that same day another neighbor also saw hanifs bruises 
rochester told her that the boy fell out of bed the woman said she 
wanted to tell authorities about the beating but was afraid of 
scott 
it would have caused a lot of problems for me and my kids 
she said so i just told my boyfriend that i was going to mind my 
own problems 
actually authorities already had been alerted about hanif the 
state department of social services had been checking on him since 
february after an anonymous tipster claimed the boy wasnt 
receiving proper attention for an ear infection 
a social worker first met with rochester on feb 17 and reported 
that she was making an effort to care for hanif and that the boy 
had visited a doctor the social worker met with hanif and his 
mother six times and the mother separately three times according 
to dss spokeswoman lorraine carli 
rochester missed an appointment april 21 the social worker went 
to her home april 27 but no one was home by last weekend it was 
too late hanif was taken to the hospital at about 430 am april 
30 and died the following day 
the autopsy showed hanif died of blunt trauma to the head 
according to tousignant there also was evidence he may have been 
sexually assaulted 
the dss was aware of scotts drug use and had unverified 
information about rochester being a prostitute carli said the 
department was concerned that scott may have been abusing 
rochester but had no indication that hanif was being harmed except 
for possibly being neglected 
its a very difficult dilemma on whats appropriate when 
youre dealing with a family carli said thats why the whole 
system is set up so that people can make reports to us at any time 
of the day 
things seem more simple to hanifs young cousin and his mother 
i just say thank god my kid got out of there the mother 
said

the first of the new biloxi schooner 
sailboats is in the water bringing back memories of the vessels 
that once turned the mississippi coast city into the 
selfproclaimed seafood capital of the world 
eightysevenyearold glenn swetman smiled broadly as the boat 
that carries his name plunged into back bay on friday from a 
boatyard in diberville across the bay from here 
the sailboat was named for him because his bank made a large 
contribution to the private effort to bring back the era of sailing 
schooners here eventually the 68foot twomasted glenn l 
swetman will be joined by a second asyetunnamed schooner 
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the schooners 
harvested gulf shrimp and oysters and raced one another in the 
offseasons 
both the seafood title and the fishing fleets became victims of 
change when motorized boats began scooping up a depleting bounty 
and schooners largely disappeared by the 1930s 
the glenn l swetman wont be scooping up shrimp and oysters 
but it will race and earn its keep as a charter and educational 
boat 
the schooner project begun in 1986 and a seafood industry 
museum are part of an effort to revive the biloxi waterfront 
now this is true progress with preservation bringing back 
historic boats as a symbol of our revival said biloxi mayor 
gerald blessey as he watched the schooner slip into the water we 
are already getting requests for charters for this boat even for 
convention parties 
numerous fundraisers private contributions and an 80000 bank 
loan have footed the bill for the 200000 schooner

copper workers from the official trade 
union alliance and from solidarity struck four mines in 
southwestern poland for a second day saturday to demand higher pay 
jan sugalski a local solidarity activist said the miners were 
demanding a 50 percent pay increase he said they earn 118 to 176 
a month 
sugalski said the miners formed a strike committee of 
representatives from the official trade union alliance opzz and 
the recently legalized solidarity union talks between the 
committee and management have so far failed to settle the strike 
the state news agency pap said 
a sevenyear ban on solidarity was lifted april 17 under an 
agreement the opposition and communist authorities reached during 
broadbased talks that were held after a serious wave of strikes 
last year 
workers were striking at the lubin polkowice rudna and 
sieroszowice mines near the city of lubin 200 miles southwest of 
warsaw sugalski and pap said 
sugalski said more than 20000 miners joined the strike which 
began friday morning pap said the miners struck the morning shift 
and were joined by workers on the afternoon shift pap gave no 
figures on the number of strikers 
sugalski said the striking miners remained on the surface of the 
pits and were carrying out maintenance underground 
on friday the strikers handed over a list of demands all of 
which concerned pay and they were rejected by management he said

in new york city where atrocities against 
children have been the stuff of headlines for two years officials 
have twice confirmed the obvious there is a crisis in services for 
victimized kids 
in one report issued last week state social services 
commissioner cesar perales found that child welfare workers often 
mishandled investigations and failed to monitor troubled families 
he also faulted the way children were placed in foster homes and 
accused the city of sloppy recordkeeping poor supervision and 
unclear policies 
a day later the human resources administration the citys 
child welfare agency issued its own report which made many of the 
same criticisms in at least three cases said the report children 
died in 1988 in households that should have been visited frequently 
by social workers but were not 
in 1988 according to a city panel 127 children may have died 
of abuse or neglect of those 58 or nearly half were previously 
known to child welfare authorities the panel said 18 of the deaths 
led to sanctions against welfare workers ranging from warnings and 
memos to resignations 
a series of muchpublicized horrors have made child welfare an 
issue in the citys current mayoral campaign 
the first was the killing of 6yearold lisa steinberg in 
november 1987 police and school officials were scored for failing 
to notice that the girl had been abused the man who adopted her 
illegally joel steinberg was convicted of manslaughter earlier 
this year 
the states examination of how the city handled childabuse 
cases was prompted by the beating death last december of jessica 
cortez a 5yearold whose case was known to welfare workers for 
some time the girls mother and her boyfriend have been charged in 
the death 
the state report said children taken from their parents were 
shuttled from office to office bedded on cots placed in 
inappropriate settings and separated from their brothers and 
sisters 
the state report also alleged that there were instances when 
welfare workers did not look up records even though they knew the 
records existed when there were no visits to homes in which child 
abuse had been reported and when families did not receive 
counseling or other services ordered by family court judges 
in one case the agency didnt even know that a child had frozen 
to death in a familys unheated house the report said 
but the report asserted that many of the problems encountered 
by child protective workers today are really beyond their 
mandate particularly escalating drug use by parents

the battleship iowa will be returned to sea 
duty next month while still awaiting repairs on its badly damaged 
no 2 turret defense officials said saturday 
the officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
indicated the iowa would serve a normal tour of four to six 
months in the northern atlantic and mediterranean before being 
returned stateside for repair of the turret next winter 
aside from the disabled turret where an explosion killed 47 
sailors during practice firing on april 19 the ship is sound 
said one official dont forget he added shes still got 
two other turrets of three 16inch guns and a whole mess of cruise 
missiles 
in addition to their big guns the iowa and three sister 
battleships the wisconsin the missouri and the new jersey each 
bear 32 tomahawk cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear 
warheads 1000 miles as well as four 20mm antimissile guns and 16 
harpoon missiles than can hit ships up to 60 miles away 
while declining as usual to specify dates of the iowas new 
tour officials said the ship likely would leave its home port at 
norfolk va next month 
the ship could use its two other turrets as well as other 
weapons systems if it became involved in hostilities but a 
moratorium against testfiring the 16inch guns remains in effect 
until the navy determines the cause of the accident the officials 
noted the moratorium decreed by adm carlisle a h trost 
applies to the three other world war iivintage battleships as well 
as the iowa 
the officials said the decision to return the iowa to sea before 
repairing the no 2 turret at an estimated cost of 15 million to 
20 million was made to avoid disrupting normal fleet schedules as 
well as shipyard schedules 
to begin the repairs now they said would force costly delays 
on work scheduled for other ships by sending the iowa to sea with 
the damaged turret sealed the navy will be better able to plan for 
the repair of the battleship including the determination of which 
shipyard is best suited for the work 
that also will enable officials to seek regular appropriations 
from congress next fiscal year for the repairs rather than dipping 
into an alreadydepleted discretionary account for the atlantic 
fleet they noted 
after the explosion which occurred during a training exercise 
330 miles northeast of puerto rico the navy said at first that it 
did not know whether it could find either the parts of the 
technicians to fix the guns which are nearly 50 years old since 
then however chief defense department spokesman dan howard has 
said the navy was satisfied the job could be done for 15 million 
to 20 million despite estimates of some private experts that 
ranged as high as 100 million

kidnappers have threatened to kill a west 
german hostage unless a court grants a light sentence to a lebanese 
hijacker in west germany and cyprus frees another terrorist a plo 
official said saturday 
west germany initially had been skeptical of the kidnapping 
claim but said saturday it was convinced it was dealing with a 
hostage crisis 
the missing west german reportedly is one of three who 
palestinian officials say were abducted thursday by unidentified 
kidnappers two of the west germans turned up safe friday and the 
palestinians said they had been freed by the kidnappers 
the life of the man still held is in danger unless a west german 
court grants a lenient sentence to mohammed ali hamadi and cyprus 
frees within 10 days a lebanese man supposedly jailed there said 
lt co wajih abu ali head of the palestine liberation 
organizations military police in sidon 
abu ali said the two freed germans heinrich struebig 48 and 
petra schnitzler 26 told him of the kidnappers demands during a 
meeting at the mieh mieh palestinian refugee camp 
they told me that they were asked in english by their five 
kidnappers to transmit their demands to the bonn government and the 
cypriot authorities he said 
palestinian officers have identified the missing man as markus 
michael 25 the west german television network zdf identified him 
as markus quint 24 and west germanys ard television identified 
him as 21yearold markus quient 
he and the other two west germans work for the asmehumanitas 
humanitarian organization which delivers medical aid to the sidon 
region palestinian officers say they were abducted on the 
outskirts of sidon 
abu ali said struebig and schnitzler identified the lebanese 
held in cyrpus as amin sahour a shiite moslem lebanese 
cypriot authorities had no comment on the demand 
official lists of arab prisoners on the mediterranean island do 
not include amin sahour but a lebanese man named amin zaarour was 
sentenced in september 1987 to seven years in jail after a suitcase 
full of grenades was found in his apartment 
i asked them if the kidnappers have said what they would do if 
their demands were not met abu ali said they told me that the 
kidnappers said that michaels life will be threatened 
hamadi a 23yearold shiite moslem is on trial in frankfurt on 
air piracy and murder charges in the 1985 hijacking of a twa 
airline to beirut us navy diver robert stethem was slain during 
the ordeal a verdict is expected this month 
west germanys ambassador to lebanon wolfgangf gottelmann met 
saturday in moslem west beirut with acting prime minister salim 
hoss who heads the moslem cabinet in lebanons splintered 
government 
afterward gottelmann said all i can say is that two german 
citizens had disappeared and theyve shown up again after a short 
while 
they confirmed that a third german citizen is still missing 
and were confident he also will show up gottelmann said 
in bonn a west german official said the government has had no 
direct contact with the kidnappers but said it no longer is 
skeptical an abduction took place 
we have to conclude now that a west german indeed has been 
kidnapped said a foreign ministry official speaking on the 
condition of anonymity 
there are 15 foreigners known to be held hostage in lebanon 
including nine americans terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press is the longestheld of the

communist firebrand boris n yeltsin said saturday 
more than one person could be considered for the soviet presidency 
but he shied away from declaring himself a candidate to face the 
most likely contender his onetime supporter mikhail s gorbachev 
the congress of peoples deputies the parliament to which 
yeltsin was elected by a landslide meets may 25 to choose a 
president from among its 2250 members 
if past communist party practice holds gorbachev the current 
president and communist party generalsecretary will be the only 
candidate 
but in an interview the 58yearold yeltsin did not discount 
the possibility of alternative candidates 
there could be other suggestions from deputies he said but 
indicating the opponents might not make it past the stage of 
preliminary discussion he added that doesnt mean there will be 
a vote among several alternative candidates 
yeltsin would not say who he would like to see run against 
gorbachev 
well wait for the session he said he has said repeatedly 
he does not consider himself a candidate 
in late april there were indications some moscow deputies 
planned to propose an alternative candidate but after meeting with 
gorbachev on wednesday one of those deputies mikhail bocharov 
said nominating anyone but the kremlin chief would be silly 
gorbachev has been party generalsecretary since march 1985 and 
president since oct 1 he supports multiplecandidate elections 
such as the march 26 parliamentary vote but has not said whether 
the presidential race should be contested 
there is token official opposition to gorbachev who was 
rejected by 12 of the 641 policymaking central committee members 
and alternates in his bid to join the new congress he was among a 
slate of communist party officials who were simply chosen rather 
than elected to the parliament 
gorbachev brought yeltsin into the soviet leadership in 1985 
but the two quarreled after yeltsin criticized the slow pace of 
political reforms yeltsin was ousted as moscow party chief and 
dropped as a nonvoting politburo member 
under constitutional amendments approved in november the vote 
for president will be conducted in secret the congress will also 
elect 542 of its members to the supreme soviet a fulltime 
legislature 
yeltsin reiterated that the people should have a say in setting 
rules for the presidential election 
let the people determine who the chairman will be and not 
2250 deputies yeltsin said 
as for his own political future yeltsin said he should be 
chosen for the supreme soviet because of his popularity he won his 
moscow parliamentary race with 90 percent of the vote 
no one had so many voters almost 6 million and that must 
be considered although my personality will also be considered 
he said 
the communist party has branded yeltsin politically immature 
but he said hundreds of deputies support him

policy one area in which he is expected to have input involves 
cambodia where vietnamese troops are scheduled to end their 
decadelong occupation sept 30 
quayle said his second foreign excursion as vice president his 
first was in february to venezuela and el salvador gave him an 
understanding of a range of issues as well as the personalities who 
shape them 
i am now in personal contact with those leaders he said 
the trip was full of exotic photo opportunities quayle mingling 
with sarongclad women pago pago quayle golfing with singapores 
deputy prime minister quayle in a coverall touring an oilslick 
beach in alaska quayle cuddling cambodian refugees in a camp six 
miles from the thaicambodian border 
he even tried scuba diving on australias great barrier reef 
the vice presidents tour bore similarities to one president 
bush made in the spring of 1982 when he was vice president bush 
visited australia singapore japan south korea and china 
but larry sabato a political science professor at the 
university of virginia said quayles trip was more important for 
him because bush already had wide experience in foreign affairs 
when he became vice president 
bush was a former head of the cia ambassador to the united 
nations and chief us liaison officer to china a rank tantamount 
to ambassador during the establishment of full diplomatic 
relations with the communist nation 
quayle is a former senator from indiana with limited experience 
in foreign affairs although he is wellversed in defense policy 
before the recent trip japan was the only pacific country 
quayle had visited 
sabato said trips like quayles are crucial to expand his 
breadth of knowledge and let americans particularly the vice 
presidents conservative republican supporters know he can handle 
himself as a diplomat 
this is onthejob training sabato said such trips help 
quayle as long as he doesnt make any major mistakes he said 
for dan quayle no news is good news 
abroad as at home quayle attracts interest sabato said from 
people who want to know whether hes really the way democratic 
opponents portrayed him as in the 1988 election campaign a 
wetbehindtheears goodnatured sports buff without the 
intellectual facilities necessary to lead the largest nation in the 
free world 
hes viewed as a curiosity sabato said 
nowhere was more attention paid to quayle than in australia 
where he had a wellpublicized runin with officials over subsidies 
the united states pays to its wheat farmers the australians say 
price supports hurt their exports abroad quayle says they dont 
and besides theyre aimed at protectionist policies in europe not 
australia 
its a very sensitive issue with the australians the vice 
president said 
in a column in the sydney morning news the day after quayle 
arrived tony stephens wrote that quayle apparently had chosen to 
visit australia because it was a friendly nation 
the rationale for this piece of diplomacy was mr quayles 
bumbling effort in the presidential campaign he wrote now 
however mr quayle is apparently growing into his job 
another writer in the national newspaper the australian said 
the australian national press corps clearly enjoyed mr quayles 
brand of humor in an appearance at canberras national press club 
australia was the place quayle said he would have liked more 
time particularly canberra the capital there quayle a 
selfdescribed member of a new generation of world leaders 
said he enjoyed seeing contemporaries like 40yearold defense 
minister kim beazley 
the vice president acknowledged he played down his new 
generation theme in thailand and indonesia two countries with a 
layer of older leaders 
in indonesia quayle met with human rights activists but 
refrained from publicly criticizing president suharto on the issue 
in singapore quayle said he had a long and profound 
discussion with prime minister lee kuan yew about press freedom and 
human rights in that small bustling citystate 
in jakarta indonesia quayle highlighted his talks with prince 
norodom sihanouk a former cambodian head of state who resides 
there sihanouk leader of the noncommunist resistance is favored 
by washington to lead a transition government in cambodia the 
united states is weighing whether to give him military aid 
meantime quayles aides are planning his next foreign foray 
possibly to africa in the fall quayle said he also wants to see 
more of latin america

comatose the communist youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said 
the newspaper said the incident was the third in which people 
were reported harmed by residue from the gas used by security 
forces during the april 9 riots in tbilisi the georgian capital

there have been numerous conflicting reports about the nature of 
the gas which has not been identified but has been blamed for at 
least two deaths and for nervous system disorders to hundreds of 
people 
communist party leaders in the republic were ousted after the 
muchcriticized decision to send troops against the 
proindependence demonstrators 
gennady i gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
said last week that a kremlin commission investigating the clash 
identified one component of the gas as a chemical known in the west 
as cs an incapacitating agent 
almost 500 georgians have been treated for chemical poisoning 
the weekly moscow news reported last week 
international red cross doctors were en route to tbilisi on 
saturday to help treat victims of the gas poisoning because local 
doctors have been unable to find a cure the local news agency 
gruzinform said 
komsomolskaya pravda said 230 people were hospitalized 
including eight in serious condition 
the newspaper under the headline find a clear answer said 
millions of flowers strewn by people mourning the dead in 
tbilisi apparently absorbed the gas and that 60 maintenance workers 
became ill and were hospitalized while making preparations for a 
permanent memorial to the dead 
such chemical compounds which caused these particular symptoms 
have already been found at a school and a theater institute located 
not far from the square the newspaper said and now in 
flowers 
it did not say when the workers were hospitalized 
the newspaper called on officials to reveal the name of the gas 
so doctors can treat the injured 
a deputy chief military prosecutor involved in the investigation 
indicated in an izvestia article that some chemicals remain 
unidentified 
it is necessary to find out what additives were used together 
with the cs gas vladimir vasilyev told izvestia 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov in tbilisi with 
another investigative panel told reporters at the local airport he 
supports red cross help activist sergei dandurov said in a 
telephone interview from tbilisi 
izvestia said sakharov and other commission members met thursday 
with georgias health minister and dandurov said they visited the 
injured in a hospital on friday 
in another development about 1000 georgian women gathered 
friday night on the site of the april 9 demonstration to demand 
that authorities take stronger action to treat gas poisoning 
victims dandurov said

christian sectors on the citys port around the christian 
enclaves northern coastline and in summer resort towns in the 
central mountains above the capital 
police said seven civilians including a pregnant woman were 
killed and 22 wounded in west beirut three were killed and 11 
wounded in christian east beirut 
the latest violence brought the overall death toll to 288 since

alliance of syrian and druse moslem militiamen 
another 1044 have been wounded according to police count 
a police spokesman said casualty figures from bombarded 
districts outside the citys municipal boundaries were not 
immediately available 
the duels crushed a ceasefire brokered nine days ago by the 
arab league it was the fourth such ceasefire in two months 
since the latest truce was declared rockets had been fired at 
the christian enclave but aouns forces had not returned fire 
police said they struck back after nightfall saturday opening 
up with a heavy barrage of 155mm artillery fire 
tens of thousands of residents stunned by the sudden escalation 
scurried to basements and underground bunkers as syrian gunners 
opened up with multibarreled rocket launchers that fire 40 rockets

all hell has broken loose all over again said rita azar a 
christian woman reached by telephone in the bunker of her apartment

live 
the druse and moslem gunners also have demanded that observers 
be stationed at the main christian port of jounieh and the city of 
byblos to guard against iraqi arms shipments to aoun

for the first time since hungarys 1956 
antisoviet revolt official radio on saturday broadcast a speech 
premier imre nagy made while red army soldiers and tanks crushed 
the uprising 
the broadcast was seen as another step in a reassessment of that 
period in hungarys history and the show trial that led to nagys 
execution in 1958 
the emotional speech nagy gave on national radio on nov 4 
1956 informed his people that soviet forces had entered budapest 
to put down the revolt 
at dawn today soviet forces began an attack on our capital 
obviously with the aim of toppling the legal democratic hungarian 
government nagy said in the speech broadcast again saturday his 
voice trembling with emotion he said our troops are fighting 
the government is in place i am making this fact known to our 
people and the whole world 
that same day nagy took refuge in the yugoslav embassy weeks 
later he and his associates were kidnapped by the soviets and held 
in romania until brought back to hungary and executed in june 
1958 
recently hungarys revolt against stalinism and soviet rule and 
nagys role as its leader have been examined with more sympathy 
politburo reformer imre pozsgay declared in january that the revolt 
was a popular uprising and communist authorities opened up the 
archives to historians 
on june 16 the anniversary of his execution thousands of 
hungarians are expected to attend the reburial of nagy and his 
associates in a corner of a budapest cemetery where the bodies have 
lain in unmarked graves since 1958 
the broadcast saturday of nagys speech came in a morning 
broadcast on radio kossuth scholar maria ormos had just given a 
summary of a discussion held friday by historians they called for 
opening the archives on the 195358 period and they blamed soviet 
interference for the failure of the revolt and for the failure of a 
1953 attempt at reform 
after the interview the radio mentioned several new 
publications on the 1956 period including a compilation of the 
text of radio broadcasts by nagy and his supporters during the 
shortlived 1956 revolt the collection is edited by janos kenedi 
a wellknown member of hungarys democratic opposition 
kenedi told radio kossuth the material was collected by radio 
free europe and published abroad but would now appear for the first 
time in hungary 
the radio then closed out the broadcast with the nagy speech 
which has been broadcast on the usfunded munichbased rfe every 
nov 4 for years in memory of the end of the 1956 revolt 
the sweeping revision of hungarian history began after the 
ouster in may of janos kadar as communist party chief kadar took 
over as hungarian leader after the revolt was crushed his role in 
the uprising has never been clear and he has refused to give a 
public accounting of those days 
kadar 76 is said to be too ill to carry out official duties as 
honorary chairman of the party a post created when he was replaced 
as party chief last year by karoly grosz 
unconfirmed reports say that kadar is unhappy about the recent 
discussion of 1956 and the gradual rehabilitation of nagy a new 
biography of nagy is selling briskly and his picture appears on 
lapel pins sold in budapest kiosks

armenians have launched a new wave of protests to 
demand annexation of a disputed enclave and freedom for activists 
arrested in ethnic unrest residents and officials said saturday 
a strike beginning wednesday closed all businesses in 
stepanakert the administrative center of the disputed 
nagornokarabakh area said valery a sidorov a government 
official there only medical clinics foodprocessing plants and 
the power station remained open he said in a telephone interview 
the strikers are demanding that authorities in moscow reconsider 
their january decision to place nagornokarabakh under kremlin 
control sidorov said the strikers who are mostly ethnic 
armenians want to wrest the region from azerbaijan and incorporate 
it into the neighboring armenian republic 
the region in the caucasus mountains in the southwestern soviet 
union has been part of azerbaijan since 1923 armenians who make 
up threequarters of the regions 162000 people say they suffer 
discrimination by azerbaijanis 
armenians in nagornokarabakh and the armenian republic carried 
out strikes and demonstrations through most of last year until the 
earthquake in december that killed an estimated 25000 people more 
than 90 people were killed in the ethnic unrest 
sidorov said a group of local party officials wrote an open 
letter published in the nagornokarabakh press asking for a meeting 
with president mikhail s gorbachev to discuss the dispute 
rafael popoyan an activist in yerevan said people also went on 
strike to protest reports that the official in charge of 
nagornokarabakh arkady volsky ordered that more ethnic 
azerbaijanis be settled in the region they now comprise 23 percent 
of the regions population 
however sidorov said there has been no influx of azerbaijanis 
and that armenians instead have been moving to the area 
two residents reported that a crowd of armenians formed in 
yerevan the armenian capital on saturday night to demand that 
authorities free 11 activists the prisoners belong to the karabakh 
committee which spearheaded the drive for nagornokarabakhs 
alliance with armenia 
the activists were arrested in december but authorities have 
not announced any charges against them 
silva arutunyan an armenian poet who went to the gathering 
estimated the crowd at 50000 but armen minasyan a ninth grade 
teacher who also there put the figure at 1000 to 2000 the 
official soviet news media carried no report of the protest 
the two residents both speaking by telephone said the crowd 
dispersed after about 90 minutes when a speaker announced that 
another meeting would be held thursday 
popoyan also speaking by telephone said armenian television 
had broadcast warnings friday threatening that all available 
means would be used to control protests police and troops were 
posted at two popular demonstrations sites in downtown yerevan to 
block demonstrations he said 
yerevan and the azerbaijani capital baku were placed under 
martial law and public gatherings were banned in november because 
of the ethnic violence a curfew enforced by troops remains in 
effect

bush administration proponents of a greater 
us leadership role on global warming urged the white house to 
call now for an international convention on the subject but chief 
of staff john sununu said the idea was premature officials said 
saturday 
william reilly administrator of the environmental protection 
administration was among those who wanted us representatives to 
make an official diplomatic overture to that effect at a united 
nationssponsored meeting that begins monday in geneva the 
administration officials said 
the proponents including fred bernthal the assistant 
secretary of state for oceans and international environmental 
affairs contended it would be a strong symbolic move for bush to 
urge a convention of nations to develop a framework agreement on 
how to combat the global warming trend known as the greenhouse 
effect 
bush promised during the presidential campaign last year that he 
would be an environmental president and would call an international 
environmental conference to focus on tackling global warming 
however sununu and others took the position that the government 
is not yet ready to take such a step because more analysis is 
needed on economic and other effects of the dramatic actions needed 
against global warming officials said 
epa spokesman david cohen on saturday said reilly understood 
sununus cautious approach 
basically he sununu has been extremely supportive and he has 
said only that he has some questions that he wants answers said 
cohen adding that reilly believes the questions deserve 
answers 
although the proponents felt it would show a positive approach 
and would cost little for the united states to stake out a 
leadership position on the idea cohen said reilly believes 
sununus position was extremely reasonable 
however other officials were known to believe bush was missing 
the boat at a chance to show environmental leadership 
sununus office did not return calls for comment on saturday 
the idea being pushed would have been a formal us statement to 
other nations urging an international framework convention to 
negotiate such matters as joint monitoring research and other 
cooperative efforts on global warming said william nitze deputy 
assistant secretary of state for environment health and natural 
resources 
nitze will represent the united states at the geneva meeting 
this week where a working group of more than 20 nations is 
developing a report on response strategies to counter global 
warming the working group whose meeting will be chaired by 
bernthal is part of the unsponsored intragovernmental panel on 
climate change 
other countries may take the official initiative to move toward 
a framework convention on global warming but nitze said that 
absent a decision from president bush he will not be able to make 
any commitment 
politically there would have been an advantage to the 
president making a statement nitze said 
however he said the reason things are moving slowly on this 
issue is that many people are concerned about the cost of really 
addressing this problem 
for the united states to really do something to limit 
greenhouse gas emission may require some rather expensive and 
potentially disruptive policies he added theres a sense that 
if we were really to try to reduce emissions by any percentage we 
would have to make some very major investments 
the greenhouse effect is caused by burning of fossil fuels and 
other human activities that have loaded the atmosphere with gases 
and increased world temperatures scientific evidence has shown 
many scientists say global warming will cause significant rising 
of the seas and radical weather and rainfall patterns with dramatic 
effect on agriculture 
to turn around the trend would likely mean significant changes 
in everyday life including finding alternatives to fossil fuels 
for automobiles and industrial use creating dramatic impacts on 
the petroleum industry 
thus any us position on global warming would have 
governmentwide implications including in the departments of 
energy commerce treasury agriculture and defense and the office 
of management and budget 
governor sununu and others want to have a better grasp of what 
realistic options we could get people to accept before we start 
down the road that could lead to a commitment said nitze

the government criticized white house 
officials saturday for revealing details of a telephone 
conversation between chancellor helmut kohl and president bush who 
are locked in a nato policy dispute 
kohl and bush spoke by telephone friday in the latest attempt to 
resolve the feud over west germanys call for early talks with the 
warsaw pact on reducing shortrange nuclear missiles in europe 
officials in bonn refused to discuss the contents of the 
conversation saying bush and kohl had agreed to keep their talk 
confidential 
however the white house later said the two leaders had failed 
to resolve their differences 
kohls chief spokesman hans klein said saturday the west german 
government believed public disputes would reduce the chances of 
solving the problem before the may 2930 nato summit in brussels 
the more the positions are brought into the open and the more 
they are emphasized the harder it will be to achieve an exchange 
of opinions before the nato summit klein said 
the dispute between bonn and washington threatens to mar the 
harmony of the nato summit 
kohls centerright government is losing support among west 
germans increasingly upset with their strategic role in nato 
defenses and wooed by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs warm 
overtures to the west 
kohl wants talks on reducing the missiles to start soon and he 
wants to postpone a decision on modernizing the weapons until after 
next years elections 
the united states opposes any negotiations on the grounds that 
nato needs nuclear weapons to compensate for the overwhelming 
superiority of sovietbloc tanks artillery soldiers and other 
conventional forces washington also says the missiles soon will be 
obsolete and must be modernized 
the united states posture has not changed white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said after fridays 20minute telephone 
conversation between kohl and bush it does not appear that a 
basis for agreement is there but well continue to discuss it and 
see 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher the main 
proponent of early talks with the warsaw pact on saturday said 
the discussion on shortrange missiles has grown out of any 
proportion 
genscher in an interview on hesse state radio again urged 
talks with the warsaw pact and said west germany should have an 
important word in formulating western strategy as well as in 
formula506 0080

the attorney for a former winery 
worker charged with seven slayings said sonoma county authorities 
illegally brought ramon salcido back from mexico to stand trial 
public defender marteen miller said friday that he would file 
legal papers challenging the manner in which salcido was 
transported back to this country and the violation of a treaty 
with mexico 
after a brief santa rosa municipal court hearing in which 
salcido pleaded innocent to the seven counts of murder miller said 
he would make his appeal before a preliminary hearing scheduled to 
start sept 11 
salcido 28 is charged with murdering his wife two daughters 
motherinlaw two sistersinlaw and a coworker at the grand cru 
winery near his boyes hot springs home on april 14 
salcidos three daughters were found in a sonoma county dump 
with their throats slashed one daughter 3yearold carmina 
survived and remains under medical care at petaluma valley hospital 
salcido was apprehended in his native mexico by mexican police 
who were aided by the us drug enforcement administration 
international treaties prevent criminal suspects from being 
extradited from mexico without hearings even so mexican officials 
deported salcido without a hearing and he was flown back to santa 
rosa with sheriffs deputies on a private jet belonging to 
peanuts cartoonist charles schulz 
miller declined to say what action he might take if the judge 
agrees salcidos return to the us was illegal theoretically he 
could ask that salcido be returned to mexico or ask that charges be 
dismissed 
miller contends that an impartial trial is impossible in sonoma 
county 
salcido is kept in an isolated cell at the county jail under 
24hour supervision that acts as a suicide watch 
a gag order has been issued forbidding court and law enforcement 
authorities from discussing the case with reporters

months later attorney james coleman remains 
frustrated by ted bundys execution not so much because he failed 
to block it but because the whys behind his clients killing 
rampage will probably never be known 
i dont think it will ever be answered coleman said i 
dont think we came close 
coleman was bundys lead counsel for nearly three years and was 
among the witnesses at his jan 24 execution 
while he defended bundy blocking three death warrants before 
bundys execution on the fourth coleman purposely kept a low 
profile he answered news media questions only about specifics of 
bundys appeals and declined to appear on television news talk 
shows 
in a lengthy telephone interview from his washington office last 
week coleman reflected upon his dealings with one of americas 
most reviled murderers 
in his final days bundy was fixated on trying to understand 
what had caused his uncontrollable drive to brutalize young women 
coleman said bundy convicted of three florida murders confessed 
to 23 more in four states during talks with investigators who came 
to florida state prison in his last days 
i think he wanted to confess at least since he was arrested in 
florida in 1978 with varying degrees of intensity i think that 
more than that he wanted to talk about not only what he had done 
but why coleman said 
some investigators have said they believe bundy was responsible 
for 50 to 100 murders but coleman doubts there are many bundy left 
unconfessed and estimates his total at 36 killings 
coleman played down bundys execution eve interview with james 
dobson a radio minister and psychologist who is a national 
antipornography leader bundy told dobson his crimes were fueled 
by an addiction to hardcore pornography 
i think that was a little bit of ted telling the minister what 
he wanted to hear and ted offering an explanation that would 
exonerate him personally coleman said i had heard that before 
and i told ted i never accepted it 
coleman said bundy was intrigued by his finalweek talks with 
psychiatrist dorothy lewis who focused on bundys childhood to 
study the killer who wore the mask of a handsome articulate law 
student bundy never knew his biological father and was raised 
initially in the home of a sometimesviolent grandfather 
but as the execution neared coleman said there was little time 
to get ontherecord details of bundys crimes or to study him 
coleman had argued that bundy was incompetent to stand trial 
but said that bundy opposed defense efforts to have him found 
incompetent bundy he said basically destroyed himself 
the attorney recalled thinking as he said goodbye to bundy in 
his holding cell just before his execution he was probably his 
37th victim he executed himself 
coleman said that as sickening as bundys crimes were and as 
devastated as he would be if his own daughter were so victimized 
he felt it important to the justice system to ensure that even a 
ted bundy receives an adequate defense 
if it gets to the point when people get railroaded then we 
will have lost something very important coleman said we came 
close to that in ted bundys case

israeli soldiers shot and killed three 
palestinians on saturday and arab hospital officials said at least 
137 were wounded in one of the heaviest days of shooting in the 
17monthold uprising 
clashes reached such an intensity that palestinian youths used 
mosque loudspeakers to urge residents to rush to hospitals and 
clinics to donate blood arab reports said 
the riots were concentrated in the gaza strip and broke out as 
moslems celebrated the holiday of eid alfitr which marks the end 
of the holy month of ramadan 
the army confirmed the three deaths and said 70 palestinians 
were wounded all in gaza an army spokesman speaking on condition 
of anonymity said saturday was by far the worst day in the 
gaza strip since the start of the palestinian uprising 
he said defense minister yitzhak rabin visited gaza to 
investigate the incidents 
the shooting was the heaviest since riots broke out after the 
assassination of plo military chief khalil wazir in tunis on april 
16 1988 fifteen arabs were shot and killed and more than 90 
wounded as palestinians rioted blaming israel for the murder 
the deaths saturday raised to 465 the number of palestinians 
killed since the antiisraeli uprising began in december 1987 
twenty israelis have died 
the clashes began in the nusseirat refugee camp as palestinian 
worshipers were leaving a mosque after holiday prayers 
the day is traditionally celebrated with morning prayers 
followed by visits to cemeteries to memorialize lost relatives 
arab reporters said worshipers left the mosque and began 
chanting allahu akbar arabic for god is great and throwing 
stones at about 100 israeli soldiers outside 
the soldiers fired tear gas and later live ammunition at the 
demonstrators and killed one 
the demonstrators carried the dead man to the cemetery which 
was crowded with arab families praying and decorating with flowers 
the graves of relatives and palestinians killed in the uprising 
as news of the shooting spread palestinians in the cemetery 
began to pelt soldiers with stones the army called in 
reinforcements and used helicopters to drop tear gas on the nearly 
500 demonstrators arab reports said 
the second palestinian was killed during the cemetery unrest 
hospital officials identified the dead there as muhammed abdalla 
zakout 40 and muhammed muenes 20 and said both were killed by 
gunshot wounds to the head they said 40 palestinians were wounded 
in nusseirat 
the army clamped a curfew on nusseirat confining the camps 
29000 residents to their homes 
rioting quickly spread to other parts of the gaza strip in 
nearby khan yunis arab hospital officials reported one palestinian 
shot and killed and 53 wounded including three in critical 
condition who were transferred to israeli hospitals 
they identified the slain palestinian as 22yearold eid salameh 
abu masoud and said he was fatally wounded in the chest 
also in khan yunis a palestinian suspected of collaborating 
with israeli authorities was found stabbed to death arab reporters 
said 
arab reporters identified him as 27yearold hassan handeek the 
army confirmed the death but said handeek was a criminal and not a 
collaborator 
clashes were also reported in the bureij refugee camp where 11 
palestinians were wounded and in the town of beit hanoun where nine 
arabs were wounded 
in scattered clashes throughut the area another 22 palestinians

wounds

injuries and that 23 were registered in hospitals as suffering from 
inhaling tear gas he said six palestinians were transferred to 
israeli hospitals in critical condition 
the armys deputy chief of staff maj gen ehud barak said 
israel can defeat palestinian nationalists with determination 
tenacity and the capability of adapting quickly 
he said few soldiers preferred to serve in the occupied west 
bank or gaza strip but said resources devoted to quelling the riots 
were not sapping the armys physical or moral strength

britain and france accused iran on saturday of 
inciting murder by urging palestinians to wage an international 
campaign of terror against westerners in retaliation for slayings 
in israels occupied lands 
israels foreign ministry called the iranian appeal a 
bloodthirsty idea 
britain said it would discuss the threat with european and 
american allies and the government tightened security at airports 
in london and manchester there were no other indications of what 
steps western governments might take to counter the iranian threat 
the united states condemned iran for the remarks on friday the 
united states britain and france were singled out as targets in an 
inflammatory speech friday by irans parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani 
rafsanjani urged palestinians to kill five americans britons or 
frenchmen for every arab slain in the uprising in israelioccupied 
territories he urged palestinians to hijack planes or blow up 
factories in western countries to pressure israel to release 
prisoners 
rafsanjani also denounced the peace initiative of palestine 
liberation organization leader yasser arafat who has renounced 
terrorism and recognized israels right to exist 
rafsanjani once was regarded as a moderate his remarks 
underlined a new and growing antiwestern trend that is part of a 
radical resurgence in iran 
the british foreign office said the incitement to murder of 
british citizens or those of any other country is totally 
unacceptable 
it is an affront to international standards of behavior 
and further confirmation if any were necessary that iran is not 
ready to accept its international obligations it said 
home office minister timothy renton said he was certain all 
moslems in britain would reject rafsanjanis call i was 
horrified and im sure every lawabiding moslem christian and 
jew in this and any other western country will be horrified too 
he told independent television news 
in paris the french foreign ministry said in a statement that 
rafsanjanis declarations are totally unacceptable because they 
accompany an inadmissible call to murder 
they are of a nature to create the presumption of 
responsibility of iran in all violent action which could now 
come the ministry said 
in washington on friday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
denounced rafsanjanis comments as another step backwards for 
iran from the community of civilized nations he said the united 
states held the iranian leadership responsible for any attacks on 
american interests or citizens 
plo representative faisal aweidah in london said he did not 
think rafsanjanis appeal would mobilize many militants in britain 
in paris ayatollah mehdi rouhani spiritual leader of the 
shiite community in europe said the irresponsible and 
antiislamic words spoken by mr rafsanjani regarding the free 
world prove that the extremist tendency has scored decisive points 
in iran 
he said iran has been thrown into the extreme leftist camp 
shiite moslems predominate in iran 
the british department of transport issued an urgent directive 
to airport authorities advising extreme caution its contents were 
not disclosed but a department spokesman said on condition of 
anonymity that the agency was taking the threats very seriously 
and had initiated appropriate measures 
extra staffers were sent to several airports on saturday 
including gatwick near london to make increased checks on 
passengers 
a gatwick spokeswoman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the precautions had led to some minor holdups 
a spokeswoman at londons heathrow airport also reported slight 
delays as a result of the security measures she said the 
department of transport had provided detailed instructions which 
were followed to the letter 
at manchester airport the sunday times said police armed with 
handguns and submachine guns were seen for the first time in three 
years

a sheriff investigating the threeyearold 
death of a baby whose parents reported was abducted said saturday 
that the strangely similar slaying of another daughter gives him 
hope hell make arrests 
jersey county sheriff frank yocom 50 said he still thinks 
daily about the june 1986 death of loralei marie sims which left 
him angry and upset its worn on me yocom said 
ive maintained throughout my investigation that i would never 
close the case as long as i was involved in law enforcement in 
jersey county make arrests and put this thing to rest he said 
and thats still my goal 
the parents robert and paula sims are the chief suspects in 
the latest case the death of their 6weekold daughter heather 
lee and authorities expect to make an arrest soon police sgt 
rick mccain said friday in this city of 40000 people along the 
mississippi river near st louis 
mccain said saturday that neither parent is considered the 
stronger suspect 
the simses deny any wrongdoing and hope police will investigate 
with an open mind so the killer will be caught said their 
attorney donald groshong of alton the parents have refused to 
talk to reporters 
the state department of children and family services on friday 
took custody of their 15monthold son randy and the parents are 
staying with relatives 
their home in a middleincome treelined neighborhood remains 
an object of curiosity 
broken glass remnants from thursday night when authorities 
broke a window to get inside the house is still scattered on the 
front porch and the grass stands about a foot high 
a sign on the front door reads in case of fire save our 
dogs we have dogs 
officials investigating heathers death have examined jersey 
county records and have been working closely with yocom the 
sheriff said by telephone from his office in jerseyville 
when authorities interviewed robert sims 37 on thursday night 
yocom sat in sims made some comments that could be very helpful 
down the road the sheriff said 
in june 1986 the parents who then lived in nearby brighton in 
jersey county reported that an armed intruder barged into their 
home while sims was at work and took loralei their 13dayold 
firstborn 
remains believed to be loraleis were found a week later near 
the couples former home the parents were suspects but no one was 
charged 
on april 29 the simses told police that a masked gunman knocked 
out mrs sims 30 and abducted heather 
four days later a fisherman found the childs body which was 
wrapped in a black plastic bag in a trash barrel at a west alton 
mo recreation area along the mississippi river 
it appeared the body had been refrigerated and an autopsy 
determined that heather had died of asphyxiation about the time she 
was reported missing mccain said 
yocom said that when heard the scenario he felt there was no 
question anything could be that bizarre 
hair samples were taken from a freezer at the home of mrs sims 
parents orville and nylene blew who were out of town the night 
heather was reported kidnapped yocom said tests are being done to 
determine if the hair matches heathers 
investigators also seized from the blew home an infants sleeper 
that heather was believed to have been wearing at the time of the 
abduction mccain said 
in loraleis case however evidence was lacking yocom said 
you couldnt even call it a murder because the body was in 
such bad shape he said 
the sheriff said he still gets weekly inquiries about the case 
and still feels pressure to solve it 
in alton too some folks are growing restless 
thats all everybody is talking about now said jeanette 
odell 67 who lives near the simses every time somebody hears 
something new i get a phone call

pope john paul ii ended a nineday african visit 
saturday by telling africans to reject the modern way of life and 
instead embrace their own traditions and christianity 
the pope arrived back in rome aboard a special alitalia boeing 
747 after celebrating mass for 75000 people in lilongwe malawis 
administrative capital a group of impi warriors wearing leopard 
skins and carrying spears danced as he boarded the plane 
john pauls 41st foreign pilgrimage and fifth trip to africa 
covered 13500 miles taking him to the african island of 
madagascar the french indian ocean island of reunion zambia and 
malawi 
in a papal first john paul flew on the supersonic concorde 
traveling at more than twice the speed of sound from reunion to 
zambia 
but in the homily of his final mass the pope told africans not 
to abandon their roots 
i put before you today a challenge a challenge to reject a 
way of living which does not correspond to the best of your local 
traditions and your christian faith said the pontiff his white 
robes flapping in the strong wind that swept the army air wing 
military airport 
many people in africa look beyond africa for the socalled 
freedom of the modern way of life he said today i urge you to 
look inside yourselves look to the riches of your own traditions 
look to christ 
the pontiff reiterated his plea for sustained assistance to the 
640000 refugees who have poured into malawi fleeing civil war in 
mozambique 
every effort by the public authorities the churches and 
international organizations to help these brothers and sisters must 
be encouraged and supported he said

hope we must all pray to increase peace and harmony in this 
continent the future of africa is at stake

kamuzu banda defended malawis record as the only blackruled 
african nation maintaining formal diplomatic ties with south africa

violence and confrontation but through contact and dialogue

romania is using technology 
provided by a west german firm to build an assembly plant for 
missiles that can carry nuclear warheads the magazine der spiegel 
said saturday 
the hamburgbased news weekly said most of the rocket technology 
for the romanian factory came from the messerschmittboelkowblohm 
company of munich it said mbb developed it in the mid1980s for 
argentina 
the report which will appear in der spiegels monday edition 
was provided early to other news media it said the romanian plant 
was being constructed partly underground and was intended to 
manufacture what der spiegel said are condor2 rockets 
the report did not specify the location of the romanian plant 
on april 14 romanian president nicolae ceausescu publicly 
stated that his country has the ability to make nuclear weapons 
but he said the communist nation had no intention of making use of 
the technology 
western experts say there is no way to verify the claim 
independently but that it is doubtful because romania apparently 
has been unable to complete a largely imported nuclear power plant 
under construction at cernavoda on the danube river 
in a similar report on the rockets last week der spiegel said 
that mbb technology was being used to develop mediumrange missiles 
for argentina egypt and iraq with a range of 600 miles 
der spiegel said mbb circumvented west german restrictions on 
arms exports by selling the technology through a consortium of 
small companies in austria switzerland and west germany 
the articles follow similar reports by other west german news 
media over the past month prosecutors have opened a probe of 
several companies in west germany including some that are mbb 
subsidiaries 
mbb a giant aerospace and armaments company has said it does 
not want to comment on the reports while the case is under 
investigation

atlantis astronauts soared past the 
halfway mark of their fourday space journey saturday continuing a 
light schedule of experiments as the probe they deployed soared 
beyond the moon toward venus 
the workload aboard atlantis was limited because the magellan 
probe and its rocket booster which together weighed 45000 pounds 
did not allow for many experiments to be carried aboard 
flight director ron dittemore dismissed a suggestion that the 
astronauts had been on a joy ride since releasing the venus 
craft he said nasa rules require a minimum fourday shuttle flight 
to give crew members time to recover from any motion sickness 
before conducting the crucial maneuvers required to return to earth 
more than half the 143 astronauts on earlier shuttle missions 
became ill adapting to weightless space usually the illness was 
not serious and lasted a day or two none of atlantis five crew 
members appeared to have suffered 
we did sleep well and were ready to roll today commander 
david walker said after mission control in houston awakened the 
astronauts saturday with a medley of their school songs 
the crew had to work around two malfunctions saturday morning 
the dial that regulates flow from a water dispenser in the galley 
wouldnt work so the astronauts attached a hose that controls 
another dispenser one of the cameras on board jammed and was set 
aside while trouble shooters on the ground pondered how to fix it 
the crew then settled into a day of metals processing medical 
and earth photography experiments conversation was light and 
mostly technical as they methodically went about their work 
talking sparingly with controllers 184 miles below on earth 
at midday the astronauts dropped the pressure in the cabin from 
a normal 147 pounds per square inch to 102 psi in a test of new 
helmet equipment that will be used on future space shuttle space 
walks the cabin has to be partially depressurized for an outside 
excursion dittemore said the exercise went very well 
walker said he and pilot ronald grabe and mission specialists 
mary cleave mark lee and norman thagard were pleased to hear that 
magellan was still operating perfectly as it continued its 15month 
voyage to venus 
early saturday the probe passed the 240000mile distance from 
earth at which the moon orbits and late in the day it was more 
than 350000 miles out streaking along at 6700 mph venus was 
still more than 158 million miles away 
magellan is to fire into orbit around venus in august 1990 and 
is to map up to 90 percent of its surface with a high resolution 
radar system the images expected to be 10 times clearer than any 
previously obtained could tell much about the history of that 
mysterious cloudshrouded planet 
atlantis is scheduled to land at edwards air force base calif 
at 343 pm edt monday

a congressional panel investigating the 
nations worst oil spill prepared saturday for two days of 
hearings but the committees chairman has already drawn a few 
harsh conclusions 
oil companies have demonstrated they have no ability no 
expertise no capability in cleaning up oil spills rep george 
miller dcalif said at a public meeting in the fishing town of 
cordova 50 miles from the spill site 
miller chairman of the house interior committees subcommittee 
on water and energy said friday the spill is not just about 
polluted waters dead birds otters its about disrupted 
communities families lifestyles 
millers fivemember panel has scheduled hearings for sunday and 
monday in valdez near the section of prince william sound where 
the tanker exxon valdez hit a reef march 24 and poured more than 10 
million gallons of crude into the water members of the panel and 
its 26member staff continued arriving saturday 
the 987foot tankers former captain joseph hazelwood has been 
accused of operating the ship while intoxicated and faces a june 
20 trial on misdemeanor charges a grand jury is conducting a 
felony investigation 
third mate gregory cousins who was at the helm when the wreck 
occurred said hazelwood did not appear to be drunk at the time 
there was no indication there was anything wrong cousins 
said in a story in saturdays editions of the tampa fla tribune 
he described hazelwood as extremely competent 
cousins has been on leave at home in tampa preparing his 
testimony for a national transportation safety board hearing may 16 
in anchorage 
millers panel will hear testimony from coast guard officers 
exxon executives and environmentalists 
miller was quick to criticize not only oil companies but 
alyeska the jointly owned pipeline service company in valdez 
which is the terminus of the transalaska pipeline from the north 
slope 
back in 1973 we made a compact with alyeska and its owners 
including exxon miller said in exchange for the right to 
drill for oil on public lands they promised theyd do so in a 
safe fashion 
but he added the oil company lobbied state and federal 
officials to get the agreement changed to the industrys benefit 
what we didnt know is that theyd spend the next 10 years 
undermining that compact he said 
exxon spokesman karsten rodvik said saturday that he was not 
aware of millers statements and could not comment on them 
in the more than six weeks since the spill oil has fouled 
beaches as far as 525 miles southwest of valdez 
the hardest hit areas include the islands within prince william 
sound and beaches at katmai national park a spectacular wildife 
refuge on the alaska peninsula

merchants boarded up their stores and 
shoppers jammed supermarkets to stock up on nonperishable foods on 
saturday as panamanians warily took precautions on the eve of a 
presidential election 
the vote sunday has evolved into another showdown between gen 
manuel antonio noriega the head of the panamanian defense forces 
and the countrys de facto ruler and the united states 
noriega while stumping for his handpicked candidate claimed 
that a vote for the opposition is a vote for us control of this 
central american country 
the opposition and us officials charge that noriega plans to 
rig the vote to ensure the continuation of his ironhanded military 
rule 
mindful of violent antinoriega disturbances a year ago that 
shut down most businesses some shop owners in the capital boarded 
up their windows people flocked to markets to stock up on items 
such as rice and canned goods 
a 13member observer delegation appointed by president bush 
arrived in panama city on an american government jet saturday 
afternoon despite panamanian statements that the delegation would 
not be welcome 
delegation members would not say if they had visas to enter the 
country rep john murtha dpa heading the delegation only 
said we have the appropriate documentation and declined to 
answer further questions 
the united states recognizes eric delvalle who noriega fired 
last year as panamas legitimate president and the current 
government does not recognize visas issued by panamanian consuls in 
the united states all of whom are still loyal to delvalle 
panama has invited election observers from the european 
parliament and several latin american and caribbean countries and 
has said uninvited delegations are unwelcome but it has welcomed 
an unofficial observer group that includes former presidents jimmy 
carter and gerald ford 
on saturday carter toured the panama canal and discussed the 
operation of the waterway 
murthas delegation arrived at the us howard air force base to 
avoid the visa requirements and left in three military helicopters 
for an undisclosed location where they will stay 
us embassy spokesman terence kneebone said the delegation 
hopes to split up into three groups to observe sundays voting and 
plans to return to the united states on monday 
us officials and a member of the delegation all of whom spoke 
on condition of anonymity indicated the delegation was in panama 
on temporary orders from the us department of defense which 
authorizes their presence without a visa at american military bases 
it was not immediately known what if any access the orders 
might give them to the rest of panama 
but maj edgardo lopez spokesman for the panama defense forces 
said i cannot go into the united states without a visa they can 
come into panama without visas this is a provocation 
a us southern command official said noriegas defense forces 
set up checkpoints late friday to control access into the former 
panama canal zone where many us military personnel live 
us personnel have had no problems leaving the former zone 
area despite the panamanian checkpoints the southern command 
official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the command citing possible disturbances planned to increase 
security on saturday it previously had urged the estimated 12000 
american troops stationed in panama to go into the capital only on 
essential business 
the canal zone once was controlled by the united states but was 
among the areas that reverted to panamanian control under the 
panama canal treaties of 1977 
under the treaties full control of the canal is to be turned 
over to panama in 1999 but the tense relations between noriega and 
washington have complicated that treaty 
the bush administration saying election fraud likely will 
maintain noriegas grip on power said friday it is considering 
more measures to oust the military leader including possibly 
seizing his assets abroad 
although panamanians will pick from two leading candidates the 
big issues have been noriegas rule and washingtons influence on 
panamanian affairs 
progovernment candidate carlos duque said friday the general 
should remain as head of the panamanian defense forces until the 
year 2000 to assure that panama gets control of the panama canal 
the eight parties in the progovernment national liberation 
coalition contend that the opposition and the united states plan to 
delay or cancel handing over the canal 
opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara has said he 
will fire noriega if the general wont retire although noriega has 
installed and deposed presidents at will since he took control of 
the armed forces in 1983 
endara is running for the fiveyear term under the banner of the 
democratic opposition alliance a threeparty coalition 
the winner takes office sept 1 
about 12 million of panamas 22 residents are registered to 
vote polls are open from 7 am 8 am edt to 5 pm the 
government has promised results within 24 hours after polls close 
in the last election in 1984 nicolas ardito barletta was 
narrowly elected over arnulfo arias madrid amid cries of fraud 
noriega had barletta resign and installed eric delvalle as 
president in 1985 
when delvalle tried to fire noriega in february 1988 after the 
general was indicted in the united states on drug trafficking 
charges noriega engineered delvalles ouster and installed manuel 
solis palma as acting president 
duque supporters have charged that the united states is spending 
millions of dollars for the opposition campaign

oliver north attacked congress before a cheering 
crowd of supporters saturday saying too many members interfere 
unconstitutionally in foreign affairs but he avoided any mention 
of his irancontra conviction 
the event was sponsored by conservatives among miamis 
nicaraguan and cuban immigrants who are helping pay norths legal 
bill stemming from a 2year battle against charges that he misled 
congress and illegally accepted money from arms merchants 
it was the former marine lieutenant colonels first scheduled 
public appearance since a federal jury in washington convicted him 
thursday on three of the 12 counts he faced during the threemonth 
trial 
north used most of his 20minute speech to criticize congress 
suggesting it was giving central america away to the communists and 
accusing house speaker jim wright dtexas and other members of 
acting like secretaries of state 
they have too many people in it who decided to become 
secretaries of state and too many who would usurp the powers of 
the presidency that were granted to the president in the 
constitution north said 
we have a situation today where the speaker of the house feels 
like he has a role in negotiating with the adversaries of this 
country he said 
north contrasted congress support of the freedom fighters 
fighting a sovietbacked government in afghanistan with its refusal 
to do the same in nicaragua 
as a consequence of that thousands of young brave men and 
women of the nicaraguan resistance were abandoned in the field of 
battle he said 
when the revolution without frontiers that has been promised 
in central america by the sandinistas succeeds it wont be on my 
watch it will be on our childrens 
norths only reference to his legal situation was indirect 
coming when he criticized the congress and the special prosecutors 
office for spending 40 million on investigating the irancontra 
affair he said the money would better have been spent supporting 
the contras 
sitting at the head table with north was indicted cia agent 
joseph fernandez north called for the audience to give financial 
support to fernandez who faces trial in virginia on charges of 
illegally aiding the contras 
about 850 people cheered and applauded north giving him a 
standing ovation and chanting ollie ollie when he was 
introduced for his speech 
north was convicted of supplying congress with a false 
chronology of the irancontra events shredding documents to cover 
up the deceit and accepting a 13800 home security system from 
richard secord who still faces trial for his part in shipping 
weapons to iran 
the 100perperson fundraiser was sponsored by concerned 
citizens for democracy led by cubanamerican importer carlos 
perez and the miami medical team the groups hope to raise 
500000 for north 
former maj gen john k singlaub whose fundraising efforts 
for he contras also surfaced during a congressional probe of the 
affair is listed as a member of the first groups advisory board 
singlaub has long been active in raising money for anticommunist 
causes around the world 
miami headquarters for the contra fighters that the former 
national security council aide worked so hard to support remains a 
hotbed of pronorth sentiment but the area also helped lead to his 
downfall 
in early 1986 months before the crash of a c130 cargo plane in 
nicaragua helped lead to the irancontra plots unraveling the fbi 
and the us attorneys office here were investigating illegal arms 
smuggling to the contras 
thenassistant us attorney jeffrey feldman in prosecuting a 
routine weapons case stumbled on connections among drug dealers 
the contras nowjailed cost rican rancher john hull and various 
us agencies including the cia and norths nsc 
feldman eventually drew up a chart with norths name at the top 
of the illegal gunrunning effort and tried to pursue a legal case 
against those involved that later led to charges that 
thenattorney general edwin meese tried to halt the investigation 
that case is still in the hands of the special prosecutorss office 
in washington

an army warrant officer courtmartialed for 
espionage may have critically damaged several electronic 
surveillance operations aimed at the soviet bloc the new york 
times reported in sunday editions 
james w hall iii rendered useless one program that had cost 
hundreds of millions of dollars and was meant to exploit weak links 
in the soviet communications network the times said 
without commenting on the specifics it appears that hall did 
very serious damage senate intelligence committee chairman david 
boren dokla told the newspaper 
we are looking at the potential and its so far just 
potential that this could be the armys walker case one 
official told the times referring to the espionage ring led by 
former navy officer john a walker jr who was arrested in 1985 
hall 30 reportedly was recruited in 1982 he was arrested dec 
20 and after pleading guilty to espionage in feburary began a 
40year prison term 
the times said hall 30 was one of the highestpaid 
easternbloc spies receiving 300000 over a sixyear span from 
the soviets and east germany 
the newspaper said prosecution documents at halls courtmartial 
said that hall disclosed data on eavesdropping systems and 
information about western alliance plans in the event of a war in 
europe 
the times quoted unidentified sources as saying that hall gave 
east germany or the soviet union nato wartime scenarios well into 
the 21st century 
the newspaper said the united states first learned about halls 
spying from a tip from a central intelligence agency source inside 
the east german government the cia source has defected to the west 
and is in hiding 
few details on the nature of the information hall relayed to his 
agents had been released before 
the times said us officials fear hall may have been just one 
of several american soldiers who were recruited by a 58yearold 
mechanic huseyin yildirim who taught auto repair to army 
personnel at field station berlin where hall was posted

pax christi a national roman catholic peace group based in 
erie pa organized the protests to mark the anniversary of a 1983 
pastoral letter from us catholic bishops that opposed the 
development of firststrike nuclear systems

submarine is a major move ahead in the arms race said

sport fishermen shouted racial slurs at 
nine boats full of chippewa indians protected under treaty rights 
as they slipped into the waters of a northern lake to begin 
spearfishing on saturday 
about a dozen wisconsin department of natural resources boats 
cleared a path for the traditional spearfishing boats through 
dozens of craft skippered by antitreaty protesters at butternut 
lake 
the crowd protesting the indians right to spearfish on 
offreservation lakes was estimated at 1000 people 
the protesters shouted go home and racial epithets and 
ridiculed a group of indians and their supporters who gathered 
around a drum playing tribal music 
most of the tribal members stood silently although some tried 
to talk to the protesters 
police officers wearing riot helmets and face masks patrolled 
the lakeshore to keep the protesters away from the boat landings 
the natural resources department moved 90 percent of its 
173warden staff to northern wisconsin to deal with the increased 
number of boats expected on the water said george meyer the 
departments administrator of nforcement 
more than a hundred opponents of the chippewas treaty rights 
were arrested friday on the eve of the sports fishing season when a 
crowd crossed police lines at a trout lake boat landing 
butternut and trout lakes are among a cluster of lakes in the 
north woods of wisconsin 
the arrests were the most in a day since the tribe began 
spearing fish on northern lakes five years ago under a courtupheld 
guarantee of 19th century treaties that ceded much of northern 
wisconsin to the united states 
meyer said the protesters who have run boats past the indians 
to disturb their spearing are a small percentage of sport 
fishermen 
spearfishing begins during spring spawning ahead of the general 
fishing season and is regulated by the indians it is far more 
efficient than traditional rod and reel fishing as a result the 
state had to limit rodandreel catches of walleyed pike on 254 
lakes 
al soik president of stop treaty abuse wisconsin said 
opponents of the treaty rights were waiting to see what action gov 
tommy thompson would take 
if he stops the spearing there wont be any reason for us to 
go out there he said if he doesnt well be back 
the republican governor tried unsuccessfully friday to get us 
district judge barbara crabb in madison to order the end of 
spearfishing before the action began thompson testified that 
violence could erupt and could lead to deaths if both the chippewa 
and the state fishermen are allowed to fish on the same lakes 
crabb denied thompsons request saying she would not allow 
violent and lawless protests to interfere with the tribes 
rights thompson said the state would appeal 
meanwhile hundreds of people gathered at the lac du flambeau 
tribal center to show their support for chippewa treaty rights 
organizers said the group planned to counter demonstrations against 
chippewa spearing 
tom maulson a lac du flambeau tribal judge said he did not 
think the start of the general fishing season would worsen the 
situation 
these guys come up here to fish they dont want to fight 
indians he said

developer donald trump and singer robert 
goulet did not authorize the use of their names in an advertisement 
appearing friday in support of shock tv show host morton downey 
jr a trump spokeswoman said 
a fullpage advertisement in usa today reads burn mort why 
not just burn the constitution we believe in mort we believe 
in freedom 
the ad also said television is the peoples medium and the 1st 
amendment protects the rights of the morton downey jr show and any 
show regardless of its content 
among the 25 names that appear at the bottom of the ad are 
trump goulet harvard law professor allen dershowitz and broadway 
producer jerry cohen 
downeys show known for his confrontations with guests has 
suffered a ratings collapse in recent months and several stations 
have canceled the program because of decreased ratings lack of 
advertiser support or consumer complaints 
last month downey reported that he had been attacked at san 
francisco international airport by neonazi skinheads who he said 
cut off his hair and painted a reverse swastika on his face but 
authorities could not verify the story and some dismissed it as a 
publicity stunt 
trump is upset about the ad because he did not give anyone 
permission to use his name said his secretary norma foerderer 
he thinks its horrible and unfortunate that someone used 
his name she said in a telephone interview from the developers 
new york office but he certainly supports the first 
amendment 
ms foerderer said she received a call friday from goulet who 
also was upset at the unauthorized use of his name 
calls to downeys new york office for comment were not returned 
rachel mcallister a spokeswoman for downeys public relations 
los angelesbased firm schecter cone and mcallister said all

hispanics to advance but bernardo m mat perez concedes the 
door had to be kicked down 
we hispanics as any other american citizens have a 
contribution to make and we want to believe in the american 
system he said after a federal judge ordered changes in the 
agencys promotional system and established a procedure for 
promoting hispanics wrongly denied advancement 
all we want is an equal chance now were going to get it

the notoriously picky people who invest in the 
stock market seldom act as happy about the state of the economy as 
they seem to be right now 
wall streeters wished for a slowdown in economic growth to take 
the pressure off inflation and interest rates signs are piling up 
that they are getting what they wanted 
but some observers question how long investors will stay happy 
over that set of circumstances 
the rationale behind this way of thinking is that slower 
economic growth means reduced inflation pressures which in turn 
mean lower interest rates say analysts at wright investors 
service in bridgeport conn 
stock prices so the saying goes are slaves of interest 
rates so lower interest rates are good for the stock market 
but stocks serve two masters they are also the slaves of 
earnings and an economic slowdown would clearly have negative 
implications for corporate earnings todays stock market investors 
have yet to make this connection 
there is another problem some analysts say with the recent 
economic statistics that have been so warmly received on the street 
consider for example the surprise news on friday that the 
civilian unemployment rate took a 03 percentage point jump in 
april to 53 percent 
while the data looked like a clear signal of slackening business 
conditions they provided little accompanying evidence that 
inflation was abating as well 
average hourly earnings in fact increased at an 85 percent 
annual rate in april according to the labor department report 
so hopes remained subdued that the federal reserve can reverse 
course and relax its credit policy any time soon 
they may get a further test this friday when the monthly 
reading of the producer price index of finished goods is due to be 
made public then on may 18 comes the consumer price index for 
april which could represent another stumbling block for stocks 
in part because of higher energy prices the merrill lynch 
market letter projects that the april cpi could be up 07 percent 
to 09 percent compared with a 05 percent increase in march 
faced with such thoughts the stock markets sixmonthold rally 
flattened out in the past week the dow jones average of 30 
industrials dropped 3684 points to 238196 
the new york stock exchange composite index lost 99 to 17214 
while the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
rose 216 to 43071 and the american stock exchange market value 
index gained 176 to 34684 
volume on the big board averaged 16325 million shares a day 
against 16064 million the week before 
robert brusca economist at nikko securities international says 
stocks appear to have benefited lately from what might be called 
the eye of the needle theory 
this is the idea that the economy is slowing just enough for 
the bond market to rally the fed to ease and corporate earnings 
to be little affected by the weakness he said 
can the fed truly steer this large lumbering economy through 
such a narrow passage that seems unlikely but looking at the 
markets behavior apparently others attach different probabilities 
to this event than i do 
if the slowdown is sharp and cumulates to a become a 
recession the stock market is in for real trouble 
the obvious problem would be corporate earnings but the 
destabilizing effect of low interest rates on the dollar is a 
factor too 
i wonder why the market is so optimistic brusca concluded 
adding i had this same question around mid1987

eastern airlines tortuous path has taken it 
through multimillion dollar losses into a crippling strike and the 
refuge of bankruptcy court now its fate rests with a powerful 
judge known for biting sarcasm a penchant for popcorn and a 
determination to get the airline flying again 
in the nearly two months since burton r lifland has been 
overseeing easterns reorganization his actions have chafed the 
carrier and its lawyers even representatives of easterns unions 
who applaud many of liflands decisions privately call him a 
loose cannon 
lifland 60 has a style that some lawyers and acquaintances 
privately say borders on the eccentric 
during one tense closeddoor negotiation he made bowls of 
popcorn for everybody his courtroom utterances are liberally 
sprinkled with humor and jibes he can reduce highpowered haughty 
attorneys to the level of redfaced stammering schoolboys standing 
nervously before him 
besides the rows of law books lining the walls a huge poster of 
rumpole of the bailey the fictional british barrister dominates 
liflands chambers in the federal bankruptcy courthouse the 
highceilinged rooms in the turnofthecentury customs house 
building in lower manhattan command a splendid view of the hudson 
river 
lifland rarely talks to reporters and declined to be interviewed 
as the chief us bankruptcy judge for the southern district of 
new york lifland has presided over some of the biggest and most 
complex cases in history they include former asbestos maker 
manville corp steelmaker ltv corp and farm machinery maker 
allischalmers corp 
hes a graduate of syracuse university and fordham university 
law school and frequently lectures at law schools and legal 
conferences 
liflands primary concern for the past two months has been 
eastern since parent texas air corp put it into chapter 11 
protection from creditors on march 9 five days after a crippling 
strike 
in the eastern case as in others lifland has departed from the 
historically neutral role many bankruptcy judges take in the view 
of some lawyers 
he has been interventionist at the far end of the spectrum 
said karen gross a professor at new york law school and a director 
of the national bankruptcy institute 
early in the case lifland ordered the appointment of a 
bankruptcy examiner for eastern with extraordinary powers he later 
ordered all parties to explain why he shouldnt put the airline up 
for auction 
he has continually said its in the public interest to get 
eastern back to a full schedule quickly 
what im hearing is a reflection of parochial interests what 
im not hearing is the public interest here lifland scolded 
attorneys for eastern and the unions at one hearing 
the public is a main player here he said citing the 
consumers who have scrimped and saved to buy eastern tickets 
and cant use them 
statements like that have riled a number of bankruptcy attorneys 
who are not involved in the eastern case but say they are worried 
about precedents that may be set by lifland 
some believe the judge has lost his impartiality has sided with 
easterns unions and is pushing the airline into a hasty 
bargainbasement sale 
they dismiss liflands public interest argument asserting that 
a bankruptcy court is charged only with protecting the interests of 
creditors and shareholders the public they say can find seats on 
other airlines if needed 
hes grandstanding and thats counterproductive said a 
bankruptcy attorney unconnected with the eastern case who requested 
anonymity 
even union representatives who have liked many of liflands 
moves complain privately that he has raised their expectations too 
high and has subsequently backed down on several occasions 
he really has painted himself into a corner there doesnt 
seem to be any easy way out of it said a union team member who 
asked not to be identified bankruptcy judges do not do heroic 
things very often 
in midapril sources say lifland was persuaded under pressure 
to back down when he came close to appointing a powerful temporary 
trustee to run eastern which in effect would have invalidated 
managements authority 
the trustee issue was at the heart of the collapse of 
exbaseball commissioner peter v ueberroths 464 million deal to 
buy eastern from texas air chairman frank lorenzo 
easterns three unions which had agreed to accept a reported 
210 million in labor concessions in exchange for a 30 percent 
share in the airline insisted on a trustee to replace lorenzo 
before ueberroth took over 
lorenzo refused to accept the appointment of a trustee which is 
rarely done in bankruptcy cases and usually implies fraud or 
mismanagement on the part of a companys bosses 
sources say easterns lead bankruptcy attorney harvey miller 
mobilized other lawyers to warn lifland against naming a trustee 
and the signal that would send miller widely considered one of 
the most prominent bankruptcy lawyers in the country declined 
comment on the matter 
i think he lifland saw he was going to have a battle if he 
opted for a trustee said a source close to the situation 
lifland does have defenders in the legal community however 
i know him to be a dedicated sincere judge hes very well 
motivated said joseph gassen a former bankruptcy judge who is 
now an attorney in miami 
lifland is trying to find a timely solution to revive eastern 
he said 
the judges razorsharp humor is relentless 
in one hearing after making a lengthy speech miller somberly 
presented a towering stack of documents to lifland he waved them 
away telling the attorney i had planned to devour a robert 
ludlum novel tonight 
on another occasion lifland expressed disappointment that no 
members of the female gender graced the lawyers bench at that 
particular hearing 
at a hearing on eastern in late april pilots union attorney 
bruce simon said he was so angered by millers remarks that i am 
moved to stand 
would you be less moved if you sat down lifland shot back

if brokers in new yorks commodities pits 
thought theyd dodged government scrutiny into sleazy trading acts 
theyve been jolted back to reality by federal agents armed with 
search warrants and subpoenas 
a surprise hunt for evidence into possible wrongdoing at four of 
new yorks five commodities exchanges this past week signaled a new 
frontier of investigation by law enforcement agencies that earlier 
had targeted markets in chicago and had said they would examine 
trading frauds elsewhere 
accounts of the raid performed by teams from the commodity 
futures trading commission and us postal service indicated more 
than 50 futures traders were subpoenaed by investigators looking 
into possible civil and criminal violations although the exact 
nature of alleged wrongdoing was unclear by the weekend 
nonetheless the action stunned the new york mercantile 
exchange commodity exchange coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange and 
new york cotton exchange which had been spared the negative 
publicity of a government investigation suffered for months by the 
chicago mercantile exchange and chicago board of trade 
federal officials said the chicago and new york probes werent 
related but there was speculation they targeted some of the same 
types of questionable practices that historically have dogged the 
furious pace of commodities trading in the cramped futures pits of 
both cities 
one focus was said to be frontrunning in which unscrupulous 
traders make profitable transactions for themselves before 
attending to their customers orders another was said to be 
prearranged trading when buyers and sellers profit via secret 
arrangements that can victimize innocent third parties 
both the chicago and new york probes come against a background 
of explosive growth in the trading of commodities contracts which 
allow investors to bet on the direction of prices of goods ranging 
from gasoline to frozen pork bellies to stock index futures 
part of the expansion stems from the 1980s era of lax regulation 
over the nations securities and commodities markets some experts 
say 
others attribute it to the enormous growth in futures markets 
worldwide and technological leaps that allow investors in singapore 
to gamble on corn prices in chicago or speculators in paris to 
hedge risky positions in orange juice futures in new york 
some futuresindustry experts predict the widely heralded advent 
of 24hour trading via the use of sophisticated computer technology 
originally aimed at catering to worldwide investors will help 
curb abusive or illegal practices like those under investigation 
now 
wed like to think that electronic trading would better define 
an audit trail said barbara b diamond director of diamond 
services group a trading and consulting firm and coauthor of a 
new book on 24hour trading nonetheless she said until we see 
it in operation we dont know 
alan bromberg a professor at southern methodist university and 
expert on securities and commodities frauds said he believed 
computerized markets probably would be more efficient but some 
frauds likely would go undetected 
as far as manipulation of markets thats going to be harder 
to trace because you may run the market up in sydney in order to 
top the market in chicago or new york he said its going to 
be very tricky 
in other important business and economic news this past week 
more evidence emerged of a nationwide economic slowdown easing 
pressure on interest rates government reports showed april 
unemployment rose 03 percent march home sales declined 55 
percent from a month earlier and march factory orders rose 07 
percent but the rise was caused by a jump in demand for new 
aircraft which fluctuates sharply from month to month 
in the turbulent world of the airlines potential new bidders 
arose for strikecrippled eastern its parent texas air corp 
reported a record firstquarter loss of 2555 million because of 
the walkout pan am reported a 151 million quarterly loss due to a 
drop in transatlantic business partly because of terrorism fears 
and northwest reached a temporary truce with suitor marvin davis 
californias highest court upheld most of a controversial law 
rolling back insurance rates which could have profound 
implications for policyholders and insurers nationwide if other 
states adopt similar measures consumer groups welcomed the ruling 
while the insurance industry denounced it calling the law 
arbitrary and unfair

unisys corp faces a defensecontracting 
scandal and a quarterly loss but the nations thirdbiggest 
computer company isnt talking about trouble instead its chairman 
wants to double revenue to 20 billion in five years 
the arithmetic is not so difficult to fathom w michael 
blumenthal said of his plans if we can achieve doubledigit 
growth in the next several years it will go a good distance toward 
achieving that goal 
investors dont have much faith in the growth plan but 
blumenthal 63 has defied the odds before starting when he fled 
with his family from nazi germany and survive the japanese bombing 
of shanghai 
blumenthal who still speaks with a german accent earned a 
doctorate from princeton university and became secretary of the 
treasury in the carter administration in 1986 as chairman of 
burroughs corp he engineered the 48 billion purchase of sperry 
corp to create unisys 
the modest success of unisys has quieted skeptics who said the 
merger of two old slowgrowing makers of incompatible mainframe 
computers would never work 
bigness is important to blumenthal because he believes it gives 
the company credibility against international business machines 
corp the biggest computer maker digital equipment corp is 
second 
blumenthal says he is hoping to achieve his growth goal through 
acquisitions as well as internal expansion especially in the 
rapidly growing field of open systems computers that can run 
a wider variety of programs 
a measure of investors skepticism is that unisys stock price 
is less than eight times last years pershare earnings compared 
with a ratio for ibm of more than 11 
the market is valuing this company as if this growth strategy 
will fail said donald young an analyst for sanford c bernstein 
amp co that assessment he said might be slightly harsh 
a prolonged suspension by the navy brought about by the 
investigation of the pentagon procurement scandal operation ill 
wind has slowed progress toward that goal 
two former executives and two former consultants who worked for 
unisys have pleaded guilty in the case which involves bribes paid 
to pentagon officials to win contracts 
in march three divisions of unisys were barred indefinitely 
from bidding on navy contracts unisys is negotiating a monetary 
settlement with the justice department that could lead to the navy 
allowing it to resume bidding 
financial analysts are estimating the navy suspension will be 
lifted soon possibly sometime this summer but they also say there 
could be further indictments before the case is done 
i get the impression the worst is yet to come young said 
unisys has been lucky so far in that few new contracts have been 
put up for bid and the company is continuing to do business under 
old ones said curt hessler unisys chief financial officer he 
said the financial effect has been minor 
the executives and the three suspended businesses were part of 
the old sperry unisys executives claim those convicted were 
rotten apples employed by a company now under new management 
it was a rarity within sperry and a rarity within the industry 
and they deserve what they get hessler said of the former 
executives 
blumenthal is confident an internal investigation that resulted 
in the departure of 17 executives and the cancellation of contracts 
with 60 consultants has rid the company of corruption 
its behind us in a sense it isnt our problem he said 
for blumenthal the companys other glaring problem a 787 
million loss in the first quarter is also in the past 
blumenthal said the loss was due mostly to the rough transition 
to a new mainframe computer line the 2200 series of mainframes was 
not available when expected and customers stopped buying the model 
it replaced the 1100 
but demand has been strong since the 2200 became available late 
in the first quarter blumenthal said analysts agree that unisys 
will return to profitability in the current quarter 
to achieve 20 billion in revenue blumenthal is focusing on 
open systems or computers that can use different kinds of 
software not just the programs sold by for instance unisys 
the strategy is to grow at singledigit rates in older 
businesses keeping up with the industry pace while gaining market 
share in the fastgrowing market for open systems based on unix 
software 
blumenthal also sees a consolidation that will have unisys 
acquiring smaller companies that can help it grow in networking 
software telecommunications and professional services
