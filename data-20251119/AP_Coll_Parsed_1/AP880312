a specially equipped van that can churn 
out more than 7000 slices of pizza a day for hungry muscovites was 
unveiled in preparation for its shipment to the soviet union 
the mobile pizzeria conceived by two new jersey entrepreneurs 
will be put aboard an container ship early next week for the 
twoweek trip to helsinki finland astro pizza ltd inc officials 
said friday in this new york harbor city 
company operations manager patrick ferrante said he would drive 
the van 750 miles to moscow and that muscovites should be munching 
on americanstyle pizza within a month 
theyre going to love it who doesnt love pizza said louis 
piancone sr president of roma food enterprises inc in 
piscataway which is participating in the joint venture 
pizza will be made every seven minutes and will cost about 70 
cents a slice piancone said a 16inch cheese pie will go for 
550 or seven rubles 
the 36footby11foot van has an oven refrigerators freezers 
and a machine that presses dough in three seconds it several 
hundred thousand dollars to design and build officials said 
all the pizza ingredients will come from the united states said 
piancone 
piancone and partner shelley m ziegler who operates a trenton 
real estate and import firm said they intend to follow the mobile 
pizzeria with up to 25 stores to serve pizzas and italian dishes to 
moscow residents and tourists 
pizza is served in the soviet union but the concept is totally 
different from in america and thats unfortunate piancone said 
piancone and ziegler set up astro pizza after signing an 
agreement with moscow officials who visited new jersey last october 
officials credited soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness with permitting their business to move ahead 
piancone who plans a later trip to the soviet union said he 
hopes to serve pizza to gorbachev 
to teach soviet employees the secret of making delicious pizza

us states with everything from pans to sauce will accompany 
piancone 
if the soviet venture succeeds astro pizza outlets in spain 
japan china and italy may not be far behind he said

the woman who resigned as head of gallaudet 
university after angry student protests says officials didnt 
foresee that having a deaf president would become a national 
civil rights matter 
elisabeth ann zinser who can hear and does not know sign 
language said a week of outcry over her appointment at the school 
for the deaf made her see that deaf people as a group must take 
their place in society and this had become the time 
i have responded to this extraordinary social movement of deaf 
people not to the demands of the students and protesters she 
said 
as the search progressed and as we got to the point of 
actually making the offer to me the situation was becoming more 
intense but they still did not perceive that it would end up 
becoming a national civil rights matter she said 
she said she resigned when she realized how deeply the deaf 
community felt about the gallaudet presidency as a symbol 
i eventually began to really believe what was being said here 
on the part of that community she said 
the 124yearold school is the only liberal arts university for 
the deaf in the world but has never had a deaf president 
about 2500 students and supporters rallied at the capitol after 
zinser resigned claiming victory but insisting that they would 
not stop until their demand for a deaf president is met 
the students say they want the president chosen from the two 
deaf finalists from sunday 
the students want jane bassett spilman chairwoman of the board 
to resign a deaf majority on the board and guarantees that there 
would be no reprisals against any of the demonstrators 
virtually all 2200 graduate and undergraduate students at 
gallaudet participated in the weeklong protests 
were still winning were still winning said student 
leader jerry covell he said he was pleased that zinser had 
resigned but he urged the students to continue their battle 
gary olsen executive director of the national association of 
the deaf told the students their protests had helped the cause of 
deaf people nationwide 
truman stelle a gallaudet faculty member said it is long 
past time that gallaudet had a deaf president as testimony that 
deaf people are capable of leading themselves 
stelle said the ouster of spilman was important because she 
clearly sees herself as owner of the gallaudet plantation 
answerable to no one 
at a news conference earlier friday spilman criticized the 
external interests of people who perhaps are not as interested or 
involved in the daytoday operations of gallaudet and not as well 
informed as the board and the administration she did not 
elaborate 
zinser who was vice chancellor of the university of north 
carolina at greensboro had never formally submitted her 
resignation there and university of north carolina system 
president cd spangler said she would be welcome back 
the house education and labor committees subcommittee on select 
education which has jurisdiction over funding for gallaudet has 
scheduled hearings for tuesday to review the makeup of the board 
and the controversy over the presidential selection threequarters 
of the schools 76 million operating budget comes from the federal 
government 
and john banzhaff george washington university law professor 
and founder of the national center for law and the deaf has filed 
a complaint with the district of columbia office of human rights 
charging the board with unlawful discrimination for never hiring a 
deaf president

two car bombs exploded in the 
fashionable pink zone strip of restaurants and night clubs 
friday injuring one boy and scattering dinner customers witnesses 
said 
the explosions occurred about 930 pm several hours after 
about 400 union activists marched through the capital to demand 
that the salvadoran government free a detained labor leader 
the car bombs damaged five private cars and shattered windows in 
three businesses the witnesses said 
the boy had minor head and arm injuries but did not appear to be 
seriously hurt 
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the explosions 
leftist guerrillas assumed responsibility for a machinegun 
attack in the same district june 19 1985 in which 13 people 
including four offduty us embassy marine guards and two american 
businessmen were killed 
in the march earlier friday one demonstrator was wounded by a 
gunshot in the leg when other demonstrators identified an 
undercover security agent in their ranks and confronted him the 
man pulled a pistol shot a demonstrator and ran off 
there were no confrontations with police or soldiers along the 
fivemile march route uniformed security forces were not in sight 
the demonstrators many of whom carried nailstudded wooden 
clubs and iron bars asked passengers to get off about 10 buses 
along the march route then deflated the bus tires so the vehicles 
blocked side streets 
a pickup truck was set afire near the us embassy where the 
marchers stopped for 30 minutes to denounce us support for the 
salvadoran government 
protesters painted the walls around the embassy with 
antiamerican slogans and set a stack of tires afire 
the demonstrators demanded the release of humberto centeno the 
leader of the telecommunications workers union who was arrested 
thursday night 
the union members alleged centeno was badly beaten by the troops 
who arrested him and that he was hospitalized 
the government acknowledged centenos arrest but claimed he 
tried to attack a member of the security forces it made no mention 
of his condition 
centeno was arrested after about 50 union members occupied the 
labor ministry for nine hours thursday demanding higher pay and 
reinstatement of fired workers 
several metal boxes containing telephone line connections were 
pried open during fridays march doused with gasoline and set 
ablaze leaving dozens of city blocks without phone service

take trendsetting princess diana mix in a 
fashion collection thats cheeky and classic long and short and 
british designers hope to have the perfect ingredients for a 
smashing autumn season 
conscious of the lingering effects of the october stock market 
crash and britains soaring pound londons top designers have 
abandoned the silly and unsaleable for a massive dose of realism 
what alastair blair calls just adult grownup clothes 
there is still plenty of individuality and a little zaniness 
vivian westwoods minicrinoline skirt topped with a peplum and 
underbust waistcoat but overall the fall collections launched 
friday were eminently wearable 
the fourday london show attracting more than 6000 buyers has 
become a regular stop on the international fashion circuit 
sandwiched between the milan and paris shows the clothing and 
textile industry is britains thirdlargest export earner with 
clothing exports alone totaling 24 billion 
princess diana one of the industrys biggest boosters hopes to 
give britains designers an edge over foreign rivals with a 
reception monday night at her home in kensington palace for 200 
buyers designers and fashion journalists 
edina ronay a favorite designer of the princess and her 
sisterinlaw the duchess of york said its oneup on any 
other country that doesnt have a royal family that the whole world 
knows about 
blair another royal favorite said of the princess i think 
shes 98 percent responsible for the revival of interest in british 
fashion and i think what shes doing is terrific 
like the italians britains designers couldnt decide whether 
hems should be long or short so they offered both with plenty of 
trousers mainly wide as well as some slimmer jodhpurs breeches 
and dickensian stovepipes 
several british designers also picked up on the italian 
fascination with ecological furs arabella pollen who did a 
circus theme had fake leopard and zebra minisuits and antony 
price did brocade suits and frock coats trimmed in fake mink 
ronays designs went edwardian wendy dagworthy also explored 
retro themes of edwardian and late forties and betty jackson 
did hourglass edwardian jackets in a collection she called a 
complete mixup which i love 
the new realism of british fashion the designers said means 
choice quality and priceconsciousness 
i think its luxury dressing its beautiful fabrics its 
opulent said david sassoon of belville sassoon 
and then theres a contradiction well almost with lots of 
trousers theyre suddenly important again and they dont pose a 
length problem women who dont know whether to go long or short 
will opt for pants he said 
betty jacksons collection was nearly all pants wide and slim 
rifat ozbek designed a clinging wool jersey jumpsuit with a tiny 
draped miniskirt over it bruce oldfield said shapes were more 
important than lengths and hes doing bell skirts 
benny ong who showed silks with short bell skirts as well as 
long tubular dresses said i think women want to look younger 
but without looking silly give them a choice but maintain their 
integrity 
blair echoed that view showing long and short skirts i think 
women who do spend money on clothes are fed up that they have to 
look like 18yearolds you have to give people a choice he said 
with flounces and full skirts outmoded blair said he was able 
to use less fabric and cut the cost of his daywear by 25 percent 
and his evening gowns by 17 percent a plus in the current 
financial climate 
gina fratini whose black velvet cocktail dresses with ruffles 
and dashes of hot pink electric blue and turquoise were an instant 
seller said the stock market crash had made the designers come 
out fighting 
i think the stock market crash if anything has brought the 
fun clothes back because we want to cheer ourselves up she said

an agriculture department export program is 
helping alaska promote salmon in western europe and japan two 
lucrative us farm markets where competition is rising 
the departments targeted export assistance program popularly 
called tea has allocated 195 million this fiscal year for the 
alaska seafood marketing institute a quasiindependent commission 
of the states department of commerce and economic development 
according to a usda list of trade organizations sharing in the 
program the only other comparable group is the catfish farmers of 
america which was allocated 50000 
department officials said each tea plan is negotiated with the 
sponsoring group some put up money to match or exceed the federal 
contribution while others contribute less than tea provides 
total funding of tea which was authorized by the food security 
act of 1985 was pegged at a minimum of 110 million annually 
about 40 different commodities including alaskan seafood share in 
the program 
as directed by congress the purpose of tea is to finance 
promotional activities for us agricultural products that have 
been put to a disadvantage by subsidies and unfair trade policies 
of competitor nations 
the institute is ready to pit alaska salmon against penraised 
salmon from norway being promoted in france and japan according to 
roberta graham of evanskraft bean an anchorage public relations 
firm representing the institute 
alaska processors also are attending trade fairs and food shows 
in tokyo and paris to promote salmon ms graham said this week 
thursday during a visit to washington 
you have the corn belt and the wheat belt she said i 
choose to call alaska the fish belt 
the importance of fishing to the alaskan economy cannot be 
understated she said its second only to the oil generating 900 
million for the states economy last year 
in the first year of the tea program the alaskans got 15 
million from usda the 1988 allocation according to march 1 
figures by the departments foreign agricultural service is 195 
million making a twoyear total of 345 million 
but no matter how important fishing is to alaska the states 
tea allocation is a small part of the programs overall budget for 
the fiscal year that began on oct 1 some other commodities 
qualified for much higher shares 
the largest single tea allocation this year is 105 million to 
promote citrus from arizona and california the american soybean 
association followed with 98 million the us feed grains 
council got 24 million and us wheat associates 12 million 
california the nations leading producer of agricultural 
products in terms of value qualifies for the largest share of tea 
money the 1988 allocations for example include six different 
california state commissions and boards affecting avocados 
450000 cling peaches 57 million kiwifruit 500000 prunes 
55 million raisins 98 million and table grapes 750000 
as the main producer of almonds california also benefits from 
65 million of tea money allocated for that crop this year the 
walnut marketing board gets 65 million to promote walnuts 
overseas another california crop

the agriculture department is adding the 
simbrah association to its list of registered cattle breeds so 
owners can qualify for higher federal payments when animals are 
slaughtered under the departments brucellosis eradication program 
brucellosis is a highly contagious disease said james w 
glosser acting administrator of the departments animal and plant 
health inspection service 
our experience has shown that indemnities encourage owners to 
remove infected animals from their herds to prevent the spread of 
the disease 
brucellosis can be passed on to humans where it is known as 
undulant fever through raw milk from infected cows 
simbrah cattle are a cross between simmental and brahman the 
department said approximately 2200 us producers own registered 
simbrah cattle 
to receive federal indemnities for registered cattle the owner 
must present a certificate of registration as proof that the animal 
belonged to one of the 61 usdalisted breed associations 
the indemnity rate for all dairy cattle and registered beef 
cattle and bison is 250 per animal while the payment for 
nonregistered beef and bison is 50 per animal 
officials said the new rule goes into effect on april 11

local environmental groups from new england to 
florida to the pacific northwest are joining forces against the 
reagan administrations fiveyear plan for offshore oil and gas 
leasing 
no longer will the fight to block the administrations leasing 
plan be a series of pitched battles lynn davidson of greenpeace 
said friday 
coalition organizers said at a news conference following three 
days of meetings in washington that they will consider joint public 
education campaigns lobbying efforts and perhaps an advertising 
campaign 
this is not a state local or regional issue it is a national 
issue said rachael binah of the ocean sanctuary coordinating 
committee we want americans to see the bigger picture 
if the department of interior is allowed to continue with its 
fiveyear leasing plan the coastline of the united states will be 
systematically destroyed she said 
environmental leaders said they will focus on federal 
legislation for sensitive coastal areas in new england florida and 
california that would block or defer implementation of the 
fiveyear leasing plan which was unveiled last year by interior 
secretary donald hodel 
the most sensitive parts of georges bank a fishingrich area 
off the new england coast already are protected under a 
congressional moratorium rep gerry e studds dmass vowed last 
week to fight for the georges bank ban again this year 
ann whitfield of the florida public interest research group said 
hodel because of the fiveyear plan makes former interior 
secretary james watt look like an environmentalist watt and 
his policies were constantly under attack by the environmental 
community during his tenure early in the reagan administration 
richard charter who represents some cities and counties in the 
offshore leasing controversy in california said the coalition also 
wants to force the leasing issue into the presidential campaign 
were here to send a message that america cares about its 
coastline he said 
he said all the democratic presidential aspirants have vowed to 
either oppose or modify hodels plan which outlines the areas open 
for leasing and creates a timetable for the leasing of tracts 
the republican candidates have not answered issue inquiries sent 
by the activists charter said 
regional activists said they are fighting proposals to lease 
tracts off the coasts of california florida new england the gulf 
and the pacific northwest 
a group of environmentalists in august sued the interior 
department to halt the interior departments leasing plan that 
suit is pending in the us court of appeals

congressional analysts are challenging 
president reagans contention that a capitalgains tax cut would 
reduce the federal budget deficit 
although boosting the tax rate probably would produce less 
revenue the congressional budget office concluded that most 
evidence indicates that a lower rate would also result in a revenue 
loss the study estimated that loss at 39 billion to 78 billion 
a year if the top rate on longterm capital gains were lowered from 
33 percent to 15 percent 
some advocates estimate the government would collect as much as 
15 billion a year more under a 15 percent cut because the lower 
rate would encourage people to sell longheld assets 
cbo researchers cautioned against putting too much faith in any 
prediction of how taxpayers might react to changes there are so 
many uncertainties the study said that one cannot reject the 
possibility that a 15 percent rate might increase revenues but 
the cbo said that is unlikely 
as part of the massive revision of federal income taxes in 1986 
congress eliminated the longtime preferential treatment accorded 
capital gains which are profits from the sale of stocks real 
estate and other assets owned more than six months that action 
raised the top rate on capital gains from 20 percent to 33 percent 
in a written message to congress on jan 25 reagan said the 
most important piece of unfinished tax business is to reduce the 
capitalgains tax rate to the level that will generate the savings 
and investment necessary for future economic growth past 
experience demonstrates that lowering the capitalgains tax rate 
will mean increased realizations of capital gains upon which taxes 
are paid 
reducing the capitalgains tax rate to an agreedupon optimum 
should be a cornerstone of tax reform for the 1990s reagan wrote 
the president did not say how deeply the rate should be cut but 
the level mentioned most often by congressional advocates is 15 
percent 
there is considerable support in congress for reducing the 
maximum capitalgains rate advocates say this not only would raise 
revenue by encouraging the sale of longheld assets but also 
would encourage new investment 
opponents noting that eliminating the capitalgains benefit was 
a major factor in getting the 1986 tax law enacted contend 
restoring it would threaten that entire package 
most benefits of a capitalgains reduction would go to the 
wealthiest americans the internal revenue service estimates that 
taxpayers with incomes of 100000 or more account for 55 percent 
of all capital gains but only 9 percent of other income 
in a report to chairman william gray dpa of the house budget 
committee the cbo concluded that any increase in capitalgains 
realizations the sale of assets was not likely to generate 
enough revenue to offset a cut in the tax rate 
in addition the study said restoring preferential treatment to 
capital gains might reduce other forms of taxable income such as 
interest and dividends because investments that created capital 
gains would be made more attractive than other types

teamsters president jackie pressers attorney 
says hes pleased with a ruling that prosecutors improperly 
obtained statements from an fbi agent charged with lying about his 
role in handling presser as an informant 
we look forward to a similar result in the jackie presser 
case attorney john climaco said in an interview in cleveland 
friday after an appeals court in washington suppressed statements 
that former cleveland fbi agent robert s friedrick allegedly made 
to government prosecutors in early 1986 
friedrick was indicted in may 1986 on five counts of making 
false statements that forced the government to delay for nearly a 
year its planned prosecution of presser 
presser who has headed the 16 millionmember teamsters union 
since 1983 was also indicted in may 1986 a grand jury in 
cleveland charged him with two counts of labor racketeering one 
count of embezzlement and two counts of filing false reports with 
the government his trial is set for july 
friedrick orginally said presser had been authorized by his fbi 
handlers to hire ghost employees at a cleveland teamsters union 
local who did no work 
the justice department wanted to prosecute presser for the 
alleged ghost hirings but abandoned the investigation after 
friedricks assertions 
however friedrick admitted during the ensuing fbijustice 
department inquiry that his statements about authorizing the 
illegal acts were false according to tapes and transcripts 
provided by the justice department his alleged admissions revived 
the teamsters probe which resulted in the indictment of presser 
friedricks attorney william beyer said fridays appeals court 
decision eliminates the only evidence prosecutors have against his 
client 
i dont know of any other evidence that they have to support 
their claim beyer said in a telephone interview from cleveland 
but friedrick who was fired from the fbi last august succeeded 
in having his alleged admissions suppressed as evidence by us 
district judge george revercomb on grounds that the justice 
department interrogators had not advised him of his constitutional 
right to remain silent 
clendon lee spokesman for the us attorneys office in 
washington declined comment 
it was unclear what effect the decision would have on the 
governments case against presser 
stephen jigger head of the fbi strike force in cleveland and 
prosecutor in the presser case declined comment saying he had not 
yet received a copy of the court decision 
during a june 26 1985 interview at fbi headquarters in 
washington friedrick signed an fbi form that said he was required 
to answer questions but that the government could not use his 
statements against him in a criminal prosecution as long as they 
were true 
during interviews the following january friedrick made 
statements contradicting his previous assertion that presser had 
been authorized to put ghost employees on the locals payroll the 
next day he failed a lie detector test 
the appellate court upheld revercombs finding that friedrick 
was not warned during the interview that statements he made could 
be used against him 
the prosecutors made a conscious decision prior to the 
interview not to furnish friedrick with or even mention the fbi 
form indeed they hoped that friedrick would make incriminating 
statements that they could use against him in a subsequent 
prosecution the court said in an opinion by judge kenneth starr

president reagan says he is prepared to take 
additional steps against panamas government if a new series of 
economic sanctions does not force military strongman manuel antonio 
noriega from power 
as expected reagan announced friday that the united states will 
withhold a 65 million payment due to panama next tuesday for 
operations relating to the panama canal he took other measures 
designed to make panmanian products less competitive in us 
markets 
until such time as a democratic government is restored in 
panama the us cannot proceed on a business as usual basis 
reagan said in a statement 
panamas ambassador juan b sosa praised reagans 
announcement he told a news conference late friday that the 
sanctions combined with antigovernment actions by the panamanian 
people will be enough to bring noriega down 
sosa has refused to recognize the twoweek old regime in panama 
sharing reagans view that it took power by unconstitutional means 
and is therefore illegitimate sosa has declined to turn over the 
embassy to a new envoy named by noriega 
rep jack fields rtexas the ranking minority member of a 
house subcommittee that deals with the panama canal said he was 
ecstatic over reagans announcement he predicted the sanctions 
will hasten noriegas departure 
reagan said that noriega under federal indictment on drug 
trafficking charges would best serve panama by relinquishing his 
post as commander of panamas defense forces 
reagans announcement came two weeks after president eric arturo 
delvalle attempted to fire noriega but was instead ousted hours 
later in a move that had all the the earmarks of a military coup 
the president said his decision to withhold the 65 million 
payment and place it in escrow was not in violation of us 
obligations under the panama canal treaties 
i am prepared to take additional steps if necessary to deny 
the transfer of funds to the noriega regime from other sources in 
the us reagan said 
reagan also said that panamanian exports subject to us tariffs 
will no longer be admitted at the lowest possible rates secretary 
of state george p shultz said the amount of annual trade affected 
by the decision is 96 million 
in addition reagan announced the suspension of panamanian 
participation in the caribbean basin initiative under which some 
products are allowed dutyfree entry into the united states 
he also ordered steppedup inspection of people and goods 
entering the united states from panama in order to apprehend drug 
traffickers and money launderers 
shultz said there was no need to impose an additional sanction 
relating to the fees panama receives from alaskan oil shipments 
transferred to us east coast ports through a panamanian pipeline 
shultz said those fees already have been frozen based on earlier 
court action estimates of the revenues panama receives from the 
pipeline range from 80 million to 120 million annually 
the aim of the sanctions is to aggravate an existing cashflow 
crisis in panama panamanian newspapers said friday paychecks for 
government workers may have to be delayed because of the cash 
shortage 
also on friday abc news quoted diplomatic sources as saying the 
government of spain was prepared to offer asylum to noriega 
the two countries most mentioned by opposition leaders as 
possible asylum sites are paraguay and the dominican republic 
opposition leaders say they have sounded out the dominican republic 
and that noriega sent two military colleagues to paraguay this past 
week possibly to discuss asylum prospects

firefighters begged for help from 
neighboring counties friday in battling grass fires that seared a 
60mile swath across west texas ranch land 
the fire is out of control on all fronts the shackelford 
county sheriffs office reported were pulling all our forces 
back in to protect homes 
the fire killed an undetermined number of cattle set hunting 
camps ablaze and destroyed at least one mobile home some of the 
500 firefighters suffered minor burns and were overcome by smoke 
but no serious injuries were reported 
the fire was reported within two or three miles of albany a 
town of about 2500 people but evacuations were not immediately 
ordered firefighters earlier burned ground near the town to divert 
the main fire 
its just an inferno in the pastures and with winds of 35 
mph a horse couldnt outrun it said albany resident liston f 
todd who was helping build firebreaks to detour the blaze 
the fire which began thursday covered an area 60 miles long 
and 25 miles wide over three counties with at least a 20mile wide 
portion of the blaze out of control officials said 
joe fox the texas forest service official overseeing the 
firefighting said it could take four more days to finally put out 
the fire smoke and haze reached the fort worthdallas area more 
than 120 miles east of the blaze 
a us forest service aircraft tanker was scheduled to fly over 
the area saturday morning dumping up to 2000 gallons of 
fireextinguishing chemicals 
shifting winds made it difficult to determine where the fire 
would spread and in some cases firefighters were nearly surrounded 
by the swift flames 
at least one firefighting bulldozer was caught and destroyed by 
the fire a tv news team was momentarily threatened by a line of 
fire that suddenly changed course 
twenty volunteer fire departments sent men and equipment to the 
area on friday a day after gov bill clements ordered 100 national 
guardsmen to help 
they joined nearly two dozen forest service firefighters and the 
crews of 15 fire deparments police radios crackled with pleas for 
more equipment and manpower to battle the blazes 
texas forest service spokesman sam logan said there had been 
speculation that trash fires may have sparked the blazes when 
humidity dipped to 7 percent thursday we consider anything below 
30 percent is really dangerous 
meanwhile a blaze broke out in val verde county about 200 miles 
away blackening 125000 acres of ranchland about 60 miles north of 
the mexican border 
no injuries were reported a shift in the wind was expected to 
help the fire burn itself out officials

jesse jackson was hoping to win a clear 
majority of delegates today in south carolinas democratic 
presidential caucuses while tennessee sen albert gore jr 
insisted he was a strong contender 
if you believe it were going to win this nomination 
jackson told members of the south carolina education association 
friday 
jackson said half the states have held primaries or caucuses and 
he has finished first or second in all but a few of them in 
south carolina i want to win another gold medal 
the caucus meetings at 1788 precincts were scheduled to begin 
in the late afternoon 
jackson came into south carolina second to massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis in delegates overall and jackson predicted that 
after todays caucuses and the primary tuesday in his second home 
illinois he would be the delegate leader 
illinois sen paul simon has virtually ignored south carolina 
recently and his state campaign coordinator dan king said friday 
that the campaign was asking simon supporters to remain uncommitted 
in the caucuses today but to work to become delegates to the county 
conventions later in the month 
missouri rep richard gephardt campaigned two days in the state 
this week and also is looking for a share of the 44 delegates at 
stake 
gore who toured the states major cities friday said he 
expected to do extremely well today and said he was the 
candidate with the momentum he told a crowd of a few hundred 
supporters at the statehouse that his strong showing on super 
tuesday surprised everyone 
i believe that momentum is going to continue right through the 
convention in atlanta and right through november he said im 
excited about the possibility of victory 
john dukakis said friday he believed his father would get some 
support because of his frontrunner status and his vision for 
economic growth 
we would like to pick up some delegates he said but 
were realistic and know its going to be difficult we understand 
that were up against two strong favorite sons and that they are 
going to do well

a construction company facing lawsuits 
and fines over a building collapse in bridgeport conn that 
killed 28 workmen filed friday for reorganization under chapter 11 
of the federal bankruptcy code 
texstar construction corp and its subsidiary continental lift 
slab corp took the step so that any litigation can be heard in 
texas rather than the unfriendly judicial environment of 
bridgeport said corporate counsel david t turlington 
it acted after a federal judge in bridgeport approved a 187 
million lien against company assets to cover any damages that might 
result from a suit filed over the april 1987 collapse of the 
lambiance plaza apartment complex by victims and families 
you basically have convicted the guy and taken his assets and 
he still hasnt had the right to a trial said turlington we 
are concerned about the political and judicial atmosphere in 
connecticut which has been attempting to ban the liftslab 
method 
san antoniobased texstar was the primary subcontractor on the 
lambiance plaza it was constructed using the liftslab method in 
which concrete floors are poured on the ground then lifted by 
jacks to their proper height along vertical steel columns 
the occupational safety and health administration fined texstar 
252 million for 238 instances of alleged willful violations 
texstar also has been referred to the justice department for 
possible prosecution 
on march 2 victims and families of victims filed suit in us 
district court in bridgeport against texstar judge warren eginton 
on march 2 gave the plaintiffs permission to attach 187 million of 
texstars assets 
texstar listed unsecured debts of almost 190 million and assets 
of about 13 million continental lift slab listed unsecured debts 
of 150449 and assets of 327709 
chapter 11 allows a company to hold off its creditors while it 
undergoes a financial reorganization 
in a statement texstar said friday that it has not been given 
the opportunity to a fair and impartial trial or hearing and 
that bankruptcy court would provide a forum to answer the 
allegations 
we are certainly not going to stop the presses just because 
texstar has filed chapter 11 said bridgeport attorney richard 
beider lead counsel for the victims families 
bieder called the action unfortunate because it is another 
blow to the families of the victims that comes on the heels of the 
tragedy itself and on the heels of laws that are like hurdles that 
the families have to overcome to receive just compensation

associations representing city and county 
governments are virtually certain to appeal a court ruling that 
is permitting the reagan administration to withhold 180 million in 
revenue sharing funds an attorney says 
a threejudge panel of the us court of appeals for the 
district of columbia circuit on friday reversed a lower court 
ruling and said the administration did not have to distribute the 
money to local governments 
i think its virtually certain well ask the court to 
reconsider its decision said david c vladek a lawyer for the 
national association of counties the national league of cities 
the us conference of mayors and 10 city and county governments 
my sense is the court did not fully comprehend the nature of 
our legal arguments he said 
the dispute involves president reagans feb 1 1986 order 
under the grammrudman law that set aside 43 percent of budget 
items including 180 million from that years 42 billion 
appropriation to the revenue sharing trust fund 
the local governments argued that the law provided that 1986 
budget money that had been sequestered should remain in government 
trust funds and be paid out in 1987 they argued that even though 
congress had abolished revenue sharing after 1986 it intended that 
any money remaining in the trust fund be distributed 
revenue sharing begun under the nixon administration provided 
nearly all local governments with unrestricted federal grants 
us district judge joyce hens green on july 28 ruled in favor 
of the local governments and said treasury secretary james a baker 
iii had illegally transferred the revenue sharing money from the 
trust fund to the general fund 
however judge john r gibson who wrote the appeals panels 
decision reversing green said congress intent with the 
grammrudman law was clearly to reduce the federal budget deficit 
merely freezing the monies in 1986 and resuscitating them 
in 1987 would not result in any meaningful deficit reduction and 
could be characterized by critics to be a sham said gibson who 
was joined by judges patricia m wald and david santelle 
the result in this case may be harsh but we believe it is 
consistent with congressional intent wrote gibson who was 
designated to the case from the us court of appeals for the 
eighth circuit in st louis 
among the plaintiffs are new york city kansas city mo 
milwaukee county wis and cuyahoga county ohio which includes 
cleveland 
the us conference of mayors at the time of the original 
district court decision last summer had estimated that new york 
would receive 10 million chicago 26 million los angeles 22 
million and detroit 13 million of the money 
other estimates were 606000 for new orleans 554000 for 
indianapolis 677000 for washington dc 440000 for denver and 
104000 for des moines iowa estimates for other cities were not 
provided

here is a transcript of gary harts statement 
withdrawing friday from the race for the democratic presidential 
nomination 
thank you very much 
thank you all very much 
i want to first of all introduce my wife lee our son john 
i want also to acknowledge the presence of some very good 
friends and great party leaders here today the governor of the 
state of colorado roy romer our good personal friends and more 
than worthy successor to me in the united states senate tim and 
wren wirth and the chairman of the colorado state democratic 
party and also a very good friend of ours buie seawell 
we want to thank each and every one of you for being here 
few people have had the good fortune that ive had good fortune 
measured in terms of my family and a farflung network of friends 
and supporters around the country and in the opportunities that i 
have been given to serve my country 
fewer americans still have had the opportunity to run for 
president of the united states and ive had that chance twice 
the people are the strength of this country 
i said i wanted them to decide about my candidacy 
i got a fair hearing 
and the people have decided 
and now i clearly should not go forward 
my candidacy represented a more complicated and difficult choice 
than in 1984 
a choice beyond the scope of traditional politics and i fully 
understood that 
i also had a more farreaching and complex economic defense 
and foreign policy agenda 
that was difficult to reduce to slogans and sound bites 
nonetheless i did get a chance particularly in the debates to 
get my message of fundamental change and reform on the record and 
to draw distinctions between my ideas and those of the other 
democratic candidates 
for that i want to thank all those especially the young people 
who came to my speeches 
and i want to thank members of the press and media who were 
fair balanced and professional 
lee and i want to congratulate mike and kitty dukakis jesse and 
jackie jackson and al and tipper gore for their very impressive 
achievements last tuesday and before 
theyve all worked extremely hard and they deserve every bit of 
the credit they have received 
i also want to thank paul simon along with the others for his 
gentlemanliness towards me in the debates and wish him well in his 
home state primary 
while disagreeing with him strongly on trade and international 
economics ive been extremely impressed with dick gephardts 
thoughtfulness and his equanimity under harsh attack 
despite his lack of political success all of us gained great 
respect for bruce babbitt as truthteller and prophet on our 
national budget and fiscal policy 
win or lose each of these candidates has grown in stature and 
deserves to be considered as genuine national leaders 
but win or lose we also face an unhappy reality 
the democratic party has won only one national election since 
1964 
the struggle in our party is not between the left and the right 
its between the past and the future 
and those who cling to the past too often mask their lack of 
vision and direction with caution and vagueness and platitudes 
we can only win if we are prepared to govern 
and we can only be prepared to govern if we challenge the future 
with bold specific new policies to make our economy productive 
once again and to conduct a serious foreign policy in an 
increasingly complex world 
the remaining candidates should forgo the bitter personal 
attacks so favored by political insiders and instead show their 
concern for the national interest by seriously debating the issues 
that are threatening our country 
instead of canceling or running from debates now that there are 
fewer candidates there should be more debates

a presidential campaign really is a debate over differences 
among the candidates 
and thats what it ought to be 
the remaining candidates should put out budget proposals to 
reduce reagan deficits and show how they would pay for their 
programs 
this would demonstrate competence and show honesty on the tax 
issue 
i encourage these candidates to learn the principles and 
philosophy of military reform because that represents the best 
defense policy for our country 
and they should spell out a foreign policy framework thats 
specific on issues such as third world debt and the use of military 
force to avoid the continuing pitfalls of ad hoc response of crisis 
after crisis 
we should challenge our young people to help eliminate 
illiteracy and poverty and pollution to give something back to 
their country through a voluntary national service 
so now is the time that the candidates should welcome serious 
debates not about personalities but about policies for this 
countrys future 
the reason i got back in the race was to help stimulate that 
debate about the future to challenge caution and narrowinterest 
politics of the past and to lead the cause of reform 
and i intend to continue that leadership for reform because it 
is the best hope for our country 
its a cause that lives on beyond any campaign 
i hope those who share that cause will help me continue the 
center for a new democracy which we began in 1984 
through the center through speeches through writing and 
symposiums around the country we can provide a voice for those who 
know our policies must be fundamentally restructured to keep the 
torch of democracy and idealism and hope alive 
most of all i want to say that no one has ever been more 
blessed with family and friends than i have 
my friends and supporters around the country have given the word 
loyalty new meaning 
theyve toiled tirelessly in an uphill fight understanding the 
odds throughout and having as their only reward the knowledge that 
they had done their very best to move our country forward 
to all of you everywhere particularly the young people my very 
warmest thanks and deepest gratitude and i promise that ill find 
some way in years to come to repay your commitment and loyalty to 
the cause which we shared 
public words of course are insufficient to express my feelings 
towards lee and andrea and john each of whom has demonstrated in 
his or her own way inexhaustible courage and fortitude and 
conviction in that same cause 
theyre owed more than i can ever possibly repay 
and to those of you in and out of politics who may face 
setbacks failures or defeats who are told to give up 
accommodate or compromise i hope youll simply say as i do 
hell no 
preserve your integrity study time and patience and never give 
up 
as i have before i leave with you these words 
no great cause is ever lost or ever won the battle must 
always be renewed and the creed restated for some things are 
universal catholic and undying they do not age or pass out of 
fashion for they symbolize eternal things they are the guardians 
of the freedom of the human spirit the proof of what our mortal 
frailty can achieve 
thank you all 
god bless you

following is the text of robert c mcfarlanes 
statement to reporters after his guilty plea to misdemeanor charges 
of misleading congress in the irancontra affair 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i should say at the outset that from the beginning judge walsh 
and all of his staff have dealt with me in a thoroughly 
professional way as judge walsh has said on the occasions that 
were cited inside i did indeed withhold information from the 
congress i believe strongly that throughout my actions were 
motivated by what i believed was in the best foreign policy 
interests of the united states 
from the first moment when the irancontra disclosures were made 
in november of 86 i felt a profound personal obligation to 
testify fully and voluntarily before the bodies that were formally 
established to investigate this matter that includes the tower 
commission the joint committee of the congress and the 
independent counsel i have done so in more than 200 hours of 
public and private testimony without access to my records or with 
any request for or promise of immunity ive told all that i know 
and its on the public record for everyone to see and i intend to 
remain available to repeat it for as long as its necessary to 
bring this matter to a conclusion 
i do think that its unfortunate that the fundamental issue 
here that is why congressionalexecutive relations broke down so 
tragically has not been and apparently cannot be dealt with by the 
congress or the courts it seems to me important indeed 
imperative that an indepth exploration of how to forge a better 
working relationship is essential if the united states and i mean 
by that the president and the congress is to shoulder its global 
leadership responsibility in the years ahead 
and finally i intend to do what i can to contribute to that 
continuing effort

here is a text of the statement president 
reagan released friday announcing a series of sanctions against the 
government of panama 
the united states has had a long and mutually productive 
relationship with panama the people of the united states consider 
the people of panama to be near neighbors and friends the historic 
panama canal treaties exemplify the close cooperation that has 
traditionally characterized the friendship between the two 
countries which created one of the great engineering works of the 
human race 
out of concern for our friendship we have been saddened and 
increasingly worried in recent years as panamas political crisis 
deepened our policy with respect to the situation in panama is 
clear we strongly favor a rapid restoration of democracy and the 
resumption by the panamanian defense forces of a role consistent 
with constitutional democracy 
in the present circumstances i believe that general noriega 
would best serve his country by complying with the instruction of 
president delvalle to relinquish his post in so doing general 
noriega would contribute very substantially to reducing political 
tensions and set the stage for a prompt transition to democracy in 
panama 
until such a time as democratic government is restored in 
panama the us cannot proceed on a business as usual basis 
today therefore i have taken a number of steps against the 
illegitimate noriega regime that will contribute significantly to 
the goal of a democratic stable and prosperous panama 
i have directed that actions be taken to suspend trade 
preferences available to panama under the generalized system of 
preferences and the caribbean basin initiative further in keeping 
with the spirit of our war against drugs i have ordered that 
panama be subject to intensified scrutiny by our immigration and 
customs services in order to apprehend drug traffickers and money 
launderers 
moreover because we recognize president delvalle as the lawful 
head of government in panama i have directed that all departments 
and agencies inventory all sources of funds due or payable to the 
republic of panama from the us government for purposes of 
determining those that should be placed in escrow for the delvalle 
government on behalf of the panamanian people in that light i 
have directed that certain payments due to panama from the panama 
canal commission be placed in escrow immediately this step is in 
complete compliance with our obligations under the terms of the 
panama canal treaties 
i am prepared to take additional steps if necessary to deny 
the transfer of funds to the noriega regime from other sources in 
the us 
we have welcomed the recent statements issued by president 
delvalle the political parties and the civilian crusade of panama 
calling for a government of national reconciliation we support 
their goal of restoring democratic government and constitutional 
order once panamanians achieve this goal the united states is 
fully prepared to work with the government of panama to help 
quickly restore panamas economic health 
the united states has been and remains committed to fulfilling 
faithfully its obligations under the panama canal treaties we are 
also prepared to resume our close working relationships with the 
panamanian defense forces once civilian government and 
constitutional democracy are reestablished

here are some of the latest comments by 
candidates for the presidency 
 
bob dole seeking to save a candidacy he says is hanging by 
our fingernails and maintaining many voters are still undecided 
its like lastminute christmas shoppers some people dont even 
know what theyre going to buy until the last 24 hours and then 
they buy whatever is left we dont want that to happen 
 
george bush declining a oneonone confrontation with dole 
recalling that he tried that with ronald reagan in 1980 and 
probably lost the gop nomination that year because of it i may 
be older but im a lot smarter now too 
 
michael dukakis dining in chicagos greektown section and 
commenting on whether he is trying to build an ethnic coalition 
we want to put together a coalition of people all over this 
country whether theyre firstgeneration or secondgeneration 
americans 
 
albert gore continuing to attack dukakis his complete lack 
of experience in foreign policy is i think a major issue at a 
time when the next president must be prepared to seize the 
opportunities for a new relationship with the soviets 
 
pat robertson saying he will campaign all the way to the 
republican national convention im in it until new orleans

a former top aide to gov evan mecham 
acknowledged that he told the governor an alleged death threat by a 
state official was a frivolous matter mecham should forget 
about 
max hawkins former head of the department of administration 
testified friday at the republican governors impeachment trial 
that he thought the alleged threat was a matter that would 
probably go away by itself 
mecham is accused of trying to thwart the attorney generals 
investigation of the threat allegedly made against a witness 
testifying before a state grand jury that was investigating the 
governors campaign finances 
earlier friday another former state official sam steiger 
testified the governor believed some of his decisions were 
divinely inspired 
steiger had been asked by sen john mawhinney whether mecham a 
devout mormon could and would make decisions on specific pieces 
of legislation through he believed some divine inspiration 
asked by a reporter about steigers testimony mecham said only 
sam hes a little off the wall in some of his comments too 
mormon doctrine holds that faithful christians may receive 
guidance from god regarding worldly endeavors including their 
occupations 
the day marked the end of the second week of mechams senate 
trial in addition to the death threat allegation he is accused of 
concealing a 350000 campaign loan and misusing 80000 from the 
governors protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership 
former state prison construction chief lee watkins is accused of 
threatening the life of former top mecham aide donna carlson in a 
conversation with peggy griffith head of the governors office of 
womens services 
hawkins testified that he spoke on nov 13 with watkins and mrs 
griffith and that he did not believe an actual death threat was 
made 
instead hawkins said he felt that watkins had said that ms 
carlson should keep her mouth shut and there are a lot of people 
out there who are excitable and she could have harm come to her 
hawkins said that when he told watkins that mrs griffith had 
reported the matter to others he laughed and thought that it was 
absurd that she was telling anyone about it 
hawkins said he met with mecham later that day and told the 
governor that he had found that it was a little spat a frivolous 
matter and that mecham should forget about it 
watkins has denied threatening ms carlsons life he is 
scheduled to return to the stand monday mecham could testify late 
next week said defense lawyer fred craft 
steiger blamed many of mechams troubles on attorney general bob 
corbin a republican 
steiger said mecham resented corbin because the governor took 
the political heat for canceling a martin luther king holiday for 
state workers when it was corbin who first said the holiday was 
illegally created through an executive proclamation by mechams 
predecessor bruce babbitt 
steiger faces an extortion charge brought by corbins office on 
an unrelated matter 
corbin contacted for comment on steigers testimony said 
just remember the position he is in with regard to our office and 
you can draw your own conclusions 
mecham also faces a may 17 recall election and an april 21 
criminal trial on charges of concealing the 350000 loan 
he is the first us governor impeached in six decades and the 
first ever in arizona a twothirds vote of the 30member senate is 
required to convict him and lawmakers also could bar him from 
holding any future public office

butcher noted that redington and nayokpuk took their mandatory 
24hour layovers early in the race an advantage because the

it was a break for them in the beginning but now theyve been 
going with no real long rest for a while i think our dogs are 
fresher she said 
but nayokpuk who couldnt keep up with redington between 
cripple and ruby said butcher and swenson may have trouble 
catching redington

disappeared in a hurry a tired nayokpuk said as he sat on the 
porch of a house in ruby and changed his boots i never saw him 
again he has the dogs if he gets those dogs running to nome hes 
going to be a hard one to beat

panamanians who have been unable to 
cash their checks for 10 days faced cuts in public services today 
as washington increased economic pressure on the government to 
force panamas strongman to resign 
president reagan on friday froze millions of dollars in 
panamanian assets in the united states and again called on gen 
manuel antonio noriega to step down as chief of the 15000member 
defense forces 
panamas new chief executive manuel solis palma met with his 
cabinet in an emergency session friday 
he was to meet with the cabinet again today to work out a 
total package plan to deal with the crisis especially a payment 
plan for public employees who must be paid by march 15 said an 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the government reportedly was considering delaying or reducing 
payments due tuesday to nearly 150000 government employees 
banks closed march 1 because of the lack of currency leaving 
panamanians holding checks they cannot cash panamas currency is 
the us dollar 
solis palma ordered reductions in public services friday as the 
governments coffers ran low 
the government ordered cutbacks in electricity and fuel 
consumption telephone and public vehicles use it also announced a 
twohour reduction in working hours for government offices 
reagan said the united states will place fees due to panama this 
month from the panama canal into escrow until a government led by 
ousted president eric arturo delvalle can claim them a 66 
million payment of canal fees is due tuesday 
pronoriega legislators ousted delvalle from the presidency feb 
26 a day after delvalle tried to fire noriega solis palma was 
named to replace delvalle who has been in hiding since 
the united states continues to recognize delvalle as panamas 
legitimate president 
reagan also suspended trade preferences granted panama and 
ordered increased scrutiny of the country by us immigration and 
customs service officials to apprehend drug traffickers and money 
launderers 
i believe that gen noriega would best serve his country by 
complying with the instruction of president delvalle to relinquish 
his post reagan said calling noriegas regime illegitimate 
noriega was indicted last month in the united states on drug 
trafficking and money laundering charges 
boris moreno a panamanian government spokesman said the us 
actions created a state of war and set a dangerous precedent 
this means that if the united states government does not like 
the government of another country it can withhold any funds 
deposited in the united states he said 
noriega made no comment on reagans new sanctions an official 
statement by the foreign ministry on the us actions was expected 
riot police firing tear gas grenades and spraying a stinging 
acrid liquid from canisters prevented opposition parties from 
holding a demonstration in the central banking district friday 
three journalists were injured when police sprayed tear gas in 
their faces at close range they were lucia annunziata a reporter 
with the newspaper la repubblica of rome david walters a 
photographer with the miami herald and manolo iscala a cameraman 
for spanish television 
the us sanctions were expected to deepen a cashflow crisis 
that has forced panamanian banks to close for 10 consecutive days 
attorneys for delvalle have tied up an estimated 50 million in 
official panamanian funds in private us banks 
the government on friday asked owners of four supermarket 
chains a department store and a pharmacy chain to act as 
checkcashing houses for government employees the owners refused 
saying it was up to the central bank to guarantee government checks 
businesses have not been accepting credit cards or checks for 
purchases only cash

three intelligence operatives who say the fbi and 
cia asked them to infiltrate lyndon larouches political operation 
repeatedly tried to involve him in illegal activities a larouche 
attorney told a judge 
defense lawyer michael reilly on friday urged us district 
judge robert e keeton to halt testimony in larouches fraud and 
conspiracy trial until prosecutors finish searching government 
records for references to the operatives and evidence of 
infiltration of larouche groups 
keeton canceled testimony for monday and said he would decide 
then if a longer delay was necessary in the trial of larouche six 
aides and five larouche organizations 
the defendants are charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal 
grand jury investigation into alleged credit card and loan fraud 
during larouches 1984 presidential campaign 
keeton has ordered assistant us attorney john markham to 
search the files of the fbi cia national security council and 
vice president george bush 
reilly said he would present evidence of entrapment in private 
if keeton desired but refused to be specific in open court keeton 
did not request the information 
the three operatives referred to by reilly are retired army sgt 
maj fred lewis ron tucker and gary howard in an fbi document 
declassified last week lewis tucker and howard said they were 
asked by the fbi and cia to infiltrate larouche organizations 
markham filed a memo in which he charged the three men were 
lying 
a search of the fbi files relating to them shows that they 
were never requested to penetrate the organization and that they 
never did so markham said in the memo 
reilly disputed that saying markhams memo made no reference to 
infiltration on behalf of the cia he also noted a memo between two 
pivotal players in the irancontra scandal in which lewis is 
referred to by last name but only as proof lewis was well known by 
government officials 
in a memo sent to thennsc aide oliver north by retired air 
force maj gen richard secord one of norths principal operatives 
in the network helping nicaraguan contra rebels secord said our 
man told him lewis had gathered info against larouche 
lewis is the executive vice president of rhyolite management 
systems a texas company larouche lawyers contend was one of 
several companies run by former military officers that the cia used 
to carry out covert activities 
howard and tucker claim to be longtime government informants and 
were the founders of another texas company now defunct that 
reportedly carried out covert activities 
markham originally told defense lawyers that our man 
referred to oliver buck revell a top fbi official involved in 
counterintelligence markham later said he was mistaken and that 
the reference was to john cupp a secord associate who worked in 
the resupply effort 
secord and cupp in interviews this week also have said the 
reference was to cupp both denied any role in or knowledge of a 
government effort to spy on larouche 
reilly on friday filed a motion demanding the information 
markham relied on when he initially said secord was referring to 
revell 
if our man here is in fact oliver revell it would create a 
motive for highlevel forces in the fbi and national security 
council to conceal that in order to protect mr revell the 
motion said 
larouche attorneys said the information might help them prove 
their contention that north asked the fbi and cia to infiltrate 
larouche groups because they were interfering with norths private 
contra resupply effort 
an fbi spokesman said the agency would not comment on matters at 
issue in a trial

the marine corps has devised a new training 
policy that mandates tougher physical conditioning programs to make 
sure those who already have made it through basic training are 
ready for combat

divided between anaerobic conditioning progressive resistance 
training and aerobic conditioning

focused on physical fitness and adds the focus therefore of 
our programs must change each commander must emphasize unit and 
combat fitness training instead of physical fitness testing and

jesse jackson probably wont be on the 
democratic ticket in 1988 but he should have some sort of 
inspirational role in a democratic administration says former 
virginia gov charles s robb 
robb said jackson would be best in some part of the greater 
domestic policy portion where he is simply without peer in 
motivating young people in encouraging young people not to get 
involved with drugs in encouraging people to pursue education 
robb told the cleveland city club on friday 
i think its probably clear that if he is to have a role in 
the next administration it ought to be a role that is principally 
an inspirational role and not a managerial role he said

two car bombs exploded in the 
capitals fashionable pink zone sending diners diving for 
cover and running for safety and injuring at least two people 
witnesses and officials said 
no group claimed responsibility for the bombs that went off 
friday night in the affluent sector of san salvador 
earlier in the day about 400 union activists marched through 
the city to demand the release of a detained labor leader 
the first bomb went off in front of flashback a restaurant 
adjacent to two cafes where leftist guerrillas killed 13 people 
including six americans in a machine gun attack in june 1985 
the second bomb exploded about five minutes later in a parking 
lot behind a pizza hut restaurant causing no injuries

middleaged man were wounded in front of flashback one of a row 
of trendy restaurants and night clubs in the zona rosa

his hand and released 
glass shards littered the street in front of flashback

the explosives was little more than a frame with some shreds of 
sheet metal its make and year could not be immediately determined

empty the car that held the second bomb also was reduced to a 
twisted black metal skeleton bomb squad members there said they 
had not determined what type of explosive was used

us rep mario biaggi could have helped wedtech 
corp for free but chose to help plunder millions of dollars from 
the bronx defense contractor a prosecutor told jurors in the 
congressmans racketeering trial 
the crime is not what the congressman did the crime is that 
he was paid for what he did the extortion and bribes howard 
wilson an assistant us attorney said friday in us district 
court 
wilsons opening statement to jurors hearing the case of biaggi 
and six codefendants outlined how a little company in the 
bronx was turned into an enterprise that was to be plundered 
to be used by the people on trial here 
and in the end because of the corruption because of the 
greed because of the lies the company went kaput he said 
wedtech formed in 1965 as a machine shop capitalized on laws 
allocating government contracts for minorityowned enterprises and 
by 1985 had grown into a defense contractor with 1000 employees 
and 117 million in revenue 
the company suspended operations and laid off most of its 
workers in december 1986 then filed for protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy act 
the codefendants are former bronx borough president stanley 
simon 57 bernard g ehrlich 59 of bedford biaggis former law 
partner and a former major general in the new york national guard 
biaggis son richard 38 of fort lee nj peter neglia 39 of 
armonk the former regional administrator of the small business 
administration former wedtech chairman john mariotta 57 of 
scarsdale and ronald betso 39 of brooklyn a former policeman and 
friend of neglias 
all treated this company like a gold mine said wilson 
the defendants claimed that mariotta who is hispanic was the 
majority owner of wedtech entitling the company to nobid federal 
contracts wilson saidbut mariotta owned less than half said the 
prosecutor 
rep biaggi who at one point demanded 5 percent of wedtechs 
revenues was given 5 percent of wedtech stock which was put in 
his sons name wilson said the elder biaggi and ehrlich made 4 
million from the 225000 wedtech shares they received he said 
at another point biaggi 70 asked for 50000 for expediting a 
lease before the citys board of estimate the prosecutor said 
simon demanded and received more than 50000 in cash meals 
chips for gambling at atlantic city nj casinos marble for his 
home a trip to rome and charitable contributions in his name 
wilson said 
simon also got a wedtech job for his brotherinlaw and took 
half his raises over the years wilson said 
neglia was wedtechs paidfor friend wilson said among 
other things wilson claimed neglia warned the company about a 
congressional probe 
neglia was paid with stock options frequent meals 
contributions to the republican party in his name and the promise 
of a job on leaving government wilson said less than a month 
after leaving office in early 1986 he went to work for the law 
firm of ehrlich and the younger biaggi 
mariotta embezzled about 1 million and sold wedtech stock worth 
6 million to 8 million wilson said 
ehrlich was mario biaggis partner in the plunder of wedtech 
when he got it he split it charged wilson who said richard 
biaggi became the front man 
wilson said the two mens law firm earned 1 million in 
retainers fees from wedtech 
betso took stock options in his name for his friend neglia 
wilson alleged then lied about it to the department of labor 
wilson promised testimony to back up his claims from wedtech 
accountants supervisors and workers sen alfonse damato rny 
and four former wedtech officials who pleaded guilty to crimes 
involving the company 
defense attorneys begin presenting their arguments monday 
the house ethics committee announced last month it would 
recommend biaggi be expelled following his conviction last year in 
another case on charges he accepted illegal paid vacations from an 
old friend and political ally 
biaggi had asked the committee not to act until his appeal of 
that conviction was settled the panel decided to postpone bringing 
the matter before the full house

a relative of andrei sakharov says he asked lyndon 
larouches help in getting the dissident out of the soviet union 
but denied a claim by larouche attorneys that he was acting at the 
bidding of us intelligence operatives 
we came to him on our own initiative efram yankelovich said 
in a telephone interview friday nobody asked us or directed us 
or suggested it to us 
yankelovich is married to the daughter of yelena bonner 
sakharovs wife 
larouche attorney michael reilly said yankelovich and alexei 
semyonov sakharovs stepson approached a larouche aide in 1984 
and said a third party promised to spirit sakharov and bonner out 
of the soviet union if larouche paid 2 million 
larouche refused to get involved and ended the discussions after 
the sakharov relatives identified the third party as a man the 
larouche organization believed was trying to entrap them reilly 
said 
attorneys for larouche six aides and five organizations on 
trial here on fraud and conspiracy charges were denied access 
friday to classified fbi documents referring to an attempt to get 
sakharov and bonner out of the soviet union 
the defense lawyers earlier this week were given declassified 
excerpts from the material the excerpts say fbi files indicate 
that in 1984 two intelligence operatives approached two sakharov 
relatives and told them they could get sakharov and bonner out of 
the soviet union for 2 million 
the operatives gary howard and ron tucker are quoted in the 
same fbi document as saying they and a third man retired army sgt 
maj fred lewis had been asked by the fbi and the cia to 
infiltrate larouche organizations 
yankelovich said he never heard of tucker or howard 
the larouche lawyers want the entire fbi file to help pursue 
leads they say show numerous attempts by government informants and 
operatives to entrap larouche 
but us district judge robert e keeton said the file was 
properly classified and that the material not already given the 
defense lawyers was irrelevant 
assistant us attorney john markham said the file was created 
in the boston fbi office during an investigation of possible fraud 
against sakharovs relatives and possible violations of the 
neutrality act which prohibits interference in foreign countries 
tucker and howard in a 14 million lawsuit against the 
government describe themselves as longtime operatives involved in 
government sting operations 
in the suit tucker and howard said they gathered evidence 
against an arms merchant planning to sell weapons to iran but that 
the government refused to prosecute the case because it would have 
exposed the irancontra scandal

survivors of a commuter airliner crash that 
claimed nine lives expressed outrage at a government report that 
the pilot had traces of cocaine in his body 
it makes me mad said nancy hill of cortez who suffered a 
broken leg and a dislocated shoulder in the jan 19 continental 
express accident outside durango we should have protection from 
this kind of thing 
both the pilot and copilot died in the crash and investigators 
have not determined which one was flying at the time 
the eight survivors were rescued after one peter schauer 
trudged 1 miles over a snowy mountainside to a house 
our lives will never be the same and when there is this kind 
of problem involved you have to be even more angry schauer said 
friday 
the toxicology report released friday in washington said pilot 
steven s silver had 022 micrograms per milliliter of 
benzoylecgonine the principal metabolite of cocaine in his 
bloodstream 
he also had 18 micrograms per milliliter of metabolized cocaine 
and 022 micrograms of cocaine in his urine according to the 
report by the national transportation safety boards bureau of 
technology 
i would say that is a small amount of cocaine said dr 
merrit m birky an ntsb chemist who had an outside lab analyze the 
samples it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the 
significance of this 
birky said cocaine is quickly converted to benzoylecgonine in 
the bloodstream and has a halflife of seven hours in the body but 
birky said he was unable to say how much cocaine the pilot ingested 
or when he ingested it 
the ntsb did not characterize the finding as a cause of the 
accident or indicate whether the pilot might have been impaired 
silver 36 of denver was an employee of transcolorado airlines 
inc of colorado springs transcolorado leases planes and crews to 
rocky mountain airways a continental airlines subsidiary that 
operates in colorado as continental express 
the swearingen metro iii twinengine turboprop crashed in a

the report said the toxicology report on copilot ralph harvey 
42 of denver will be released later 
bill white a denver attorney acting as transcolorados 
spokesman friday said the company was obviously surprised were 
concerned 
the air line pilots association said it was deeply disturbed 
by the report but said it leaves unanswered more questions than 
it resolves 
george james president of airline economics inc a washington 
consulting firm to the airline industry said he was unaware of any 
other commercial airline accident in which drug use had been 
involved 
the department of transportation on thursday proposed a drug 
testing program for more than a half million airline employees 
in a statement friday transportation secretary james burnley 
called the evidence of drug use by silver a tragic reminder that 
not even commercial aviation is exempt from the drug abuse problem 
which plagues our society

a 5yearold died after his stepfather allegedly 
beat him with a tree limb a belt and his hands because the boy 
couldnt recite the alphabet past g authorities said 
dwayne blocker 24 was being held in the cook county jail today 
on 150000 bond said a jailer who refused to give her name he is 
to be arraigned april 4 
blocker who was indicted on murder charges by a county grand 
jury friday admitted beating stepson charles moss because he could 
only reach g when blocked asked him to say the alphabet said 
police lt james phelan 
the boys mother joyce blocker 21 was sick wednesday and 
blocker picked up charles from preschool phelan said 
after the child could not complete the alphabet blocker 
shouted do it again the lieutenant said 
then he punched him several times hit him with a belt several 
times and then went outside and got a tree branch and struck him 
several more times phelan said 
after the attack the boy ran upstairs to his mothers room 
said david schneidman a spokesman for the state department of 
children and family services 
charles collapsed in the room and the stepfather tried to 
revive him schneidman said 
the youngster who died at st francis cabrini hospital had a 
broken arm bruises on his leg and a solid bruise from the shoulder 
blade to his buttocks schneidman said 
when this guy said he became angry because the boy could not 
get past the letter g that sounds absurd ridiculous he said 
but frankly reasons like that are very common among child 
abusers 
in severe abuse cases there are several things that can 
trigger an incident said schneidman the childs learning 
ability is one of the common reasons others are eating habits and 
toilet training 
another child from the family 1yearold jasmine blocker was 
admitted to the hospital to check for potential abuse schneidman 
said the state has moved to gain temporary custody of her

only a very small number of people carrying 
the aids virus will fail to develop some form of the disease within 
six years scientists predicted today 
a study estimates that at least 75 percent of those with the 
virus will contract aids or aidsrelated complex in that period 
the big question still is will everybody at some point 
progress from the virus to aids or is there a chance that 
some people will be able to ride it out for 15 years said paul 
omalley author of an earlier study on the virus progression 
results of the study were published in todays editions of the 
british medical journal 
the researchers at the university of california san francisco 
and other institutions studied 288 men with the virus for three 
years 
the scientists used five markers in the blood to estimate 
how many would contract aids or arc a milder form of acquired 
immune defiency syndrome which generally develops into active aids 
the markers included measurements of proteins and cells 
twentytwo percent of the participants developed aids during the 
threeyear period and 19 percent progressed to arc tests on 
another 24 percent showed abnormalities which the researchers found 
were highly predictive of aids or arc 
although that adds up to 65 percent the researchers 
extrapolated that at least another 10 percent of people infected 
with hiv or human immunodefiency virus will develop some form of 
the disease for a total of 75 percent 
the scientists called the estimate conservative saying the 
actual rate of progression may be much higher 
even the men who had not developed aids or arc after three years 
showed clear signs of progression toward a worsened condition in 
their blood markers the study found 
hiv infection is much more serious than we thought in the 
early days said andrew moss ucsf associate professor of 
epidemiology and international health at san francisco general 
hospital it may take eight or nine years but eventually the 
infected person will probably get aids 
what we saw was that the number of those showing no effects 
from hiv infection is very small added moss this means that 
if you are infected with the aids virus you will almost certainly 
go on to get aids he said 
omalley the director of the city health departments aids 
research project said the new study apparently provides important 
information for hivpositive people trying to decide whether to 
take immediate risks with antiviral drugs or await advances in 
treatment 
as each year progresses we know more but we still cant fully 
answer it said omalley his study released in february 1987 
determined that the risk of developing aids increases in the second 
five years after infection 
moss and his colleagues in the study are urging the expansion of 
current trials of antiviral drugs on people who are hiv positive 
but do not have symptoms of arc or aids 
we need to speed up the trials of the current drugs and look 
for more treatments as well moss said 
the national centers for disease control reported this week that 
55167 cases of aids have been reported since june 1981 and 30932 
of those people have died

iraq claimed today it raided an iranian 
oil tanker in the persian gulf resuming a campaign to cut tehrans 
economic lifeline after the foes halted 12 days of missile attacks 
on each others cities 
the raid came amid reports from us military sources in 
washington that iran has started building launch pads for silkworm 
antiship missiles on its abu musa island near the strait of 
hormuz the narrow entrance at the gulfs southern end 
the official iraqi news agency quoted a military spokesman as 
saying iraqi warplanes on friday night attacked a very large 
maritime target usually meaning an iranian oil tanker off the 
iranian coast scoring an accurate and effective hit 
the air raid was within the framework of iraqs firm and 
legitimate right in tearing the arteries of oil supplies of the 
iranian regime to deprive it of employing its oil revenues for the 
purposes of aggression said the spokesman who was not 
identified 
the agency monitored in nicosia gave no other details and the 
attack could not be immediately confirmed by independent shipping 
executives in the gulf iran usually does not report attacks on its 
shipping 
the ship raid occurred only hours after a truce went into effect 
to stop the unprecedented longrange missile duel in the war of 
the cities that had begun feb 29 
iraq fired eight rockets at tehran and three at the holy city of 
qom south of tehran friday afternoon just 16 minutes before 
baghdad said it would stop shooting 
more than 400 ships of different nationalities have been damaged 
in the gulf since the iraniraq war broke out in 1980 the tanker 
war began in early 1984 
iraq on friday had claimed another a ship attack but that also 
could not be confirmed 
iraqs last confirmed attack on a ship was on tuesday when 
warplanes blasted a malteseflag tanker shuttling iranian crude 
that attack was preceded by a lull since feb 12 the last time 
iraqi warplanes were confirmed to have hit a ship 
defense officials in washington who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the iranians are building launching pads in abu 
musa they added that us intelligence had not yet detected 
efforts by iran to move any of its chinesebuilt silkworms to the 
island which serves as base for revolutionary guards 
iran has batteries of silkworms which have a range of about 50 
miles on its shore along the strait of hormuz 
it also has fired missiles believed to be silkworms into 
kuwaits main oil port from the faw peninsula which it captured 
from iraq in 1986

albany a town of about 2500 people and the county seat of 
shackelford was under siege friday a change in wind direction 
brought the fire to within 100 yards of the town said lawrence 
winkler a spokesman for the shackelford county emergency division 
but the wind died down 
all four major highways through albany were closed by heavy 
smoke officials said 
smoke and haze also cast a light foglike pall over the 
dallasfort worth area late friday afternoon and some fort worth 
residents said they smelled the smoke 
gov bill clements dispatched 100 national guard soldiers they 
joined west texas fire departments texas forest service 
firefighters state highway department employees units from 
abilenes dyess air force base and the fort worth fire department 
winkler said volunteer oilfield workers also pitched in 
some firefighters suffered minor burns and were temporarily 
overcome by smoke officials said 
at the 88yearold nail ranch an estimated 35000 acres were 
scorched an unknown number of cattle lost and 2025 miles of fence 
destroyed said ronnie nail one of the ranch heirs 
shifting winds made it difficult to determine where the fire 
would spread and in some cases firefighters were nearly surrounded 
by the swiftly moving flames 
one of the fires may have started when someone was burning tires 
near here while two others appeared to have formed along farm road 
604 and may have been caused by passing motorists 
there was speculation that trash fires may have sparked the 
blazes thursday when humidity dipped to 7 percent

protesters gathered outside the office of 
president kurt waldheim today to demand that he resign because of 
his world war ii past as an officer in the german army 
a small group of demonstrators maintained an overnight vigil on 
the square in front of the presidents office and said they will 
remain until late sunday 
the protesters fixed a 10footlong banner to a nearby fence 
that read who will make waldheim resign 
we know that this will not force him to resign said one 
protester who identified herself only as a 23yearold student at 
vienna university 
but hopefully it will help keep attention focused on him and 
remind people what a problem he has become for our country she 
added 
the demonstrators were among 300 people protesting outside the 
imperial hofburg palace on friday the 50th anniversary of 
austrias annexation by nazi germany 
organizers said they expected thousands of people for an 
afternoon protest near the presidents office in the center of the 
capital 
waldheim attended several events marking the annexation but the 
controversy forced him to drop plans to deliver a major address 
austrias president normally is the keynote speaker for such 
events but waldheim was the silent guest at several of the 
ceremonies and did not play a major role 
waldheim concealed his role as a german army lieutenant in the 
balkans until it was disclosed in the media in march 1986 but he 
has said he will not leave office until his term expires in 1992 
last year the us justice department placed the former un 
secretarygeneral on a list of undesirable persons effectively 
barring him from entering the country 
a panel of historians concluded last month that waldheim was in 
close proximity to nazi war crimes including the deportation to 
death camps of jews and the murders of partisans but did nothing 
to prevent them 
the report left open the question of waldheims guilt or 
innocence in atrocities fueling pressure that he resign 
waldheim always has denied any wrongdoing 
ceremonies friday marking anshluss drew few large crowds shops 
schools and businesses remained open and many viennese ignored a 
nationwide moment of silence some public transport stood still and 
the staterun radio fell silent during the observance 
austrias largestcirculation daily the tabloid neue kronen 
zeitung gave the anniversary events scant coverage 
chancellor franz vranitzky told a special cabinet session friday 
that the nazi invasion and annexation or anschluss mattered to 
austrian politics today 
the events of 50 years ago pose relevant fundamental 
questions about the essence of politics vranitzky said if one 
attempts to avoid them they sooner or later return with greater 
emphasis 
vranitzky in a later address to 900 students in viennas 
historic musikverein concert hall urged young austrians not to 
make blanket accusations against an older generation or to 
reproach them for past mistakes 
speaking friday at an evening service in viennas landmark st 
stephens cathedral roman catholic archbishop karl berg of 
salzburg called on austrians to recognize the mistakes of the past 
austrians must recognize guilt feel regret and ask for 
forgiveness berg told the several thousand people gathered in 
the gothic cathedral

an inmate convicted of murdering two police 
officers claims he has satisfied his sentence of 20 years to life 
in prison because he died briefly during openheart surgery 
the heart and respiratory functions of jerry rosenberg an 
inmate at the auburn correctional facility stopped for about 90 
seconds during surgery in syracuses university hospital on dec 5 
1986 said attorney richard baumgarten 
rosenberg a selfstyled jailhouse lawyer was denied parole 
wednesday for the fifth time since he became eligible for it in 
1981 rosenberg claims the parole board has no jurisdiction over 
him because he had died said baumgarten a spokesman for 
rosenberg 
baumgarten said he sent a letter to gov mario m cuomo 
requesting a pardon and if it is denied rosenberg will pursue the 
case in federal court 
he cannot be forced to serve a second life sentence he said 
baumgarten said rosenberg has documentation to support his 
claim but wouldnt say what it is 
dan hurley the syracuse hospitals communications director 
said the state considers a person dead only after he is declared 
brain dead by two physicians one of them a neurosurgeon or a 
neurologist 
although he couldnt reveal rosenbergs files without his 
physicians approval he said rosenbergs case certainly wasnt 
death as we know it 
rosenberg was sentenced to death in february 1963 after he was 
convicted of killing two policemen during a robbery in brooklyn 
the death sentence was reduced in 1965 to 20 years to life 
rosenberg who says he has earned three law degrees through 
correspondence courses said he is not licensed as an attorney but 
is recognized in state and federal courts as a legal representative 
in more than 250 cases he said he has been accepting thousands of 
dollars in legal fees from inmates and others for 15 years 
however state department of correction officials last year 
found him guilty of illegally receiving 8800 in fees from inmates 
and sentenced him to a fouryear term in a special housing unit of 
the prison they said he needed a license to collect fees 
rosenberg may however represent inmates if he asks the 
permission of the prison superintendent and provides his services 
for free according to state prison regulations 
rosenberg could not be reached for comment because he is in 
solitary confinement

a soviet public relations expert studying us 
promotional strategies was left a little confused by american 
commercials 
why is k mart americas favorite store asked valentin v 
kozitzyn here for a soviet cultural exhibit 
and another thing why do americans have to drink different 
kinds of beer at different times of the day he asked 
kozitsyn had seen the commercial asserting the night belongs 
to michelob 
he said the average soviet probably knows more about american 
culture than soviet culture and that part of solving that 
shortcoming lies in modern pr techniques 
there is much we need to teach our own people and much to 
learn about accomplishing that kozitsyn said 
kozitsyn sought answers to his questions on beer k mart and 
other topics from smith kaufman public relations here while

colossus reputed to be the largest 
lowland gorilla in captivity is moving from frosty new hampshire 
to a spacious new home in florida where hell get to enjoy the 
sunshine and perhaps a little romance 
the 600pound gorilla is to fly in a chartered dc3 sunday from 
bensons animal park in hudson nh to nearby pensacola hell 
then be trucked to the zoo about 10 miles east of gulf breeze 
said pat quinn president and director of the park 
colossus was captured as an infant 20 years ago in africa and 
has not seen another gorilla since then but quinn said he hopes to 
introduce him to females of his species and breed him 
we hope to socialize him so he will breed naturally with 
females quinn said 
the socialization process is to start by letting colossus see 
smell and touch a male chimpanzee then he would be introduced to 
another bachelor male gorilla or a infertile female quinn said 
an initial attempt at breeding may be through artificial 
insemination and one potential recipient is koko the signing 
catloving gorilla owned by the gorilla foundation in woodside 
calif 
semen will be obtained from colossus before he is moved and then 
frozen 
we are hoping to obtain some of that for use with koko because 
she is very anxious to become a mother said penny patterson 
director of the gorilla foundation 
ms patterson said 16yearold kokos keepers know she wants to 
have a baby because she has told them so through sign language 
that skill and her doting care of a pet kitten landed koko on the 
cover of national geographic magazine 
all ball so named by koko because it was a tailless manx was 
hit by a truck and killed after the national geographic story but 
koko was given a replacement kitten named smokey now an adult cat 
still living with her 
koko and a male gorilla michael communicate with sign language 
to express their feelings ask for food and certain teachers and 
inquire about other animals 
colossus sperm may be used because captive gorillas sometimes 
develop incest taboos against cage mates so michael would be 
unsuitable ms patterson saidanother advantage is that colossus 
was captured in the wild as an infant and isnt inbred with zoo 
gorillas

the bodies of three ira 
guerrillas killed by british troops in gibraltar will be flown to 
dublin monday on a chartered plane the iras political wing sinn 
fein said today 
police said friday night they will move in to stop any ira 
paramilitary display at the funerals and asked the families for a 
public promise that there would be no such display there was no 
immediate reaction from the families 
last sundays killing of the three unarmed irish republican army 
guerrillas sparked nighttime rioting in belfast much of the week 
authorities have said the guerrillas were plotting a huge car bomb 
explosion in the british colony of gibraltar on spains southern 
tip 
the irish government had complained that there was no attempt to 
arrest the guerrillas before they were shot 
a sinn fein statement said spanish customs had refused to 
accommodate the return of the bodies of mairead farrell 31 
daniel mccann 30 and sean savage 24 on the first available 
scheduled flight to dublin 
as a result it said the bodies will be put aboard a chartered 
plane which will fly directly from gibraltar to dublin from where 
they will be taken to belfast in the british province 
spanish customs spokesman julio verdu in la linea de la 
concepcion which borders gibraltar said today it is absolutely 
false that the spanish government had refused entry into spain of 
the three bodies 
verdu said health ministry officials had stayed on the job 
overtime friday night in case the families decided to transport the 
bodies to malaga 
the bodies have been kept at the gibraltar royal naval hospital 
while attempts have been made to find a way to return them to 
ireland 
the mainly roman catholic ira has been fighting to unite the 
predominantly protestant northern ireland with the overwhelmingly 
catholic irish republic under socialist rule 
no date has been set for the funerals but sinn fein sources in 
belfast have been hinting they may be held next thursday st 
patricks day 
ira funerals in northern ireland have seen repeated violence as 
angry crowds clashed with police trying to stop paramilitary ira 
members from firing over the coffin 
police say the ceremonial gunfire represents an illegal show of 
arms but despite their presence in force paramilitaries shielded 
by crowds of thousands often have managed to fire the traditional 
salute

bill britt the hermit of chestnut hill 
whose refusal to leave his makeshift home in the woods cost him his 
life was remembered at his funeral as a colorful articulate 
free spirit 
fifty relatives and friends packed the funeral home friday to 
pay tribute to the garrulous 52yearold eccentric whose body was 
found monday in his leanto at the chestnut hill cemetery 
authorities said he had frozen to death about two weeks before 
the funeral also attracted the media and the room was lit up 
with television lights a touch which britts son said his father 
would have enjoyed 
my father would have loved this hes got all the cameras 
here britton steven boughner 30 said 
but if his father loved attention he also cherished 
independence said his son he was a free spirit and he taught 
me not to be afraid of anything or any individual 
britts daughter ingrid boughner 28 wept talking about the 
father who was reunited with two of his three children only a year 
ago 
my father never really was a hermit she said he was a 
naturalist he was the most colorful and articulate human 
being 
britts friend of two decades birth control activist bill 
baird recalled britts passion for freedom independence and the 
beauty of the woods 
also at the service were britts mother marion 86 his two 
brothers and close friends like sophie bubbles haggett ms 
haggett spoke to britt daily by telephone from her home in malden 
and would bring him soup and clothing britt died while the 
70yearold woman was laid up in the hospital 
britts body was cremated his ashes were to be scattered today 
in the woods where he had lived 
britt was once an ordinary married man with three children and a 
job in an office all that changed after a painful divorce in 1969 
soon he cast off his threepiece suits and his threepiece name 
britton william boughner he began to retreat to the woods at the 
stateowned chestnut hill reservoir near the affluent suburb of 
the same name where he was born 
but the hermit of chestnut hill was hardly a recluse he was 
shrewd witty and stubborn given freely to tears he would ride 
the trolleys and hunt for pay phones to call reporters clad in 
castoff clothing and dragging an armful of plastic buckets 
bearshaped and nearly toothless britt had blind eyes swollen 
with infection he refused welfare and lived on the nickels he got 
for empty bottles and cans 
two years ago officials began trying to force britt to leave 
the state land 
britt fought back he showed the world a misunderstood hermit 
who wanted only to be left among the trees it landed him on late 
night with david letterman actor mickey rooney suggested a tv 
movie about his life 
a sympathetic judge respected britts wish for a suburban eden 
and ordered the state to find a suitable alternative site 
britt refused them all but last july he was finally ejected 
from state land and moved to the adjacent cemetery

an american farmer who was held prisoner 54 
days in nicaragua has received a polite welcome back in that 
nation but cannot return to his farm in costa rica according to a 
published report 
james denby who was shot down over nicaragua on dec 6 has 
returned to managua to retrieve his damaged private plane and 
review his legal status there the st louis postdispatch reported 
although he was accused of being a spy and cia informant while 
being held by the sandinistas he has become something of a 
celebrity upon his return to managua the newspaper said 
nicaraguan soldiers reportedly have been seen asking for his 
autograph 
i didnt know id done anything to become a public 
personality denby told the newspaper thursday ive been a 
little amazed it seems unusual for a soldier to come up to me and 
ask for an autograph after being in prison for two months 
denby of carlinville ill was freed jan 31 after bill press 
a democrat running for the us senate from california persuaded 
the nicaraguan government to release denby before a congressional 
vote on aid to the contra rebels 
after his release denby delivered a message in washington dc 
against contra aid although the lifelong republican later said he 
had supported the contras while farming in central america 
denby said he returned to managua to get documentation that the 
nicaraguan government no longer has any charges against him and 
expects to receive it 
but he told the newspaper he still has some problems to solve 
including settling a bill for 3000 from the nicaraguan government 
for towing his cessna 172 from the costa rican border where it was 
shot down 
ironically denby was refused entry to costa rica when he tried 
to return to his farm and costa rican officials told him they had 
not been notified of any change in his legal status by nicaragua 
in fact i got deported to panama right when things got bad 
with panamanian military strongman manuel antonio noriega 
denby told the newspaper i didnt think that was the proper 
place to be 
as a result denby is staying on in nicaragua

the national association of evangelicals is 
concerned about the effect of financial and sexual wrongdoings by 
television preachers on young people marriages and moral 
principles 
we express deep disappointment and sorrow over some recent 
highly publicized moral lapses the nae leadership said in a 
statement at its conference this week 
all of those interviewed were quick to agree that the recent 
confession of sexual episodes by jimmy swaggart and the earlier 
allegations of sexual and financial wrongdoing by jim bakker were 
exceptional cases but they worried about the aftereffects 
jeffrey k hadden professor of sociology at the university of 
virginia said the repercussions from the recent scandals that have 
plagued the industry are numerous 
there will be more investigations hadden said there are 
a lot of people around who would like to get these guys its sort 
of open season 
he noted that a house subcommittee was looking into possible 
violations of postal regulations governing directmail 
solicitations and said the internal revenue service and federal 
communications commission would probably uncover other wrongdoings 
there was also concern among members of the national religious 
broadcasters an affiliate of the nae about reports of an increase 
in the number of television stations dropping religious programming 
as a result of the swaggart case 
gerry leonard of orlando central florida coordinator of a 
teaching ministry called evangelism explosion said she gets many 
questions from people concerned about television evangelism 
we dont throw stones or put anybody down because these are 
events caused by individuals not the church she said but i 
tell them to carefully study what the bible teaches not what 
somebody represents it to be 
these tv preachers have to answer for their own sins said 
milton russ who runs an agency that aids churches in their 
fundraising activities we make sure that what were doing is 
right they should too 
he said that those who avidly follow and give their financial 
support to tv ministries have no real strong ties to local 
churches they just do not personally want to get involved 
whenever one of them tv preachers gets in trouble they just 
switch channels and go on to the other guy

republican george bush and democrat michael 
dukakis are bidding to score political knockouts in illinois 
against dogged opponents who refuse to give up their presidential 
campaigns despite long odds 
kansas sen bob dole acknowledging that were hanging by our 
fingernails announced friday he has purchased 30 minutes of 
television time tonight and he challenged bush to join him to 
discuss the issues 
the vice president rejected a oneonone debate with dole 
that ploy has been used before he said during an appearance 
before the illinois farm bureau i may have used it before when 
things werent going too well but debates are cruel and unusual 
punishment weve already had seven of them 
during an appearance at the university of illinois dukakis told 
reporters that if he can beat sen paul simon on the senators home 
ground it would be a turning point in the democratic 
presidential race 
a smiling dukakis and his wife kitty took time out from heavy 
campaigning to feast on flaming saganaki or fried cheese and 
squid at the greek islands restaurant in chicagos greektown 
section the candidate scheduled no speech there but stopped often 
to shake hands with others dining at the restaurant 
dukakis whose parents were natives of greece said he is not 
trying to build an ethnic coalition 
we want to put together a coalition of people all over this 
country whether theyre firstgeneration or secondgeneration 
americans he said 
the chicago suntimes editorial board announced it would endorse 
bush and dukakis in sundays editions the board praised bushs 
variety and texture of public experience and said dukakis is 
his partys strongest contender to regain th white house 
the rival chicago tribune on friday endorsed dole saying he has 
often been the lone republican voice of reason and good sense on 
matters of budget and foreign affairs the tribune had made no 
endorsement in the democratic race 
as expected gary hart announced his departure from the 
democratic race on friday i got a fair hearing and the people 
decided said the former colorado senator 
jesse jackson was the winner of a nonbinding straw vote taken 
thursday night during alaskas democratic caucuses jackson 
received 35 percent of the vote to 30 percent for dukakis the 
state party announced friday 
jackson campaigned friday in south carolina which holds 
democratic caucuses today and he was given a strong chance of 
winning a majority of the delegates in his native state his 
principal competition in the state came from sen albert gore jr 
of tennessee and rep richard gephardt of missouri 
simon insisted he would carry illinois in tuesdays presidential 
primary and that no candidate would have a firstballot nomination 
at the democratic national convention next july 
i think i have as good a chance as anyone said simon as he 
campaigned in the chicago area 
simon said he believed that new york gov mario cuomos 
statement that he would endorse a democratic presidential candidate 
before his states presidential primary on april 19 meant that 
cuomo is waiting for the results of the illinois primary 
however simon could take less encouragement from a cuomo 
statement on friday when the governor said he thought the democrats 
ought to unite behind whichever candidate has the most delegates at 
the end of the primary season 
if mike dukakis has 41 percent get everybody together in a 
room and say jesse gore gephardt you came close but mikes 
the candidate said cuomo lets pick the guy whos ahead 
after california 
campaigning around the state dole conceded that were hanging 
by our fingernails we shouldnt be but we are we need to somehow 
capture the attention of the illinois voters 
in an effort to accomplish that the dole campaign has spent 
100000 to buy 30 minutes on chicago television station wgn for a 
live broadcast from knox college in galesburg which was the site of 
one of the debates between abraham lincoln and stephen douglas 
dole refused to discuss the format for the broadcast except to 
say ill be there 
i know hes ahead dole said of bush he knows hes 
ahead 
he said the voters of illinois can make history tuesday be 
demanding that we discuss the issues 
bush also will be in galesburg and dole was asked if he might 
personally confront the vice president in an effort to engage him 
in debate 
i doubt it he said no gimmicks no games

the administration has reluctantly ordered the 
closing of the plo observer mission at the united nations because 
of a law secretary of state george p shultz called one of the 
dumber things that congress has done lately 
attorney general edwin meese iii gave the palestine liberation 
organization mission in new york until march 21 to close saying 
the department would then go to federal court to enforce the 
antiterrorism act of 1987 
the 1947 treaty under which new york became un headquarters 
obliges the united states to let all accredited missions operate 
un officials and the state department have said 
despite the headquarters treaty congress passed the law 
ordering the mission closed and president reagan signed it into law 
last dec 22 as part of a state department spending bill rep jack 
kemp rny who played a leading role in the congressional 
debate called the plo the worlds most vicious terrorist 
organization 
the state department earlier had closed the plos information 
office in washington but opposed the law that would close its un 
office 
for more than a century the supreme court has held that 
congress has the authority to abrogate treaties and international 
law for the purpose of domestic law assistant attorney general 
charles cooper head of the justice departments office of legal 
counsel said friday at a news conference he said the justice 
department is obliged to follow the congressional decision 
calling the law one of the dumber things that the congress has 
done lately shultz added 
the administration opposed that law and my opinion remains 
that it is a very bad piece of legislation and the net result 
of it is from the standpoint of those who dont like the plo and 
i dont like the plo but from the standpoint of those dont like 
the plo what have they done 
theyve glorified the plo and theyve given legitimacy to the 
plo 
united nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
strongly protested this violation of the headquarters agreement 
during a friday morning meeting he had with herbert okun deputy 
us ambassador to the united nations said un spokesman francois 
giuliani 
the secretarygenerals legal staff is studying options but 
giuliani refused to describe them or say if the united nations 
would join litigation on behalf of the plo 
okun in a letter to perez de cuellar said the united states 
refuses binding arbitration of the dispute over the mission in the 
worst confrontation ever between the united nations and its host 
country 
cooper said the statute has superseded the requirements of the 
un headquarters agreement and that participation in an 
international tribunal would be to no useful end 
the 159nation general assembly in a special meeting last 
month asked the world court in the hague to rule on whether the 
united states must agree to arbitration oral arguments are 
scheduled for april 11 
the arab leagues permanent observer at the united nations 
clovis maksoud said that if the united states presses to close the 
mission naturally one of the options would be that the 43rd 
session of the un general assembly would have to meet 
elsewhere 
several arab diplomats have suggested that the general assembly 
move to geneva if the mission in new york is closed 
the call by all members of the un israel being the only 
obvious exception for the us to abide by its treaty obligations 
was not heeded and with the attorney generals decision the 
international consensus was brushed aside maksoud said 
the united states and israel consider the plo a terrorist 
organization but the united nations recognizes it as the only 
legitimate spokesman for palestinians

the european space agency fired its 
first ariane 3 rocket into space this year in a flawless launch 
that carried two telecommunications satellites one american and 
one french into orbit 
officials called the launch friday night of the wests only 
active commercial satellite launcher a complete success with 
all operations perfect it was arianes 21st launching and the 
first of eight planned for this year 
the ariane 3 placed into orbit frances telecom 1c and the 
american spacenet iiirgeostar which includes facilities for the 
associated press 
technicians said the two satellites placed into orbit by ariane 
above the equator obtained an altitude of 22554 miles 
the critical day for the spacenet satellite is wednesday when 
its own motor ignites to place it into its definitive orbit 87 
degrees west above the equator 
liftoff from the space agencys jungle base on the northern 
coast of south america came at 828 pm local time 628 pm est 
the thirdstage engine at fault in three of arianes four 
failed launchings ignited normally four minutes after blastoff 
officials said twenty minutes after blastoff the rocket separated 
from its payload thrusting the two satellites into geostationary 
transfer orbits 
frederic dallest president of arianespace the european space 
agencys commercial arm immediately announced plans for launches 
on may 11 and at the end of may one would be a demonstration of 
the more powerful ariane 4 rocket described by esa as the new 
generation of the european launcher 
this success enables us to envision the ambitious program of 
eight launches a year dallest said after the launch for 
that vigilance and rigorousness are needed 
some experts estimate the commercial space market will be worth 
more than 1 billion per year after 1991 
including fridays payload arianespace has 43 satellites on its 
order books worth 236 billion according to the company 
to keep up with the orders the kourou space center has made two 
launch pads available 
the launch friday was first scheduled for december but was 
delayed for extra tests after abnormalities were detected in the 
oxygen and liquid hydrogen thirdstage engine 
we preferred to take the time to understand the problem 
said dallest 
thirdstage engine failure was the cause of failed ariane 
launches in september 1982 september 1985 and may 1986 the last 
failure the 18th launch left the rocket grounded for more than a 
year 
another failed launch occurred in may 1980 because of a problem 
with the firststage engine 
the 21st launch thrust into orbit the american gte spacenet 
corps fifth satellite spacenet iii rgeostar r01 the satellite 
is aimed at increasing the companys telecommunications services in 
the united states and helping set up a system of satellite 
communication with mobile units such as trucks cars and trains 
the satellite with an expected lifetime of 10 years weighed 
2674 pounds before liftoff and 1562 pounds in orbit 
gte spacenet lost a satellite in the 1985 failed launch 
two transponders on spacenet iii purchased by the ap are to 
provide the new yorkbased news cooperative with domestic satellite 
delivery services over the next 10 years a satellite being used is 
nearing the end of its operational service 
the french telecom ic the third in a series of satellites owned 
by france telecom the stateowned telecommunications system it is 
to replace telecom 1b which broke down jan 15 
with the us space shuttle grounded and americas titan 4 and 
delta rockets not yet competitive ariane remains the only active 
launcher for commercial satellites in the west

their mothers were ill and offered to take them home the 
governmentowned dainik bangla and other newspapers reported 
a senior police official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said hundreds of women had been smuggled across the border in 
recent years 
most of these women land up in brothels either in india or in 
pakistan he said 
in some cases people have paid smugglers who promised them an 
escape from bangladeshs grinding poverty according to newspapers 
the smugglers known as manpower agents promise jobs as 
servants and manual laborers in prosperous middle eastern nations 
often the victims end up as nothing more than slaves in 
households or on farms 
maj noor a battalion commander of the bangladesh rifles border 
guards said a new alert was declared monday at the border between 
bangladesh and the indian state of west bengal in an effort to stop 
the smuggling 
we have recovered at least 80 women and children and some 
accompanying men since the latest crackdown started on march 7 
noor said when contacted by telephone at border town of rajshahi 
he said the group included 28 women 31 children and 29 men 
dhaka newspapers said 200 women and children had been rescued 
from the smugglers and 15 men had been charged with human 
trafficking since jan 1 
the latest reported interception occurred friday when six women 
16 men and one child were caught in the border towns of sahebnagar 
and bidirpur the dainik bangla and daily itefaq newspapers said 
two of the men were arrested on charges of trafficking in human 
lives 
by piecing together sketchy reports in dhaka newspapers the past 
three days a picture emerges of how the traffickers operate 
elevenyearold najma akthar was playing with friends at their 
schoolyard last week in munshiganj just outside dhaka when a 
middleaged woman approached her 
the woman said najmas mother was seriously ill puzzled and 
worried the sixthgrader left the playground with the woman in a 
rickshaw 
three days later she and eight women who also had been lured 
away on false pretenses were in bidirpur 90 miles northwest of 
dhaka border police rescued them before they could be taken across 
the frontier 
others paid for what they thought would be passports to better 
lives 
bangladesh with 105 million people is one of the worlds most 
densely populated nations the per capital annual income is about 
150 
i sold my jewelry to pay the man who promised me a job in 
pakistan dainik bangla quoted josna rani sarkar as saying 
the 25yearold woman whose husband had deserted her was one 
of those found by border guards this week 
mrs sarkar and other women were quoted as saying they paid 
between 100 and 200 for the journey 
a foreign ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the government was investigating local press reports that at 
least 10000 bangladeshis had been jailed abroad for using false 
passports and other papers 
the dainik bangla a bengalilanguage newspaper said last 
october that police suspect some children have been smuggled out of 
bangladesh for more macabre purposes 
the newspaper said there were unconfirmed reports that children 
had been taken across the indian border to west bengal and killed 
so their skeletons could be sold for medical studies 
bangladeshi officials have declined to comment on this report 
similar reports of indian children being killed in 1984 surfaced 
in the indian state of bihar headless bodies were found in a 
river and a box of childrens skulls was later discovered at a 
railway station in patna bihars capital

falling off horses plummeting oceanward in a 
tangled parachute or fleeing an avalanche on a ski slope prince 
charles maintains an old royal tradition of thrills and spills 
the royal pratfall had become enshrined as a national joke until 
thursday when charles narrowly escaped an avalanche that killed 
his close friend maj hugh lindsay on a swiss ski slope 
british hearts missed a beat realizing how close the avalanche 
had come to claiming the 39yearold heir to the throne it is 
only when you nearly lose someone that you become fully conscious 
of how much you value them commented novelist an wilson in the 
daily mail 
inevitably a cry went up for the royals to stop playing 
daredevil but at the same time britons have come to expect it of 
them judging by the derision charless youngest brother edward has 
suffered in some quarters for shunning rugby and quitting the royal 
marines prematurely 
zooming down the slopes with charles at the swiss resort of 
klosters were his wife princess diana and sisterinlaw sarah 
the duchess of york 
on the morning of the avalanche sarah 28 and four months 
pregnant tumbled into a river while skiing that probably was the 
only reason she and diana stayed in their chalet and were not on 
the slopes when the avalanche broke loose 
sarahs husband prince andrew charless other brother was off 
the portuguese coast aboard the navy ship on which he serves as a 
helicopter warfare instructor a few hours after the avalanche the 
vessel lost a helicopter and two crewmen at sea 
andrew flew combat missions in the 1982 falkland islands war 
and few suggested he shouldnt risking ones life for the public 
good is a tradition set in stone by king george vi when he refused 
to flee london during hitlers blitz 
charless sister anne races horses and sometimes falls off 
them his father prince philip was a polo player and took a 
wellphotographed spill in a carriagedriving race his mother 
queen elizabeth ii also is an accomplished though more sedate 
equestrian 
annes husband capt mark phillips has suffered a few riding 
spills he is also a repeat offender at the wheel and recently was 
fined for clocking more than 100 mph on a 70mph highway 
on the outer fringes of royalty risky sports and highspeed 
driving are routine in 1972 prince william of gloucester a 
cousin of the queen was killed flying in an air race 
charles has taken innumerable knocks on the sportsfields he has 
a small facial scar from a fall playing polo and in florida he 
collapsed dehydrated during a match 
on his first ski run he pitched headfirst into snow flying a 
light plane he came within seconds of a midair collision 
his first parachute jump in 1971 came equally close to disaster 
his foot snarled in the cords and he plunged thousands of feet 
upside down before righting himself and ending up in the ocean 
charless biographer anthony holden notes that the princes 
granduncle edward viii was forced by his father to give up 
steeplechasing in the 1930s but says its unlikely the same will 
happen to charles 
we cannot legislate about whether the prince of wales goes 
skiing or not he told a bbc interviewer 
its in his character he feels a need to prove himself 
physically 
in charles royaltywatchers see the dilemma of a vigorous man 
in the prime of life wellaware of his privileged status and 
feeling forever compelled to justify it 
forced to stay out of politics the endearingly jugeared prince 
is limited to speaking out on issues like modern architecture and 
the plight of britains inner cities 
he can only hint at his state of mind through remarks to friends 
that reach the media secondhand the picture that emerges is of a 
man searching for a role fearful of becoming a museum piece 
his mother at 61 shows no sign of giving up the throne and 
chances are he wont be king before he is in his fifties 
he is exasperated at being labeled an eccentric because he is 
interested in alternative medicine communes in solitude with 
nature and once let on that he talks to his plants 
his reverence for nature permeated the elegant passionate 
statement he issued after the avalanche 
he spoke of mountains needing to be treated with the greatest 
respect and of the avalanche as a whirling maelstrom as the 
whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past us into the valley below 
the times of london weighing the calls for the prince to stop 
taking risks concluded saturday that he should carry on regardless 
should we become a nation whose competitive sporting instincts 
were restricted to the chess board or the pingpong table we would 
flourish neither in peace nor war it said and a great many 
brave spirits would be stifled

the death of vietnamese premier pham 
hung has given a natural prod to recent leadership changes that 
have brought westernstyle economic reforms to vietnam 
hung 75 and the no 2 man in the communist party hierarchy 
died of a heart attack in southern vietnam on thursday 
hung was among the last of the old guard a group that 
joined the revolution at its start but which saw its influence 
dwindle as the party left the battlefields to confront the 
challenge of economic development 
over six decades he played key roles in ousting the french 
japanese and americans from vietnam but he also helped forge the 
orthodox postwar policies the party now blames for vietnams 
economic and social ruin 
when hung became premier in june 1987 western diplomats saw him 
as a transitional figure selected to ease the break with the 
past and usher the way for technocrats more clearly identified with 
reforms 
the choice of vo van kiet a vice premier and chairman of the 
state planning commission as acting premier should give impetus to 
the reform program 
western analysts regard kiet and party general secretary nguyen 
van linh as the countrys leading proponents of reforms based on 
material incentives decentralized decisionmaking and limited free 
enterprise 
the two championed such reforms years before they were declared 
the no 1 priority at the sixth national party congress in december 
1986 
related reforms have included an easing of restrictions on the 
media attempts to open vietnam to the west and reconciliation with 
former south vietnamese officials and other groups once considered 
enemies of the regime 
other deaths have accelerated vietnams recent changes 
in july 1986 party leader le duan a hardliner passed away 
several months later at the december congress the new party 
chief truong chinh relinquished his party post along with two 
other party cofounders pham van dong and le duc tho 
linh was chosen party general secretary and other pragmatists 
including kiet moved up the ranks of the politburo the most 
powerful party group in all six of 13 politburo members were 
dropped at the congress 
in june 1987 dong resigned the premiership he had held since 
1955 and chinh resigned as vietnams president that removed from 
the top ranks the last of the party cofounders an enduring clique 
comparable to russias bolshevik or chinas long march 
generations 
in addition a total of 17 ministers were sacked in major 
government reshuffles in june 1986 and february 1987 and the 
politburo has ordered a purge of corrupt and inefficient 
lowerlevel party and government officials to last until the end of 
this year 
among western diplomats hung had a reputation as a conservative 
hardliner largely because from 1980 to february 1987 he held the 
powerful post of interior minister which deals with internal 
security 
he shared many common experiences with other top officials who 
emerged from the april 1975 communist victory bitter and defiant 
hung joined the revolution at the age of 16 the french arrested 
him in 1931 and banished him to a decade and a half of hard labor 
at the notorious prison island of poulo condore from 1945 until 
the french defeat at dien bien phu in 1954 hung held key party 
posts in southern vietnam 
he assumed a high profile in defeating the south vietnam 
government and its american allies who had replaced the french 
hung was secretary of the south vietnam commission of the partys 
central committee and political commissar of the south vietnam 
liberation armed forces or the viet cong 
in 1975 he served as political commissar of the ho chi minh 
campaign the final north vietnamese offensive which climaxed with 
the capture of saigon on april 30

a tatar leader scoffed saturday at a government 
overture to members of the disgruntled ethnic group and called a 
plan to allow some tatars to return to their crimean homeland a 
campaign to deceive the public 
reshat dzhemilev who was jailed for three years because he once 
asked saudi arabia to aid the cause of his people said moscows 
move would affect only a small number of his people and only 
those who toe the communist party line 
its a campaign to deceive the public to create the 
appearance of action dzhemilev said in a telephone interview 
the tatars were deported in 1944 from crimea a peninsula in the 
ukrainian republic that extends into the black sea 
a government official told a commission in the central asian 
republic of uzbekistan on march 5 that crimean tatars who are the 
most virtuous and wellproven in work and social life would be 
allowed to return to crimea the newspaper pravda vostoka reported 
the newspaper in its march 6 edition said the state labor 
committee would decide which crimean tatars are eligible for 
resettlement on the basis of recommendations from labor 
collectives and commissions of crimean tatars 
dzhemilev said he did not believe the crimean tatars who 
attended the commission meeting in the uzbek capital of tashkent 
faithfully expressed the wishes of most of his people 
pravda vostok said the commission was made up of republiclevel 
representatives of crimean tatars and that the meeting also was 
attended by officials of regional commissions 
two hundred families maybe will be allowed to move there but 
that will not solve the problem said dzhemilev a leader in the 
crimean tatar effort who lives in tashkent but spoke during a visit 
to moscow its just supposed to distract attention 
the newspaper indicated that the crimean tatars would be allowed 
to resettle as conditions are created primarily in steppe 
regions of the crimea it hinted that resettlement will be limited 
in the areas on the black sea that have become popular resorts 
the crimean tatars who number from 250000 to 350000 are 
among the more than 100 national groups in the soviet union soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev has said that ensuring national unity 
while granting ethnic groups cultural and linguistic rights is 
the most vital fundamental issue of our society 
the crimean tatars have been fighting for the right to return to 
their ancestral homeland ever since they were driven away in may 
1944 soon after soviet troops liberated the crimea from nazi 
germany all the crimean tatars were charged with betraying their 
country and forcibly deported 
they were shipped in sealed freight cars to the eastern regions 
of the soviet union with most winding up in reservations in 
uzbekistan kazakhstan turkmenia and kirgizia thousands died 
during deportation 
the war crimes charges leveled against them were dropped in 1967 
but the tatars were not allowed to return permanently to the crimea 
the crimean tatars stage demonstrations regularly to press their 
cause the most recent being a rally march 5 outside a moscow 
hotel police broke up the protest and detained 15 of the 20 
demonstrators dissidents reported 
the government set up a national commission headed by president 
andrei a gromyko to consider the crimean tatars demands and on 
feb 3 it endorsed steps to promote the groups culture it also 
said new procedures had been adopted on resettlement but did not 
release details

finding out what is happening in tibet has 
become almost as difficult in this age of hightech 
telecommunications as it was for 19thcentury adventurers who had 
to scale snowswept mountains to reach the fabled land 
chinese authorities hypersensitive to criticism of their 
tibetan policies have shut out all foreign reporters since 
proindependence tibetans on march 5 staged their fourth protest in 
five months 
they also have halted plane ticket sales to foreigners in 
chengdu the main gateway to tibet 
in the 19th century westerners faced possible death from frigid 
temperatures and bandits when they set out to discover the 
mysteries of tibetan buddhist worship and the location of their 
gold and silver fields 
foreign reporters in 1988 have no clear picture of what would 
happen if they somehow managed to evade the barriers and enter 
lhasa expulsion from china is one possibility no news agency has 
attempted it 
concern remains high that authorities are using lhasas 
isolation to crack down heavily on youthful militants among the 
citys fewer than 1400 tibetan buddhist monks 
one of the few official reports on the march 5 protest concluded 
ominously local religious leaders demand justice against the 
rioters and are of the opinion that the peoples government has 
exercised too much restraint and shown enough tolerance and 
patience towards these people 
closing off lhasa was easy this time because most travel there 
already had been halted following three independence protests in 
september and october in which at least 14 people were killed and 
dozens others arrested 
fourteen foreign journalists who went to lhasa to cover those 
protests were given 48 hours to leave tibet 
an official report said one policeman was killed in daylong 
clashes march 5 between police and protesters but unconfirmed 
reports put casualties at 21 tibetans and three police killed 
a us state department official told the associated press that 
at least 6000 people took part in the riots and proindependence 
rallies 
only one reporter from agencefrance presse was in lhasa on 
march 5 and he was ordered to leave the next day 
the fewer than one dozen foreign travelers left in tibets 
milehigh capital of lhasa have become the only link albeit a weak 
one to the outside world 
backpackers staying in lhasas grubby coldwater guesthouses 
have been interviewed several times each day by reporters 
telephoning from chengdu and beijing 
most have acknowledged the limits of their information some 
dont speak tibetan or chinese and those who do fear bringing 
police attention to their tibetan friends and so stay away from the 
protests 
many sympathize with the tibetan cause and all are anxious to 
keep a low profile aware that chinese authorities have blamed 
foreigners for past protests 
chengdu a city of 26 million people in western chinas lush 
sichuan province about 760 miles east of lhasa became a listening 
post last week for several western reporters 
they met lhasas only outgoing flight each morning and 
intercepted the few dozen passengers in hopes of obtaining updates 
on conditions in the city 
the interviews produced unconfirmed reports of hundreds perhaps 
as many as 1000 arrests since march 5 several beating deaths of 
arrested protesters and shows of force by convoys of more than 100 
trucks filled with armed police 
authorities have refused to comment on the reports officials in 
the tibetan autonomous regions foreign affairs office brusquely 
told reporters who telephoned to put their questions in writing 
the result is that reporters are hard put to screen fact from 
fiction 
most foreigners in lhasa or arriving in chengdu from tibet were 
amazingly patient in answering reporters questions 
a japanese traveler who spoke barely any english nonetheless 
spent an hour trying to convey what he saw to nonjapanesespeaking 
reporters by using gestures and imitating the sound of automatic 
rifle fire 
reporters wondered whether their calls to lhasa might get the 
recipients in trouble one tibetan woman who answered the telephone 
at a hotel willingly answered a few questions and then asserted 
im not afraid because when the line suddenly went dead

president corazon aquino told 
military cadets saturday to leave policymaking to civilians and 
concentrate on defeating communist rebels on the battlefield 
meanwhile a classified military intelligence report said the 
rebels were losing support among the filipino people and predicted 
that the new peoples army would lose about half its fighters by 
the end of mrs aquinos term in 1992 
the report appeared to contradict public statements by the armed 
forces leadership that the rebellion is growing and poses a major 
threat to philippine democracy 
mrs aquino made her remarks during graduation exercises at the 
philippine military academy on a mountaintop 130 miles north of 
the capital of manila 
the insurgency war cannot be won by programs and speeches nor 
by commissions and committees mrs aquino told the crowd of 
3000 it will be fought and it will be won only by you and the 
men you lead 
mrs aquino reminded the 135 graduating cadets that policy is 
the business of the civilian authorities 
she urged the graduates to place allegiance to the constitution 
above your deference to superiors or friendship for your peers 
last year cadets staged a brief sitdown strike in sympathy 
with leaders of the august coup attempt in which at least 53 people 
were killed and hundreds wounded including mrs aquinos only son 
benigno aquino iii 
former col gregorio gringo honasan leader of the august 
coup attempt and a graduate of the academy was arrested last 
december in manila 
mrs aquino said the academy curriculum would be revised to 
emphasize small unit leadership and combat skills she also 
promised that officers who display skill in combat will be favored 
for promotion 
honasan complained that corruption and favoritism had sapped the 
fighting spirit of the 160000member armed forces of the 
philippines 
about 2000 troops stood guard during the commencement ceremony 
soldiers armed with m16 rifles and grenade launchers searched 
vehicles entering the grounds and helicopter gunships hovered 
overhead during mrs aquinos speech 
on march 18 1987 four people were killed when a bomb exploded 
during rehearsals for the annual graduation exercise officials 
blamed rightwing extremists but no one was ever charged in the 
blast 
the academy modeled after the us military academy at west 
point was established in 1904 to train officers for the philippine 
constabulary while the country was an american colony it now 
trains all branches of the military 
a classified military intelligence report on the communist 
insurgency made in a national intelligence estimate at the end of 
1987 predicted the communist party will suffer increasing 
political isolation by 1992 
the report distributed to defense secretary fidel ramos in 
january says the party will have to step up military operations to 
recover political support 
the report predicted the rebels would escalate their campaign of 
assassinations of police and soldiers to continuously project a 
position of strength the rebels claimed responsibility for 
killing scores of police soldiers and officials in manila last 
year 
but the report estimated that the new peoples army the partys 
armed wing had already decreased from 24430 fighters in 1986 to 
21520 by the end of last year it predicted the rebel army would 
decline in strength to 12170 by 1992 when mrs aquinos term ends 
rebel supporters or mass base had declined from 36 
million people to 31 million people since mrs aquino took office 
and was expected to decline to about 1 million by 1992 the report 
added 
the associated press obtained excerpts of the report from 
sources who insisted on anonymity 
the report attributed the decline in rebel strength to 
improvements in the combat capability of the armed forces and mrs 
aquinos economic and political reforms 
the forecast contradicts the militarys public assessment of the 
rebel threat last week the army said the new peoples army 
numbered 25000 fighters and that the guerrillas had drawn up plans 
to take power by 1992

when a major international trade fair 
opened here last week the welcoming speech to hundreds of foreign 
buyers and sellers came from a man the government considers a 
traitor 
aurelio barria the young energetic owner of an importexport 
business took time off from trying to overthrow his countrys 
military regime to tell the exposition delegates of panamas 
advantages as a marketplace 
if that had a certain strangeness to it it only served to 
underscore the complexity of the crisis in panama where politics 
power and money are almost inseparable 
panama is undergoing what you might call a neutron bomb 
revolution said one western diplomat the governments 
opponents are trying to destroy it without destroying the country 
and its a tricky task 
the diplomat was referring not only to the internal opposition 
but to the united states where the reagan administration has been 
reluctant to impose tougher economic sanctions against panama 
despite strong public support for such action 
with only two opposing votes the us house on thursday called 
for a prompt gettough policy to rid panama of its military 
strongman gen manuel antonio noriega in floor debate he was 
described by one representative after another as a thug a thief a 
tyrant and a drug trafficker 
but in announcing new sanctions on friday president reagan 
heeded the advice of his chief of staff howard baker and his 
national security adviser colin l powell who had been urging a 
more moderate course 
the president ordered the withholding of panama canal fees due 
the country that amount to about 65 million a month eliminated 
preferential tariffs on its exports and told customs officials to 
keep a closer eye out for drug smugglers and money launderers 
from panama 
but reagan stopped short of a total trade embargo which many in 
congress had urged and didnt exercise other punitive economic 
measures at his disposal he did say he was prepared to take 
further steps if noriega doesnt resign 
barria and other antinoreiga panamanians are concerned that any 
drastic measures designed to remove him could wreak havoc on the 
country like a harsh chemotherapy treatment that debilitates the 
patient while attacking his cancer 
what we want is not to destroy the country and not even just 
to get rid of general noriega but to end military domination of 
the civilian government barria said recently 
barria is the president of panamas chamber of commerce 
industry and agriculture he was reelected to a second term late 
last year while in exile having fled the country after being 
charged by the government with sedition 
the treason charge came as a result of his principal occupation 
since last june that of a leader of an antinoriega coalition of 
business professional labor and political groups known as the 
national civic crusade 
i havent really attended to my business in months said 
barria who returned to panama in january after being freed on 
bail then he added with a laugh hell i dont even know if i 
have one left 
whatever the status of barrias business one of the major props 
of panamas economy appears to have suffered irreparable losses in 
the past nine months of civil turmoil 
the banking system as it existed is destroyed said a 
source close to panamas financial community he like the 
diplomat spoke only on condition of anonymity 
the source said as much as 12 billion has been transferred out 
of panama by wary depositors since the civic crusade began its 
effort to oust noriega last summer with a series of demonstrations 
the 118 banks that make this country one of the worlds largest 
offshore banking centers began 1987 with more than 40 billion in 
deposits 
the amount of money that has fled panamas banking center cannot 
be confirmed the government only will admit a crisis exists one 
it blames largely on the united states 
most of the money deposited in offshore banks in panama never 
contributed directly to the nations economy it neither was taxed 
nor used to finance home mortgages car loans new businesses or 
industry or capital improvements 
it was just there on paper said the banking industry 
source but shuffling that paper did provide employment for about 
9000 people and led to a building boom in that way the banking 
industry contributed along with real estate 145 percent of the 
nations gross national income 
the offshore institutions are branches of major banks from more 
than 30 countries engaged primarily in the sheltering of funds from 
latin american depositors who are weary of political instability in 
their own countries 
among the hardest hit banks when the money began fleeing the 
country last year were the 12 institutions owned by panamanians 
much of the money on deposit in them was transferred either to 
panamas international banks or to other countries 
then on feb 25 the countrys civilian figurehead president 
eric arturo delvalle called for the dismissal of noriega who had 
been indicted by two federal grand juries in florida almost three 
weeks earlier on drug trafficking and money laundering charges 
within hours noriega proved who the real boss of panama is by 
engineering delvalles ouster 
that triggered a new greater run on the panamanian banks and 
they closed four days later on march 1 two days after that the 
government ordered them to remain closed admitting that it could 
not provide enough money to cover anticipated withdrawals it also 
closed temporarily the 106 foreign banks 
the banks remain closed with no sign they will reopen this 
week the situation has created chaos for individuals and 
businesses as well all are strapped for cash 
the noriega government says it is a victim of economic 
aggression by the united states where federal courts have tied 
up some 50 million in official panamanian funds on deposit in us 
banks at question is whether the money rightfully should be 
controlled by noriega or delvalle 
delvalle has been in hiding for two weeks but the united states 
still considers him the legitimate president the civic crusade 
leaders who used to refer to delvalle as a puppet also have 
reluctantly endorsed him as the true constitutional authority 
some opposition leaders complained privately that state 
department officials forced them to support delvalle and join him 
in a call last week for a new transitional government pending 
elections scheduled for next year 
said a diplomatic source its important at this point that

a prosecutor charged saturday that anwar 
sadats brother and other relatives used the slain presidents name 
to ruin the country and should lose 82 million in property as 
punishment 
esmat sadat already convicted of using his brothers position 
to enrich himself during anwar sadats 11 years in office 
responded that the prosecution was sullying the late presidents 
name by making the accusations 
the exchange came during a hearing of the ethics court to decide 
whether the assets of esmat sadat three sons and seven other 
family members should be confiscated 
the property estimated at 82 million was sequestered in 1983 
after the defendants convictions on influence peddling black 
marketeering bribery and other charges esmat sadat and three sons 
were sentenced to oneyear prison terms 
the court adjourned saturday after both sides presented their 
arguments a decision is expected on april 9 
as the prosecution presented its case saturday blaming sadats 
relatives for using the late leaders name to ruin the country 
esmat stood and objected vigorously 
the prosecution insists on using the name of the late 
leader esmat said loudly from the third row of benches 
his name should not be used as a prosecution tool he 
said looking shaken 
sayed abdelbaky president of the sevenman tribunal hearing 
the case admonished esmat not to interrupt the proceedings and 
said such comments would be heard at the end of the hearing 
we are only glorifying the name of the late president said 
assistant prosecutor mohsen mahmoud at the center of this case 
is the exploitation of the late presidents name 
he cited examples of the defendants use of the family name to 
win government contracts outside bureaucratic channels required of 
most private citizens 
the late president killed by moslem extremists on oct 6 1981 
was absolved of any wrongdoing in esmats earlier trial 
the ethics court is empowered to sequester property and order 
defendants detained for up to five years after that the 
prosecutor may ask the court to confiscate a defendants property 
in the name of the state 
the court can decide whether to permanently seize the property 
keep it sequestered and allow the prosecutors office to control 
the assets or return the property to the defendants

president reagans decision to withhold a 65 
million payment owed to panama next tuesday was aimed at impairing 
military strongman manuel noriegas ability to pay government 
workers this coming week according to us officials 
the timing was no coincidence one official said expressing 
hope that the departure of noriega could be hastened if government 
workers faced with economic hardship join the ranks of the 
opposition 
the remaining sanctions reagan imposed on friday will not have 
an immediate consequence and the officials believe noriega could 
be out of office by the time they have an impact 
the sanctions were the latest in a series of steps the united 
states has taken over the past eight months to undercut noriega 
who is under us indictment on drug smuggling charges 
according to reports from panama the government is so strapped 
for cash that it has been considering several austerity measures to 
deal with payroll budget shortfalls 
they included delaying paychecks to the nations 150000 
government workers reducing their pay temporarily or giving them 
partial payment in food instead of cash the reports said 
outside the 15000member defense force the regimes main 
source of support has been government workers if civil servants 
begin turning against noriega that would narrow his already small 
base of support even further said the us officials insisting on 
anonymity 
the soldiers were paid last thursday but monday is payday for 
the nations 20000 school teachers and thousands of other 
government workers are due their paychecks on tuesday 
ambassador juan b sosa who opposes noriega said the cash 
shortage forced panama to default on a 39 million loan repayment 
due last week to the government of japan 
sosa has remained loyal to ousted president eric arturo delvalle 
and has refused to relinquish his post to a successor named by 
noriega sosa shares the reagan administration view that delvalles 
ouster by noriega two weeks ago was unconstitutional 
before last friday the administration had suspended all 
economic and military aid to panama and ordered us 
representatives in international lending institutions to oppose 
loan requests from panama 
beyond that it has lent its support to legal efforts by 
delvalles representatives here to freeze panamanian assets in the 
united states 
as a result panama does not have access to the revenues it 
normally receives from american use of a transisthmian pipeline 
that sends alaskan oil on its way to east coast us ports those 
revenues have been variously estimated at between 80 and 120 
million a year 
in addition panamanian assets in us banks estimated at 50 
million also have been frozen 
noriega has been attempting to rally support from his countrymen 
by blaming the united states for panamas financial problems but 
secretary of state george p shultz said noriegas campaign has not 
worked and that the united states and the panamanian people are 
on the same side 
reagan tightened the screws on friday when he ordered the 65 
million fee due to panama for canalrelated services placed in 
escrow it will be released once civilian government is restored 
he said 
reagan also acted to strip panama of the right to sell its 
products in us markets either dutyfree or at the lowest tariffs 
rates possible these benefits are given to panama under a system 
of tariff preferences accorded to third world countries and under 
the caribbean basin initiative designed to help 21 countries in 
that region 
but most of panamas income from us exports would not be 
affected by the sanction because they carry no duties to begin 
with examples are bananas shellfish fish and coffee which 
account for well over half of panamas annual us exports 
two items which will be affected by reagans action are 
sweaters a 235 million business for panama last year and 
petroleum products 146 million us government estimates of 
panamas total exports to the united states range between 342 
million and 388 million

the drug indictment of a top haitian military 
officer has spotlighted that nations emergence as a way station 
for cocaine traffickers seeking safer routes and reinforces charges 
that corrupt officials aid smugglers 
col jeanclaude paul along with his brother and exwife were 
charged in a federal indictment unsealed thursday with using a 
landing strip on the colonels farm to fly a 100kilogram or 
220pound cocaine shipment to the bahamas for delivery to miami 
haitian president leslie manigat has turned pauls case over to 
his countrys military courts for investigation there is no 
extradition treaty between haiti and the united states 
one of the principal witnesses in the case osvaldo quintana 
told reporters in january that he saw 9000 kilograms or 19800 
pounds of cocaine in duffel bags in the haitian presidential 
palace during the administration of ousted leader jeanclaude 
duvalier 
quintana also told the associated press that other haitian 
officials besides paul had a role in the smuggling but he would 
not disclose their names 
the alleged trafficking by highlevel haitians has angered sen 
bob graham dfla who said he will introduce legislation this 
week to lift us trade preferences with haiti 
this indictment is further indication that we cant tolerate a 
regime in haiti that seized power from the haitian people so it 
could continue the oppression of the past said graham 
drug enforcement administration spokesman jack hook said better 
technology such as improved radar and more cooperation from 
bahamian authorities have sharply limited the traditional drug 
routes into south florida 
that has forced colombian cocaine traffickers to go through 
other caribbean islands 
we have seen an increase in haiti being used as a 
transshipment point since we stepped up enforcement said hook 
asked about quintanas allegations that other haitian officials 
are involved hook would say only that the investigation is 
continuing 
the message that this case sends is the corrupting effects on 
public officials everywhere becuse of drug trafficking said hook 
rep larry smith dfla was blunter about the haitian 
connection 
more than two years ago i questioned the dea about increased 
drug trafficking through haiti and about government involvement in 
the traffic smith said recently 
he said the dea told him then they had no information on haitian 
officials involvement in drug smuggling 
this is the kind of headinthesand attitude that has allowed 
government after government to fall prey to the colombian 
cartels said smith 
whether it is a few corrupt officials a policy of the new 
militarysupported government or just coincidence haitis role 
has changed since duvalier fled 
there has been some increase in drug interceptions since the 
haitian government changed two years ago acknowledged coast 
guard lt cmdr jim simpson 
he said drug officials are spotting more planes flying over the 
haitian half of the island of hispaniola which haiti shares with 
the dominican republic the dominican republic recently shot down a 
suspected trafficker but simpson said haiti does not have the 
resources to chase drug planes 
hook said that since november the dea has had an office in 
portauprince the haitian capital and is optimistic that haitian 
officials will cooperate 
in the 90 days before the deas arrival haitian customs 
officials seized 1500 pounds of cocaine hidden on planes at 
portauprinces airport he said 
and the paul case should make it even more difficult for 
traffickers he said 
the publicity is going to put a little heat on haiti said 
hook 
but he said no one should expect trafficking to cease if haiti 
clamps down since smugglers are already using cuba the turks and 
caicos islands and other routes 
there is no caribbean island close to the united states that 
has gone unscathed said hook it just shows the magnitude of 
the problem

authorities released two men they had 
described as prime suspects in a twostate killing spree after the 
men passed lie detector tests their prints didnt match those on a 
weapon and a witness failed to identify them 
authorities had planned to hold a hearing friday night to 
determine if they had probable cause to hold the men in connection 
with four brutal slayings on monday in gainesville texas 
farmersville texas and in saratoga ark but when the two passed 
lie detector tests authorities canceled the hearing and agreed 
unanimously to let the men go 
the men were given tickets for a bus bound for terre haute 
ind hometown of one of the men officials said 
it was a misidentification is what it was one of the men

learn i was facing death row

assistant secretary of state chester a 
crocker will hold his first talks in two years with south africas 
foreign minister in an effort to advance a us peace initiative 
for southern africa the state department said saturday 
crockers meeting with roelof pik botha next week at an 
unspecified european location also will give the united states an 
opportunity to register concern about recent developments in 
south africa spokeswoman anita stockman said the united states 
has complained about antidissent measures proposed in south africa 
in the past few weeks 
a state department working group arrived in angola on wednesday 
to explore the possibility of further talks on getting the 
estimated 40000 cuban troops out of the country as part of an 
overall settlement stockman said 
since he took office in 1981 crocker has been seeking to 
negotiate a withdrawal of cuban troops from angola in return for 
south african withdrawal from neighboring namibia 
the cuban troops have been battling a powerful guerrilla force 
unita which is backed by south african and us assistance 
in what appeared to be a major breakthrough when crocker was in 
angola in january cuba declared its willingness in principle to 
pull the troops out of the country but the overall settlement that 
would bring that about is still to be arranged 
angola has said south african willingness to participate in the 
negotiations and abide by a united nations resolution giving 
independence to namibia is a necessary ingredient of a settlement 
stockman said crockers meeting with botha will afford an 
opportunity to reassess south africas willingness to proceed 
toward a settlement involving total cuban troop withdrawal from 
angola and namibian independence based on un security council 
resolution 435 
crocker also is expected to restate us demands for a cessation 
of cross border forays by south african troops and concern about a 
new crackdown on groups seeking more rights for the countrys black 
majority 
last month the government outlawed the political activities of 
17 antiapartheid organizations the government has also introduced 
legislation to bar a wide range of organizations from receiving 
foreign funds 
foreign governments and private agencies send millions of 
dollars in assistance to these groups as a way of aiding south 
africans without sending funds to their government

a threeweek festival featuring soviet music 
opened with envoys for president reagan and soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev praising the organizers of the cultural exchange for 
bringing the two countries closer together 
making music together with its 285 soviet musicians 
dancers composers and other artists is the first part of an 
exchange that will bring a celebration focusing on american 
contemporary music to moscow in the fall of 1989 
reagans praise came in a letter to sarah caldwell a key 
organizer of the exchange and artistic director of the opera 
company of boston it was read friday night by greg guroff of the 
governmentrun us information agency 
the letter described the event as one of the most ambitious 
cultural projects ever undertaken between the united states and the 
soviet union a testament to the potential of ussoviet 
cooperation in artistic and cultural endeavors 
soviet ambassador yuri dubinin who flew from washington to 
attend opening ceremonies read gorbachevs best wishes for 
success for the benefit of peace friendship and cooperation 
between our two nations 
also present at the ornate turnofthe century boston opera 
house was yuri melentiev the minister of culture of russia the 
soviet unions largest republic 
melentiev told reporters the festival stood as a symbol of 
improved superpower relationships in the wake of the meeting 
between reagan and gorbachev in washington late last year 
the festival is in the red because of unexpected costs that 
drove the price tag above the estimated budget of 24 million to 
33 million and organizers last month seriously considered the 
idea of declaring bankruptcy and canceling the event 
but organizers said they decided not to call if off after being 
told by the state department that cancellation could mar relations 
with the soviet union 
harold hestes president of the greater boston chamber of 
commerce and a key fundraiser said shortly before the opening 
ceremonies that the original shortfall of 900000 had been reduced 
to about 200000

last september the fbi asked 20 new yorkarea 
libraries to watch for and report on library users who might be 
gathering information for hostile powers library officials 
refused calling the move an effort to turn librarians into 
informers 
that incident is one of 60 that were added last year by the 
reporters committee for freedom of the press to a summary of 
actions taken by the reagan administration since 1981 to restrict 
public and media access to government information 
the committees list now has more than 200 items which 
underscores that contempt for the publics right to know 
permeates virtually all facets of the current administrations 
information policy said jane e kirtley executive director of 
the committee 
the fbi said its attempt to recruit librarians was part of a 
national counterintelligence initiative when the attempt was 
disclosed by the new york times james fox deputy assistant 
director of the new york fbi office said all we are interested 
in is the fact that a hostile diplomat is there we dont want 
librarians to become amateur sleuths 
some of the new items on the committee list are 
revelations by lt gen william e odom head of the national 
security agency that he regularly refers cases of news leaks to 
the justice department asking that the journalists reporting the 
information be prosecuted under espionage laws 
refusal by the justice department to disclose its financial 
settlement with the families of the challenger astronauts news 
media including the associated press went to court and last week 
were granted access to the records 
in november reporters for the atlanta journal and constitution 
asked the bureau of prisons for names of prisoners inside the 
federal penitentiary in atlanta when 1100 cuban prisoners held 
that prison for 11 days the bureau refused citing a policy of 
protecting prisoners privacy by not giving out their names 
last month president reagan asked congress for a new exemption 
to the freedom of information act that would require federal 
agencies to withhold governmentgenerated and governmentowned 
scientific and technical information it would be the 10th 
exemption to the foi act and the first since 1974 the committee 
said 
in march last year sen alan k simpson rwyo lambasted 
reporters for questioning reagan during a photo session simpson 
said reporters did a sadistic little disservice by questioning 
the president while he was off balance

the american diet is lousy and people are 
dying because of it 
thats the conclusion of a longterm study by the national 
cancer institute of what americans eat and dont eat during a 
typical day 
we really need to change the way we eat said gladys block 
an nci scientist and coauthor of a study published this month in 
the american journal of public health i really believe that 
could make a difference in the amount of cancer we have 
americans are not eating enough fruits vegetables wholegrain 
breads and highfiber cereals they are eating more fat and more 
saltcured nitritecured smoked and pickled meat all dietary 
elements that can affect health 
in effect said blossom patterson a coauthor of the study 
americans are forgetting the lessons they should have learned as 
children at the family dining table 
its not really a new message said patterson this is the 
same theme that mothers have been playing for a long long time 
eat your vegetables and fruits 
and says the nci if you eat like your mommies told you to you 
may live a longer time 
the study said that diet is estimated to contribute to about 35 
percent of all cancer deaths 
block said that the right foods have been shown to help prevent 
cancers of the stomach colon rectum breast oral cavity and 
esophagus statistics released earlier this year show that all of 
these types of cancer have increased in frequency block said the 
message is that to eat well may mean to live longer and she said 
americans simply arent doing that 
in interviews with more than 11000 people researchers from the 
nci and department of agriculture found that 
on a typical day 40 percent of americans do not eat a single 
fruit and 20 percent have no vegetable 
only about 49 percent of americans include garden 
vegetables vegetables other than potatoes or salad in their 
daily diet 
more than 80 percent of those surveyed ate no highfiber 
cereals or wholegrain breads 
daily fiber intake from whole grains or from vegetables such 
as corn or dried peas and beans averaged about 11 grams the 
recommended amount is 20 to 30 grams daily 
more than 40 percent of those surveyed ate at least one 
serving of lunch meat or bacon daily these are foods high in fat 
and salt and may be smoked or cured with nitrites 
women generally had a better diet than men and people over 
age 55 usually had better diets than young adults said block 
even so all groups showed a dramatic need for improvement 
with consumption of fruits vegetables and wholegrains falling far 
short of desirable levels she said 
patterson said that even though fruits and vegetables high in 
vitamins a and c are thought to be of special importance in 
lowering cancer risk 75 percent of those interviewed failed to 
include these items in their daily diets 
in a racial breakdown of the data patterson said the survey 
showed that black people ate more vegetables than did whites 
largely due to a higher consumption of greens such as collards 
whites however ate more wholegrain breads and highfiber cereals 
income also plays a role she said those with higher incomes 
tended to eat more fruits and vegetables along with more red meat 
by region more people ate poultry and fish in the south and 
northeast than in the west and midwest and red meat consumption 
was lowest in the south highfiber cereal consumption was highest 
in the northeast and west and lowest in the south 
the survey data was collected between 1976 and 1980 but block 
said that preliminary studies of more recent surveys show there has 
been little change and the consumption patterns from the 197680 
survey in turn show almost no change from data collected from 
1971 to 1974 
block said researchers are becoming increasingly convinced that 
simple changes in diet such as just adding an apple or orange or 
some cole slaw to a typical fast food meal could make a difference 
if everybody just had fruit and vegetables every day that 
could lead to a drop in the number of cancers she said

vice president george bushs apparent lock on 
the republican presidential nomination is beginning to cool 
democratic excitement over the prospect of a brokered national 
convention 
barring a collapse of unimaginable proportions bush will spend 
the final months of the primary season seeking support for the fall 
campaign from independent voters and potential democratic converts 
the longer the democratic nominating war goes on the better 
bush likes it a democratic national convention this summer 
featuring bloodletting on primetime tv would suit him just fine 
democrats know this well and that may give them an impetus to 
rally around a candidate sooner rather than later particularly 
given bushs evident vulnerability on the irancontra affair 
no one understands this better than jimmy carter the former 
president told an audience in connecticut last week that he emerged 
from the 1976 and 1980 conventions weaker than i went in 
he said the democrats should find a winning ticket and unite 
behind it in atlanta 
why is 51 percent the magic number asks new york gov mario 
cuomo lets pick the guy whos ahead after california the 
last state to vote in the primary season 
if mike dukakis has 41 percent of the delegates get 
everybody together in a room and say jesse jackson gore 
gephardt you came close but mikes the candidate 
that would avoid what carter calls the circus type of 
convention that twice nominated him 
carters lead over republican gerald ford declined steadily 
during the 1976 fall campaign although he won a close call in 
1980 weakened politically he triumped over sen edward m kennedy 
in an emotional convention struggle before losing a landslide to 
ronald reagan 
carter says that this time he and the 645 socalled democatic 
superdelegates will have a burning desire to put together a 
winning ticket when they convene in atlanta 
that makes the senate democratic caucus which picks 43 
delegates on april 19 and the house democratic caucus which picks 
210 delegates a day later as critical as any democratic primary 
waged with television advertising phone banks and direct mail 
the same is true for the 362 members of the democratic national 
committee who are superdelegates and the 25 governors 
the key now to this thing ending early is superdelegates 
says robert beckel a democratic campaign consultant not aligned 
with any of this years contenders theyre also the key to not 
ending it early 
any candidate who succeeds in picking up a large amount of 
support from the people selected in those two congressional 
meetings will be able to send a clear signal to the party that he 
is the presumptive nominee even before the primary season ends 
to earn that support a contender would presumably have to score 
well in the industrial state contests leading up to the 
congressional caucuses illinois michigan connecticut wisconsin 
and new york 
richard gephardt the missouri congressman already has the 
support of several dozen house members he probably could 
consolidate his strength if he mounted a comeback after his poor 
super tuesday showing but he if fails to win in michigans 
caucuses march 26 he is a likely dropout and his supporters are 
free to go elsewhere 
sen albert gore of tennessee must show quickly that he can win 
in the industrial states or he will have littel claim on the 
allegience of congress members 
jesse jackson is in the process of obtaining a large bloc of 
perhaps 800 delegates and figures prominently in the brokered 
convention scenarios that occupy democratic political insiders he 
will get his share of support in congress as elsewhere but most 
house and senate members arent likely to go over to his side 
the democrat who now looks in the strongest position in the 
race massachusetts gov michael dukakis would have to run well in 
the industrial states and probably signal his willingness to name 
a southerner as his running mate in the fall 
carter said he and the party leaders want a winning ticket and 
dukakis for all the boasting over his primary wins in texas and 
florida ran poorly among disaffected democrats that the party 
needs to win the presidency 
gore whipped him among democrats who voted for president reagan 
in 1984 39 percent to 23 percent according to abc interviews on 
super tuesday with primary voters in 12 southern states 
dukakis defeated gore among liberals and the two split the 
moderate vote but gore won among selfdescribed conservatives 38 
percent to 21 percent according to the abc polls

elisabeth ann zinser who resigned as 
president of gallaudet university amid protests from students who 
want a deaf leader enraged students and faculty at the school for 
the hearing impaired by suggesting she would quickly learn sign 
language 
in truth say professors at gallaudet learning sign language 
widely considered the nations third most frequently used 
foreign language is as difficult as mastering russian or 
chinese 
she zinser thought she would come in here and pick up sign 
language in three months said robert johnson an audiology 
professor at the nations only liberal arts college for the hearing 
impaired unfortunately you dont catch sign like you catch a 
cold 
there are three different varieties of sign language the purest 
of which has no connection with the english language while the 
crudest version relies heavily on english vocabulary and sentence 
structure johnson said 
johnson and scott lidell both professors in gallaudets 
department of linguistics say around 2 million americans are 
considered deaf by audiometric standards while 18 million others 
suffer from some hearing loss 
those who use sign language are usually in the smaller group 
while persons with less severe hearing loss do not usually learn 
sign language the majority of gallaudets students are profoundly 
deaf and use sign language according to school officials 
american sign language the purest form of signing is commonly 
used between people who are either profoundly deaf or have been 
deaf since birth johnson said comparing asl to the use of a 
foreign language asl users are roughly equivalent to those fluent 
in a foreign tongue 
but similarities with written or spoken language end there 
johnson emphasized 
english relies on a linear structure with one word following 
the last but in asl the message is conveyed through simultaneous 
use of facial expressions finger signs and motions johnson 
said 
asl has a base vocabulary on which general themes not 
individual words are built images rather than words expressed in 
sign convey the signers message 
its extremely timeefficient lidell said you have two 
hands a face and a body participating in delivering the message 
in spoken or written english you have just words signing gives 
you more channels 
deaf people comunicating with hearing people mix sign language 
with some components of formal english the result being a type of 
sign language called contact variety signing or pidgin sign 
english 
in the contact variety method the message expressed may use 
numerous images associated with asl but the message is based on 
the syntax of an english sentence 
it is this form of communication through which gallaudet student 
protest leaders with the assistance of interpreters conveyed 
their message to the media and campus onlookers 
sign supported english is the third type of sign it does not 
rely on facial expressions and involves sending messages primarily 
with spoken english signing symbols are used to reinforce the 
spoken message in what johnson describes as coding speech on the 
hands 
sign supported english johnson said is slow and awkward and 
is the only type of sign language zinser could have learned in less 
than six months there are sign language symbols for each of the 26 
characters in the english alphabet and when signers cannot find a 
symbol for an english word they may spell out the english word 
then return to sign fingerspelling is used in all three types of 
sign 
gallaudet professors 30 percent of whom are deaf are required 
to know sign language and must pass sign examinations for 
promotions or raises according to roger beach a counseling 
professor who designed gallaudets exam program

chinese companies that want to sell their 
products abroad are being given greater freedom to do so the 
government announced saturday 
the state council chinas cabinet said the nation will 
introduce a contract system under which the power to handle most 
import and export commodities will be transferred to local foreign 
trade companies and certain wellmanaged industrial enterprises

as they wish 
following introduction of the system china will reduce 
mandatory state quotas for exports and the number of statehandled 
export commodities 
national export and import corporations will handle only a small 
amount of commodities instead their branches will become 
independent managerial entitites run by local governments 
xinhua said the new foreign trade structure encourages local 
authorities and exportoriented enterprises to participate in 
foreign trade

exchange managerial structure local governments enterprises and 
institutions and foreignfunded businesses will be allowed to

a condemned man who insists hes 
innocent and whose case has become a rallying cry for death penalty 
opponents is seeking his seventh reprieve from the electric chair 
with just two days left before his scheduled execution 
willie jasper darden faces execution early tuesday at florida 
state prison near starke for the september 1973 killing of 
furniture store owner carl turman during a 15 robbery 
let me tell you something willie darden is not a murderer 
darden 54 told the associated press in a 1985 interview a claim 
that he has made to dozens of reporters who have interviewed him 
darden has received six stays of execution more than any other 
florida inmate and his case has attracted international attention 
with supporters saying he was a victim of racial prejudice at his 
trial because he is black 
two witnesses say they have information to back up his story 
but their accounts were dismissed as mistaken and not new by the 
lawyer who prosecuted darden 
there is no question he is guilty ray mcdaniel now a 
bartow attorney said friday in a telephone interview 
mcdaniel said he believed darden will die tuesday i dont 
think you will find a judge with the guts to issue a stay he 
said 
i think its time i think its about 12 years too late 
mcdaniel said who added that darden was linked but never charged 
with other murders 
attorneys for the office of capital collateral review filed an 
appeal friday with the florida supreme court 
dardens is one of the mostlitigated cases involving a death 
row inmate with nearly 100 judges involved in decisions it has 
been before the us supreme court four times already 
mcdaniel discounted the assertions of two people who repeated 
claims friday at an amnesty international news conference in 
tallahassee that they believe darden is innocent 
the rev sam sparks a baptist minister and christine bass a 
lakeland secretary said they had information they say might clear 
darden of the crime 
i know willie darden is innocent it is not a belief it is a 
knowledge said ms bass 
sparks said turmans wife had told him that all blacks looked 
alike to her and that her identification of darden was unimportant 
because lawyers had told her that darden committed the crime helen 
baum formerly helen turman recently denied having made that 
statement to sparks and reaffirmed her identification of darden as 
the man who shot her husband 
ms bass said dardens car was broken down near her home until a 
tow truck arrived about 25 minutes before the robbery eight miles 
away 
mcdaniel said the two are mistaken about the times and that the 
defense knew their claims at the time of the trial 
amnesty international officials have claimed gov bob martinez 
is rushing to execute darden for political reasons 
the governor signed a seventh death warrant for darden on march 
8 just a day after the us supreme court refused to intervene 
and set his execution for tuesday giving dardens attorneys less 
than a week to prepare his case 
i think what the governor is looking for some kind of 
ritualistic sacrifice that he can go through to prove hes tough on 
crime said magdaleno roseavila national director of amnesty 
internationals campaign to abolish the death penalty he noted 
that the governors popularity rating has been low in recent polls 
when martinez signed the sixth death warrant in dardens case 
earlier this year soviet dissident andrei sakharov american 
actress margot kidder and british rock star peter gabriel urged 
clemency for darden sakharov won the 1975 nobel peace prize for 
his defense of human rights in the soviet union 
the governors spokesman said politics had nothing to do with 
the decision 
international attention has no real bearing on whether a 
legally imposed sentence that has been upheld by the courts should 
be carried out said press secretary jon peck

thousands of protesters outside the 
offices of president kurt waldheim on saturday urged him to resign 
and remembered the victims of nazism 50 years after adolf hitlers 
troops marched into austria 
police estimated about 5000 people attended despite pouring 
rain and strong winds the organizers estimated 10000 
the demonstration called by more than a dozen well known 
austrian intellectuals marked the march 1938 annexation of austria 
to nazi germany 
one of several banners displayed said memorial year without 
waldheim 
debate has surrounded the former un secretarygeneral since 
1986 when the first revelations surfaced about his service in the 
german army in the balkans during world war ii 
a panel of historians appointed by the austrian government 
issued a report last month that said he was in close proximity 
to some nazi atrocities knew they were going on and made no 
attempt to prevent them 
it also said waldheim concealed his wartime past and tried to 
make it seem harmless once he could no longer hide it 
demonstrators arrived saturday by bus and train from across 
austria loudspeakers played a recording of hitlers speech to 
cheering masses on the adjoining square on march 15 1938 
hundreds of thousand of austrians welcomed the annexation known 
as the anschluss but others actively resisted it 
author peter turrini one of several artists and intellectuals 
who addressed the crowd said austrians had not yet done enough to 
confront their wartime past 
there has not yet been one minute of confession he declared 
chancellor franz vranitzky speaking at the site of a former 
prison camp for gypsies said austrians may not behave as they 
did after 1945 when no one asked what hapened to the austrians 
who left the country in 1938 
at the demonstration before waldheims offices rosa jochmann a 
former concentration camp inmate and resistance fighter gave an 
emotional speech that left many spectators weeping 
she recalled that even people who were not directly responsible 
for nazi atrocities simply walked by acts of violence 
it is not true that one should not mourn one must she 
said all those who lived through it the nazi period must 
speak i will never be silent 
the organizers appealed for a minute of silence after the 
speech in contrast to friday when a nationwide minute of silence 
was only sparsely observed the entire square fell still

a soccer player who witnessed a deadly stadium 
collapse in the libyan capital last week said he thought tripoli 
had been hit by an earthquake 
suddenly there was a rumble and then the bodies fell 
down maltese player john buttigieg told the rome daily il 
messaggero in an interview published saturday 
part of the grandstand collapsed thursday after some of the 
60000 spectators at the 75000seat june 11 stadium panicked 
because of a knife fight according to reports 
news reports from malta and yugoslavia said 20 people were 
killed and that scores of people were injured radio malta in a 
report from tripoli said at least 17 people died and that two 
people were arrested 
the reports conflicted with those from the libyan news agency 
jana which said two people were killed and 16 others were 
hospitalized 
buttigieg said at first he screamed like a madman at his 
team captain that it was an earthquake 
the grandstand in front of me was coming down like a sand 
castle and the fans fell by the tens by the hundreds 
buttigieg was quoted as saying 
three years ago i saw on television the scene at heysel but 
in tripoli it was worse much worse he added referring to the 
may 1985 riot by english fans at brussels heysel stadium that 
killed 39 people 
after a part of the third tier of seats the highest fell on 
the second tier it was hell there was a continuous scream i 
saw people run toward the dead he said 
the referee told us to go into the dressing rooms but we 
couldnt the entrance was blocked by bodies and pieces of 
cement he said 
the belgrade daily politika ekspres said the incident began when 
several fans pulled out knives during a quarrel 
seeking shelter nearby spectators toppled an iron fence at the 
same time a 6footthick 15foothigh wall crashed down the 
newspaper said 
the paper said many people were injured when fans stampeded 
toward the exits 
people began to enter the field said buttigieg they ran 
toward the collapsed grandstand perhaps they wanted to help the 
injured but no they wanted to fight with whom i do not know 
politika exspres said about 5000 fans chased those who had 
brandished weapons one of them was caught but police managed to 
drag him free from the enraged crowd it said 
the maltese paper lorizzont reported that libyan leader col 
moammar gadhafi had planned to attend the match which opened a 
sports festival in tripoli however at the last moment he changed 
his mind and was represented at the match by a city official 
the exhibition game was stopped in the 43rd minute and did not

president reagan warned house and senate 
negotiators saturday he will veto a trade bill they are preparing 
unless protectionist and defeatist provisions are eliminated 
the conference committee working on the final draft of the 
bill has already eliminated a number of troublesome provisions 
including illegal quotas budgetbusting giveaways and 
protectionist measures reagan said from camp david md in his 
weekly radio address 
he added however that he opposes many remaining provisions 
and im hopeful within the next phase these will be jettisoned 
only wholesale elimination of many of the existing items will 
produce a bill i can sign 
the trade bill a 1000page set of provisions that have been 
worked on for three years is currently the subject of negotiations 
involving no fewer than 17 congressional committees 
one of the casualties of the process has been a controversial 
housepassed amendment that would have required 10 percent annual 
rollbacks in excess and unwarranted japanese surpluses in trade 
with this country 
reagan expressed a willingness to work with congress to produce 
a bill he could sign 
a protectionist trade bill is a serious threat to our export 
boom reagan said its a serious threat to the millions of 
american jobs that depend upon international trade it is filled 
with scores of provisions that are protectionist and defeatist 
my veto pen is ready if the final bill remains antitrade 
anticonsumer antijobs and antigrowth he said 
with an improvement in trade in recent months he said a 
protectionist trade bill would be like closing the barn door just 
when the horse is trying to get back in 
much of the recent narrowing of the us trade deficit has been 
credited to a decline in the value of the dollar against foreign 
currencies making american goods less expensive overseas 
reagan said however that since the third quarter of 1986 the 
merchandise trade deficit in real terms has declined 18 percent and 
the volume of exports has grown four times as fast as the volume of 
imports in the past 15 months 
adopting protectionist measures and starting trade wars now 
would be like closing the barn door just as the horses tried to get 
back in he said 
lawmakers have said they want to have the bill ready by easter 
in recent weeks quotas on lamb imports and payments to sugar 
refiners hurt by imports have been stripped from the legislation by 
the senate conferees 
sen jeff bingaman dnm in his partys weekly radio speech 
said reagans upbeat comments about exports hides our trade 
deficit problem staggering figures which are monthly reminders 
that america is not the economic power that it was 
the 1987 trade deficit was about 170 billion

here is the text of president reagans radio 
address delivered saturday from camp david md 
my fellow americans id like to talk to you today about our 
nations trade policy i cant think of a recent economic issue 
that has generated more heat and less light yet has more 
importance to our longterm national interest than trade 
throughout the seven years ive been in office professional 
doom sayers have latched onto one issue after another as evidence 
of an american decline they cant seem to acknowledge the obvious 
good news that surrounds us the low inflation the over 15 
million new jobs since november 1982 and the longest peacetime 
economic expansion of the century 
trade is only the most recent subject of lamentation by our 
critics for them our trade deficit is an excuse for getting the 
government more involved in in private business they say that 
americans cant compete with foreign workers so we should slow 
imports by erecting protectionist trade barriers 
as usual the doom merchants are wrong the us economy remains 
the most dynamic and exciting one on the globe our entrepreneurs 
our cando spirit and our economic freedom are the envy of the 
world the pessimism used to justify protectionism is totally 
unfounded lets clear up a few myths 
first the trade situation is improving far more quickly than 
people realize economists may disagree on the impact of the trade 
imbalance but there is no disagreement that there has been a 
remarkable turnaround in the real trade deficit 
since the third quarter of 1986 the merchandise trade deficit 
in real terms has declined 18 percent and over the past 15 months 
the volume of exports has grown over fourtimes as fast as the 
volume of imports clearly we are in an export boom american 
industries particularly manufacturers are setting records 
unfortunately theres a threat to all this good news im 
talking about the trade bill pending in congress adopting 
protectionist measures and starting trade wars now would be like 
closing the barn door just as the horses tried to get back in the 
best way to keep our exports growing is to keep international trade 
expanding and that brings me to another myth that congress can 
pass a law that will reduce the trade deficit without destroying 
our prosperity legislation can reduce a trade deficit only if it 
reduces economic activity if people are not working theyre not 
trading we had a trade surplus and 25 percent unemployment in the 
great depression 
a protectionist trade bill is a serious threat to our export 
boom its a serious threat to the millions of american jobs that 
depend upon international trade it is filled with scores of 
provisions that are protectionist and defeatist my veto pen is 
ready if the final bill remains antitrade anticonsumer 
antijobs and antigrowth however the administration is willing 
to work diligently with congress to produce a bill that would 
increase our international competitiveness and complement our 
efforts to promote trade exports jobs and productivity not 
stymie them 
all those working on the bill should take a deep breath take 
another look at the trade outlet and work together in a 
constructive spirit it is still possible to write a bill that i 
can sign 
indeed i am encouraged by reports on the status of the trade 
bill negotiations the conference committee working on the final 
draft of the bill has already eliminated a number of troublesome 
provisions including illegal quotas budgetbusting giveaways and 
protectionist measures many objectionable provisions remain 
including procedural changes in the law but im hopeful within the 
next phase these will be jettisoned only wholesale elimination of 
many of the existing items will produce a bill i can sign 
regardless of whether i sign trade legislation this year we 
will continue our free and fair approach to trade policy we will 
challenge unfair trade practices of other countries in order to 
achieve a level playing field for american industries we will 
negotiate to knock down trade barriers on a bilateral or 
multilateral basis in that regard we will seek early enactment of 
the uscanada free trade agreement and push for concrete progress 
in the upcoming uruguay round of trade negotiations 
finally we will continue to coordinate economic policies with 
our major trading partners thereby helping to maintain a favorable 
international climate for trade expansion americas open market is 
its great strength not its weakness international trade has 
helped bring unparalleled prosperity to the american people it 
would be a tragic mistake to surrender to doubt and defeatism just 
when our prospects are looking so bright i have confidence in 
america and im sure you do too 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

in an atmosphere of deepening crisis 
panamas leaders met again saturday to figure out how to pay the 
130000 public employees whose salaries come due early this week 
with its treasury virtually empty the government reportedly was 
considering delaying or reducing the semimonthly paychecks of the 
workers who have been among its staunchest supporters 
panamas new chief of state manuel solis palma and his cabinet 
have been meeting almost constantly since thursday evening in an 
effort to solve the problem which could have strong political 
repercussions 
it became even more critical friday when the reagan 
administration in washington announced new economic sanctions 
against panama including the withholding of 65 million in 
monthly panama canal fees 
the sanctions were meant to force the ouster of gen manuel 
antonio noriega who has ruled panama since 1983 as head of its 
defense forces he is under indictment in the united states on drug 
smuggling and money laundering charges 
with solis palma and the foreign minister jorge abadia tied up 
in the emergency economic meetings the government saturday still 
had not responded formally to the punitive measures taken in 
washington 
but boris moreno head of the governments national information 
office referred to the sanctions as economic aggression and an 
outrage and said they had created a virtual state of war 
this means that if the united states government does not like 
the government of another country it can withhold any funds 
deposited in the united states he said 
panama uses the us dollar as its currency and even before the 
latest sanctions were announced washington had halted normal 
transfers of funds from the us federal reserve other monies on 
deposit by panama in private us banks also have been tied up by 
legal actions 
panamas 118 local and foreign banks were ordered closed until 
further notice on march 3 because the government could not provide 
enough money to cover withdrawals most had already shut down or 
were operating on a limited basis because of a run on deposits that 
began late last month 
the bank closure left thousands of people and businesses holding 
checks they could not cash in the absence of cash most people 
were hoarding the dollars they had and many businessmen said they 
were working out barter deals with suppliers and customers 
eric arturo delvalle the deposed president whose ouster last 
month sparked the current crisis predicted earlier this week that 
the governments inability to pay its employees would add a new 
political dimension to the problem 
delvalle made the statement from hiding he has not been seen in 
public since shortly after noriega engineered his ouster in a 
thinly disguised coup that came only hours after he tried to 
dismiss the general the united states still recognizes delvalle as 
panamas legitimate president

here is the text of the democratic partys 
response by sen jeff bingaman of new mexico to president 
reagans radio address on saturday 
in one respect the president has done our country a great 
service in 1981 when he took office we were not feeling good 
about ourselves there was the iranhostage crisis there was 
runaway inflation 
by 1984 the presidents rhetoric had helped us to feel proud of 
america once again and that good feeling hit its height in the 
summer of 1984 at the summer olympic games in los angeles the 
president had reminded all americans that we are a proud people 
but now that feelgood rhetoric is becoming a problem in 
itself the president insists that the economy is in great shape 
and that america has never been better off but the truth is that 
we have seen feelgood rhetoric used to paper over the very real 
problems that challenge our country and thats not the way 
americans work 
as americans we pride ourselves in solving our problems not in 
papering them over the real issue that the presidents feelgood 
rhetoric ignores is what kind of america are we leaving for our 
children what standard of living will our children have will they 
realize the american dream the way that weve been able to will 
our children ever be as well off as we have been 
the presidents rhetoric hides the fact that wage rates today 
are below what they were 15 years ago it hides the fact that the 
new service sector jobs that have been created pay about half as 
much as the manufacturing jobs they replace it hides the fact that 
both parents in most of americas young families have to work and 
they have to work whether there are young children to take care of 
or not 
it hides the fact that fewer and fewer young american families 
can afford to buy their own house today and it hides the fact that 
the wages of our young families make it virtually impossible for 
them to save save for hard times save for a down payment on a 
house or save for their childrens education 
the presidents rhetoric also hides our trade deficit problem 
staggering figures which are monthly reminders that america is not 
the economic power that we once were it hides the fact that during 
this administration as a country we have added 15 trillion to 
the national debt that means that in 1989 we will spend more on 
interest payments in the national debt than on the total combined 
budgets of the departments of agriculture commerce education 
energy interior labor and justice 
these interest payments consume precious funds which will not be 
spent on rebuilding americas economic power and will not be spent 
on educating our children 
mr president you have reminded us that we are a great country 
and that we are proud to be americans but we are now ready to get 
to work solving some of those very real problems that exist it 
does not help to pretend that the problems dont exist 
it does not help to stay the course when the course has taken us 
into the ditch were ready to invest the time money and energy in 
revitalizing the american economy were ready to fight unfair 
trade practices 
were ready to create new jobs which pay more than the ones that 
they replace were ready to make specific investments in education 
and retraining of our workers in new research and development and 
in the commercialization of new technologies and were also ready 
to reverse our growing dependence on foreign sources of energy 
also were ready to invest the time money and energy in the 
education of our children 
instead of lecturing our childrens teachers were ready to do 
our part to help make our educational system work work better and 
work harder were ready to do what has to be done to prepare our 
children to take the good jobs that this country can create in an 
economic revitalization program mr president feeling good and 
staying the course just are not doing the job 
a proud america means an america that can recognize its 
challenges and meet those challenges headon only if we do so will 
our children be as proud to be americans 20 years from now as we 
are today this is us sen jeff bingaman thank you for listening

some hunters develop stuffy noses wheezing 
and hives around deer in what one researcher calls a case of 
bambi strikes back and some people are literally allergic to 
exercise scientists have found 
research also shows that cockroaches often prompt asthmatics to 
wheeze while fleas make others sneeze the scientists say 
their studies of unusual often unrecognized and potentially 
deadly allergies are being presented during the american academy of 
allergy and immunologys annual meeting which opened friday and 
ends wednesday 
the prevalence of such allergies is unknown but the studies 
suggest they probably are more common than once thought especially 
among people with common allergies such as sensitivity to pollens 
household dust and foods such as peanuts and shellfish 
theres all kind of weird triggers to allergies said dr 
robert k bush a university of wisconsin allergist and chief of 
allergy at the veterans administration hospital in madison bush 
coauthored the study of 12 deersensitive wisconsin hunters with 
dr david schroeckenstein 
this may not be real common bush said of the hunters deer 
dilemma but there are certainly a lot of people who get exposed 
to these animals and the potential is there for them to become 
allergic 
most of the hunters suffered congestion hives asthma 
sneezing runny noses itchy eyes and swollen eyelids and lips 
after inhaling deer hair or touching the animals hair saliva 
blood or urine one was a state deer checker who went into 
allergic shock after cutting his hand on a tag he placed on a deer 
the man recovered 
poor bambi gets shot then bambi strikes back thats a good 
headline bush said 
the allergy academys president dr albert sheffer of harvard 
university medical school coauthored the largest study to date of 
exerciseinduced allergic shock which was first recognized in 1969 
and is characterized by hives choking andor a lifethreatening 
drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness 
sheffer concluded that while the condition is rare its the 
most common physical allergy even more common than hives induced 
by heat or cold 
the study outlined saturday by harvards dr john wade 
analyzed a group of 199 people who develop allergic shock called 
anaphylaxis when they exercise 
jogging prompted shock in 71 percent of the patients aerobics 
in 38 percent dancing in 26 percent and swimming in 17 percent 
many were allergic to certain foods pollen cat dander aspirin 
and other painkillers 
the cause of exercise allergy is unknown while exerciseinduced 
shock is lifethreatening we dont have any evidence anybody 
died from it sheffer said 
dr bann kang head of the allergy section at the university of 
kentucky medical center in lexington said her study of 680 
asthmatics in chicago found 283 of them were allergic to body 
parts eggs and feces of cockroaches in house dust an allergy 
first identified in new york in 1967 
they usually have very severe intractable asthma she said 
they have attacks all the time 
because many doctors dont recognize cockroach asthma they only 
treat symptoms then send the patient back home where the home 
is filled with material that may induce asthma attacks again 
kang said 
while flea bites are known to cause hives a new study revealed 
fleas body parts inhaled from house dust also trigger allergic 
reactions said the studys author research associate walter 
trudeau of the university of south florida school of medicine and 
the veterans administration hospital in tampa 
trudeaus study found 18 of 100 consecutive patients treated at 
an allergy clinic for other allergies also were allergic to fleas 
that invaded their homes aboard their cats or dogs 
desensitization injections can eliminate allergies to pollens 
house dust and cockroaches but there is no effective serum to 
desensitize people allergic to deer fleas or exercise the 
researchers said 
people allergic to fleas should get rid of their pets or at 
least exterminate the fleas trudeau said hunters allergic to deer 
should stop hunting if necessary bush said 
people prone to develop exerciseinduced allergic shock should 
not exercise for at least four to six hours after eating since 
exercise allergy often causes symptoms only if allergenic foods 
were consumed sheffer said

ashland women deny they are ladies of 
leisure despite a recent report saying there are fewer of them in 
work force than anywhere else in the country 
the 1988 congressional district fact book said only 316 percent 
of the northeastern kentucky women are employed while the national 
average for working women was 547 percent in 1986 
but some members of the american business womens association in 
ashland dispute the finding 
ive got three daughters and two daughtersinlaw and they all 
work said margaret moore ive worked all my life all the 
women i know work 
helen hunt vice president of the association said she doesnt 
think ashland is much different than any other area 
usually women can find work here quicker than men she said 
on the other hand prince georges county md topped the list of 
working women with 626 percent arlington va was second with 
622 percent and bloomington minn ranked third at 622 percent 
the book said 
ranking slightly above ashland are huntington wva 319 
percent washington pa 362 percent and the economically 
depressed south bronx section of new york city 365 percent the 
book said 
the book was published by the joint center for political 
studies a washington dc think tank which used us census 
data to determine its rankings 
one explanation for the small percentage of working women in 
ashland might be that males traditionally have held the highpaying 
jobs at large local employers such as ashland oil and armco inc 
perhaps it wasnt necessary for women to work in some 
situations said mike sturm employment and training program 
supervisor with the kentucky department of employment services in 
ashland

the chicago tribune endorsed tennessee sen 
albert gore in tuesdays illinois presidential primary passing 
over homestate candidates sen paul simon and jesse jackson 
the tribune endorsement in sunday editions called gore an 
underdog with sound judgment and an important message 
the chicago suntimes the states second largest newspaper 
after the tribune has endorsed massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
in the democratic race and vice president george bush in the 
republican primary 
the endorsement is offered in the same spirit as our earlier 
endorsement of sen robert dole in the republican primary in 
hopes that an underdog with sound judgment and an important message 
can pick up momentum in illinois and contest his partys nomination 
all the way to its convention said the tribune editorial 
the tribune conducted a poll for sundays editions that showed 
simon was favored by 35 percent of those surveyed jackson 30 
percent and dukakis 18 percent gore and gephardt had a combined 
total of about 10 percent 
among the likely republican voters bush was supported by 62 
percent and dole by 28 percent robertson was the first choice of 
only 6 percent 
the survey conducted by peter d hart research associates 
contacted 504 republicans and 501 democrats on wednesday and 
thursday and had a margin of error of 5 percentage points 
the tribune endorsement said gore was the only candidate who 
could prevent the democatic debate from winding down into the 
staid pronouncements of dukakis and the jazzier echo of 
the classconscious mr jackson 
the tribune gave gore high marks on his knowledge of domestic 
and foreign affairs and also warned the democratic party it needed 
a strong gore candidacy just to avoid a repeat in november of its 
1980 and 1984 humiliations 
dukakis leads in the race for delegates to the partys national 
nominating convention followed by jackson and gore missouri rep 
richard gephardt is fourth and simon is last although there are 
more uncommitted delegates than simon and gephardt have together

some 65000 americans a year develop lung 
diseases from onthejob causes making lung disease the most 
common preventable cause of jobrelated illness and death in the 
country the american lung association said saturday 
longterm exposure to cancercausing substances in the 
workplace for example is blamed for about 16000 lung cancer 
deaths a year the association said in its 1987 annual report 
that is about 12 percent of the nations total lung cancer 
deaths last year the association said 
among the workplace substances that cause lung cancer are 
arsenic a hazard in the oil refining smelting and mining 
industries asbestos in asbestos milling and manufacture 
insulation and shipyard work chromium used in glassmaking 
potting and battery making nickel in nickel refining and 
petroleum products and oils the association said 
not everyone in those industries is exposed to those substances 
however the association noted 
other jobrelated lung diseases include chronic bronchitis a 
stiffening of lung tissue called pulmonary fibrosis and industrial 
asthma the association said 
on other topics the annual report said smokers who kick the 
habit have to wait 10 years or more before their risk of lung 
cancer falls to about that of people who have never smoked 
but that should not discourage smokers from quitting because 
quitting causes an immediate and dramatic plunge in the risk of 
other diseases especially emphysema and chronic bronchitis the 
report says 
the report also calls lung cancer statistics on blacks 
horrendous resulting from higher percentages of smokers among 
black men and women than among whites 
in 1985 about 41 percent of black men aged 20 and older smoked 
compared to about 32 percent for white men while about 32 percent 
of black women smoked compared to 28 percent of white women the 
association said 
from 1973 to 1984 the lung cancer death rate among black men 
rose 25 percent from 643 deaths per 100000 population to 803 
three times faster than the rate among white men the association 
said in a separate statement 
for black women the death rate nearly doubled from 119 per 
100000 population to 204 the association said

chinese embassy there was no response from the embassy and police 
maintained a discreet watch on the demonstrators who ended their

china out of tibet and long live the dalai lama on a 
peaceful march through zurichs inner city 
about 150 tibetan refugees participated in the new delhi 
demonstration one of the latest last week to mark the 29th 
anniversary of an unsuccessful uprising against chinese rule in the 
tibetan capital of lhasa 
the pride and might of communist china will not crush the 
spirit of tibetan nationalism the tibetan womens organization 
which organized the new delhi protest said in statement 
indian policewomen stood by and watched the tibetan women burn 
the red flag of china near parliament 
tsewang topgyal a spokesman for the demonstrators fled his 
country at the age of 5 in the wake of the violent revolt in 1959 
he said this anniversary is like christmas for tibetans it is a 
time when we remember family and friends at home

the worlds birthrate will begin 
declining within the next 12 years for the first time in recorded 
history a group of development experts said saturday 
this will be a momentous occasion in the history of the 
world said dr william foege director of the task force for 
child survival and former head of the centers for disease control 
in atlanta 
scientists attending the task forces threeday international 
symposium here agreed that new projections from developing 
countries show that the birthrate should stop growing nearly a half 
century earlier than demographers previously thought possible 
that would be followed by the stabilization of the entire 
population said foege an epidemiologist who conducted the 
birthrate study the birthrate is the number of births per 1000 
population 
dr kenneth warren a vaccines expert and head of the health 
unit of the rockefeller foundation said people have considered 
that world population growth would continue indefinitely the 
question has been is man going to overrun and destroy the whole 
planet its something people have been despairing about 
the task force for child survival is a coalition that includes 
unicef the un childrens fund the world health organization 
more than a dozen international aid agencies and doctors and health 
ministers from 11 developing countries 
the organizations have been working on an international campaign 
to immunize children against polio diphtheria tuberculosis and 
other diseases in a project aimed primarily at developing nations 
the common perception that low infant mortality causes 
population increases is apparently incorrect said warren 
actually a low death rate for infants actually causes 
populations to stabilize industrialized countries such as the 
united states have relatively low birthrates 
experts at the conference said asian and latin american 
countries now are following this trend an increasing number of 
countries are weighing in with lower birth rates 
the experts said women in poor countries are likely to have 
larger families to offset the loss of children to disease 
foege using data from the world bank examined trends in infant 
mortality and birthrates from 1960 to the present and projected 
infant mortality by nation through 2000 
if were wrong were only wrong by a few years the concept 
isnt wrong foege said adding that his predictions of the 
anticipated drop int he birthrate could have an error margin of 
five years 
previous predictions have indicated that the birthrate would 
stabilize midway through the next century when the population 
reaches about 13 billion 
if foeges projections are correct the population would stop 
growing at about the year 2150 
because of increased life expectancy and other factors the 
population level will take at least several decades to level off 
after the birthrate stops growing 
theres full agreement on the prediction said james p 
grant executive director of unicef with the kinds of 
improvements in survival weve been talking about at this meeting 
the decline could come even sooner 
the birthrate prediction made at on the last day of the 
symposium was part of an optimistic appraisal of the progress made 
in improving health care and the potential to extend life for 
children worldwide

the drug enforcement administration at the 
invitation of bolivia peru and ecuador has been assisting an 
offensive aimed at south american cocaineprocessing facilities and 
growing areas that was first tried with us military troops amid 
much controversy in 1986 
under the initiative dea officials say specially trained us 
drug agents with the assistance of aircraft from the agency are 
accompanying bolivian military forces into the jungles of that 
country and locating cocaine processing laboratories which are 
then dismantled by the troops 
the effort begun last year is a continuation and broadening of 
operation blast furnace in 1986 dea spokesman cornelius dougherty 
said in blast furnace 170 us army personnel raided about 20 
drug lab sites in bolivia the injection of us troops drew 
criticism from civil liberties groups concerned about the use of 
the military to enforce civilian laws 
the new operation doesnt involve us military personnel 
were working with the governments in the primary cocagrowing 
countries of peru and bolivia where they are using their troops 
and we are sending along dea advisers as intelligence experts 
dougherty said 
the agents have undergone extensive training in weapons 
language and jungle survival in addition to the regular 14 weeks 
of field training dea agents take the jungle survival training is 
given by the us army special forces the green berets 
as part of the effort dea planes outfitted with sophisticated 
electronic gear are being used for aerial reconnaissance to 
identify drug labs 
in peru dea agents began in mid1987 to help immobilize and 
disrupt the flow of cocaine products from the principal area of 
that country where illicit coca is cultivated the upper huallaga 
valley extensive production of coca paste and cocaine base also 
takes place there david l westrate assistant dea administrator 
for operations said in congressional testimony earlier this month 
partly as a result of the effort there have been substantial 
seizures of coca leaves cocaine base and chemicals used in 
producing coca paste and base westrate said 
under an agreement made in 1987 with bolivia dea agents helped 
the government there locate and destroy numerous coca processing 
facilities a total of 26 labs for producing coca base or refining 
it were seized last year in bolivia westrate said 
dea agents also are taking a more active role in ecuador a 
transit country for large amounts of chemicals used in processing 
cocaine in other south american countries dea officials said most 
of the coca paste produced in ecuador is transported to colombia 
for conversion to cocaine hydrochloride

iraq said saturday its jets hit a tanker 
in the persian gulf and an oil pumping station on the iranian 
mainland indicating a return of hostilities to economic targets 
during a truce in the war of the cities 
but iran later accused iraq of violating the truce by sending a 
warplane to bomb the town of gachsaran in southwestern iran 
tehran television monitored in cyprus quoted a spokesman for 
the war information headquarters as saying the plane was forced 
to flee under heavy antiaircraft fire 
he said the aircraft was seen dropping it bombs out of 
frustration in a desert area 
the unidentified spokesman said the incident indicates iraq 
wants to continue its acts of mischief and the islamic combatants 
will not remain silent if civilian targets are attacked again 
iraq did not comment on the report 
irans islamic republic news agency monitored in cyprus 
earlier reported that revolutionary guards attacked and set ablaze 
the offshore alamaya radar facility in the northern tip of the 
gulf friday night 
alamaya had been transformed by the iraqis from an oil platform 
to monitor activity in the gulf irna said surfacetoair and 
shoretosea missile pads on the facility were destroyed in the 
attack 
the official iraqi news agency also monitored in cyprus 
reported that iraqi warplanes blasted the imam hassan oil pumping 
station in southwestern iran saturday afternoon 
the agency quoted an unidentified iraqi military spokesman as 
saying the facility was totally destroyed 
in an earlier dispatch iraq reported to have struck a very 
large maritime target off the iranian coast friday night the 
attack was not independently verified by gulfbased shipping 
executives 
ina quoted a military spokesman as saying the iraqi warplanes 
scored an accurate and effective hit on the vessel and 
returned safely 
it quoted a spokesman as saying the raids reflected iraqs 
determination to destroy irans economic lifeline and deprive the 
enemy of revenues employed to finance aggression 
the ceasefire in the war of the cities passed the 24hour 
mark with no attacks on each others capitals or major population 
centers 
hundreds of civilian casualties were reported in the 
unprecedented 12day duel iraq claimed to have hurled 71 
longrange missiles into tehran and two other cities and iran said 
it fired 29 missiles at iraqi cities 
the barrage ended friday afternoon after iraq fired eight 
rockets at tehran and three at the holy city of qom the last one 
just 16 minutes before the 4 pm truce deadline 
iraq had made its right to fire the last shot a precondition for 
the truce on grounds that iran the aggressive party had 
triggered the exchange 
iraqs terms for the ceasefire also stipulated that tehran not 
attempt to launch a ground offensive against any iraqi population 
centers 
it did not bar either side from continuing to attack military or 
economically strategic targets 
ali ahani director general of european and american affairs of 
irans foreign ministry speaking in the hague netherlands said 
iran will unleash a new battlefront offensive against iraq in 
response to the missile attacks 
we are going to give a decisive response in the war of the 
fronts because of this bloodshed he said refusing to provide 
specifics on the offensive 
baghdads officially controlled press called the ceasefire a 
triumph and warned iran against resuming the bombardment ina said 
althawra voice of iraqs ruling arab baath socialist party 
said the missile war taught the charlatans of iran a painful 
bitter lesson it said any iranian violation of the 
ceasefire would for sure generate a devastating iraqi reply 
iraq had vowed to disrupt oil exports by which iran finances its 
share of the 7yearold war the attacks concentrate on irans 
governmentowned or chartered tankers that shuttle oil from kharg 
island in the northern gulf to centers in safer waters near the 
strait of hormuz 
iraq broke a threeweek lull in the tanker war on wednesday 
when its warplanes struck the 41195ton malteseflag tanker 
tenacity 
baghdad reported another attack on friday which like the one it 
claimed on saturday could not be confirmed 
the iranians retaliate for iraqi raids with attacks on neutral 
commercial shipping although gulf radio monitors say iranian 
gunboats were actively challenging ships in the southern gulf in 
recent days there have been no attacks since feb 11 
indications arose of a new potential threat to shipping in the 
southern gulf where iran was reported by us military sources to 
be building launch pads for its chinesemade silkworm antiship 
missiles on abu musa a tiny island used as a base by irans 
revolutionary guards 
the washingtonbased sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said american intelligence had detected no sign of 
actual missiles being installed 
positioning the weapons which have a range of 50 miles on abu 
musa would extend the socalled silkworm envelope by about 100 
miles into the gulf embracing the busy united arab emirates cities 
of dubai sharjah and ras alkhaimah

syria on saturday rejected an american 
proposal for an arabisraeli peace settlement submitted last week 
to arab and israeli leaders by secretary of state george p shultz 
syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa also said he did not 
believe any other arab leader would support the plan 
we have studied the american proposal and we think the plan 
as presented to us is not acceptable we also believe that it is 
not acceptable to any other arab side sharaa told reporters 
the palestine liberation organization and israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir also have rejected the plan shamirs rival in the 
coalition government foreign minister shimon peres supports the 
plan 
sharaa spoke at damascus airport after seeing off his swedish 
counterpart sten andersson andersson left for home after a 
24hour visit and talks with president hafez assad and sharaa on 
the arabisraeli conflict 
sharaas statement was the first outright syrian rejection of 
the plan which shultz submitted to assad during a visit to 
damascus march 4 
shultz handed copies of the proposal to king hussein of jordan 
shamir peres and egyptian president hosni mubarak 
the proposal aimed primarily at halting violence that has raged 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip since dec 8 called for 
limited selfrule for 15 million palestinians living under israeli 
occupation 
it also called for the formation of a joint 
jordanianpalestinian delegation to negotiate a permanent 
settlement in the west bank and gaza under an international peace 
conference to convene by may 1 
at a later parley other arabisraeli conflicts including the 
future of the syrian golan heights occcupied by israel in the 1967 
war would be discussed 
shultz had asked that the leaders concerned respond to his 
proposal within 10 days 
the syrian president speaking at a rally on tuesday had 
indicated he rejected the plan saying israel did not want peace 
and that the arabs have no alternative but to keep up the fight 
against the jewish state 
but he did not openly reject the plan 
earlier last week assad discussed the proposal with hussein 
the jordanian monarch during a meeting in damascus 
sharaa said we hope the american adminstration would come up 
with a much clearer proposal leaving the door open for 
additional ussyrian consultations 
sharaa said syria would not accept any settlement that is not 
based on the termination of israels occupation and recognition 
of palestinian rights to selfdetermination and the establishment 
of a state

conservative judaism on saturday offered its 
first comprehensive definition of principles declaring its faith 
is linked to israel but not bound to it 
both israel and the diaspora the countries to which the jews 
have been dispersed are partners to aid and enrich the other in 
every possible way the 23000word statement said each needs 
the other 
however jewish identity was termed essentially a matter of 
religion rather than geography 
our religion has been landcentered but never landbound 
the document said it has been a portable religion so that 
despite our long exile from our spiritual homeland we have been 
able to survive creatively and spiritually we do not believe 
that jewish identity can be replaced by israeli identity or the 
ability to speak hebrew we are convinced that jewish religion is 
essential as a source of ethical and moral values the authors 
said 
some jews have viewed the jewish state as the religious center 
of world jewry the statement said adding that various jewish 
communities have complementary roles in maintaining judaism 
the statement emet veemunah hebrew for truth and 
faith was drawn up over 2 years by a 35member commission of 
scholars rabbis and laity set up in 1985 
never before in its history has the centuryold conservative 
movement in this country produced such an overall summation of 
convictions 
officials of the rabbinical assembly the rabbinical arm of 
conservative judaism and its jewish theological seminary hailed 
the document as monumental and historic 
it provides a consensus view of the movements positions on 
personal and general questions affecting jewish life said the 
commission chairman seminary professor robert gordis 
he termed it a way of life for the jew today to live in 
loyalty to the tradition without resigning from the 20th century 
conservative judaism is the middle ground between the other two 
major branches reform which freely adapts jewish practices to 
changing times and orthodoxy which sees ritual as commanded by 
god and thus unchangeable 
conservatisms statement deals with god revelation evil the 
messianic hope jewish law personal practices the role of women 
israel social justice relations with other faiths and meaning of 
chosen people 
the widely misunderstood chosen people concept often has 
been distorted into an expression of moral arrogance despite 
counterefforts the statement said 
instead of implying any innate jewish superiority gods 
choosing of the jews to reveal his purposes laid on them special 
obligations and duties as a result of their accepting that role 
far from being a license for special privilege it entailed 
additional responsibilities not only toward god but to their fellow 
human beings the statement said 
often however they had to pay a bloody price for insisting 
on this role enabling them to identify with the prophet isaiahs 
suffering servant who accepted the blows and contempt of others 
in order to bring the truth of god to the world 
the statement deplored the rifts that have developed among 
different branches of judaism and urged work to overcome them 
declaring 
in the face of unflagging enemies and widespread 
antisemitism jewish unity is more vital than ever only when 
jews live in harmony and peace with each other will we be 
worthy of messianic redemption 
regarding israel the statement voiced deep attachment to the 
land and pride in the achievement of the modern state in gathering 
jews from dispersion and rebuilding a nation 
however the states discrimination against the conservative and 
reform movements is morally intolerable the statement said 
the writers said israel should recognize religious authority of 
all rabbis not just the orthodox adding we have often suffered 
from discriminatory policies but we remain firm and loving 
supporters of the state of israel 
israels jews and their fellows living in the diaspora have 
sustained the creative survival of am yisrael the jewish 
people interacting in a continual symbiotic process of mutual 
enrichment the statement said 
and conservative judaism offered this selfdescription 
the conservative movement affirms that the jewish religion as 
reflected in the jewish way of life constitutes the most 
significant factor that identifies distinguishes unites and 
preserves the jewish people

joe redington couldnt run in the first 
iditarod trail sled dog race in 1973 because he was too busy 
organizing the 1100mile marathon from anchorage to nome 
he missed out again in 1983 when a runin with an angry moose 
during training left him with a few cracked ribs 
but redington now 70 has run in every other iditarod a 
torturous test of people and dogs billed as the last great 
race and as this years race approached the midpoint near the 
frozen yukon river redington was savoring the lead in a contest he 
has never won 
redington who has finished as high as fifth three times 
grabbed the lead tuesday at rohn 271 miles from the start and 
held it until saturday when he slipped into second place at the 
yukon river town of galena 452 miles from the finish 
i feel like an old fox being chased by 50 young hounds he 
said 
redington earned the title father of the iditarod 16 years 
ago when he spearheaded a movement to get alaskans off snowmobiles 
and back behind the dog teams that traditionally had provided 
winter transportation across the vast state 
to galvanize the mushing revival he promoted an idea that many 
thought impossible a race along the old iditarod trail a supply 
route used earlier this century to reach interior alaska gold 
mining districts 
in 1925 dog teams relayed diphtheria serum along the trail to 
the epidemicstricken community of nome on norton sound 
using that historic relay for inspiration 36 wary mushers set 
out from anchorage in march 1973 for the next month the dog teams 
struggled up into the glacierribbed alaska range dropped into the 
timbered interior mushed down the frozen yukon then crossed over 
to the windblown bering sea coast for a final limp into nome 
it was a macho event full of the alaska mystique and the men 
who finished no women raced until 1975 were instant heroes in 
alaska 
today the race still bursts with a frontier aura rugged 
mushers and their teams of 12 to 20 eager dogs brave blizzards 
wild animals frostbite and 1000 miles of sledbusting trail 
but its not quite so macho anymore 
since 1985 when libby riddles ventured into a howling gale and 
left the men behind women have dominated the race 
riddles won that race and susan butcher has won the last two 
setting a course record each time last march she finished in 11 
days 2 hours about half the time it took in 1973 
the fastest competitors have become mushing machines backed by 
corporate sponsors and driving hightech plastic sleds they shave 
hours from their race times by going without sleep for days the 
winner this year will get 30000 the next 19 finishers will share 
the rest of the 150000 purse 
but even some of the leaders refuse to take things too seriously 
duane dewey halverson a perennial contender remembers the 
days when many mushers regarded the iditarod as an extended camping 
trip 
i think the competition is a little stiffer than it used to 
be he said in mcgrath while his dogs rested on straw laid down 
in the snow 
well make it and have fun and see where we finish and ill 
get one of those little teeny trophies this year 
then he grinned and pronounced his own philosophy of racing dogs 
across the alaska wilds 
im going to have fun if it kills me

the government on saturday 
banned a churchled opposition group headed by archbishop desmond 
tutu and said it was a threat to public safety 
minister of law and order adriaan vlok said the recently created 
committee for the defense of democracy was barred from performing 
any activities or acts whatsoever 
police meanwhile issued a separate order banning a sunday 
rally in cape town that was to mark national detainees day 
tutu who heads the committee for the defense of democracy and 
who planned to attend the rally said clergymen instead would hold 
a church service at st georges cathedral in cape town similar 
church services are scheduled in four other cities 
we are dealing with a vicious government that will not 
tolerate any opposition to its evil and immoral policies tutu 
told a news conference they have banned a committee even before 
it has started operating 
tutus group was set up following the governments feb 24 
crackdown on blackled opposition groups in that crackdown the 
government banned 18 antiapartheid organizations from 
participating in politics 
the committee for the defense of democracy is led by several 
church leaders including tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace 
prize and allan boesak president of the world alliance of 
reformed churches the clergymen said the group would attempt to 
take over some the activities previously carried out by the 
restricted organizations 
however vloks latest order places the same restrictions on 
tutus group as the other antiapartheid groups 
certain clergy are becoming more and more involved in 
preaching revolution instead of the true christian message vlok 
said in a statement 
vlok accused church leaders of promoting the aims of the 
outlawed african national congress which wages a bombing and 
sabotage campaign in a bid to overthrow the whiteled government 
he cited a march 1 broadcast by ancs radio freedom which called 
for the church in south africa to take a more active role in 
opposing the government 
the anc is currently waging a desperate attempt to extend the 
revolutionary onslaught and is aiming this attack more and more at 
the churches and the whites vlok said 
the church should direct itself to the spiritual area and 
the government can rely on its prayers to solve the difficult 
political problems in the country vlok added 
tutus group helped arrange sunday rallies at five sites across 
the country to mark national detainees day however police 
saturday banned the cape town ceremony where tutu and boesak were 
to appear 
police spokesman lj haasbroek said he had no information on 
the status of the four remaining rallies 
clergymen indicated earlier this week they may defy any attempt 
by authorities to stop them 
saturdays clampdown is the latest in a series of tough 
government actions aimed at political opponents in recent weeks in 
addition to banning political activity by 18 groups the government 
has imposed restrictions on individual activists and introduced 
legislation to prohibit foreign funding of political activity 
in a related development the black sash an antiapartheid 
group made up of white women estimated saturday that 1500 
activists remain in detention without charge 
black sash which has not been directly affected by the recent 
crackdowns said it would continue to defend those who are 
voiceless and incarcerated 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained without charge for 
varying lengths of time during the 21monthold state of emergency 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

survivors of gov evan mechams 
administration have come forward at his impeachment trial with 
tales of the chaotic final days when mistrust bred mistrust and 
mecham believed his enemies were spying on him with laser beams 
a reluctant defense witness electronics technician antonio 
corio told how he was sent to the governors offices in november 
to check the security system and do a sweep to detect 
electronic bugs and laser beam listening devices 
they had feelings there were leaks corio said 
information was getting out of the ninth floor somehow 
he said he was reminded that mecham was publicly embarrassed by 
reports that he thought laser beam listening devices were being 
used to spy on him the governors office was seeking proof 
what did you detect asked mecham defense attorney fred 
craft 
not a whole lot corio said to the lawyers surprise 
the technician who had been called to bolster the claim of 
bugging refused to cooperate once he was on the stand he said he 
knew about laser beam listening devices but they have to be used 
at close range 
could you detect sounds in the governors office if you were 
on the capitol grounds asked craft 
i dont think so said corio 
as to who might be using such a device the governor had a prime 
suspect attorney general robert corbin corbin said the only 
laser he ever had was a toy he got for christmas 
mecham 63 the first us governor to face an impeachment trial 
in six decades is charged with obstructing an investigation by 
corbin into an alleged death threat against former mecham aide 
donna carlson by another mecham associate lee watkins 
in other impeachment charges the firstterm republican governor 
is accused of concealing a 350000 campaign loan and misusing 
80000 in a state fund by loaning it to his auto dealership the 
arizona senate is considering the obstruction charge first 
mecham faces a criminal trial april 21 on the loan charge and a 
recall election may 17 
the antagonism between mecham and corbin surfaced as witnesses 
from mechams inner circle tried to explain why mecham faced with 
a probe by corbin into the alleged death threat would have told 
the states top lawman col ralph milstead the attorney general 
is out to hang me dont tell the attorney general anything 
former mecham aide sam steiger described a feud between corbin 
and mecham that began in the first days of mechams term when 
corbin advised the governor to eliminate the states martin luther 
king holiday for state employees he said it had been illegally 
declared by gov bruce babbitt mechams predecessor 
the governor abided by that decision and took an inordinate 
public beating over it steiger recalled i thought the beating 
should have been shared but he said corbin never announced it 
was his idea 
steiger acknowledged under crossexamination that i would be 
less than candid if i were to say the governor was a supporter of 
the martin luther king holiday 
mechams other perceived enemy was the news media and steiger 
suggested this led to his downfall 
he was a man who won election essentially without the press 
and the republican party he said he learned he could be 
elected without them what he forgot was he couldnt survive 
without them 
in the final months before mecham was impeached by the house of 
representatives on feb 5 close aides such as ms carlson resigned 
in protest of mechams policies peggy griffith mechams chief of 
womens services said she and ms carlson friends for many years 
stopped speaking 
mistrust bred mistrust said steiger 
you would agree that the mecham inner circle was paranoid 
prosecutor paul eckstein asked steiger 
no i would not agree with that said steiger who suggested 
that concern about electronic bugs and traitors on the staff were 
realistic 
the final staff split with mecham was over watkins in charge of 
prison construction said several witnesses staffers almost 
unanimously favored dismissal of the unpopular watkins even before 
he was accused of making a death threat on ms carlson then a 
grand jury witness against mecham 
with people telling him mr watkins should go he is the kind 
of person that would dig in his heels and absent a compelling 
reason would defend mr watkins steiger said of mecham 
ms carlson also said she was told by mechams chief of staff 
jim colter we have to take care of lee he raised a lot of money 
for the campaign

by allowing robert c mcfarlane to plead 
guilty to four misdemeanor counts independent counsel lawrence e 
walsh virtually secured a major prosecution witness if other 
players in the irancontra affair go to trial 
mcfarlanes promise of full cooperation as part of the plea 
agreement is a prize for walsh the former national security 
adviser was among the inner circle of reagan administration aides 
who masterminded the irancontra scheme 
walsh said mcfarlanes cooperation would solve the technical 
problem of joinder legal experts said this means walsh could 
have live testimony from a crucial player instead of having to 
build his case around documents 
mcfarlane who was national security adviser from october 1983 
through november 1985 initiated the review of us arms policy 
toward iran after leaving the white house he remained a key 
policymaker leading an unsuccessful armsforhostages mission to 
tehran in may 1986 
his guilty plea focused on his role in secret us assistance to 
the nicaraguan contras at a time congress had banned such aid 
he admitted that he withheld information about the activities of 
lt col oliver l north and other members of the national security 
council staff in three 1985 letters to house committees 
he also admitted withholding information from the house foreign 
affairs committee when he told the panel on dec 8 1986 that he 
was unaware of any efforts to solicit donations for the contras 
from a third country 
although walsh and mcfarlane agreed that the cooperation was 
voluntary the independent counsel acknowledged mcfarlane could 
have faced much more serious perjury charges if he was 
uncooperative 
each of the misdemeanor counts of withholding information 
carries a maximum one year prison term by contrast felony perjury 
charges carry a maximum of five years in prison and larger fines 
also could be levied 
walsh said mcfarlanes cooperation wasnt the only reason he 
went the misdemeanor route 
he cited mcfarlanes undisguised demonstration of remorse 
after the false testimony was given in which he tried to correct 
his testimony and actually imposed injury upon himself in a fit of 
depression a reference to mcfarlanes attempted suicide via an 
overdose of valium last year 
while admitting his guilt mcfarlane told reporters he acted at 
a time that relations between congress and the white house broke 
down so tragically 
my actions were motivated by what i believed to be in the 
foreign policy interest of the united states he said 
mcfarlanes comments were reminiscent of remarks by former cia 
director richard helms on oct 31 1977 when he pleaded no contest 
to two misdemeanor charges under the same law used by walsh 
the charges against helms arose from his testimony to the senate 
foreign relations committee that the cia had made no attempt to 
prevent the election of marxist salvador allende as president of 
chile in 1970 
i found myself in a position of conflict said helms i 
had sworn by my oath to preserve certain secrets i didnt want 
to lie i didnt want to mislead the senate i was simply trying to 
find my way through a very difficult situation in which i found 
myself

a monthly magazine has published the first half of 
an unfinished memoir by late poet konstantin m simonov in which he 
explores the shame felt by soviets like himself who aided the 
repressions of dictator josef v stalin 
simonov began the memoir in 1979 but died in 1980 before he 
could finish it 
he wrote the book for the archives and told his secretary 
that he did not expect to see the memoir published in his lifetime 
explained an accompanying publishers note in the march issue of 
znamya a literary journal 
articles and books reexamining the legacy of stalin have been 
appearing regularly over the past year as soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs campaign for glasnost or openness encourages broader 
discussion of social and historical problems 
the memoir through the eyes of a person of my generation 
attempts to explain without excusing the behavior of those who 
grew to regard stalins excesses as a normal state of affairs 
referring to his acceptance of the arrest and exile of three 
aunts in the 1930s simonov wrote four decades later that such 
events which seem monstrous and impossible today were then a 
norm and gradually became habitual 
he wrote that the rationale he adopted at the time was you 
cant make an omelette without breaking eggs 
simonov who was twice honored with the stalin prize for 
literature and earned numerous other accolades during his writing 
career was one of the many literary figures who followed the 
governments lead in denouncing poet anna akhmatova writer mikhail 
zoshchenko and others in a 1946 purge of the intelligentsia 
he referred to the role he played in ruining the careers of 
contemporaries only as the events of 1946 acknowledging that 
his readers would know what he meant 
simonov had confessed to sinning against his conscience in 
denouncing respected writers and artists in the way of atonement 
he championed the suppressed works of writer mikhail bulgakov and 
eventually succeeded in getting published his masterpiece the 
master and margarita 
the weekly newspaper moscow news published a commentary on the 
simonov memoir observing that simonov was trying to explain why it 
is possible for many russians to feel both awe for stalins 
accomplishments and revulsion over his purges 
the second half of the unfinished memoir is to be published in 
april edition of znamya the journal said

chrysler corps failed attempt to quietly sell 
off a fifth of the company before its united auto workers contract 
expired has created a fracture in labor relations that the two 
sides hope can be healed at the bargaining table 
the no 3 automaker once planned to use the months before its 
threeyear uaw contract expires sept 14 to rid itself of most 
parts operations by selling its 28000worker acustar inc 
subsidiary 
under that plan chrysler could have evaded restrictions on 
closing plants or shifting inside work to outside suppliers that 
already are in place at ford motor co and general motors corp 
under the established uaw pattern contracts for the auto industry 
instead chrysler found itself with a work force whose anger 
exploded over the possible sale and remains largely unappeased by 
chryslers retreat in the face of a threat of crippling 
plantbyplant strikes 
theres still a lot of hard feelings and the central issue is 
still not settled said uaw local 412 president jim jensen whose 
local represents engineers and other salaried chrysler workers in 
the detroit area 
rather than allow the anger to simmer and build during the three 
or four crucial months before contract talks open hurting chances 
of a settlement and continued quality production chrysler asked 
for early negotiations 
its always important to resolve issues that are 
outstanding said chryslers chief negotiator human resources 
vice president anthony st john weve had some convergence of 
issues that have been very difficult for the union and for 
chrysler 
the uaw agreed last week marking the third time in the last 10 
years that the two will bargain early once before in 1982 the 
early talks failed but this time neither side can easily afford a 
failure at the table 
chrysler and the union are betting that in the talks which 
could begin as early as next month and will cover 59500 workers 
theyll be able to fix the problem rather than make it worse 
but difficult issues remain beginning with acustar in 
announcing its retreat from the sale chrysler said it would 
instead close four acustar plants affecting 2000 workers if it 
cant sell them in 18 months 
we as a union are not prepared to just give up and say there 
goes 2000 jobs said jensen who will be one of 10 elected 
members of the unions bargaining team 
st john however said last week that the fate of the plants is 
not up for negotiation 
jensen and other workers also say they expect chrysler to seek a 
twotier wage system paying parts workers lower wages and 
benefits than assembly workers because it has shown it considers 
the parts operation too expensive 
the uaw sidelined similar attempts by ford and general motors 
last fall when it negotiated new threeyear contracts with 
chryslers larger rivals 
given the enormous reaction to acustar chryslers ability to 
institute twotier wages in this round of negotiations would be 
very low said harley shaiken labor and technology expert at the 
university of california at san diego 
uaw president owen bieber said the union will demand a twoyear 
contract so that in 1990 the gm ford and chrysler contracts will 
expire together for the first time since 1979 
bargaining with the big three together makes it easier for the 
union to impose one contract on all and gives it a third choice 
when it is choosing a strike target the company whose contract 
serves as the pattern for the others 
st john said chrysler finds advantages in remaining out of 
synch with gm and ford chrysler sought a separate relationship 
with the union beginning in 1979 when workers made the first of 
many concessions to help the automaker survive

for the first time in 21 years former 
black panther johnny spain is out of jail but the man convicted of 
slaying two prison guards in the bloody 1971 san quentin six 
escape attempt is not yet a free man 
release of the onetime prison revolutionary has been opposed 
consistently by the state but his parole has been urged by 
enthusiastic supporters including dennis riordan his attorney for 
the past 12 years two congressmen and two prison guards one the 
best friend of one of the slain san quentin officers 
while in prison spain 38 earned a high school diploma became 
an electrician and has been a model prisoner in recent years he 
has had no disciplinary action against him since 1979 when he was 
caught with marijuana 
he left the california medical facility in vacaville last week 
after a series of court actions allowed friends and relatives to 
post 350000 bail for his freedom 
i wont let anyone down who has supported me and there have 
been many who supported me he promised upon his release adding 
that he expected life outside prison to be difficult ill deal 
with it im prepared ive thought about it a lot 
however spain still faces a new trial on the prison murders and 
a monday hearing at which the state will argue against the order 
calling for that trial a 21 state board of prison terms decision 
to parole spain next year also will be reviewed by the entire 
ninemember board march 11 
spain had been behind bars continuously since his arrest at the 
age of 17 in december 1966 for the firstdegree murder and robbery 
of a los angeles man 
while on bail authorities said spain will live in san francisco 
and work as an electrician he also will be allowed to travel 
around the state and visit his wife and childhood sweetheart 
pinkey whom he married in 1977 while in prison they have two sons 
it was a twisting courtroom trail that finally opened spains 
cell door 
us district judge thelton henderson overturned the san quentin 
murder conviction in 1986 saying spain had been deprived of his 
right to a fair trial by being shackled in 25 pounds of chains in 
every court appearance in the case 
but spain still had to remain behind bars because of the 1966 
murder conviction 
but tuesday los angeles superior court judge kathleen parker 
ordered spain paroled immediately for the 1966 murderrobbery 
parker said he was eligible for release because the state board of 
prison terms improperly extended his sentence six years by applying 
regulations passed in 1976 to disciplinary violations committed in 
1970 and 1971 
that action cleared the way for bail to be set in the san 
quentin retrial 
during a trial that took almost five years spain was convicted 
of murdering two san quentin guards in a bloodbath that left one 
other guard prison militant george jackson and two prisoners dead 
prison authorities said spain was seen bolting from the 
maximumsecurity unit with jackson and helped plot the unsuccessful 
escape attempt 
although no one said spain actually killed guards jere graham 
and frank deleon he was found culpable under state law because he 
had conspired to escape with jackson 
bullets hidden in hollow bars of soap and a map reportedly 
showing escape routes were found afterward in his cell in a section 
reserved for death row and problem inmates 
spain and jackson a black panther leader and author of the 
book soledad brothers had become friends while incarcerated 
together at soledad state prison before both were transfered to san 
quentin 
spain had a troubled childhood in jackson miss his mother was 
a white woman married to a white man but as spain grew up it 
became increasingly clear that his biological father was a black 
man not his mothers husband segregated black schools refused to 
accept him as did white schools 
his mother sent him at the age of 6 to live with a black couple 
in east los angeles he became a high school athlete but also 
joined a street gang and committed minor crimes that netted him a 
stint in a juvenile facility before the 1966 robberymurder

a vatican official said saturday that permission 
from cubas communist government to send 20 foreign priests to cuba 
was a sign of improving relations between the roman catholic church 
and that caribbean nation 
however monsignor carlos manuel de cespedes director of the 
vaticans secretariat of the episcopal conference told vatican 
radio that the church hopes for still more improvement in the area 
of individual rights 
he said the church would like to see more religious freedom in 
cuba and the construction of new churches 
he said there has not been sensational changes in the rapport 
between the church and state between catholics and marxists but 
nevertheless things are moving and i would like to say they are 
moving in the right way 
de cespedes said examples of change were the government allowing 
the cuban church to import 30000 bibles last year and permission 
last week for the church to send 20 foreign priests to cuba 
vatican radio said there are 406 cuban priests to serve the 
predominantly catholic population of about 10 million 
it said most of the 20 foreign priests that will go to cuba are 
spanish or italian but there also will be one mexican and one 
canadian 
rebels led by fidel castro ousted the fulgencio batista 
dictatorsyip in 1959 and in december 1961 castro declared cuba 
would be a marxistleninist state

as the presidential campaign moved from the 
south to illinois associated press bureaus in the super tuesday 
states surveyed officials reactions to their innovative regional 
primary here is a report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
if the goal was to beat iowa the wednesday morning quarterbacks 
agreed the south had a winner in its super tuesday regional 
presidential primary election experiment 
many officials in the 20 voting states were elated to have real 
live presidential candidates trooping through but some felt they 
could have attracted more attention with a less crowded primary 
super tuesday did what i thought it would do said georgia 
secretary of state max cleland it has meant sudden death to most 
candidates and sudden life to a few 
jim hunt former governor of north carolina thought super 
tuesday proved its worth his candidate sen albert gore of 
tennessee gained the stature he needed after ignoring earlier 
contests in both iowa and new hampshire 
but although gore did well he had to share the victory with two 
liberals massachusetts gov michael dukakis and jesse jackson 
each won about a third of the states and delegates 
alabama republican party chairman emory folmar called that a 
defeat for southern leaders who had hoped super tuesday would give 
the edge to a moderate or conservative 
it blew up in their faces folmar said 
but the democratic finish combined with vice president george 
bushs 161 sweep of tuesdays primaries and caucuses turned the 
iowa caucus results on their head there rep richard gephardt was 
the democratic winner while sen robert dole and pat robertson 
both beat bush 
presidential candidates may approach the race differently as 
the result of super tuesday it could be they will no longer 
consider iowa a must stop said us rep tom tauke riowa 
gores strategy has revealed that the new hampshire primary 
doesnt control how the democratic nominee will be selected said 
oklahoma attorney general robert henry 
however joe grandmaison new hampshires democratic party 
chief said super tuesday proved the value and singularity of 
his states firstinthenation primary new hampshires brand of 
retail politics forces the candidates to face the voters and debate 
the issues he said 
many democrats in the south and some republicans were pleased 
with the outcome 
we wanted to nationalize our message and we accomplished 
that compare the rhetoric between 1984 and 1988 it was far less 
damaging this year than four years ago said former gov charles 
robb of virginia a democrat who endorsed gore and promoted the 
super tuesday idea 
before this year all the presidential candidates did in the 
south was change planes in the atlanta airport said former 
tennessee gov lamar alexander a republican 
we just felt for years like the candidates were ignoring us to 
go to iowa and new hampshire weve had more presidential 
candidates in texas already this time than weve had in the whole 
past 10 years said former texas state sen john traeger 
us sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said super tuesday forced 
candidates to address locally important issues such as low oil 
prices but he thought the calendar was too crowded with 14 
southern and border states plus six other states and american 
samoa holding primaries or caucuses 
id rather texas be out by itself i wish we could figure out 
some way to get it ahead of iowa bentsen said 
wallace hyde a democratic fundraiser from asheville nc and 
cochairman of gores state campaign was happier 
it worked almost on the money he said you definitely 
came out of it with a moderately conservative candidate 
however texas state sen chet edwards said super tuesday was 
not conceived as a way to elect some neanderthal anglo 
southerner 
it was designed to give 16 million texans and citizens 
throughout the south a voice in the selection of our president and 
a voice in the setting of our national agenda he said 
john weaver executive director of the texas gop thought 
democrats hoping for a conservative must be disappointed 
im sure the people who hoped the democrats would nominate 
sen sam nunn or chuck robb would rather put this primary in a 
burlap bag and drop it in the colorado river weaver said 
judgeexecutive jerry taylor of whitley county ky called 
super tuesday the biggest farce there ever was 
unless you have something locally as a drawing card its just 
difficult to get people involved said taylor a democrat 
turnout in kentucky was 244 percent for democrats and 221 
percent for republicans 
most states did better georgia had a 40 percent turnout 
overall a record for a presidential primary in that state and a 
gop turnout which doubled the previous mark 
mississippis republicans had a record turnout 31 percent of 
the total vote in a traditionally democratic state in fact it 
was double what weve had before in a republican primary said 
evelyn mcphail executive director of the mississippi gop 
in texas a presidential primary record 277 million voters 
participated or 35 percent 
in tennessee and north carolina officials said the turnout was 
about the same as in previous nonsuper primaries 
in maryland the democratic turnout of 38 percent compared to 34 
percent four years ago when walter mondale was all but unopposed 
and 48 percent in 1976 when jimmy carter ran against former 
calfiornia gov jerry brown 
maryland gov william donald schaefer a democrat called the 
march 8 primary a waste of time that drew only token appearances by 
the candidates 
mr bush made a telephone call to one of the baltimore radio 
stations schaefer said i would hope we would go back to may 
when the candidate would have to come through and talk to the 
people 
maryland also held its congressional primaries march 8 and gop 
chairman dan fleming said the early primary made it impossible to 
find a candidate to oppose rep tom mcmillen even though the 
firstterm democrat won by only 428 votes in 1986 in a historically 
republican district 
people arent used to thinking about the election until the 
first of the year here we had a filing deadline that was in 
december for a march primary said schaefer 
in massachusetts republican and democratic leaders agreed they 
would not want to compete with a southern primary again 
joe malone executive director of the republican state committee 
in massachusetts also complained that a big oneday contest gives 
an advantage to candidates with money and organization 
once you get into what is the closest thing to a national 
primary then you better have a lot of ammunition malone said

with excitement in his hands rather than 
voice alfred sonnenstrahl expressed in candid joyful words the 
sense of triumph shared by fellow protesters who made themselves 
heard on the quietest college campus in america 
ive been on this campus for 30 years now he said in sign 
language and for the first time in my whole life i feel good 
about being here for the first time i feel like a complete 
person 
the 52yearold mechanical engineer a doctoral candidate at 
gallaudet university pointed to the students staff and faculty 
who had shut down the school for the deaf last week to protest the 
appointment of a hearing president 
look around sonnenstrahl signed you see people smiling 
they look alive 
the transformation of gallaudet occurred even before elisabeth 
ann zinser who is not deaf and does not know sign language gave 
in to mounting pressure for a deaf president and stepped down only 
days after she was chosen 
there was no mistaking the exhilaration in the brisk air more 
than a generation after the civil rights movement began the time 
for the deaf was finally now 
even zinser acknowledged the strength of the movement in a news 
conference the day she resigned 
the protest she said was a very special moment in time for 
the deaf community that we could not anticipate 
twenty years ago blacks devastated by martin luther king jrs 
murder looted and burned a major commercial strip that is only now 
being rebuilt four blocks away behind its tall fence gallaudet 
lay isolated and hidden under a thick blanket of silence 
only in the last few years with civil rights laws 
communications technology and a wave of professional interpreters 
has that silence begun to lift deaf people say they are more aware 
of their rights more selfconfident and more assertive thus the 
stage was set for last weeks eruption 
the campus crusade drew headlines and nightline the 
attention of congressmen and presidential candidates the support 
of commuters and taxi drivers and contributors across the country 
the largess of local corporations who donated food paint and 50 
sheets with which to make banners 
the protesters liken themselves to prisoners or slaves and the 
blacks of south africa nothing they say will ever be the same 
we have been accepting bowing down for 124 years maybe 
longer said student leader jerry covell we want to take 
control of our lives and our futures 
president lincoln chartered the school 124 years ago it later 
was named after thomas hopkins gallaudet a pioneer in deaf 
education the nations only liberal arts school for the deaf it 
is described again and again as an intellectual mecca its 
presidency the loftiest post to which a deaf person could aspire 
so its not hard to understand the resentment created by the 
appointment of a hearing nonsigning president particularly when 
there were two deaf finalists for the job including the 
universitys own dean of arts and sciences 
deaf people own businesses we have deaf lawyers and deaf 
dentists we have deaf stockbrokers and deaf millionaires the only 
thing weve never had is a deaf president of this college said 
angel ramos 38 a math professor and doctoral candidate at 
gallaudet well never be telephone operators but theres no 
reason we cannot have a deaf president here 
the gallaudet presidency was last open in 1983 and the board of 
trustees chose jerry lee another hearing person but one who knew 
sign language and who had been part of the campus community for 
several years 
there was no uprising then nor in 1969 when edward merrill 
began his 14year tenure as president students did complain that 
he didnt know sign language and they asked him to learn now they 
want far more 
we were never given opportunities to manage schools before 
1980 said john kubis 62 a math professor at gallaudet since 
1957 in 1983 there were a few qualified deaf candidates but 
they only had a few years of administrative experience now we have 
deaf people who are as much if not more experienced as dr zinser 
deaf people have been slowly emerging from their isolation since 
the rehabilitation act of 1973 which barred discrimination against 
the handicapped in federally funded programs or activities 
the process has been speeded by a proliferation of professional 
impartial interpreters during the early days interpreters were 
very few and far between kubis said they talked down to the 
deaf instead of being our tools to communicate they would tell us 
what they thought we should say and censor the dialogue 
the deaf community was ripe for rebellion for other reasons as 
well the advent of closed captioning on television telephone 
access through telecommunications devices for the deaf and 
computers through which deaf people can communicate with anyone 
protesters claimed only a partial victory when zinser withdrew 
friday they say a deaf president has yet to be named they also 
want a majority of deaf people on the 20member board of trustees 
that runs the university now only four members are deaf 
but the demonstrators said events at gallaudet had already 
brought irrevocable changes 
theres no way things will ever be the same again said 
ramos a protest leader deaf people throughout the world have 
finally learned what other minority groups have learned that if 
you stick together and walk together you will succeed finally 
after 124 years the deaf community has taken charge of their own 
destiny and were mighty proud of it

two months into the trial of lyndon larouche comes 
evidence supporting the political extremists claim that he was the 
target of plots by the fbi the cia and even lt col oliver north 
now even some defense lawyers who had dismissed larouches 
allegations of a conspiracy theory as one of his many bizarre 
claims are taking notice larouche has also said britains queen 
elizabeth condones drug trafficking and that one way to help the 
us economy is to populate mars 
the trial of larouche six aides and five of his political 
organizations on fraud and conspiracy charges was halted friday so 
that defense attorneys could search government files including 
those of the white house and vice president george bush for any 
evidence suggesting infiltration of larouche groups 
prosecutors have insisted that talk of fbi cia and other 
government infiltration in recently declassified documents is just 
that talk and that the subject is irrelevant to charges that 
larouche and followers conspired to stymie a grand jury 
investigation into alleged fraud by fundraisers during his 1984 
presidential campaign 
but at least for now larouche has turned the tables on the 
government which has been ordered to search thousands of files 
belonging to the fbi cia the national security council and bush 
assistant us attorney john markham on monday is to update us 
district judge robert e keeton on the status of the search the 
judge will decide whether to resume testimony tuesday or wait until 
the search is completed 
larouche lawyers last week received a copy of a memo from 
retired air force maj gen richard secord to north two principals 
in the irancontra affair in which secord says retired army sgt 
major fred lewis had met with the fbi and other agency reps and 
has collected info against larouche 
the defense then demanded fbi files mentioning lewis after 
first refusing to do so the fbi declassified parts of a document 
in which lewis and two texas lawmen who had worked as government 
informants say the fbi and cia asked them to infiltrate larouche 
groups 
lewis and the lawmen were involved in two texas companies 
reportedly used by the pentagon and cia for covert activities 
markham insists they are lying about infiltrating larouche groups 
but the mere existence of the fbi document and the secordnorth 
memo discovered months after markham had said searches of 
government records were complete was enough to persuade the judge 
to halt testimony and order new searches 
it also was enough to convert michael reilly attorney for 
larouches central political organization the national caucus of 
labor committees reilly had told the jury in his opening statement 
that larouches infiltration claim was misguided paranoia 
this is a fundamental change in my defense strategy reilly 
said i should have had this 18 months ago and i have a right to 
have it before i pursue this case 
another defense attorney william moffitt says his legal 
strategy may be affected by the document searches 
in his opening statement markham referred to an entry in a 
notebook seized from moffitts client larouche aide jeffrey 
steinberg as evidence larouche and aides conspired to obstruct the 
grand jury investigation 
the aug 23 1986 entry is attributed to ryan quade emerson 
who at the time had recently returned to the larouche organization 
five days earlier according to documents recently surrendered to 
defense lawyers an fbi agent interviewed emerson and asked him to 
rejoin the larouche organization 
the prosecutors task will be to convince keeton that references 
to fbi and cia infiltration of larouche groups are unsubstantiated 
and irrelevant to the case 
the defense lawyers who concede the material may not be 
directly relevant say it nevertheless supports their argument that 
larouche and his followers are longtime government targets and 
victims of entrapment 
ironically larouche missed the week of his trial he would have 
enjoyed the most with court permission he went to west germany 
for cataract surgery last week and is not expected back for several 
weeks

several lawmakers have criticized a group of 
congressional aides for meeting secretly with palestinian leader 
yasser arafat in january only weeks after congress voted to close 
palestine liberation organization offices in the united states 
the secret twohour meeting which took place in baghdad iraq 
became publicly known last week it was arranged by the national 
council on usarab relations the group that paid for the 
congressional aides eightday trip to iraq on jan 1119 
the meeting described as an open exchange between arafat and 
the aides was held shortly after congress passed controversial 
legislation shutting down two plo offices in the united states on 
the grounds they represent a terrorist organization arafat is head 
of the plo 
it was very foolish very wrong rep larry smith dfla 
said of the aides meeting he arafat is not going to change 
his positions because a capitol hill staffer meets with him 
rep robert g torricelli dnj said he was upset when he 
learned an aide attended the baghdad meeting with arafat 
she acted independently and i had no knowledge of this 
meeting nor would i have approved it and i remain very disturbed 
about it the staffer no longer works for torricelli but left 
for personal reasons unrelated to the meeting 
but another lawmaker was unfazed by his aides attendance at the 
meeting 
rep edward feighan dohio said his assistant was not on any 
official trip and he was traveling in a personal capacity 
michael van dusen staff director of the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on europe and the middle east said seeing arafat was 
extremely unwise when as a matter of law american officials are 
not supposed to negotiate with the plo i wouldnt do it 
us policy set by congress prohibits officials in the 
executive branch from negotiating with arafat or members of the plo 
until the group recognizes israels right to exist 
the policy does not apply to congress and a few lawmakers as 
well as members of their staff have met openly with arafat in the 
past 
while the congressional group did not violate the law members 
of congress and key staff people on capitol hill said that in view 
of us policy it was unwise to hold discussions with arafat 
particularly if a lawmaker had not authorized the talks 
ronald w cathell the executive director of usarab council 
said he would not release the names of the staffers who attended 
the arafat meeting or traveled to iraq for fear they would be 
subjected to reprisals for going to the meeting 
the council which seeks to promote understanding between 
americans and arabs receives its money from grants and private and 
corporate contributions 
several staffers contacted about the meeting refused to talk 
about it and would not provide the names of their companions 
people with knowledge of the free trip confirmed that those who 
went to iraq worked for sens mark hatfield rore john heinz 
rpa j bennett johnston dla david karnes rneb and reps 
feighan torricelli helen bentley rmd douglas bereuter 
rneb william clay dmo james inhofe rokla and robert 
lagomarsino rcalif 
bereuters spokeswoman carol lawrence said the congressmans 
aide resigned before the trip but now works at the pentagon 
a state department official speaking on condition on anonymity 
said all but one of the staffers on the iraq trip went to the 
meeting with arafat 
cathell said the original agenda did not include seeing arafat 
once the group arrived in baghdad the council learned the plo 
leader was in town and broached the possibility of a meeting with 
the congressional aides 
the staffers were never pressured to attend the meeting which 
cathell said was designed to give them information they could 
relate to their bosses the staffers were told its totally up 
to you he said 
one aide speaking on condition of anonymity said the group was 
given less than an hours notice that a facetoface meeting with 
arafat had been fixed 
torricelli complained the us embassy in baghdad failed to 
advise his aide about us policy prohibiting official negotiations 
with the plo cathell said the embassy simply told the group its 
own people couldnt attend the meeting because of us policy 
but a state department official refusing to be identified by 
name said the us ambassador had tried to dissuade the americans 
from meeting with arafat 
cathell said the meeting was constructive and gave the staffers 
a unique chance to find out firsthand where the palestinian 
stood the aides he said were candid and forthright with 
arafat 
the baghdad meeting came a few months after congress voted to 
close both the plos office at the united nations in new york and 
a palestine information office in washington 
lawmakers took the action which has provoked widespread 
criticism from civil libertarians and un members on the grounds 
that the plo supports terrorism 
rep george w crockett jr dmich has introduced legislation 
to repeal the closings

federal investigators have concluded their 
fourday hearing into the cause of a continental jet crash that 
killed 28 people but their findings probably wont be released 
until sometime around the accidents first anniversary in november 
we have not eliminated any issue in the suspected cause of 
the nov 15 crash of flight 1713 board of inquiry chairman joseph 
t nall said friday after investigators heard the final testimony 
in the national transportation safety board hearings 
flight 1713 bound for boise idaho began rocking violently 
moments after taking off from stapleton international airport 
during a snowstorm it flipped over on its back and crashed on the 
runway breaking into three pieces 
fiftyfour of the 82 people on board survived some of those 
survivors were among the 33 witnesses who testified at the hearing 
the ntsb investigators were looking into flight characteristics 
of the dc910 aircraft especially in snow and ice conditions air 
traffic control cold weather operations by continental 
turbulence and continentals pilot training pilot selection and 
crew pairing 
i anticipate our board will determine a probable cause and 
contributing causes to the crash by november nall said 
the pilot and copilot capt frank zvonek 43 and first 
officer lee bruecher 26 both were killed in the crash bruecher 
was at the controls 
the brief flying time in the dc9 by both pilots has been one 
area of study by the investigation 
zvonek had 12135 total hours flying time with 33 hours as a 
dc9 captain bruecher had a total of 3186 hours with 12 hours as 
a dc9 first officer 
at fridays hearings richard hillman continental vice 
president for flight operations said that since the crash the 
carrier had adopted a federal aviation administration bulletin 
recommendation that the copilot not be allowed to make takeoffs or 
landings until he or she had 100 hours in that type of aircraft 
the hearings also delved into continentals use of a flight 
simulator in pilot training that is based on the dc930 a 
different model of dc9 from the dash 10 flown by zvonek and 
bruecher 
the main difference between the two dc9 models is the dash 
30 has wing slats to improve the wings lift the dash 10 is an 
older model with a wing design considered more susceptiable to loss 
of lift from ice buildup 
james e madsen continentals assistant chief dc9 pilot at 
denver minimized handling difference between the dash 10 and dash 
30s in his testimony 
a dc9 is a dc9 there are some differences they pilots 
should be aware of madsen said 
early theories of what caused flight 1713 to roll violently and 
crash seconds after liftoff included ice buildup on the wings 
turbulence from a jumbo jet that had just landed on a parallel 
runway 1600 feet away and pilot error 
continentals deicing procedures at stapleton also came under 
scrutiny flight 1713 waited between 24 and 27 minutes for takeoff 
after it had been deiced 
survivors offered conflicting testimony on the amount of snow 
and ice buildup on the wings 
i wondered at one point is that ice but i decided it was 
just wet said dr fred helpenstall of nampa idaho who suffered 
broken ribs in the crash 
airman greg wadsworth of mountain home air force base in idaho 
said he had a clear view of the wing before takeoff 
it was like the snow was starting to pile up on the wings i 
was very concerned but i said it under my breath he testified 
other testimony attributed flight 1713s delay between deicing 
and takeoff on miscommunciation in the control tower and between 
the tower and aircraft 
ntsb investigators refused to speculate on any of the suspected 
causes 
our minds are still open we will make no final conclusion 
until the time we make our final report nall said

hundreds of palestinian policemen in the 
occupied territories resigned saturday to protest israeli treatment 
of palestinians prompting fears that other arab employees of the 
government also would quit 
israel radio said close to 450 of the roughly 1000 arab police 
officers in the occupied west bank and gaza strip have quit their 
jobs in the past two days and more resignations are expected 
israeli and palestinian officials said at least 330 had resigned 
and the resignations would take effect monday 
israeli bullets and beatings have killed 87 palestinians in 
antioccupation unrest since dec 8 
the resignations began friday one day after underground leaders 
of the disturbances in the occupied territories called on the arab 
policemen to resign immediately some officers reported that their 
lives had been threatened 
israeli warplanes meanwhile struck at guerrilla targets east 
of the port town of sidon in southern lebanon the army command 
said 
israel television reported that at least eight people were 
killed in the air raid israels second this year against 
palestinian targets in south lebanon sidon police said at least 
one guerrilla was killed and eight were wounded 
in the west bank israeli soldiers shot and seriously wounded a 
palestinian from the village of bani naim near hebron after he 
threw a hand grenade at them the army command said the grenade 
did not explode 
at nur elshams near tulkarem a 50yearold woman was wounded 
when prison service employees opened fire after their bus was 
stoned 
thousands of israeli peace now demonstrators gathered in tel 
aviv to urge prime minister yitzhak shamir to support a us peace 
initiative that would allow limited selfrule for the arabs in the 
occupied lands 
peace now organizers estimated the crowd at 100000 a reporter 
for the daily yediot ahronot put the figure at 70000 police 
refused to give an estimate 
israels rightwing factions have called for a 
counterdemonstration in the same place on sunday evening a few 
hours before shamir leaves for a visit to washington to discuss the 
plan 
the continuing unrest in the occupied territories appears to be 
putting a severe strain on israels defense forces 
the weekend edition of yediot ahronot the countrys largest 
newspaper carried at least four ads offering securityrelated jobs 
one ad sought recruits for a new police antiterror unit 
another asked for arabspeaking officers holding the rank of 
captain or major for special work involving contact with the 
local population 
other ads offered jobs to arabic language translators along 
israels northern border and civilian guards to protect the 
israeliegyptian border 
the mass resignation of palestinian police officers will add a 
new strain and could be the harbinger of larger and more serious 
defections to come 
bethlehem mayor elias freij said the mass resignations will 
vastly affect the process of the courts in the west bank and it is 
a precedent for many more civil servants to resign 
about 18000 palestinians work for the military government in 
the west bank and gaza strip 
national police spokesman adi gonen warned that the resignations 
would hurt the palestinians themselves 
the arab police were not used for intelligence purposes to 
put down protests or for anything political said gonen if 
they quit we will have to reduce police activities and that will 
affect the quality of palestinian life 
last week 40 arab tax collectors in the gaza strip left their 
jobs after palestinian protesters threatened their lives 
the resignations indicated the growing loss of control by israel 
over the occupied territories and deprived it of a potent symbol of 
cooperation and coexistence with the palestinians 
a survey by the associated press indicated that most of the 250 
policemen in the southern part of the west bank have handed in 
their resignations 
arab police at the ramallah station said all 50 policemen were 
quitting freij said that all 50 policemen in his district had 
resigned the arabrun palestine press service put the figure in 
hebron at at least 68 
mordechai bareket police spokesman for the southern section of 
the occupied west bank said over 100 policemen handed in their 
resignations over the past two days 
israel radio reported that 100 policemen in gaza and 30 in the 
northern district of the west bank also said they were leaving the 
force 
police spokesmen said they were trying to persuade the 
palestinian police officers to change their minds 
we are talking to each one of them individually and looking 
into each of their problems said chaim alter commander of the 
northern west bank police district 
the order to resign was issued thursday by the national united 
command of the uprising 
mustafa adani who resigned friday said his life had been 
threatened twice 
earlier this week a policeman from the aqbat jaber refugee camp 
near jericho was killed

the company that operates the federally owned 
fernald uraniumprocessing plant violates its own regulations and 
puts its workers health at risk a new government report concludes 
the report says the us department of energy which owns the 
plant and westinghouse materials co of ohio the private 
contractor that runs it should work harder to eliminate potential 
worker health hazards at the facilitys feed materials production 
center 
the 37yearold plant 18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
processes uranium for use in the governments nuclear weapons 
the national institute for occupational safety and health part 
of the us department of health and human services issued the 
preliminary report last week on the basis of a december inspection 
conducted at the request of labor unions at the plant 
its final report is not due out for three more months but 
westinghouse says it has already responded to the institutes 
findings by making some rule changes at the plant 
the report said plant employees sometimes leave portable 
airbreathing equipment lying out in areas containing loose and 
radioactively contaminated dust which could get into the 
respirators and ultimately into workers lungs 
given the fact that many surfaces in the plants where we made 
measurements are radiologically contaminated it is imperative that 
workers store their respirators in a clean location when not in 
use this practice should prevent inadvertent ingestion of 
radiationcontaminated materials wrote the industrial hygienists 
who prepared the report 
many surfaces in the plant are contaminated with radioactive 
substances from the plants years of service and require cleanup 
the federal hygienists said 
they said they found westinghouse technicians who violated 
company regulations and created a potential health hazard by 
smoking eating and drinking while handling and counting 
radiological samples 
surely such a practice needs to stop immediately the 
investigators wrote 
they also urged improving workplace ventilation in some areas of 
the plant and they recommended that the department of energy 
improve its supervision of worker health and safety by assigning a 
health physicist to the plant 
the investigators lauded westinghouse however for improving 
worker health and safety since taking over operation of the plant 
in january 1986 from the previous contractor national lead of ohio 
westinghouse spokesman pete kelley said the report made no major 
criticisms of his company 
westinghouse has responded to the federal report by banning 
smoking eating and drinking in the radiological sampling area 
kelley said leaving respirators in potentially contaminated areas 
is a violation of westinghouse policies he added 
the spokesman also noted that westinghouse has increased the 
staff of health physicists since it took over the plants operation

a car with a device stored in the trunk 
containing mildly radioactive material was stolen and the thieves 
could be harmed if they tampered with the devide federal officials 
said saturday 
the car which was stolen thursday night had a measuring device 
containing cesium137 and americium241 said karl abraham a 
spokesman for the nuclear regulatory commission in philadelphia 
abraham said the material was inside a 30inchhigh yellow 
plastic case bearing a radioactive label and a federal 
department of transportation sticker 
its perfectly safe to pick up and carry the case around 
abraham said the radioactive sources are not all that powerful 
the substances were part of a moisture density gauge that 
measures the compaction and moisture content of materials used in 
constructing roads abraham said the car is owned by an employee 
of soils engineering services co in whippany 
a person would have to tamper with it and take the radioactive 
sources out of a safe container and carry them in ones hands for 
several hours before there would be the possibility of radioactive 
injuries said abraham

sen paul simon facing the pivotal battle of his 
presidential campaign accused democratic rival michael dukakis on 
saturday of trying to buy the illinois primary with tv commericials 
the simon campaign already cashpoor also was buffeted by the 
results of a new poll showing the illinois senators support 
slipping in his home state just three days before the election 
he also lost key newspaper endorsements to dukakis in the 
chicago suntimes and to tennessee sen albert gore jr in the 
chicago tribune 
still simon pressed on enlisting three congressional allies 
from industrial states with pending primaries to push his theme 
that the postsuper tuesday campaign marked the start of a second 
phase in the nominating process 
simon attacked the massachusetts governor for a new television 
advertising assault that simons campaign views as a swipe at their 
candidate 
you ought to win an election not buy an election simon 
said at a news conference at de paul university 
the dukakis ads do not name simon but criticize his strategy of 
remaining in the race until the democratic convention in july in 
hopes of being the consensus candidate in a brokered nomination 
simon said he will not respond with his own television 
commercials 
whatever decision the people of illinois make i urge that you 
not sell your heritage for a 30second commercial simon said 
the question illinois voters must ask themselves is not who has 
the slick commercials but who can best represent us in the 
presidency 
us rep stephen solarz campaigning for simon in chicago said 
the illinois primary would be either the political equivalent of 
custers last stand or the battle of gettysburg for simon 
i trust and hope that for paul simon the illinois primary on 
tuesday will be the political equivalent of the battle of 
gettysburg marking the turning point in the campaign leading to 
his ultimate nomination at the democratic convention solarz 
dny said 
but the sunday editions of the chicago tribune brought bad news 
for the simon campaign simon shrugged off the papers endorsement 
of gore but the poll results showed further erosion in his support 
among registered democratic voters 
in the poll of 501 democrats 35 percent supported simon 30 
percent favored illinois other favorite son jesse jackson and 18 
percent liked dukakis 
the results made the race essentially a dead heat between simon 
and jackson because the poll conducted march 9 and 10 has an 
error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points

workers at a nuclear power plant were set afire saturday night two 
days after the government said construction could resume there the

compound of the montalto di castro nuclear plant and were owned by 
the central nuclear consortium which is building the facility 50 
miles north of rome 
strong socialist party opposition to resuming construction at 
the plant was one factor that led to the resignation of christian 
democrat premier giovanni goria friday night 
goria leader of the coalition government since august resigned 
twice before the last time in february but agreed to stay on to 
help pass the national budget the budget was passed thursday and 
goria had been expected to resign next week politicial leaders 
said he decided to quit immediately because of the controversy over 
construction at the plant here

plant last november after voters in a nonbinding referendum 
expressed their disapproval of nuclear power facilities 
on thursday the government said construction could resume at the 
plant which already has cost italy 5 billion

the sandinista government announced 
saturday it has formally agreed to hold the first ceasefire talks 
inside nicaragua with rebel leaders 
it said the talks will be held march 2123 in the southern 
frontier post of sapoa 90 miles south of managua 
president daniel ortega ordered local civilian and military 
authorities in the area to lend all facilities to the delegation 
of the counterrevolution to enter and leave the country freely at 
the pena blanca border crossing according to a statement issued by 
his office 
the statement said the government would assume all 
responsibility for the security of the rebel delegation during the 
negotiations and crossborder traffic would not be affected 
adolfo calero the top political leader of the nicaraguan 
resistance is expected to head the delegation from the rebels 
known as contras nicaraguan resistance is an umbrella organization 
of rebel group 
ortega previously announced that his brother defense minister 
humberto ortega would lead the government delegation 
the sapoa meeting also will be the first between the two sides 
without a mediator 
calero told the associated press recently that the sapoa talks 
would take place with an open agenda he said joao baena 
soares secretary general of the organization of american states 
and roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo would attend as 
witnesses 
obando y bravo the archbishop of managua mediated previous 
talks held in the dominican republic and guatemala 
calero said a representative of nicaraguas internal opposition 
also would be invited to attend a contra representative in miami 
who spoke with the condition he not be identified told ap saturday 
the nicaraguan resistance still was insisting that a domestic 
opponent of the sandinistas be present at the talks as an observer 
ortegas statement did not mention that demand 
both sides had tentatively agreed to meet in sapoa for three 
days of direct negotiations beginning march 9 ortega canceled that 
schedule after the rebels said they would not attend without 
preliminary discussions 
ortega dismissed obando y bravo as mediator on march 2 after the 
cardinal proposed an agenda that included discussion of internal 
politics 
the contras previously had insisted on the presence of obando y 
bravo a frequent critic of the leftwing government 
contra spokesmen also insisted ortegas government agree to 
discuss the political points outlined by obando y bravo during the 
last ceasefire talks held feb 18 in guatemala 
the cardinals plan would have required the sandinistas to grant 
amnesty to political prisoners restore full press freedom open 
talks with internal opposition political parties and review the 
military draft law 
the sandinistas have refused to discuss internal political 
issues with the contras saying the only purpose of the talks is to 
work out a ceasefire in accordance with the regional peace plan 
signed aug 7 by the presidents of the five central american 
countries 
roger guevara secretary of the nicaraguan democratic 
coordinate a coalition of opposition political parties and 
business and labor groups said his organization would send a 
representative to the talks but as a participant not as an 
observer 
in a broadcast over the rebels radio liberacion guevara said 
in spite of the fact there does not exist an official invitation 
the coordinate is ready to assist in this reunion 
obando y bravo told local reporters saturday he was willing to 
attend as a witness i would like these talks to advance so that 
they redound to the benefit of the nicaraguan people he said

kansas sen bob dole saying the issues 
are more important than the odds went on television for 30 
minutes saturday in an effort to reverse the decline in his 
presidential prospects 
standing in front of a portrait of abraham lincoln dole said 
i know im the underdog in this race the issues are more 
important than the odds i didnt expect this job to be handed 
to me in the first place 
dole spoke from alumni hall at knox college which was the site 
of the fifth of the seven debates in 1858 between lincoln and 
stephen douglas during their campaign for the senate doles 
address was televised in illinois 
vice president george bush who has refused to respond to a dole 
challenge for a oneonone debate before the illinois primary on 
tuesday was the featured speaker at a dinner on the campus shortly 
after the dole program aired 
dole spoke as a new survey said bush was the choice of 62 
percent of likely republican primary voters only 28 percent named 
dole as their choice 
it just seems to me we should have had a debate said dole 
my opponent is less than 100 yards away as i speak 
actually bush was not scheduled to arrive until after dole left 
nothing has ever come easy for bob said his wife 
elizabeth his only inheritance was the love of his parents 
ladies and gentlemen youre going to be voting tuesday and we 
want you to know more about bob doles life she said 
introducing a 14minute segment from a biographical sketch filmed 
for showing to dole campaign meetings 
but her remarks were never seen by wgn viewers because of a 
technical problem that cut off the live picture for about two to 
three minutes said raymond kirk the master controller for the tv 
station 
the station froze the last live shot of dole and kept it on the 
screen while viewers also heard his voice 
then the station switched to the biographical sketch bypassing 
mrs doles introduction the program concluded without further 
problems 
a poll published in the sunday edition of the chicago tribune 
said the vice president was the choice of 62 percent of republicans 
likely to vote in tuesdays primary dole was named by 28 percent 
and pat robertson by 6 percent 
the survey of 504 likely gop voters was conducted wednesday and 
thursday 
during campaign appearances on friday dole conceded he was 
hanging by our fingernails 
the senator who took a drubbing on super tuesday this past 
week losing 16 of 16 primaries to bush needed a victory in 
illinois to maintain any faint hope that he can stage a comeback in 
the presidential race 
bush campaigning in northwest chicago suburbs predicted 
saturday that victory in the illinois primary election tuesday 
would cinch the republican nomination for him 
the vice president preached gop unity and all but ignored dole 
and robertson 
i want to be your president bush said to a cheering crowd 
at st viator high school i do not want to do it by tearing some 
other republican by weakening the party that needs to be 
together 
the latest associated press delegate count gave bush 705 and 
dole 163 a total of 1139 delegate votes would be needed at the 
gop convention in new orleans next august to win the presidential 
nomination 
larry mccarthy communications director for the dole campaign 
said 100000 was spent to purchase one halfhour on chicago 
television station wgn and additional time slots sunday and monday 
on other stations around the state he said the amount also covered 
the production costs 
campaign manager william e brock said the broadcast would be 
repeated sunday on other stations around the state 
brock also said that contrary to earlier statements from 
campaign officials other dole commercials were running in illinois 
earlier in the week the campaign had said that all commercials 
in a total buy of 500000 had been pulled off the air 
brock said some were pulled off but others biographical spots 
portraying dole as a strong leader were continuing to run he 
said some commercials were dropped when it was decided to use part 
of the media budget for the half hour program 
we need to somehow capture the attention of the illinois 
voters said dole who has repeatedly challenged bush to a 
oneonone debate the vice president brushed off the challenge 
saying he already has participated in seven debates and called them 
cruel and unusual punishment 
the only encouragement dole could get from the tribune poll was 
the response when republicans were asked if they agreed with the 
statement that it was important for the republicans that bob dole 
does well in illinois so that the republican presidential campaign 
continues a total of 56 percent said they agreed while 30 
percent said they disagreed 
other findings strongly favored bush 
when people were asked which candidate they considered tough 
a strong leader 45 percent named bush and 32 percent dole

the repressive campaign against campesinos those who fly the 
helicopters and planes the diplomats marines of the us embassy 
and the demagogues who design electoral campaigns

for the school for the deaf just days after massive student 
protests prompted the hearing person chosen for that post to resign 
students at the nations only liberal arts school for the deaf 
said saturday they hoped the meeting will bring about their demand 
for the nations first deaf university president

protests after elisabeth a zinser who can hear and does not know 
sign language was appointed by the board last sunday over two 
deaf candidates 
faced with student outrage zinser stepped down early friday 
my decision to resign was reached with great difficulty as i came 
to understand how deeply some see the social stature of deaf 
persons reflected in the presidency of this university she said 
in a statement 
the two deaf candidates who were bypassed last week are being 
reconsidered for the position they are harvey j corson 44 
superintendent of the louisiana school for the deaf in baton rouge 
and a gallaudet board member and i king jordan 45 dean of 
gallaudets college of arts and sciences both are gallaudet 
graduates 
students in the deaf president now committee last night asked 
for mediation with the board to resolve the students demands 
that a deaf president be appointed from the two finalists 
that board chairwoman jane bassett spilman resign from the board of 
trustees effective immediately that the bylaws of the board of 
trustees be amended to reflect a majority of deaf voting members 
to be achieved within a specific period of time and that no 
reprisals be taken at any time against any student faculty or 
staff member of gallaudet university 
gallaudet has never had a deaf president in its 124year 
history the college was founded by congress in 1864 and became a 
university by an act of congress in 1986

romare bearden a preeminent american artist 
whose collages fashioned stories about the dignity of black people 
and southern living died saturday he was 75 
bearden died about 1 am at new york hospital of complications 
from bone cancer diagnosed two years ago and a stroke suffered 
last month said his manager of 13 years june kelly 
works by bearden who was awarded the national medal of arts by 
president reagan last june fetched prices at sothebys up to 
56000 among the highest prices paid for works by black artists 
in the united states 
beardens work ranged from political cartoons published in 1934 
to water colors and eventually the collages he had oneman shows 
at the museum of modern art and several top galleries 
he was a lover of jazz who did sets and costumes for the alvin 
ailey dance theater and murals for the baltimore and pittsburgh 
transit systems 
i think certainly that hes one of the great masters of the 
20th century especially over the last 40 years said lowery 
sims associate curator of 20th century art at the metropolitan 
museum of art 
sims said beardens work in collages raised it to such a fine 
art its hard to think of any other artist who is so closely 
associated with that medium 
sims who compared his use of form and color to that of henri 
matisse said beardens work had an unparalleled ability to 
provide us with a heroic depiction of even the most mundane aspects 
of american black life 
i think that he was trying to make us conscious of the 
richness of part of the black heritage we wouldnt think ordinarily 
of sims said i think he made us aware that we are a very 
important part of american culture 
in the book the art of romare bearden by john a williams 
bearden said i work out of a response and need to redefine the 
image of man in the terms of the negro experience i know best 
ralph ellison author of invisible man and a friend from the 
1930s said that in the artists work restlessness was not 
frivolous it was the discovery of the self of the paintings of 
the design 
bearden who was born in charlotte nc grew up in harlem and 
in pittsburgh he attended boston university and new york 
university majoring in mathematics and planning to become a 
doctor he started drawing in college and cartoons published in the 
afro american a weekly led to his career in art 
he gained prominence in the 1940s after his work was included in 
a show by black artists in washington in 1943 
he is survived by his wife nanette a memorial service was 
being planned for later in the month

a major brush fire that destroyed tens of 
thousands of acres of west texas prairie land appeared under 
control late saturday afternoon officials said 
for parts of friday and saturday the fire seriously threatened 
the towns of albany and moran in shackelford county and baird in 
northern callahan county but three tanker airplanes helped contain 
it by dropping fireretardant chemicals 
at least 265000 acres were burned and officials said the dry 
windy weather continued to pose a danger that the fire could 
rekindle 
sam logan public information officer for the texas forest 
service said the grass fires that ravaged much of shackelford 
county and parts of callahan and throckmorton counties since 
thursday were under control and the forest service was beginning 
its mopup operation 
thatll take about two days logan said but he added 
well continue to keep an eye on it because with the strong 
winds and low humidity just a spark could start it up all over 
again 
most of the fires appeared to be interior ones that appear 
likely to burn themselves out where they were officials said 
weve pretty well got fire guards around the complete fire 
tonight were going to just more or less be running a patrol and 
mopup operation said baird fire chief pat mckennon we will 
have forest service crews out and some local fire units out just 
more or less patrolling 
national guardsmen and other military personnel used heavy 
equipment such as bulldozer and scrapers to build fire breaks 
the idea is to get the grass down real short so that if a fire 
jumps a street it doesnt ignite said airman 1st class william 
cross from dyess air force base in abilene 
the fire killed livestock burned trailer homes and oilfield 
equipment and closed roads across parts of an area 60 miles long 
and 25 miles wide officials said 
about 265000 acres of rangeland had burned in shackelford 
county alone or roughly half the county said joe fox of the texas 
forest service albany a town of about 2500 is the county seat 
smaller acreages were burned in the other two affected counties 
officials said 
at a 3000acre ranch south of albany workers moved about 100 
head of cattle away from the blaze while a us forest service 
crew with three bulldozers fought flames earlier saturday that 
had rekindled in a pasture 
it looks worse at night because thats when you can see the 
flames during the day the smoke covers everything said wanda 
sims a partowner of the dyersims ranch the night before last 
it looked like hot lava moving down the hills 
volunteer firefighter phillip rodriguez said he and hundreds of 
other workers stopped the flames just inside the city limits of 
baird a town of about 1700 people about 7 am saturday 
when it was dark all you could see was orange rolling down 
the hills said rodriguez 
smoke is drifting across baird it is like we are having a big 
wienie roast out here said callahan county sheriffs officer jan 
davis 
some homes were evacuated friday night in the hannersville 
section of baird and authorities set up a command post but no 
dwellings were lost in the community 21 miles east of abilene said 
ms davis residents returned to their homes saturday 
but in albany 25 miles north the fire consumed trailers and 
oilfield equipment and its relentless march eastward earlier in 
the day saturday fanned by strong winds had worried authorities 
theres plenty of damage to rangeland oilfield equipment 
including storage tanks and some trailer houses said albany 
mayor wayne hogan we are still trying to get it under wraps 
after three days but it seems to be under better control than this 
time yesterday 
but if the wind changes which it can do real sudden were in 
trouble again he said 
in moran a town of about 340 people 16 miles southeast of 
albany morris snyder jr gazed with neighbors through a smoky haze 
at a long bluff a few miles away pointing toward a line of flames 
this is the worst anyone living here has seen he had said 
before the situation was reported under control its the worst 
anyone can remember 
federal officials at the request of texas emergency management 
officials approved aid to help reimburse the state for expenses in 
fighting the blaze which began thursday from a trash fire 
murry fly a spokesman for the texas forest service in lufkin 
said crews arriving from around the state gave tired forest service 
crews volunteers and national guardsmen the chance to rest 
numerous firefighters among hundreds battling the blaze have 
suffered injuries from smoke inhalation and minor burns said tom 
millwee of the division of emergncy management 
an aircraft tanker containing 2000 gallons of fire retardant 
chemical arrived saturday from the us forest service in fort 
smith ark said millwee 
we are trying to survey the burned area from the air because 
you still cant drive through most of it said hogan the albany 
mayor we lit backfires last night to protect rural houses just 
west of the city limits to stop the flames advancing from the west 
and northwest 
elsewhere another range fire in val verde county about 300 
miles to the southwest consumed about 60000 acres before it was 
brought under control 
mike scott a spokesman with the governors office of emergency 
management said saturday night that national guard troops sent to 
the area had been released 
there is still apparently some fires down there but its 
minor scott said

jesse jackson easily won the democratic precinct caucuses 
saturday in his native south carolina while sen bob dole went on 
illinois television for a halfhour plea for republican votes in a 
state where he said he is the underdog 
jackson took a commanding lead in the caucuses and maintained a 
better than 21 margin over the uncommitted who represented the 
secondlargest bloc of delegates being elected to county 
conventions in south carolina 
with 78 percent of the precincts reporting jackson was winning 
53 percent of the delegates to the county conventions while the 
uncommitted trailed with 20 percent tennessee sen albert gore was 
in third place with 19 percent and other candidates were far behind 
dole who spoke while standing before a portrait of abraham 
lincoln on the site where lincoln and stephen douglas held one of 
their famous debates told illinois voters i know im the 
underdog in this race 
the issues are more important than the odds dole said i 
didnt expect this job to be handed to me in the first place 
the kansas senator who earlier acknowledged that his 
presidential campaign is hanging by our fingernails invested 
100000 in the broadcast in an attempt to stop the momentum of gop 
frontrunner vice president george bush 
a chicago tribune poll published in sunday editions said bush 
was far ahead of dole while homestate sen paul simon was leading 
the democratic field followed closely by jackson 
the newspaper also endorsed gore in the democratic contest 
passing over native simon and jackson who has made illinois his 
adoptive home state 
i dare george bush to debate bob dole dole told a news 
conference in originating his broadcast from knox college in 
galesburg he had picked the time and site to conform to bushs 
appearance at the same location he said 
gore whose success in southern primaries on march 8 catapulted 
him into contention in the democratic race was counting on another 
boost from south carolina 
we have worked very hard in this state and i think we have an 
opportunity to extremely well here gore said during an 
appearance in columbia sc 
but favored to get a majority of the 44 delegates at stake in 
south carolina was jackson a native of greenville 
jackson trailed massachusetts gov dukakis by 58 in the latest 
associated press delegate count strong showings in south carolina 
where he was born and illinois which he now calls home could 
propel jackson into the delegate lead in the democratic race 
appearing at a meeting of the south carolina education 
association jackson said im delighted to be home again you 
taught me you can have somebody in the white house that you 
taught 
rival rep richard gephardt of missouri has the support of 
former govs robert mcnair and richard riley and is a strong 
backer of legislation to limit textile imports an important issue 
in south carolina 
gore said he too supported the legislation 
bush crushed his republican opponents in the south carolina gop 
primary last saturday 
simon was banking on illinois voters in tuesdays primary to 
give their home state senator enough support to keep him in the 
race 
dukakis jackson and gephardt made forays saturday into 
michigan where democrats hold caucuses march 26 
jackson addressed the graduation at michigan state unversity 
recalling the tumult of the civil rights movement and calling on 
graduates to work for more than material wants 
a generation of young americans died sacrificed to keep 
america better and make america strong he said your 
generation must resist the dangerous trend of surrendering to the 
war of the opiate and the war of selfishness and the war of conceit 
and use your strength to take the torch another lap in this great 
struggle 
dukakis visited the 250worker olofsson corp plant which makes 
exotic computercontrolled machines and said the united states 
needs to reinvest in its industrial base 
dukakis seeking michigan union support against stiff 
competition from gephardt and jackson said he plans to target his 
message to working people teachers homemakers and professionals 
in illinois dukakis began airing a new commercial that appeared 
to be a veiled attack on simon who has been saying he thought the 
democratic nominee would be chosen at a brokered convention 
the ad did not name simon but said some people want to return 
to the days when you didnt really pick the presidential nominee 
they say you must turn over the power to them to use at a brokered 
convention on tuesday you can pick the next president mike 
dukakis is running for president in every state in america 
a washington postabc news poll published sunday showed simon 
supported by 39 percent of the 540 likely democratic voters 
interviewed on thursday and friday jackson had 32 percent in the 
poll followed by dukakis with 15 percent gephardt with 5 percent 
and gore with 3 percent the poll has a margin of error of plus or 
minus 7 percentage points 
after campaigning in the citys greektown region on friday 
night dukakis stopped saturday at an italian bakery on the citys 
west side to help bake bread he offered a modest goal for illinois 
if we can get some share of the delegates i think it would be 
great he said 
bush has repeatedly rejected doles debate challenges 
that ploy has been used before he said debates are cruel 
and unusual punishment weve already had seven of them 
republican candidate pat robertson also was in illinois and 
insisted he did not need a victory in the state to remain the race 
it looks strong for me in the west he said if he loses the 
fight for the gop nomination said robertson ill dust myself off 
and be right back in it in 1992 
in the gop race bush has 705 delegates while dole was a 
distant second with 163 robertson has 17 
meanwhile a newsweek poll released saturday showed that bush 
would beat dukakis gore or jackson if the presidential election 
were held today the telephone survey of 755 voters thursday and 
friday had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points 
the poll also indicated that dukakis would beat dole but only by 1 
percentage point within the surveys margin of error dole would 
beat either gore or jackson according to the survey

the reagan administration created a new 
permanent pentagon division to carry out covert paramilitary 
operations after the failure of the 1980 attempt to rescue american 
hostages in iran according to a book to be released in april 
the lack of coordination that led to the failure in desert one 
during the carter administration prompted the new administration to 
establish snow bird to be run by a group of men in the armys new 
special operations division says us news amp world report senior 
editor steven emerson 
the division was created following a decision by the new 
reagan administration to make permanent the counterterrorism 
aviation and specialoperations units assembled for the iran rescue 
mission emerson says in excerpts of his book secret warriors 
inside the covert military operations of the reagan era which 
were printed in this weeks magazine 
among other findings in the book which emerson wrote based what 
he says was a yearlong investigation and hundreds of interviews 
and thousands of documents obtained under the freedom of 
information act 
in 1985 us intelligence identified the precise location of 
the house where five of the six american hostages were being held 
in lebanon identified as building 18 the site was 
reconstructed by us intelligence agents as part of a portable 
minimodel used by us officials to prepare a rescue operation a 
detailed military rescue mission was planned by the pentagons 
counterterrorist units in 1986 but it was scrapped when the 
irancontra affair began to unfold 
us officials negotiated with the palestine liberation 
organization and libyan intermediaries to obtain the hostages 
release according to classified portions of private notebooks of 
marine lt col oliver north a national security council aide who 
was a central figure in the irancontra affair one plan which 
later collapsed called for covert payments of a total of 10 
million to sheik fadlallah the leader of the hezbollah 
organization holding the hostages and hussein massawi the leader 
of the islamic amal militia at us request the plo actually 
transferred some money to fadlallah to get the hostages out but 
nothing happened according to the book 
nsc sources said the man behind the kidnapping of the hostages 
was a shiite named immad mughniye however north said that 
mughniyes wife whose relative was being held in a kuwaiti prison 
for terrorism was running the show ollie said mughniye wasnt 
going to get any sex until his wifes relative was released 
says emerson 
intrapentagon rivalry between counterterrorist organizations 
prevented the pentagon from participating in the search for 
kidnapped cia beirut station chief william buckley who was later 
killed 
over several years emerson says the cia despite laws to the 
contrary exploited the secret pentagon units to carry out covert 
operations in central america to further the cause of the contra 
rebels fighting the sandinista government in nicaragua

burmas top rebel leaders called 
saturday for a political settlement of the 40yearold insurgency 
and greater autonomy for the countrys ethnic minorities 
although the rebels national democratic front operates in a 
region awash in opium and heroin production the leaders denied 
involvement in drug trafficking they have been accused of dealing 
in drugs to finance their war 
democratic front leaders in a meeting with journalists in this 
thaiburmese border town called on the united states and other 
countries to cut support for the regime of president ne win 
chiefs of the coalition of 10 guerrilla organizations claimed 
aircraft provided to ne win by the united states to fight the 
narcotics trade were being used in military operations against the 
insurgents 
coalition chairman saw mah reh said the group wanted to 
present its case to the outside world and counter government 
claims that the insurgency would be crushed within two years 
he called for peace negotiations to be conducted on neutral 
ground with an impartial mediator three countries have expressed 
interest in the mediation role he said but he did not identify 
them or elaborate 
the ndp does not want war and desires to end the civil 
conflict as soon as feasible he said calling for a democratic 
multiparty system to replace ne win who has presided over 
oneparty rule since 1962 
the insurgency began shortly after burma became independent from 
britain in 1948 ethnic minorities said the original british 
concept of a federal union was changed by central government 
leaders 
ethnic minority groups represented saturday were the mon 
kachin wa palaung pao karenni arakanese lahu and shan 
the leaders claimed a rigorous antinarcotics policy had been 
laid down and opium eradication is being pursued 
they said usprovided helicopters were being used to ferry 
troops and ammunition to the battlefield and for medical 
evacuation they also said chemical herbicides provided by the 
united states were causing illness among humans and killing 
livestock 
washington has provided aircraft and herbicides to allow the 
burmese government to spray border areas where opium is grown 
knowledgeable western narcotics sources say that some of the 
rebel groups probably are not involved in narcotics trafficking 
but others are instrumental in the flow of opium that is used to 
produce heroin 
the burmese communist party which also is battling the 
government is regarded by western diplomats as a major drug 
trafficker the democratic front leaders said their ooperations 
with the communists were limited to military matters 
the front claims it has 35000 guerrillas and they control about 
half of the country western military analysts say burma has more 
than 250000 personnel in its military services police forces and 
militias

attorney general edwin meese iii and his 
friend e bob wallach jointly briefed thenisraeli prime minister 
shimon peres in october 1985 about the status of plans for a 1 
billion iraqi pipeline project the washington post said in 
sundays editions 
the newspaper said memos written by wallach and reviewed by the 
post described peres as enthusiastic and intensely interested 
in the project when briefed on it at an israeli embassy reception 
wallach in the memos said he had given up hope of getting 
enough time to brief peres when meese walked up to them and came 
to his rescue according to the post 
wallach said he had been expecting to meet with peres on the 
afternoon of his oct 16 1985 arrival here to discuss the pipeline 
project peres plane however arrived 90 minutes late and peres 
went directly to the reception 
almost 1000 guests were waiting a mob scene wrote 
wallach but he waited for a break and managed to get to peres and 
introduce himself the post said 
he peres literally dragged me off into a corner at that 
moment and began discussing the project intensely wallach said 
but then a crush of people built up led by thenisraeli ambassador 
meir rosenne who wanted peres to meet various members of congress 
at that point wallach said he gave up and peres asked him to wait 
around until after the reception 
fortunately as that time approached my friend wallachs 
usual phrase for meese arrived and there was a threeway 
discussion which took approximately 10 minutes the post quoted 
wallach as saying he peres is very quick and we went right to 
the point and he was agreeable in all respects it wasnt the kind 
of briefing i would have preferred but it seemed to have been 
effective 
wallach said peres later invited him to meet again in new york a 
few days later and wallach said he did so accompanied by a 
staffer from the national security council who had been assigned to 
expedite the pipeline plans and its construction by the bechtel 
group of san francisco 
according to a memo composed by wallach on oct 20 1985 the 
meeting at the israeli embassy here was more of a briefing than 
a chat 
independent counsel james c mckay is investigating meeses role 
in the pipeline maneuvering to determine whether meese might have 
violated any laws in concert with wallach swiss financier bruce 
rappaport or anyone else 
the pipeline was never built

nasa plans to recommend to congress that a 
12 billion governmentowned plant be built to make new booster 
rockets for the space shuttle an idea blasted by a senator from 
utah where the boosters are now constructed by morton thiokol inc 
according to a published report sunday 
i suspect that this is one of those crazy ideas that was 
dreamed up by some empirebuilding bureaucrat sen jake garn 
rutah was quoted by the washington post as saying in this 
current budgetary climate we shouldnt even be considering this 
kind of nonsense 
the plan which calls for a contractor to operate the 
boosterbuilding plant would end morton thiokols monopoly on the 
booster manufacturing the boosters are now built at a plant in 
wasatch utah 
the newspaper cited an unidentified industry source as saying 
that garn has been threatening to hold up space station funding if 
the plan isnt blocked 
thiokol has dominated the solid rocket industry since 1973 when 
it first won the shuttle rocket contract but the plan by the 
national aeronautics and space administration would give other 
firms an opportunity to get into the business 
after the space station this is the biggest initiative weve 
got going said russ bardos director of nasa solid propulsion 
systems whoever wins this will be the biggest rocket 
propellant producer in the country 
the proposal already has aroused the interest of four rival 
companies the post said identifying them as united technologies

illinois democrats 
the dukakis campaign began airing a new advertisement that

in part by simons fading campaign 
some people would like to turn back the clock to go back to 
the days when the voters didnt really pick their presidential

brokered convention but you dont have to do that on tuesday you

the president of the alabama naacp and 
13 other black lawmakers asked a judge friday to dismiss 
trespassing charges stemming from their bid to remove the 
confederate battle flag from the capitol dome 
defense attorneys invoked claims of legislative immunity from 
such misdemeanor charges and said state historians not republican 
gov guy hunt had jurisdiction to order any arrests while the 
capitol is being renovated 
prosecutors did not comment on the defense claims at the brief 
hearing before district judge craig miller who withheld a ruling 
pending the filing of further briefs 
thomas reed a lawmaker and state president of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people vowed for weeks 
to remove the flag on feb 2 after the legislature opened the feat 
would require climbing an 8foot chainlink fence entering the 
locked building climbing an inner stairwell to the white dome and 
taking the banner off a staff 
hunt had said anyone who made such an attempt would be arrested 
minutes after the legislatures opening gavel state police 
pulled down reed and others as they made at least symbolic efforts 
to scale the fence they nevergot near the building and the flag 
still flies atop the capitol dome 
each lawmaker was charged with seconddegree criminal 
trespassing and released from the county jail on 300 bond 
conviction on the misdemeanor count carries a maximum penalty of 
three months in jail and a 500 fine 
defense attorney fred gray said the legislators cannot be 
prosecuted for their attempt to climb the fence because the alabama 
constitution provides immunity from arrest to lawmakers while the 
legislature is in session 
the trespassing charges should be dropped because no entry was 
made and the capitol is public property he said 
gray also told miller that hunt did not have the power to order 
the arrests because the capitol is under the control of the alabama 
historical commission while it is being renovated 
the naacp says the flag is a racist symbol of oppression and 
slavery hunt who has said the legislature must decide whether to 
remove the flag has said many view the banner as a historical 
symbol of the old south 
despite grays arguments hunt is standing by his decision to 
have the lawmakers arrested said his press secretary terry abbott 
our legal research showed that the governor is actually in 
charge of very distinct parts of the capitol abbott said most 
parts of the capitol excluding the floor controlled by the 
legislature did fall to the governor 
in another case friday involving the confederate flag three bus 
drivers in durham nc said they were fired and at least a dozen 
students were sent home after they arrived at school wearing the 
flags 
when some of the chewing juniuor high school students and 
drivers later gathered at a store near the school police set up a 
roadblock but they would not say why 
alesia keith 22 who has driven a school bus for the durham 
county schools for three years said she had the confederate flag 
tucked into her back pocket friday as a show of pride not of 
racism one of the drivers fired was black 
this is southern pride day ms keith said they can take 
my job and my money but they cant take my pride 
schools spokeswoman alisa terry said the students were dismissed 
for the day because their clothing was considered disruptive 
administrators are meeting and will discuss with parents what 
kind of longterm action will be taken she said 
she also said no final decision had been made on the status of 
the three bus drivers although they too were sent home for the 
day

former prime minister pierre elliott trudeau may 
not have had grounds for imposing the war measures act in october 
1970 to deal with quebec separatists according to the diary of a 
late cabinet minister 
the sweeping powers given police by the act led to the arrests 
and detention of more than 460 civilians in quebec only 62 were 
ever charged and 18 were convicted 
trudeau justified his action by saying an insurrection was 
taking place in quebec a predominantly frenchspeaking province 
and police lacked the power to suppress it 
a diary left by former transport minister don jamieson who died 
in 1986 said two days after trudeau acted the cabinet was told 
police had no evidence of an insurrection no firearms ammunition 
or explosives 
portions of the diary were published friday by the toronto 
magazine saturday night 
jamiesons notations marked the first time in 18 years the 
official version of events was questioned by a person who was in 
the government at the time 
trudeau stopped on a street by a reporter and asked about 
jamiesons conclusions said look i dont want to talk to the 
media for gods sake read your history 
the october crisis began when guerrillas of the quebec 
liberation front kidnapped british trade commissioner james cross 
and quebec labor minister pierre laporte cross was freed after two 
months but laporte was killed 
jamieson wrote that in his view trudeau used the war measures 
act to assert federal power not halt an insurrection 
i am satisfied that from the very moment when cross was 
abducted the prime minister saw the incident as an issue on which 
we the liberal party government would stand or fall and through 
which he might very well be able to assert the federal position in 
a dramatic manner jamieson wrote 
truedeau retired in 1984 and an election returned the 
conservative party to take over the federal government 
the separatist movement subsided in quebec after voters rejected 
a 1980 referendum on the issue

at least half of the 600 jobless miners 
who crossed the andes on foot last week to grow coca will be 
relocated by the save the children organization it was announced 
friday 
the miners many with their families arrived in the tropical 
town of chulumani 50 miles east of la paz over the weekend and said 
they would grow coca leaves unless the government provided them 
with jobs 
bruce harris director in bolivia of the westport connbased 
save the children aid program said arrangements have been made for 
at least 300 of the miners and their families to relocate in the 
town of circuata 30 miles east of chulumani where they will be 
encouraged to cultivate coffee citrus plants and bananas 
he said circuata residents have agreed to make land available 
the government will assist with building houses and save the 
children will provide seeds technical assistence and credits 
the humid area around chululmani has been an important cocaleaf 
producing zone for generations a paste is made from the leaves and 
then refined into cocaine 
since 1985 more than 21000 employees in the mining work force 
of 27000 have lost their jobs as the government closed 14 of 21 
governmentowned mines because of the collapse of the tin market 
and deficits by the state mining company

miners with funds provided by the united nations and some european 
governments 
other jobless miners are living in tent cities on the outskirts 
of la paz or have gone to tropical zones to farm coca leaves are a 
major cash product in this impoverished country with a population 
of 64 million 
the reason for our presence in chulumani is very simple we 
are demanding from the government a solution to our problem

all options for finding jobs are closed to us we have nowhere to 
live so we have adopted this political decision

angola is seeking direct talks with 
south africa on peace in southern africa because the united states 
has lost credibility as a mediator angolas industry minister 
pedro de castro vandunem said friday 
he told a news conference in lisbon that his marxist government 
has received signals that some south african officials were 
considering the possibility of direct negotiations 
the minister said angola wanted to talk directly to south africa 
because the united states lost impartiality as mediator in the 
conflict by supplying the angolan rebel movement unita with arms 
and by welcoming guerrilla leader jonas savimbi in washington 
like a head of state 
angola says 9000 south african soldiers are in southern angola 
to support unita the national union for the total independence of 
angola 
unita has fought since 1975 to force angolas government to 
share power 
the soviet union and cuba support the angolan government 
defense minister magnus malan of south africa has said his 
government would consider making a direct deal with moscow on 
ending the war in angola if a nonaligned government was

swedish tv said friday that nonjews 
expelled from the soviet union were issued visas to israel as a way 
of inflating official jewish emigration statistics while getting 
rid of dissidents 
it interviewed baltic dissidents friday who said soviet 
authorities gave them visas to israel when they were expelled even 
though they were not jewish 
swedish television said it knew of 47 cases in past months where 
nonjews were registered as jews in emigration documents and given 
visas to israel 
janis barkans a lithuanian nationalist who served six years in 
a soviet prison and was an activist before being expelled told a 
tv reporter soviet authorities gave him an ultimatum after a 
demonstration in riga last summer 
they told me that either i leave the country or i would go to 
prison again a jewish visa arrived automatically shortly 
afterward he said 
barkans said he was not jewish and had not asked for such a visa 
i met many jews in jail they had been put there only because 
they wanted to emigrate to their historical home country barkans 
said 
the television said at least 32 lithuanians and 15 estonians 
all of them nonjews were expelled on visas to israel several 
came to sweden 
according to statistics from the genevabased intergovernmental 
committe for migration 8011 soviet jews left the communist 
country last year for permanent resettlement abroad about eight 
times the annual rate of the previous five years in 1986 only 943 
jews were allowed to leave 
it was not clear whether nonjews carrying visas for israel were 
included in those statistics

president blaise compaore of burkina 
faso outlined his governments new program friday and made it clear 
that he will give business and foreign interests a warmer welcome 
than his predecessor did 
in a radio broadcast monitored in abidjan compaore said that 
with burkina fasos limited resources the state alone cannot 
pretend to do anything 
compaore led the oct 15 coup in which president thomas sankara 
was killed it was the fifth coup in the poor west african nation 
of 75 million since burkina faso formerly upper volta won 
independence from france in 1960 both men were army captains and 
compaore was a close aide of sankaras 
sankara had antagonized business people and western governments 
and creditors with his policies and statements attacking western 
imperialism 
compaore said friday his government will work with national 
foreign and private sectors an apparent reference to his efforts 
to improve government relations with national trade unions 
commercial interests and foreign neigbors 
the new program published later friday in the official daily 
sidwaya newspaper pledged to continue some economic reforms begun 
under sankara 
the program called for a reinforcement of industrial 
production and the rehabilitation of factories that are underused 
or currently dormant 
the plan pledged to enlarge and reinforce democracy its 
most striking change was abolition of sankaras feared 
revolutionary defense committees in favor of smaller organizations 
with a social and cultural focus the organizations would be 
separate groups of rural peasants blue collar workers youth 
civil servants women and the elderly 
compaore avoided offending elements sympathetic to sankara 
without directly naming sankara he noted his speech borrowed ideas 
from the political program sankara laid out in a 1983 speech made 
shortly after taking power 
compaores foreign relations program was more moderate than the 
radical policies of sankara which criticized frances africa 
policy and its involvement in chad the sankara program troubled 
many of burkina fasos neighbors whose relations with libyan 
leader moammar gadhafi have been strained 
compaore said his program was drawn up after a review of the 
four years of sankaras government he offered no direct criticism 
of sankara and only briefly referred to his seizure of power as a 
rectification process 
compaore also pledged to continue the government crackdown on 
corruption and laziness begun when sankara took power in 1983

the united states has begun testing two 
types of singleuse syringes to help stop the spread of aids and 
hepatitis transmitted by contaminated needles an american official 
said friday 
alan woods administrator of the us agency for international 
development announced the disposible syringe tests at an 
international conference of doctors and health experts 
woods declined to say how much money the united states was 
spending on developing the syringes but he said they could be on 
the market by the end of the year 
unlike other disposible syringes already in use neither of the 
two new types can be reused woods said 
he said they are being tested by the program for appropriate 
technology in health a seattlebased company under contract to 
the government woods did not provide details on the tests at the 
conference on immunization and childrens health 
woods said several other countries also are testing prefilled 
singleuse syringes including france and switzerland 
when they are ready we will have to flood the market with 
these devices said dr william foege director of the task force 
for child survival the conference sponsor 
we will have to find some way of subsidizing the cost to get 
them to developing countries because theyll be too expensive at 
first and well have to find some way to get the old syringes off 
the market said foege former director of the centers for 
disease control in atlanta ga 
contaminated needles are responsible for the spread of a number 
of diseases in developing countries and are a particular threat to 
young children receiving vaccine injections 
needles contaminated with the hiv virus are believed to be a 
major method of transmitting aids or acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome the fatal disease that attacks the bodys immune system 
leaving it vulnerable to cancers and other diseases 
aids can be transmitted by sex intravenous drug use blood 
transfusion and from infected pregnant mothers to fetuses

threequarters of those carrying the aids 
virus will develop either the fatal disease or an aidsrelated 
condition within six years of infection university of california 
scientists reported friday 
researchers from ucsan francisco said their threeyear study 
made important advances in tracking the progression of the virus 
but found little to encourage hope for longterm survival among 
those infected with it 
what we saw was that the number of those showing no effects 
from hiv aids virus infection is very small said andrew moss 
ucsf associate professor of epidemiology and international 
healththis means that if you are infected with the aids virus 
you will almost certainly go on to get aids 
the findings were published in saturdays british medical 
journal 
the study was the first to base the prediction of progression to 
aids or aidsrelated complex called arc on microscopic changes in 
patients blood the researchers said 
the author of an earlier study on the topic said the new report 
apparently provides important information for infected people 
trying to decide whether to take immediate risks with antiviral 
drugs or wait for advances in treatment 
the big question still is will everybody at some point 
progress from the virus to aids or is there a chance that 
some people will be able to ride it out for 15 years said paul 
omalley director of the city public health departments aids 
research project 
as each year progresses we know more but we still cant fully 
answer it said omalley 
omalleys study released in february 1987 found that of 104 
men infected with the aids virus 15 percent developed aids within 
five years 22 percent developed the disease within six years and 
33 percent had it within seven years in addition many of the 
patients who did not have fullblown aids after six years suffered 
from arc 
the national centers for disease control has estimated that 20 
percent to 30 percent of the 1 million to 15 million americans 
infected with the aids virus will develop the disease by the end of 
1991 
the cdc reported this week that 55167 cases of aids in the 
united states have been reported since june 1981 30932 of those 
people have died 
researchers at ucsf followed 288 men with the virus for three 
years and used five markers in the blood to estimate how many 
would contract aids or arc after another three years the markers 
included measurements of proteins and cells 
twentytwo percent of study participants developed aids during 
the threeyear period and 19 percent developed arc a milder form 
of the disease that can develop into aids 
an additional 24 percent had laboratory abnormalities that the 
researchers found to be highly predictive of aids or arc 
extrapolating from the evidence the scientists said an 
additional 10 percent would develop aids or arc within six years 
for a total of 75 percent 
even the men who had not developed aids or arc after three years 
showed clear signs of progression toward a worsened condition in 
their blood markers the study found 
the researchers described their sixyear estimates as 
conservative saying the actual rate of progression may be much 
higher 
hiv infection is much more serious than we thought in the 
early days moss said it may take eight or nine years but 
eventually the infected person will probably get aids

loma linda medical center said friday 
has accepted a fourth baby born with most of his brain missing and 
will keep it alive for up to a week in hopes that its organs can be 
used for transplant 
the boy identified only as baby d was born at an unidentified 
southern california hospital thursday and transferred to loma linda 
university medical center said anita rockwell a spokeswoman for 
the center 
baby d suffers from anencephaly in which most of the brain is 
missing the condition almost always leads to death within days or 
weeks his parents want to donate their babys organs when brain 
death occurs rockwell said 
dr joyce peabody loma linda chief of neonatology said baby d 
was resting comfortably friday and receiving nutrition and water as 
needed rockwell said the newborn will be cared for for a sevenday 
period that began thursday night 
under loma linda policy baby d will be placed on life support 
if needed to prevent damage to organs 
if baby d is declared braindead within seven days the hospital 
will give notice that his organs are available for transplant if 
he isnt brain dead within seven days he will be allowed to die 
the time limit was developed to alleviate ethical concerns that 
doomed anencephalics not be kept alive indefinitely merely so their 
organs can be donated 
rockwell said anonymity was requested by baby ds parents and 
officials of the hospital where he was born 
baby d is the fourth anencephalic newborn accepted as a possible 
organ donor at the hospital 
the first was stillborn dec 23 thwarting her parents desire 
to have her major organs donated her corneas and heart valves were 
given to infants needing them 
the second anencephalic was declared braindead feb 18 
attempts to donate his liver failed because potential recipients 
either werent suitable matches or couldnt be operated on in time 
he was disconnected from lifesupport feb 20 
most recently a girl was transferred to loma linda after birth 
feb 20 because she never met braindeath criteria within the 
sevenday limit she was disconnected from a respirator and allowed 
to die on feb 28 however her eyes corneas and heart valves were 
later donated to infants needing organs 
loma linda gained worldwide attention in 1984 when dr leonard 
bailey frustrated at the lack of heart donors for babies 
transplanted a baboons heart into a girl known as baby fae she 
died 20 days later 
bailey whose baboon transplant was sharply criticized by many 
doctors subsequently urged the use of anencephalics as donors of 
hearts and other organs

andreas whittam smith editor of the independent 
newspaper appeared at a hearing in the old bailey central criminal 
court on friday over alleged possession of a secret document on the 
fight against terrorism 
the hearing before judge aron owen was closed but whittam smith 
told reporters his newspaper was accused of having a document 
obtained in violation of the official secrets act 
we shall argue against that most strongly he said after the 
case was adjourned to next week 
a story in his paper thursday described proposals in a draft 
confidential report on how information would be built up by the 
12 european governments in a data base to keep track of extremists 
across frontiers 
it said the british were unenthusiastic about the idea because 
of reluctance to endanger informants and surveillance methods 
the interior ministers of the 12 governments involved are known 
as the trevi group after the italian town where their first 
meeting was held in 1976 
the story did not say how the document was obtained a police 
order served on the independent to surrender the document said it 
concerned a meeting of the trevi group in brussels last january 
press and public were excluded from the old bailey hearing at 
the request of government law officers 
whittam smith said his dailys attorney desmond brown had 
argued that the 1911 official secrets act could not apply to a 
document obtained outside britain and one that was held by all 12 
members in the trevi agreement 
under the act unauthorized release of government information is 
illegal 
the independent story by its domestic affairs correspondent 
sarah helm said the killing of three irish republican army members 
by british security agents in gibraltar last monday is seen as 
firm proof that intercountry cooperation promoted by trevi is 
working

the leader of northern 
irelands largest protestant paramilitary group resigned friday 
four days after a foiled attempt on his life 
the ulster defense association announced that it was mutually 
agreed that andy tyrie 48 would step down as chairman a post 
he has held since 1973 no successor was immediately named 
on monday a clandestine protestant group calling itself the 
loyalist peoples reaction force claimed responsiblity for planting 
the bomb that tyrie found attached to his car 
tyrie considered a moderate in the british provinces sectarian 
feuding advocates independence for northern ireland under a 
powersharing protestantroman catholic administration 
the ulster defense association with an estimated 10000 
members was established in 1971 as an umbrella group for 
protestant vigilante groups it defines its main aim as preventing 
the unification of predominantly protestant northern ireland and 
the catholicdominated irish republic to the south 
although the organization is widely assumed to be armed the 
british government has resisted calls by the catholic minority to 
outlaw it 
tyrie became prominent in 1974 when he led hooded paramilitaries 
in support of worker strikes that destroyed a joint 
catholicprotestant administration set up by the british government 
but later he came to embrace powersharing as a way to end the 
provinces two decades of conflict between protestants and 
catholics 
tyrie was credited with unifying and imposing discipline on the 
ulster defense association and with ending random killings of 
catholics attributed to the organization 
but he lost some influence because of his reluctance to throw 
the groups weight behind large street protests against the 1985 
angloirish agreement that pact gives the irish republic a 
consultative role in running northern ireland 
his organization also was wracked by allegations that it was 
involved in extortion and racketeering sometimes in league with 
its archenemy the irish republican army dissidents accused tyrie 
of failing to clamp down on the alleged abuses 
under tyrie the ulster defense association produced a blueprint 
for powersharing that was hailed as a farsighted attempt to break 
the deadlock between catholics and protestants john mcmichael the 
group member largely responsible for the blueprint was 
assassinated by the ira last december

residents of midsized cities in the west will 
no longer get detailed figures on monthly price changes in their 
communities 
in new york and los angeles monthly household surveys of 
employment and unemployment are being cut back sharply tracking of 
trends among blacks hispanics teenagers and women in the two 
cities will be less current 
the government is changing the numbers it collects and crunches 
to measure whether times are good or bad 
as a result a congressional mandate to find out what happens to 
laid off workers in all 50 states when their local factories close 
is being scaled back to cover just 32 states 
wage surveys in some of the fastest growing occupations 
architects engineers and health technicians have been abandoned 
postponed indefinitely are efforts to learn more about the growing 
numbers of people who hold down two or more jobs 
in their place the government is going to provide more and 
better trade figures beginning with monthly rather than quarterly 
changes in the prices of imported and exported goods 
the changes are being made by the labor and commerce departments 
partly in response to the globalization of the economy and changing 
perceptions of what is important 
with unemployment at a decade low 57 percent and inflation 
running below 45 percent the monthly jobless and consumer price 
figures command less attention than when either or both were in 
double digits 
just as big a factor if not bigger is the deficitreducing 
budget cuts negotiated by congress and president reagan last year 
statistics gatherers were ordered to take the same acrosstheboard 
spending cuts as the pentagon 
march and april will be the last months the labor departments 
bureau of labor statistics surveys consumer price changes in salt 
lake city sacremento calif phoenix ariz columbus ohio 
raeford nc and five primarily rural counties in central 
kentucky 
beginning next month the bureau will reduce the size of its 
monthly employment surveys from 2200 to 1300 households in new 
york city and from 2100 to 825 households in los angeles for an 
annual savings of 750000 
detailed reports on changes among racial and other demographic 
subgroups in the two cities will be issued every six months instead 
of every three months 
another 427000 in some 97 million that congress cut from the 
bureaus budget will be saved by delaying a special report on dual 
job holders a growing phenomenon that could help explain how 
americans maintain their living standards despite hourly wage 
increases that dont keep pace with inflation 
spared in the cuts are data collection and analyses that would 
diminish the accuracy of the bureaus most widely used reports the 
monthly nationwide surveys of employment and unemployment and 
consumer and wholesale prices 
the bureau of labor statistics doesnt produce any useless 
products but we have to prioritize them says its deputy 
commissioner william j barron our budget was cut 46 percent 
across the board and to preserve the integrity of the national 
figures some of the regional local and special programs became 
vulnerable we did the best we could 
not everyone agrees 
new york mayor edward i koch foreseeing a rise in 
unemployment complained in a letter to labor secretary ann 
mclaughlin that collecting less data for his city amounts to 
turning off the lights in the operating room when the operation 
is still in progress 
undersecretary of commerce robert ortner who oversees the 
governments data on retail sales trade economic growth and 
housing said complaints are inevitable whenever any data is 
reduced or eliminated 
new york city complains its no longer getting special 
treatment but thats the nature of new york ortner said they 
think they are entitled to special treatment 
also falling victim to the budget ax are bls surveys in six 
cities on wages in auto repair shops and hotels and motels future 
reductions are planned in surveys of wages in hospitals nursing 
homes banking and computer services 
all of these things are important said the bureaus barron 
but the overall issue facing everybody is the budget deficit 
were just adhering to what congress ordered 
there is an exception the reagan administration is asking for 
specific increases to improve the governments trade data a 
monthly fixture that has become crucial in view of the record 
1712 billion us trade deficit last year 
in his proposed fiscal 1989 budget president reagan asked for a 
32 million increase in the bureaus current budget resources of 
54 million for collecting international price comparisons 
that program was started in the early 1970s and no one foresaw 
the tremendous incease in trade barron said from 1976 to 
1986 the value of imports has increased 286 percent our samples 
are not representative of whats taking place 
the administration has contended that the dollars devaluation 
against foreign currencies has masked an improving trade picture in 
terms of volumes of goods and services exported and imported but 
the numbers to back up that claim have been sketchy estimates 
with monthly rather than quarterly trade changes measured 
ortner says the commerce department will soon be able to get a 
better handle on how much is moving across borders 
the problem with the data seemed to grow with the trade 
imbalance he said given the important policy decisions to be 
made its important to have meaningful as well as accurate data 
ortner believes there always will be a clamor for improving one 
economic statistic or another depending on whether it is 
inflation unemployment recession or a trade deficit that is 
dominating newspaper headlines 
interest in the accuracy of the numbers just like the economy 
moves in cycles he said at the moment its the trade figures 
that have the limelight as they tend to improve the 
disproportionate interest in them will fade and something else will 
take their place

even with all its sectarian strife and 
economic chaos lebanon is preparing for a presidential election in 
july and the signs now point to more disruption and division 
by tradition the presidency has been set aside for lebanons 
christians while the posts of prime minister and parliament speaker 
have gone to moslems this year however some leading moslems have 
begun laying claim to the presidency as well 
an array of christian politicians ambassadors exiles former 
security and intelligence chiefs the army commander and militia 
chieftains are possible candidates to succeed president amin 
gemayel a 45yearold maronite catholic when his sixyear term 
expires sept 22 
no moslems have yet to step forward as candidates but some 
influential moslem factions are making it plain they believe the 
presidential post should be theirs 
with lebanon dismembered by the 13yearold civil war gemayel 
has become politically powerless his authority is confined to a 
shrunken christian enclave he is constitutionally barred from 
running for a second term 
finding a successor acceptable to all sides promises to be a 
monumental task to a large extent that includes being acceptable 
to syria and israel the two key outside players in lebanon 
gemayel torpedoed a syrianarranged peace treaty between rival 
moslem and christian militia leaders in december 1985 and syria now 
is expected to want someone more to its liking syria which has 
troops in lebanon is heavily influential among sunni and shiite 
moslems 
but hardline christians such as samir geagea leader of the 
lebanese forces the christians main militia are not expected to 
go along with anyone syria wants 
a lebanese forces spokesman georges abdel massih told the 
associated press the militia will block the election of a 
president imposed by syria with political pressure and even 
military pressure 
we want a president who can liberate lebanon then unite it 
geagea has said were tired of intervention that has no limits 
and we will not let foreigners play a role in presidential 
elections 
gemayel was hastily elected president after his younger brother 
bashir was killed in a september 1982 bombing nine days before he 
was due to be sworn in as president 
under an unwritten convention dating from lebanons independence 
from france in 1943 the president is traditionally a maronite 
catholic the prime minister a sunni moslem and the parliament 
speaker a shiite moslem 
when that pact was made the christians were deemed to be the 
majority sect by a preindependence census but now the 12 million 
shiites are the biggest single group christians whose ranks have 
been depleted by those who have fled the country now number about 
900000 
with syrias backing the shiites are now demanding political 
equality and some even want one of their own as president 
christians like geagea refuse to surrender the presidency 
however 
proiranian shiite fundamentalists are even another matter 
since they seek to establish an iranianstyle islamic republic in 
lebanon 
so far only one candidate has announced officially for the 
presidential race he is dany chamoun a former christian militia 
leader leader of the national liberal party and son of the late 
camille chamoun a former president 
chamoun has said he opposes partition of lebanon and favors a 
secular state free of all foreign forces like the 25000 syrian 
troops in north and east lebanon and moslem west beirut and the 
israelis who remain in a southern border strip 
iran has about 3000 of ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
revolutionary guards in east lebanon and thousands of palestinian 
fighters are in lebanese refugee camps 
unannounced but likely christian candidates are raimond edde a 
veteran politician in selfexile in france since 1976 following two 
assassination attempts and suleiman franjieh a maronite who was 
president when the civil war erupted 
still other possible christian candidates are lebanons 
ambassador to france farouk abi lamaa a former security chief 
and the envoy to switzerland johnny abdo a former military 
intelligence chief 
other christians mentioned are gen michel aoun the army 
commander who once was a gemayel loyalist the millionaire 
businessmen manuel younes and henri sfeir 
elie hobeika the ousted prosyrian leader of the lebanese 
forces and former gemayel aide jean obeid who was kidnapped in 
beirut for several days last year are considered outside 
possibilities both also are christians 
on the moslem side the maneuvering is much less in the open 
nonetheless justice minister nabih berri leader of the 
syrianbacked shiite amal militia has declared lebanon should have 
a shiite president although he has not put himself forward 
leaflets distributed in west beirut call for the installation of 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah spiritual leader of the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god to head an islamic 
republic

changing into an urban world and this is one example of what is 
happening because of it 
james witham of the illinois natural history survey said there 
has been a substantial increase of deer in chicagos suburbs he 
recalled that last year a deer was hit by a car when it crossed a 
busy street in addison ill 
stunned the deer wandered over to a grocery store it stood on 
the rubber mat at the entry way opened the automatic door and 
commenced to graze on the lettuce and radishes in the produce 
section 
he evidently thought he found a new place to feed witham 
said 
authorities say the buck that crashed through the window of 
captains pizza in bridgeport conn last summer was not foraging 
for italian food 
jim spignesi biologist with the connecticut department of 
environmental protection theorizes the deers usual habitat was a 
90acre park about five miles away but development in the area 
forced the beast onto main street 
spignesi said the deer believed it was hurdling a threefoot 
stone wall and did not see the glass he set off a burglar alarm 
officers found the deer cowering in the dining room according to 
owner gregory kapeteneas it was treated for minor cuts and 
released in woods 25 miles away 
most encounters with the deer are less spectacular mary moore 
of islip says the deer will eat corn out of a plastic cup held by 
her husband 
they come right to our back door especially the babies the 
ones with the white spots she says they dont bother anyone 
others are less appreciative theyve eaten my bushes right 
down to the stem said one resident who asked that her name not 
be used 
she used to think the deer were adorable no more 
it cost me thousands of dollars to replace my azaleas and 
rhododendrons now i have chicken wire around them she said 
also of concern to residents is lyme disease a malady that is 
carried by ticks found on deer and other animals a bite by an 
infected tick leaves a red doughnutshaped rash which if 
untreated can lead to a high fever paralysis and swelling of the 
joints 
state health officials say 450 cases of the disease were 
reported on long island last year an increase of 50 from 1986 
edward bosler research scientist for the new york state health 
department said there has been an increase of ticks in the areas 
where the deer live but he believes the deer are getting a bad 
rap 
shooting all the deer would not eliminate lyme disease said 
bosler the tick would only look for another carrier 
but shooting some of the deer could help the long island herd 
says harry knock state department of environmental conservation 
wildlife manager 
most of long islands herd of 3000 deer inhabit the eastern end 
of the island knock says deer began wandering off long island 
refuges and parks in noticeable numbers about six years ago 
overpopulation is to blame he says 
people have refused to have a deer hunting season on some of 
the refuges because they are afraid they are killing bambi said 
knock 
about 150 deer died from starvation last year despite a mild 
winter according to knock others face death from disease or 
accidents 
knock advocates a hunting season on lands where it is now 
prohibited in order to bring the number of deer into balance with 
the food available he disagrees sharply with those who rebel at 
bambicide 
these wellmeaning people are doing a disservice to the deer 
by looking at them as a personality he said 
the us fish and wildlife service which overseas the 
preserves is exploring alternatives to reducing the deer herds 
but ray whittemore in charge of the eight us wildlife 
preserves on long island said a hunt is unlikely the public 
opposes it and most of the land was donated with the stipulation 
that it remain forever wild and closed to hunters he said 
witham the illinois expert said there is no simple answer 
deer and man are just going to have to learn to live with each 
other he said there has to be a balance and compromise

since he came to power three years ago mikhail 
s gorbachev has imposed his image upon the world his visits to 
the west and meetings with president reagan have brought him 
intimately into tens of millions of us living rooms he has made 
glasnost and perestroika part of a worldwide vocabulary but what 
has it meant to the ordinary soviet citizen here is a scorecard of 
his kremlin stewardship 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
three years have been enough for mikhail s 
gorbachev to shake his nation break away from economic dogmas a 
halfcentury old and strike a new kind of arms deal with the united 
states 
yet many of gorbachevs 284 million compatriots have so far seen 
few concrete results from his robust style of leadership 
the reformminded communist party chief who turned 57 this 
month says he has just begun to reshape his country and 
acknowledges the toughest years lie ahead 
we have revived throughout the world hope for the future 
gorbachev said in a feb 18 speech we ought to treasure that 
and to justify the trust that we feel everywhere 
within a week of being named soviet leader on march 11 1985 
following the death of konstantin u chernenko gorbachev called 
for speeding up the countrys economic and social development 
there have been stirrings of change as well as resistance as 
bureaucrats are laid off workers face more demanding standards and 
the specter of price hikes looms 
yet as gorbachev enters his fourth year in power the soviet 
union still must import grain to feed itself poor housing a 
monotonous diet and hours spent waiting in line to buy lowquality 
goods remain the lot of millions 
gorbachev has set himself an ambitious agenda one he 
increasingly says will take years to enact here in gorbachevs 
words are the goals he has fixed and his successes and setbacks 
to date 
 
glasnost we must not evade the problems that have arisen 
so let us say it loud and clear 1986 
glasnost for soviets has meant being able to read in their press 
about prostitution homelessness and other social ills whose 
existence was once denied 
in january they were told for the first time of a domestic air 
crash the same day it occurred 
glasnost has breathed life into theater films and art boris 
pasternaks masterpiece doctor zhivago appeared in print this 
year for the first time and there is franker discussion of the 
legacy of dictator josef stalin and some of his victims including 
nikolai i bukharin were posthumously rehabilitated 
but as russians would say blank spots in glasnost persist 
a reflex seems to make the kremlin leadership hesitate before 
issuing bad news as during the chernobyl disaster or the ethnic 
bloodshed in azerbaijan last month 
glasnost is not a sovietstyle first amendment unsanctioned 
public gatherings are prohibited independent groups are barred 
from having printing presses newspapers toe the party line on 
foreign policy and defense 
 
living standards plans for the countrys social and economic 
development envisage raising the peoples wellbeing to a 
qualitatively new level 1986 
for the soviet worker it means people who work well are 
entitled to earn more those who dont can be fired 
moreover 16 million people are expected to be laid off by the 
year 2000 because of rising labor efficiency and cuts made in the 
government bureaucracy 
many soviets worry the reforms may hurt their buying power 
authorities are studying a price hike to slash the 97 billion 
spent yearly to subsidize milk bread and other staples 
meat and butter are still rationed in some areas and wellmade 
shoes and clothing are rare in winter onions and potatoes are the 
only vegetables in many moscow food stores 
one family in five lives in communal housing 
the soviet living standard is still markedly low when compared 
to the developed west and a criticism once made by nikita s 
khrushchev still seems apt what sort of a communist society is 
it that has no sausage 
 
perestroika the economy is a mess we have forgotten how 
to work 1987 
perestroika the restructuring and modernization of the 
staterun economy is the linchpin of gorbachevs program it runs 
counter to more than 50 years of central control when bureaucrats 
set production levels of everything from safety pins to trucks 
factory managers are now free to contract freely with other 
firms citizens can drive taxis or organize in cooperatives to run 
a restaurant 
the bottom line so far has been inconclusive 
last year for the first time in recent memory the entire rise 
in production was due to greater efficiency rather than the 
building of new factories the gross national product rose by 33 
percent 
however more than one enterprise in eight lost money many 
factories signed contracts then failed to deliver 
others delivered but no one was interested in 23 billion 
worth of goods too shoddy or outmoded to attract buyers 
 
agriculture comrades a problem that we will have to solve 
in the shortest time possible is that of fully supplying our 
country with food 1986 
a peasants son and the partys former chief for agriculture 
gorbachev well knows the woes of the soviet staterun farming 
sector and after eight months in power he created a 
superministry to tackle them 
but in 1987 partly because of bad weather farm output was up 
by only 18 percent over 1986 and harvests of some crops like 
potatoes actually declined 
foreign farmers continue to feed a part of the soviet 
population the 1987 grain crop was the third largest in history 
but a drop in the output of good wheat has forced the soviets to 
import large quantities of grain for bread 
 
superpower and foreign relations the soviet union is 
proposing a stepbystep and consistent process of ridding the 
earth of nuclear weapons before the end of this century 
1986 
relations with washington had begun to warm slightly before 
gorbachev took over as soviet leader but his tenure has seen a 
rebirth of optimism that reminds some of the detente days of the 
1970s 
gorbachev and president reagan are preparing a fourth summit in 
december they signed a treaty banning intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles the first superpower pact outlawing a class of weaponry 
negotiators are working on a treaty that would halve superpower 
strategic arsenals 
gorbachev has proclaimed his readiness to pull out of 
afghanistan ending an eightyear soviet military occupation that 
has damaged kremlin prestige cost billions of rubles and claimed 
the lives of an estimated 10000 soviet soldiers 
he has given east bloc nations more latitude to set their own 
domestic courses and courted asian countries and americas allies 
in europe but irritants like concerns over soviet human rights 
violations remain 
in february he told a visitor western europe is not ready so 
far to understand us the way we really are people there continue 
to be afraid of the soviet union this is deeprooted

with the economy still growing and the trade 
deficit shrinking presidential candidates who hoped to capitalize 
on economic pain are getting no mileage from pocketbook issues 
recent upbeat economic statistics are making it hard for 
democrats to use the economy to their advantage as a campaign issue 
and super tuesday voting appears to have eliminated from the 
race more than just a few candidates it also may have buried 
trade or at least protectionism as a votegetting theme 
the candidate who sought to capitalize on the issue the most 
rep richard gephardt dmo was a big loser in tuesdays 
contests he captured only his home state of missouri 
gephardt didnt win a single state in the south where his 
advocacy of a gettough trade policy to protect importbattered 
us industries had been expected to play well 
an amendment that bears his name centerpiece of a housepassed 
trade bill is expected to be stripped from compromise trade 
legislation now before a housesenate conference committee 
the measure calls for mandatory reduction of trade surpluses 
maintained by countries who restrict their own markets to us 
goods the measure has been widely viewed as slap against japan 
taiwan and other asian allies 
gephardt was not the only candidate who failed to get any 
political mileage from the trade issue sen bob dole found his 
support for a textilequota bill of little help in republican 
caucuses in south carolina a key textileproducing state 
when we have basic prosperity and basic optimism in the 
country that 800pound gorilla the economic issue doesnt sit 
down said norman ornstein an analyst at the american enterprise 
institute a conservative research organization 
rep jack kemps supplyside economic theories most closely 
matched president reagans but the connection did not benefit him 
as he received only a fraction of the vote and was forced to 
withdraw 
meanwhile vice president george bush who once derided 
supplyside policies as voodoo economics is now enjoying 
enormous gop support partly due to his identification with reagan 
bush is trying to surgically attach himself to ronald reagan 
ornstein suggested 
lawrence chimerine chairman of the wefa group a private 
economic forecasting service said as long as the economy is fairly 
healthy matters of personality and organization will have more 
impact on votes than economic philosophies 
to the extent the economy stays where it is right now 
obviously it will be difficult to use it as an issue except in a 
positive sense chimerine said 
gephardt has always disputed that his views are protectionist 
even though critics suggest his amendment defines the term in any 
event support for the gephardt measure has eroded since it was 
narrowly approved a year ago on a 218214 house vote 
congressional leaders kept the legislation alive this long both 
as a courtesy to gephardt and out of curiosity over how it and he 
would fare at the polls 
much has happened on the trade and economic fronts in the past 
few months changing the political landscape 
just last fall the trade deficit hit a onemonth record of 
176 billion in october the stock market collapse sent tremors 
through the economy the dollar plunged in foreignexchange markets 
and a recession seemed imminent 
since then the trade shortfall has shown two dramatic months of 
exportled improvement manufaucturing industries are enjoying a 
resurgence and the dollar has stabilized 
interest rates and inflation remain restrained and the civilian 
unemployment rate fell in feburary to 57 percent its lowest rate 
since may 1979 
on the political side everything is coming up roses this is 
another lucky reagan year said allen sinai chief economist for 
the boston company economic advisors inc who could ask for 
anything more than continuing growth reasonably low inflation and 
a reviving manufacturing sector 
exit polls taken by abctv on super tuesday showed 18 percent of 
those surveyed considered a candidates stand on trade as very 
important in making up their minds but only 14 percent of them 
said they voted for gephardt 
the primaries have brought trade to the forefront of public 
discussion but the trade issue is not the exclusive domain of any 
one candidate nor was super tuesday a referendum on the issue 
said rex hardesty a spokesman for the aflcio the labor 
federation has been one of the most outspoken backers of the 
gephardt amendment 
gephardt himself said afterward that he still believed a huge 
majority of people agree with my trade position 
but they didnt know it was my policy it was just our 
inability to be able to get that message out there he said

it probably wont go down as the year of the 
muni but experts say 1988 also isnt expected to mirror last 
years disastrous performance for the municipal bond market 
the volume of issues from state and local governments totaled 
144 billion during the first two months of this year down from 
165 billion a year ago but still one of the best starts on 
record according to securities data cobond buyer which tracks 
the municipal market 
although 1987 started out on a positive note rising interest 
rates put a damper on activity later in the year sharply 
curtailing volume and bringing about a severe decline in the value 
of many municipal bond funds 
analysts say a drop in interest rates after the stock market 
crash in october helped lure some borrowers back to the muni market 
neal attermann municipal research director of kidder peabody 
called the early data on the muni market was both helpful and 
misleading 
its a helpful indicator in that bonds are coming to 
market despite restrictions resulting from the 1986 tax bill he 
said tax reform generally reduced the attractiveness of municipal 
bond returns and also restricted use of the bonds 
but he cautioned that 1988 wont be a large year of issuance 
george friedlander a municipal bond analyst for smith barney 
upham amp co agreed the data for january and february isnt so 
great on an annualized basis it comes out to 92 bilion a year 
thats a moderate supply 
still atterman noted an early drop in the percentage of 
refundings or bond issues sold in order to retire older securities 
usually to take advantage of lower rates 
thats a very encouraging sign that means that rather than 
being tied to interest rates we have a lot of volume independent of 
interest rates he said 
while market experts arent predicting a banner year for the 
municipal market most arent forecasting a replay of 1987 even 
though the outlook for interest rates remains cloudy 
atterman notes that many changes could occur in the municipal 
market following the presidential election especially as demand 
for a reduction in the budget deficit persists 
that could result in a further restriction in taxexempt 
bonds he said adding that bond prices could rise on that 
anticipation 
so far this year most of the munis sold were general purpose 
followed by education utilities health transportation water 
sewer and gas housing airports student loans and solid waste 
recovery according to securities data 
the largest issue in january it said came from the municipal 
electric authority of georgia which sold 4887 million of special 
obligation refunding bonds in february the largest was 450 
million of new york city general obligation bonds and in march 
40475 million of power system revenue refunding bonds securities 
data said 
an overwhelming number of the bonds were tax exempt it said

a clash of titans looms on wall street in the 
next few days when the trade deficit meets headon with the triple 
witching hour 
though both of these ogres have been bedeviling wall street for 
some time they have rarely put in simultaneous appearances 
but all that will change on thursday when the commerce 
department issues its report on the nations trade balance for 
january just as the markets head into the final stages of trading 
in a group of stockindex futures and options that are approaching 
expiration 
the combination looks highly explosive the effect however may 
be not to create a fireworks display but rather a period of 
extreme caution and safetyconsciousness 
whenever something like this causes expectations to get high 
and heartbeats to get rapid it often turns out to be a 
nonevent said hugh johnson an analyst at first albany corp in 
albany ny 
small investors and a lot of large investors too are likely 
to sit it out 
the triple witching hour which occurs on the third friday of 
march june september and december apparently was tamed to some 
extent last year when procedures were adopted to spread it out 
some futures contracts on stockmarket indexes which are used 
by professional traders in computer strategies known as index 
arbitrage are now settled as of the opening on friday while 
others are settled at the close that day 
this time around program traders will be operating under a 
further restraint the socalled collar adopted by the new 
york stock exchange on feb 4 
this procedure closes off the exchanges main computerized 
trading facilities to index arbitrage any time the dow jones 
industrial average rises or falls 50 points from the previous days 
close 
that poses a threat of problems to any program trader who might 
need to close out a position just before expiration 
for all the controversy surrounding them indexarbitrage 
transactions are designed as lowrisk propositions if one were to 
go awry it could quite conceivably cause a brokerage firm to lose 
valued clients and traders themselves to lose their jobs 
so the people who play this game are presumed to be proceeding 
very carefully as this triple witching hour approaches 
market participants of all persuasions seemed to be playing it 
cautious in the past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
hit a new early1988 high on tuesday but then backed off closing 
friday at 203498 down 2288 from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 98 to 14945 
while the american stock exchange market value index rose 235 to 
29609 and the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter 
market gained 212 to 37548 
big board volume averaged 19977 million shares a day against 
20808 million the week before 
since the collar was set up it has never gone into effect 
although the dow has risen or fallen about 48 points on three 
separate occasions 
thus it appears that it has become a de facto boundary an 
informal equivalent to the limits on daily price swings used in the 
commodities markets 
wall street analysts say it would be going too far to assume 
that there cant be days in the future when the dow goes past the 
50point limit the collars potential impact in such circumstances 
is the subject of much conjecture 
whatever the collars merits and potential perils many 
observers say it would be helpful for the market if it serves to 
reduce the perceived volatility of stock prices in the investing 
publics minds 
as johnson observed retail individual investors have been 
deeply alienated by volatility in the market

a government report showing lower inflation has soothed anxiety 
in the bond market and helped ease interest rates but some 
economists say other figures suggesting weak retail sales raise the 
possibility of a recession 
the labor department said friday its index that measures 
wholesale prices fell 02 percent in february reflecting a decline 
in food and energy costs this partly erased a 04 percent rise in 
january and provided evidence that inflation remains under control 
for the first two months of 1988 wholesale prices have been 
increasing at an annual rate of 11 percent half of last years 
22 percent rise 
the news cheered the bond market which is highly sensitive to 
evidence of inflation because rising prices erode the value of 
fixedincome investments 
the treasurys key 30year issue rose about 650 per 1000 in 
face amount its yield which moves inversely to price and is a 
signal of interest rate trends fell to 850 percent from 855 
percent late thursday 
stocks also benefited on wall street the dow jones average of 
30 industrials which took its sharpest drop in nearly two months 
thursday with a 4824 point loss closed friday with a gain of 895 
at 203498 
broader market indices also rose and the wilshire 5000 
equities index measuring the value of all us stocks rose by 
nearly 6 billion 
a separate report by the commerce department showed retail sales 
rose 06 percent in february largely because of strong demand for 
autos but economists were more concerned with a sharp downward 
revision in january sales 
instead of a 05 percent rise in january sales reported earlier 
the government said sales fell 02 percent evidence that consumer 
buying is much weaker than previously believed 
this change was considered significant because consumer buying 
is a crucial element in economic growth and a significant slowdown 
could slide the country into recession 
many economists fear that consumers have been reluctant to spend 
money since the october stock market collapse and have been saving 
instead

oil prices closed out the week on the upswing 
but analysts are not sure how substantial the rally really is 
after two days of slight gains oil prices jumped strongly 
higher thursday as traders anticipated productioncutting moves by 
world producers the advance continued friday but was hampered by 
continuous profittaking analysts said 
on the new york mercantile exchange contracts for april 
delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude oil 
closed 29 cents higher at 1629 per 42gallon barrel on thursday 
the contract leaped 51 cents topping combined gains tuesday and 
wednesday of 12 cents

after thursdays 090 cent gain wholesale unleaded gasoline closed 
at 4559 cents a gallon up 045 cent after leaping 114 cents the 
day before 
bob baker an analyst for prudentialbache securities inc said 
fridays move reflected a growing confidence that by whatever 
means it might take our oilexporting friends will contain the 
discounting and get prices moving up 
at the dean witter reynolds inc securities firm however 
analyst jayne ball was less certain 
at this point its unclear whether this is just a technical 
correction or whether its a serious recovery she said 
analysts generally attributed thursdays advance to market 
sentiment that worried opec and nonmember countries were 
attempting to find ways to boost oil prices that had severely 
eroded since late last year 
by early this week sluggish demand and growing surpluses 
together with discounting by members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries had driven prices to levels between 
13 and 14 a barrel in the persian gulf far short of opecs 18 
target and to 1537 per barrel on the new york merc 2 to 3
