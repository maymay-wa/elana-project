three french hostages held in lebanon since 1985 
were freed wednesday and headed home and one of them said his 
liberation was a rebirth 
the plane carring journalist jeanpaul kauffmann and diplomats 
marcel fontaine and marcel carton stopped briefly in salonica 
greece and in corsica on its way to paris in corsica it was met 
by interior minister charles pasqua and a medical team 
its the most beautiful day of my life there are no other 
words kauffmann told rtl radio whose reporter roger auque 
himself a former hostage was permitted to board the plane in 
salonica 
its a rebirth because for three years i wont say we lived 
we survived he said 
its the end of a nightmare a nightmare that lasted three 
years and then some carton told rtl 
at first we were together then we were separated he said 
we saw other hostages but we did not know exactly who they 
were 
wednesdays release leaves 18 foreigners including nine 
americans missing and believed held captive in lebanon by moslem 
extremists 
renee veyret the second secretary at the french embassy in 
beirut told the associated press that carton 62 fontaine 45 
and kauffmann 44 were set free at 720 pm 120 pm edt 
wednesday near the summerland hotel in the seaside jnah 
neighborhood of the lebanese capital 
there were reports in beirut this week that france had agreed to 
pay iran 670 million still owed to iran on a billiondollar loan 
made by the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi the french government 
froze payments after the 1979 islamic revolution in iran 
the kidnappers in lebanon were believed to have loyalties to 
iran 
kauffmann and fontaine both spoke of being blindfolded and 
chained 
no longer to have a blindfold chains kauffmann said 
i wouldnt say we were in a tomb but after all it is a little 
like that 
kauffmann said the hostages had heard little news he did not 
know who was running in sundays second round of french 
presidential elections 
i knew my wife fought for me not only for me but for us 
he said 
joelle kauffmann made several trips to beirut and made frequent 
public appeals for the hostages release 
fontaine said to have had a blindfold over your eyes and 
chains on your hands and feet that makes a change it is the 
difference between night and day 
in strasbourg france conservative premier jacques chirac who 
faces incumbent socialist francois mitterrand the presidential 
election this sunday announced the mens release wednesday at a 
campaign rally 
i have been informed just now that the three french hostages 
in lebanon were freed and have been turned over to a representative 
of the interior minister he said 
i am thinking of the horrible time theyve been through which 
they didnt deserve i am thinking of the one who alas was 
the victim of these kidnappers and has not returned chirac said 
he was referring to michel seurat 39 who was kidnapped may 22 
1985 islamic jihad a proiranian shiite moslem group claimed it 
killed him march 5 1986 his body was not found but his wife says 
french officials confirmed his death 
a total of 10 french hostages now have been released since 
chirac took office in 1986 
mitterrand appearing later on national tv expressed happiness 
about the release but sorrow for the one who did not return 
michel seurat and for his family as well as for the foreign 
hostages still held in lebanon 
in washington the state department said it was awaiting details 
of the release 
we would be concerned by any sign that concessions were 
made the state department said we believe concessions 
encourage future kidnappings and could prolong the captivity of 
other hostages 
the release followed weeks of reports that chiracs government 
was working feverishly through contacts with the iranian 
government and elsewhere to win the mens freedom 
hostage negotiations shrouded in official secrecy were the 
subject of continuing press speculation last december france 
expelled 17 iranian exile opponents of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
but denied this had any connection with hostage talks 
french negotiator jeancharles marchiani personal 
representative of french interior minister charles pasqua met the 
freed captives at the headquarters of the syrian army in beirut 
embassy secretary veyret said 
marchiani a former intelligence officer made several trips to 
beirut in recent weeks 
he had negotiated the freedom of two other french captives 
auque and jeanlouis normandin last november 
in damascus syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa said in a 
statement as in the past syria exerted efforts to ensure the 
release of hostages 
pasqua said the former hostages would be taken to a military 
hospital in paris 
in beirut the moslemcontrolled voice of the nation quoted a 
reporter at the summerland hotel as saying the three frenchmen were 
brought there in a black mercedes that had no license plates 
carton the embassy vice consul in beirut and fontaine an 
embassy protocol officer had been missing since march 22 1985 
islamic jihad said its members kidnapped them 
kauffmann a journalist working for the weekly magazine 
lenvenement du jeudi and seurat an academic researcher were 
kidnapped may 22 1985 
the longestheld foreign hostage in lebanon is terry a 
anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
the november release of auque and normandin reportedly involved 
france agreeing to let wahid gordji an employee at the iranian 
embassy leave france gordji was wanted for questioning in 
connection with terrorist bombings

the armys thrust into south lebanon may signal 
a new phase in a simmering guerrilla war one in which israel again 
is ready to use its military might even if it means raising 
tensions with syria 
the fact that helicopterborne troops landed tuesday in a 
village only four miles from syrian lines in lebanons bekaa valley 
was likely to be viewed as a challenge by damascus 
syrias initial reaction was to put its troops on alert but 
there was no corresponding war of words and israeli officials 
stressed they sought to avoid a confrontation with syria 
our intentions are limited we are not out there to go to war 
with syria but simply to control the security of our northern 
border settlements said col renaan gissin deputy army 
spokesman 
we made it very clear to the syrians as well as the population 
in the area that we intend to complete this search mission and 
return our forces back he said in an interview on israels army 
radio 
the disclaimers were reinforced by the makeup of the mechanized 
brigade that entered lebanon only a few tanks were involved and 
the use of artillery was extremely limited it was not a combat 
force said one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
on friday united nations peacekeepers reported seeing six 
israeli f4 phantom jets fire 30 missiles in the direction of 
syrian lines in the bekaa valley beirut newspapers said a sam6 
surfacetoair missile was launched but there was no confirmation 
from either side 
the last war of nerves with syria came in november 1985 after 
israeli warplanes patroling over lebanon chased two syrian jets 
into syrian airspace and shot them down 
some observers said tensions with syria would divert attention 
from the occupied west bank and gaza strip where the army has been 
fighting daily battles with rioters since dec 8 
but israeli officials rejected such suggestions and insisted the 
primary motive was to keep palestinian guerrillas from building up 
new bases in lebanon like the ones they had before israels 1982 
invasion 
this operation is aimed at searching for the terrorists at 
trying to locate groups and weaponry and to deliver a message to 
residents of the villages that we would not agree to an 
increase of hostile activity said maj gen yossi peled the 
head of the northern command 
the new strike into lebanon was an unusually wellpublicized 
campaign accompanied by a stream of public statements it seemed 
designed more to send a warning about israels readiness to use the 
military option than it was to fulfill the declared mission of 
capturing guerrillas 
the warning was directed at the palestinian factions who carry 
out the raids at the syrians who provide the protective umbrella 
and at villagers who provide guides and shelter there was also a 
hint of more to come if the infiltrations continued 
israels new thrust into lebanon was the armys first major 
ground offensive since february 1986 overcoming a reluctance to 
get involved in lebanon that lingered from an unpopular threeyear 
occupation ending in 1985 
we will not wait to engage in defensive activity onlyand we 
want to initiate activity in the field which would make it harder 
for terrorist groups to operate said peled 
the new campaign in lebanon like last months assassination of 
plo military chief khalil wazir appeared designed to show off 
israels military potency 
many believe such actions will help restore the armys image as 
a force to be reckoned with an image that has suffered as a result 
of the west bank riots and guerrilla infiltrations 
the message is we will get the terrorists whereever they 
are said an army official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
but to a nation suspicious of any longterm involvement in 
lebanon prime minister yitzhak shamir said on israel radio i 
think there is totally no danger of entanglement 
the army was prodded to go into lebanon by a rebirth of 
palestinian guerrilla activity in south lebanon where the plo had 
amassed a large military presence before israels 1982 invasion 
a dozen infiltration attempts since last november have claimed 
11 israeli lives and alarmed residents living along israels 
northern border they have in turn put pressure on the government 
to take action 
there has also been a marked increase in attacks on a 2000man 
israeliallied lebanese militia and the few hundred israeli troops 
permanently stationed in south lebanon 
in march there were 105 antiisraeli operations mounted by 
palestinians lebanese communists and proiranian shiite moslems 
said a security official in lebanon who monitors the warfare 
two proisraeli militiamen were killed in the march fighting 
along with eight guerrillas three israelis and 16 fighters in the 
israelibacked militia were wounded 
the official said it was the highest monthly casualty count 
since october 1985 when there were 130 operations in which six 
proisraeli militiamen were killed and 8 others wounded

in its confrontation with gen manuel 
antonio noriega the united states seems to have been maneuvered 
into an awkward position by the military strongman 
the us government had pledged to remove the commander of the 
defense forces the de facto ruler of this country from office and 
from panama 
now the reagan administration appears to be offering noriega a 
deal he had hinted at more than a month ago that he leave power 
but not the country he also wants his us indictments on drug 
trafficking charges invalidated 
the apparent us policy shift has managed to alienate 
opposition leaders they now privately use the word 
incompetence when referring to the way the united states has 
handled the general 
noriega denied on saturday that he had reached any agreement 
with the united states but treasury secretary james a baker said 
on sunday that talks with noriega continued during the weekend and 
that progress is being made 
initially the united states encouraged the opposition as it 
demanded both noriegas ouster and exile washington imposed 
economic sanctions and froze panamanian government assets in the 
united states causing a severe economic crisis in this country 
where the dollar is the legal currency 
the united states recognized as panamas legitimate president 
eric arturo delvalle a man noriega himself had picked as president 
and whose only merit opposition leaders say was that he later 
tried to fire the general 
but noriega a military leader with the populist tactics of a 
latin american politician vowed he would not leave under pressure 
he clung to power in spite of the crisis whipping up panamanian 
nationalism and the sympathy that latin american nations feel for 
anyone who confronts the united states 
the gringos overestimated the opposition and underestimated 
noriega said maj edgardo lopez a spokesman for the general 
as late as april 16 state department officials were telling 
opposition members the us position had not changed and that 
noriega had to leave soon 
if they united states are now offering a deal that would 
enable noriega to stay in panama then it is a serious mistake 
said ricardo arias calderon of the christian democratic party 
all panamanians know that allowing noriega to stay in panama 
is not a solution said guillermo endara spokesman for the 
authentic panamanian party the largest opposition party 
concerned about a possible usnoriega deal that might bypass 
them the opposition parties met on monday for the first time to 
discuss the serious crisis we are suffering 
the opposition includes the national civic crusade an umbrella 
organization of private professional and labor groups that since 
june has mounted demonstrations against noriegas rule 
opposition leaders feel the us government created noriega by 
sustaining his 15000member defense forces and allowing him to 
impose and depose presidents during the past five years 
the change in attitude on the part of the united states to 
support democratization in panama now is not the result of 
solidarity with our people said arias it merely recognizes 
that its interests in panama are more compatible with the struggle 
for democracy than with the support of a dictatorial regime 
noriega has insisted that the american decision to topple him 
was political because he refused to cooperate with us attempts to 
involve panama in incidents to embarrass the leftist sandinista 
regime in nicaragua the reagan administration supports the 
nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
noriega said on saturday that he would not leave unless the 
popular forces meaning the defense forces and his political 
base negotiate their security 
he will leave on his terms now said an opposition party 
leader who spoke on condition of anonymity 
aides said the general also wants the economic sanctions lifted 
noriega is more concerned about lifting the economic sanctions 
than any discussion about his departure lopez said 
he is not going to resign under us pressure and he is not 
going into exile he said we have learned to be wary of the 
united states a country that historically had been our friend

britains top two confectioners cadbury schweppes 
plc and kit katmaker rowntree plc have become tempting targets 
for us and swiss bidders in what the british have dubbed the 
candy bar wars 
the bidding and stakebuilding reflect a trend among consumer 
companies to go global by acquiring existing strong brands which 
are almost prohibitively expensive to create from scratch analysts 
say 
the moves also reflect swiss companies concerns about the 
approach of 1992 when the common market is to become one 
barrierfree market of 320 million consumers 
because switzerland is not a member swiss companies are eager 
to buy operations within the 12nation european community said 
felicity smith an analyst with the london investment firm hoare 
govett ltd 
the candy bar wars also underscore the key roles cadbury and 
rowntree play in the industry and the importance of britain as a 
confectionery market 
the two companies rank among the worlds largest 
chocolatemakers as do the swiss suitors for rowntree nestle sa 
and jacobs suchard sa 
the american company general cinema corp which said it wants 
to increase its stake in cadbury has interests in movie theaters 
and soft drink bottling 
in britain the thirdlargest chocolate consuming country in 
the world after switzerland and norway cadbury has the largest 
share of the 39 billion chocolate market or 30 percent 
according to the london brokerage firm henderson crosthwaite ltd 
rowntree comes in a second with 26 percent and usbased mars 
inc is third with 24 percent the firm said 
cadburys brands also include canada dry soft drinks 
many britons are not happy that two of their venerable 
institutions are being raided by foreigners 
the fate of the rowntree yorkie bar has stirred the nation 
into a fit of patriotism the daily telegraph newspaper said 
the little english lobby has been in a lather 
rowntree hasnt made a direct approach to the government about 
possible intervention but it is discussing the matter with one 
or two people a rowntree spokesman said on tuesday 
in accordance with british practice the spokesman wasnt 
identified 
in cadburys case general cinema which is headquartered in 
chestnut hill mass said last week that it would increase its 
177 percent stake in the british company possibly through a 
tender offer 
londonbased cadbury whose brands include peter pauls mounds 
and almond joy candy bars said any involvement or interference 
from general cinema would be unwelcome and strongly resisted 
it was more than a year ago that general cinema first became a 
major shareholder in cadbury whose shares fell 15 cents to finish 
at 651 on londons stock exchange on tuesday 
meanwhile rowntree which is based in york england last week 
became the reluctant target of a hostile 39 billion bid from 
nestle the worlds largest food company with interests in 
chocolate and coffee 
nestle which has acquired almost 7 percent of rowntree offered 
1664 a share for the company which rejected the bid 
the offer from nestle whose brands include nestles crunch 
is said to be the largest by a nonbritish bidder for a british 
company nestle based in vevey switzerland also recently reached 
an agreement to acquire the buitoni spa foods group including its 
perugina chocolates business from italian businessman carlo de 
benedetti 
separately competing suitor jacobs suchard another swiss 
company with chocolate and coffee interests has amassed a 21 
percent stake in rowntree which didnt welcome that move either 
zurichbased jacobs suchard which makes the triangular 
toblerone chocolate bars initially paid 1178 a share for its 
rowntree shares 
rowntrees shares finished at 1730 up nine cents on tuesday 
nestle currently has a 3 percent share and suchard 2 percent 
of the british chocolate market 
what it is all about is globalization of consumer products 
markets said david lang a food analyst at henderson crosthwaite 
you have the multinational companies at the moment trying to 
accumulate tremendous brand strength in a narrow product line but 
internationally 
lang added the scramble for shelf space is some of it and the 
big brands are the only ones that can get it 
satellite advertising and international travel are creating a 
greater homogenization lang said the supermarket shelves of 
the world are starting to look like one another 
rowntree which traces its origins back to a quaker grocers 
shop in york northeast england in the 18th century had pretax 
profit of 210 million on sales of 267 billion in 1987 
cadbury which began as a seller of tea and coffee in birmingham 
in 1824 had pretax profit of 329 million on revenue of 38 
billion last year

convincing parents that top prep schools are 
worth tuitions exceeding 10000 isnt always easy but even 
harder are the challenges of ensuring classrooms are filled in 
future years with ethnically diverse students and faculty 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
perhaps the least of the 
challenges facing the private school that proclaims itself the 
pearl of the midwest is explaining to parents why its worth 
12000 annual tuition 
the 300acre campus of cranbrook kingswood school outside 
detroit has the requisite prepschool luxuries a hockey arena 
bowling alleys indoor and outdoor tennis courts where players 
strokes are videotaped and an oldtime swimming hole called lake 
jonah so named because its shaped like a whale 
for its 800 students each day is an aesthetic feast from the 
tapestries and art deco light fixtures down to the very doorknobs 
and lunchroom chairs these and practically everything else were 
designed or influenced by famed finnish architect eliel saarinen 
who lived and taught here from 1925 to his death in 1950 
but just as the virtues of top private schools like this arent 
just skindeep neither are the problems 
with the schoolage population declining and prep school 
tuitions sometimes rivaling ivy league colleges officials worry 
about future enrollments and are casting their recruiting nets from 
coast to coast 
the nations approximately 1700 independent private schools 
those not receiving tax or church funds enroll some 600000 
students up 97 percent over the last decade 
but the number of students taking private school admissions 
tests dropped by 14 percent in the last two years according to the 
national association of independent schools 
a few years ago cranbrook kingswood could almost fill its 
classes with students just from michigan and surrounding midwestern 
states now the school recruits from as far away as southern 
florida and california 
if we didnt do that kind of thing we wouldnt be in good 
shape in five years because of the demographics the best schools 
are out there all the time said admissions director bruce 
kridler whose travel budget has risen from 500 to 15000 in 
recent years and who now makes routine visits to 35 cities in 17 
states 
like other prep schools cranbrook kingswood has constantly 
fought a perception of elitism the formerly allwhite 
predominantly episcopalian school is now 25 percent jewish and 25 
percent persons of color including indians asianamericans and 
blacks a change due largely to aggressive minority student 
recruiting and a 158 million endowment that helps make sizable 
scholarships possible 
cranbrook kingswood is the most expensive boarding school in 
michigan and among the most expensive in the midwest but it is a 
bargain compared with the priciest eastern schools 
leland academy in franklin mass is the nations most 
expensive private college preparatory school charging 18500 for 
a years tuition fees room and board cranbrook kingswood at 
12000 ranks 44th in the nation 
another stubborn problem is finding minority teachers of 90 
upperschool faculty members four are black one is hispanic one 
is asianamerican 
but such challenges seem remote at 8 am as english teacher 
peter fayroian poured the coffee in his carpeted classroom for a 
dozen students about half the size of most public school classes 
he kicked off a discussion on the religious and moral 
implications of herman hesses classic siddhartha should we 
prepare to come to the presence of the holy on a motorcycle he 
asked what should be the relationship between technology and the 
holy 
in russ conners biology lab nine juniors toil on a typically 
complex question at what wavelengths does chlorophyll in plants 
absorb the most light 
they use a college text conner said and i dont give 
them a whole lot of answers 
academically ive never seen anything like it said jerry 
rubino from nearby sterling heights mich whose daughter lisa is 
an 11thgrade day student public school kids might come home at 
230 or 3 in the afternoon but my daughter typically isnt home 
until 6 or 7 at night and then she buries herself in the books 
its a school rule that the 270 boarding students must be in 
their rooms studying every evening sunday through thursday 
upon graduation each students name is handcarved into the oak 
walls of alumni court those names include such luminaries as 
wyoming senator alan k simpson daniel ellsberg who leaked the 
pentagon papers poet brad leithauser and new republic editor 
michael kinsley 
nonetheless schools that tout themselves as training grounds 
for future leaders in an increasingly diverse world simply cant 
ignore the issues of race and ethnicity any longer said school 
president and acting director lillian bauder 
yet private schools remain overwhelmingly white according to 
the naiss own statistics in 198687 independent school 
enrollments were 47 percent black 18 percent hispanic 47 
percent asianamerican and 01 percent native american 
i recruit in cabrini green said kridler referring to an 
allblack chicago housing project and i go to mexicanamerican 
neighborhoods 
inner city kids think were not affordable i talk a lot about 
financial aid opportunities kridler said 
about 24 percent of students in the upper school grades 912 
get financial aid covering twothirds of need on average still 
22 students accepted last year did not enroll for money reasons 
low teacher salaries remain a source of frustration especially 
for younger faculty even though median salaries have risen 7000 
in five years nationally beginning private school teachers make 
1200019000 and average salaries for all such teachers was 
23000 about 5000 less than public school teachers 
fayroian a 25yearold firstyear teacher earns 16300 he 
says he is up at 4 am and in bed at midnight spending his day 
and evening grading papers teaching classes and meeting with 
students the salary can be disheartening for the amount of work 
we do he said 
top scale at cranbrook kingswood is 34000 and the median is 
25600 theres no teacher union and no tenure 
on the other hand private school teachers generally have more 
freedom to choose textbooks and shape their lessons free of 
bureaucratic interference 
at cranbrook kingswood the resulting curriculum is so rigorous 
many students find college easy by comparison the school recently 
studied its recent graduates and found their freshman grades often 
improved compared with their grades at cranbrook kingswood 
students who averaged 20 to 25 at the prep school averaged 286 
as college freshmen for example 
what makes the grind worth it is the extraordinarily high 
probability of admission to one of the better us colleges 
of 190 graduates in 1987 187 went to college 14 as national 
merit finalists their scholastic aptitude test scores averaged 
1100 of a possible 1600 compared with a national average of 906 
mark botvinick a 17yearold senior from bloomfield hills 
whose public schools lead the state nonetheless chose to come here 
and was recently granted early acceptance at his dream school duke 
university 
denise brainard a 12th grader from crosslands wva says 
theres no comparison between what she gets here and what she would 
have gotten at her hometown school 
private schools are very stereotyped she said people 
think theyre very snobby but were not we come here for the 
education i dont know what my chances would have been at nitro 
high school in crosslands wva

fidel garcia has guided hundreds of 
illegal aliens to new jobs and new lives escorting them through 
the hills and canyons dividing the united states and mexico 
but fear has kept the 29yearold alien smuggler from seeking a 
new way of life for himself as time runs out on the yearlong 
amnesty program 
i dont want to lose my money my family my house garcia 
told a us border patrol agent who accompanied two journalists 
sunday i want to know if i can make it pass legalization 
requirements or not 
garcia said he has documentation from three employers and has 
spent 15 years in the united states but he said he feared his 
dozens of arrests for alien smuggling would make him ineligible for 
amnesty and lead to his deportation

at sunset sunday hundreds of illegal aliens mainly mexicans 
gathered on the socalled soccer field on otay mesa just north of 
the international border in tijuana mexico the site is about 12 
miles south of downtown san diego

there than in mexico or south or central america 
some people took advantage of bilingual agent stuart kutzs 
unusual presence among them to press for information about the

long before whats your sign replaced come here often 
as a lounge lizards opening line people sought their fortune in 
the stars planets and signs of the zodiac 
astrology assumes that the planets and stars in some way 
predict or rule the lives of humans 
soothsayers searched the skies for omens in babylon of the 18th 
century bc but what is now known as astrology developed during 
the hellenistic period from the 3rd century bc to the 3rd century 
ad according to the encyclopedia britannica 
the world book encyclopedia says that astrological forecasts or 
horoscopes are based on four elements the earth the planets the 
zodiac the 12 signs that divide up the heavens and comprise an 
astrological year and 12 houses or elements of personality 
associated with 12 imaginary divisions of the earths surface 
astrology assumes the earth is the center of the solar system 
newtonian physics eradicated a belief in astrology among the 
educated the practice of the now pseudoscience continued among 
nonintellectuals in the west gradually losing contact with its 
rich tradition and becoming more and more fraudulent the 
encyclopedia says 
but popular interest in astrology grew after newspapers began 
printing horoscopes in the 1930s 
nazi leader adolf hitler is known to have consulted astrologers 
as did his deputy rudolf hess who was captured on a bizarre peace 
mission to england in 1941 sir ivone kirkpatrick head of the 
british foreign office in 1941 said that hess was a simple 
stupid person whose astrologer had told him he would bring peace

885 percent sen bob dole 279 or 65 percent and pat robertson 
170 or 39 percent 
elections director emmett fremaux said a light turnout resulted

unopposed in his partys primary seeking his 10th term to 
congress fauntroy will face republican william reed in november

a ranking republican on the house labor 
committee says the democratic leadership has tried to quash a 
nonpartisan report indicating that an increase in the minimum wage 
to 505 could cost up to 500000 jobs 
rep thomas e petri rwis ranking gop member on the house 
labor standards subcommittee that handled the minimum wage 
legislation said tuesday that the democratic leadership is not 
interested in objective analysis 
theyre just interested in ramming their bill through with 
brute force no matter who gets hurt petri said in a floor 
statement 
the congressional budget office studied the democraticsponsored 
legislation which would raise the minimum wage from 335 an hour 
to 505 an hour over the next four years 
petri said that although the cbo found the legislation could 
wipe out 500000 jobs and boost inflation the folks who run the 
labor committee didnt want that kind of information and ordered 
it removed from the cbo report before the minority could see it 
stanley l greigg a cbo spokesman said it followed its normal 
procedure of sending a copy of the report to both rep augustus f 
hawkins dcalif labor committee chairman and rep james m 
jeffords rvt ranking gop member 
we followed the same procedure we always do said greigg 
a copy went to both of them simultaneously we were baffled by 
the suggestion of jeffords that he made three requests for a copy 
of the report 
the house is expected to take up the minimum wage bill sometime 
this month 
the cbo the research arm of congress has disputed news reports 
that the agency has become politicized in issuing a report on the 
cost estimates of the legislation 
in a letter to the house education and labor committee cbo 
acting chairman james l blum said the budget office was fully 
responsive to the requests made of us by the committee staff and 
that nothing has transpired to change the nonpartisan 
professional conduct of our office 
at the specific request of the staff blum said the cbo 
provided the committee with an assessment of the possible impact of 
the measure on the economy 
our cost estimates normally provide information only on the 
possible budget impacts for federal state and local governments 
blum said 
susan mcguire committee staff director sent a letter last 
thursday to all panel members in which she said the staff requested 
cbo to provide a second submission because the first cbo cost 
estimate included an analysis not required by the budget act or 
house rules for inclusion in the committees report 
this analysis has been available to any member requesting it 
and the staffs action in requesting cbo to conform in no way 
constituted suppression of the analysis or improper pressure on the 
congressional budget office

african guerrilla leader sam nujoma is asking 
presidential hopefuls michael dukakis and jesse jackson to pressure 
south africa into relinquishing control over southwest africa the 
territory known as namibia 
nujoma who heads the southwest africa peoples organization 
said he had met with campaign managers who promised him a meeting 
with the two democratic candidates within the coming week gop 
contender george bush has not responded to a similar request for a 
meeting nujoma said in an interview tuesday 
nujoma 58 said that despite claims to the contrary south 
africa is trying to strengthen its hold over the mineralrich 
territory which it rules in defiance of a 1978 un resolution 
calling for namibian independence 
nujoma who lives in exile in angola accused south african 
troops of arson and bombing attacks against namibias 15 million 
residents including the burning of 14 churchrun schools last 
month 
south africa has denied the charges accusing swapo of the 
attacks 
south african president pw botha paid a rare visit to the 
territory on april 8 and proposed increased powers for his chief 
representative there the proposal would weaken the 
transitional government established by south africa in 1985 
with a view to eventual independence for namibia 
south africa has no intention whatsoever to leave namibia 
said nujoma the south africans will have to be forced out by the 
combined resistance of the namibian people and international 
pressure 
he called on the next us administration to pursue steps 
similar to the trade sanctions legislated by congress in 1986 
against south africa 
nujoma said he had requested a meeting with secretary of state 
george p shultz but had not received any response a state 
department official confirmed nujoma had asked for a meeting and 
said shultz had yet to reply 
shultz has been criticized by conservative members of congress 
such as rep patrick swindall rga for allowing nujoma into the 
country in view of his organizations guerrilla activities and 
support from the soviet union in a letter to shultz swindall 
called nujoma a terrorist and soviet puppet 
the united states supports a south african pullout and an 
independent namibia but its contacts with swapo have been limited 
us representatives are taking part in two days of talks in 
london with representatives from angola cuba and south africa on a 
plan for the pullout of south african forces from namibia and cuban 
troops from angola 
cuba has an estimated 37000 soldiers in angola estimates for 
the south african military presence in namibia range from 40000 to 
100000 
nujoma said he was sure angola would protect his groups 
interests at the talks and press its demands for namibian 
independence it will be a package i am assured of this by the 
angolan government he said 
if an agreement is worked out swapo will stop its attacks 
against south african troops he said swapo says it killed more 
than 90 south africans this year but its claims cannot be verified 
nujoma conceded that swapo gets most of its arms and training 
from the soviet union cuba yugoslavia angola and several other 
members of the organization of african unity 
but he added that if the united states wants to supply swapo 
with weapons we will certainly accept it with great pleasure 
nujoma is on a threeweek visit to the united states to attend 
several unsponsored seminars on namibia and to highlight his 
organizations demands

environmentalists are looking to the house 
interior committee in their efforts to reverse a congressional tide 
that is running toward oil development in the arctic national 
wildlife refuge 
the focus of the biggest energyvsenvironment battle of the 
100th congress shifted to that panel tuesday after the house 
merchant marine and fisheries committee approved a bill to open the 
alaska preserve to oil rigs 
tim mahoney of the alaska coalition of drilling foes said he is 
optimistic about stopping the bill in the interior committee 
chaired by rep morris udall dariz who opposes developing the 
nations largest refuge 
its been a friendlier committee to us traditionally 
mahoney said the committee is always split 5050 on tough 
developmental issues our strategy is pretty simple we believe 
in the justsayno strategy 
mahoney and other antidrilling lobbyists are trying to slow 
down the bill which is similar to a measure approved narrowly 
earlier this year by the senate energy and natural resources 
committee 
he said he thinks the chance of a drilling bill getting through 
congress this year are very low there are a lot of people who 
prefer not to vote on controversial issues in an election year 
drilling opponents hope to stall final action until 1989 on the 
theory that a new administration will be less eager than the reagan 
administration to develop the 15 million acre coastal plain of the 
19millionacre refuge 
randy snodgrass of the wilderness society said that democratic 
frontrunner michael dukakis has pledged to make the coastal plain 
a nodevelopment wilderness area 
drilling advocates including interior secretary donald hodel 
say the refuges potentially rich oil deposits must be tapped as 
soon as possible in order to reduce the nations growing dependence 
on imported petroleum 
the merchant marine committee approved its drilling bill 2813 
after rejecting bipartisan pleas by some members that congress 
postpone a decision on the issue until a new president can study 
the matter and formulate a new national energy policy 
this is the first positive energy step weve made since 
1973 said rep don young ralaska a principal proponent of 
tapping what the reagan administration and the oil industry say may 
be a major supply of petroleum 
young was referring to congress approval of the pipeline that 
carries alaskan oil from prudhoe bay the huge field about 70 miles 
west of the refuge boundary and the source of about 20 percent of 
us oil production 
an opponent rep gerry studds dmass said the drilling 
legislation backed by young and crafted by chairman walter jones 
dnc was illconceived and illtimed 
the resources of the arctic will wait and we can await the 
arrival of a new president and a new energy secretary said 
studds predicting a bitter battle if drilling legislation reaches 
the house floor 
we will have a donneybrook of such dimensions that it will be 
recalled for some time studds predicted 
the jones bill would allow drilling to begin within 21 months of 
enactment it would bar rigs from a caribou calving area and 
earmark federal revenue from refuge oil for national wildlife and 
conservation programs 
the closest drilling opponents got to victory was a 2318 vote 
against a plan to allow preleasing activities which would take 
two or more years to be carried out while the national academy of 
sciences studied the nations future energy needs and how they 
could be filled by conservation and renewable sources of energy 
the foes also tried to add language to force the administration 
to reverse its decision to lower the auto fleet economy standard 
from 275 mpg to 26 mpg rep mike lowry dwash said that over 
the long term oil saved this way could equal what the refuge may 
contain

an inspection has found no mechanical problems 
with the united airlines jumbo jet that landed in japan on one 
engine after three of its engines lost power during a flight over 
the pacific the airline says 
united spokesmen refused to speculate on what caused the 
incident although they say the boeing 747 has been found to be 
airworthy and was being flown today without passengers from japan 
to san francisco 
that appeared to lend credence to a theory that the engine 
problems may have stemmed from a pilot error in shifting fuel among 
the jets four fuel tanks 
industry and government sources asking not to be identified by 
name said tuesday that the plane landed with three of its fuel 
tanks empty and not feeding three of the huge jets engines 
causing them to stop operating 
during a flight fuel routinely is transferred among the four 
tanks to maintain the aircrafts balance according to these 
sources more than 20000 pounds of fuel was left in a fourth tank 
feeding the engine that continued to operate 
the jetliner with 258 passengers and crewmembers aboard landed 
safely at the narita airport in japan with only the one engine 
providing power the pilot had reported losing the first engine at 
39000 feet about 1 hour and 15 minutes from the airport a second 
engine 30 minutes later and a third engine just before landing 
the airplane has been thoroughly inspected said united 
spokesman robert doughty in chicago we have not found a 
mechanical problem the airplane is airworthy enough to ferry 
it back to san franicsco 
doughty refused to speculate what caused the engine problem but 
said the plane had 23500 pounds of fuel left when it landed in 
japan on monday 7500 pounds more than the federal aviation 
administration requires and 4500 pounds more than the airline 
requires but he said he did not know the distribution of the fuel 
among the jumbo jets four tanks 
the boeing 747 has a maximum fuel capacity of 320000 pounds 
other aviation and government sources said tuesday that the fuel 
was in the tank that powered the engine that continued to operate 
although it has yet to be determined whether the improper 
distribution of the fuel was caused by mechanical problem or flight 
crew error 
each of the four engines is independent and has its own fuel 
lines drawing from the tanks in the wing you can interchange 
fuel from tank to tank said david jimenez a spokesman for the 
boeing co 
such fuel transfers in the older boeing 747100 series aircraft 
are often performed manually according to another boeing official 
elizabeth reese although she said she did not know the procedure 
used on the united aircraft involved in mondays incident 
industry and government sources speaking on the condition that 
they not be identified said that a mechanical problem such as a 
fuel line or filter clog or malfunctioning valve might have kept 
the crew from transferring the fuel 
another possibility is that the flight crew shifted too much 
fuel into the fourth tank and was unable to transfer it back to the 
other tanks said one aviation source 
according to the boeing officials the aircraft has a variety of 
gauges to tell the flight crew how much fuel has been burned how 
much fuel remains and the fuel flow rates for each tank 
the incident is being investigated by japanese authorities but 
us air safety investigators also are interested in the case 
drucella anderson a spokeswoman for the national transportation 
safety board said staffers plan to talk to pilots of the plane 
when they return to the united states

higher speed limits on rural interstate 
highways are having no discernible effect on traffic fatalities 
probably due to stricter enforcement transportation secretary jim 
burnley says 
a 55 mph limit that is not enforced can be more of a problem 
than a 65 mph limit that is enforced burnley said tuesday after

a law enacted last year over president reagans veto allows 
states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph on rural stretches of 
interstate highways 10 mph faster than the national 55 mph speed 
limit enacted in 1974 as an energy conservation measure 
forty states have adopted the higher speed limit 
burnley declined to provide specific figures to support his 
conclusion saying they will be provided to congress in a report 
being prepared by the transportation department 
were just not finding any distinction between fatalities on 
the 65 mph rural interstate highways and those where the speed 
limit remained at 55 mph burnley said 
the fatality statistics are all over the board with deaths 
rising in some states and falling in others on 65 mph stretches of 
highway said ron defore a transportation department spokesman 
the only official statistic on the issue has been provided by 
diane steed administrator of the national highway traffic safety 
administration in congressional testimony she said that in the 
months after the federal law took effect the agency found 
increases between 18 percent and 23 percent on rural interstates in 
states that raised the limit 
defore however said it is difficult to assess the effect of 
the higher speed limit because of possible variations in other 
safety factors such as enforcement 
in his speech burnley said americans are becoming more safety 
conscious citing a 14 percent decline in the number of drunken 
drivers involved in fatal auto accidents between 1982 and 1986 
but the national safety council told congress it believes the 
higher speed limit is causing more deaths 
we have a very strong and clear indication from across the 
nation that average speeds have increased and more people are dying 
and sustaining more severe injuries on these roads said judith 
stone the councils federal affairs director in testimony before 
the house surface transportation subcommittee 
she said she expects statistics to show 500 additional highway 
deaths annually as a result of the higher speed limit

wild raccoons on a remote atlantic coastal 
island will become subjects in a test of a geneticallyengineered 
rabies vaccine if the federal government approves a plan proposed 
by a philadelphia biomedical institute 
the wistar institute announced a proposal tuesday to test the 
vaccine this fall on an island that will be selected off the coast 
of either virginia or south carolina the experiment said wistar 
officials is part of an international plan to eradicate rabies a 
disease that has plagued humans and animals since ancient times 
charles rupprecht an assistant professor at wistar said the 
vaccine in a liquid form would be placed into baits designed to 
attract wild raccoons the baits then would be distributed on the 
selected island 
later he said captured raccoons would be examined to determine 
if they have eaten the bait and become immune to rabies 
william h wunner a wistar professor said the baits would 
consist of a sponge filled with the vaccine and then sealed with a 
wax the baits would be coated with a scent as an attractant 
he said laboratory tests have shown that when raccoons bite into 
the baits they absorb the vaccine through the lining of their 
mouths 
rupprecht said the process has been shown to be effective in 
tests on thousands of animals of 15 different species in the 
laboratory 
the test would be the first us use in the wild of a virus made 
with recombinant dna technology but the same vaccine now is being 
used in field tests on foxes in belgium and will start soon in 
france other types of rabies vaccines have been used in field 
tests in west germany and in canada 
warren cheston associated director of wistar said the 
engineered vaccine was made by removing one of five genes from the 
rabies virus and splicing it into the genetic pattern of the 
vaccinia virus which is the virus used to make smallpox vaccines 
for human innoculations 
cheston said that because the technology uses a harmless gene 
from the rabies virus the resulting vaccine cannot cause rabies 
but when put into an animals immune system the vaccine will 
cause the animal to develop antibodies to the rabies virus thus 
making the animal immune to the disease 
wistar has applied to the us department of agriculture for 
approval to conduct the tests wistar institute located in 
philadelphia is an independent nonprofit biomedical research 
laboratory 
repprecht said the islands under consideration for the test are 
parramore island va and north cedar or murphy islands on the 
coast of south carolina these islands are uninhabited by humans 
but do have a population of raccoons the south carolina islands 
are part of a wildlife refuge he said he hopes that the test can 
get under way this fall 
rabies is a viral infection that can infect any warmblooded 
animal it attacks the central nervous system and always is fatal 
unless a vaccine is administered shortly after exposure 
a survey by the world health organization shows that more than 
20000 humans die annually from rabies and that more than a half 
million receive postexposure injections about 30000 people in 
the united states receive the rabies vaccine annually the centers 
for disease control reported rabies in more than 4000 animals in 
the us last year but no human cases developed 
current rabies vaccines must be administered by injection but 
cheston said it is hoped that eventually a geneticallyengineered 
vaccine that can be taken orally will be made tested and cleared 
for human use the oral rabies vaccine now being tested can be used 
only on animals he said

the reagan administration says the threat of 
soviet germ weapons and not us public fears about exotic diseases 
should tip the decision on whether to build a new test laboratory 
for biological weapons 
the united states has formally renounced possession of any 
biological weapons or their use but the administration says it 
still needs a defensive research program to develop and test 
protection for american troops 
we certainly have the responsibility to the soldier to protect 
him and her against those who would use biological weapons 
thomas j welch deputy assistant secretary of defense told three 
house subcommittees 
lynn hansen assistant director of the arms control and 
disarmament agency said the soviets have an active research 
program in sciences that could be used for building germ weapons 
the soviets have continued to maintain an offensive biological 
warfare program hansen warned 
the army wants to build a 54 million biological test 
laboratory at utahs dugway proving ground the plan has been 
temporarily shelved because of strong local opposition but welch 
said the request will be made again next year 
rep wayne owens dutah who represents the area said the army 
plans have been setting off alarm bells throughout the scientific 
community both internationally and in utah as to the public 
safety and wisdom of building the dugway facility 
the army wants the lab to be to biosafety level four b4 
the highest standard of protection however all the planned 
experiments could be done in a b3 lab said welch who explained 
the higher safety level would be an additional public protection 
owens noted the lab would have the capability to convert these 
lethal pathogens into aerosol form and that potential was the 
chief cause of public fears 
the united states officially closed down its biological weapons 
program which was headquartered at fort detrick md in 1969 and 
announced that future research would be limited to defensive 
purposes the united states is also a party to a 1972 treaty 
banning biological weapons but the pact lacks enforcement or 
verification provisions 
welch hansen and other officials said repeatedly tuesday that 
the armys research program was only defensive and the united 
states would not use germ weapons and wouldnt violate the 1972 
pact 
welch said it would be impossible for us to use biological 
weapons because we dont have them we would never use 
biological weapons against anybody 
but owens said the line between defensive and offensive 
research would be so hopelessly blurred by the construction of a 
levelfour aerosol facility that the dugway lab could easily 
perceived by other nations as a provocative violation of the 
treaty 
other legislators also appeared skeptical rep dante fascell 
dfla said the line between offensive and defensive biological 
agents seems fuzzy at best 
under questioning army col walter busby who oversees the 
testing program said there are no plans to use genetically 
engineered material at dugway 
some of the biological agents tested at dugway are shipped 
through regular mails officials said 
jeremy rifkin a chief critic of the new lab said an 
environmental impact statement on the lab released by the army in 
february dismisses a number of potential problems including fire 
terrorism sabotage or explosion 
he criticized the statement as shoddily prepared grossly 
inadequate 
rifkin is president of the private foundation on economic 
trends which has sued to block construction of the army lab 
the witnesses testified at a joint hearing of the house foreign 
affairs arms control subcommittee the interior subcommittee on 
energy and the environment and the armed services subcommittee on 
military installations and facilities

a new policy of the national association of 
securities dealers is making it easier for investors to find out if 
their stockbrokers have ever been in trouble 
state securities regulators are applauding the move but say 
brokers ought to be required to disclose any black marks on their 
record even if the customer doesnt ask 
nasd said tuesday it will provide information to anyone who 
requests it in writing from the organizations records on its 6600 
member firms and on 460000 brokers virtually every retail broker 
in the country 
previously nasd which oversees the overthecounter stock 
market has revealed only the current employer of a broker and any 
major disciplinary actions brought by the association itself said 
nasd spokesman enno hobbing 
now the association at no charge will supply information on 
all infractions including brokers criminal convictions and 
disciplinary actions taken by federal and state agencies and by 
other stock exchanges he said 
nasd will also list a brokers previous employers so you can 
determine if this guy has been a job hopper hobbing said 
he said expanded records will be supplied only in response to 
written requests while the limited information previously provided 
will continue to be given over the telephone 
the north american securities administrators association which 
represents state securities regulators has been pushing to shift 
the onus of triggering disclosure from customers to brokers 
it is suggesting that brokers be required to give new customers 
a brochure outlining their disciplinary history as well as the 
commissions they charge and other information 
the new nasd policy certainly represents a vast improvment 
over what was previously available said james c meyer nasaa 
president and tennessees top securities regulator 
however he said it was only an important first step 
adding its really a little unrealistic to expect most 
customers to take the initiative in investigating their brokers 
record 
meyer said that many investors who called a hotline set up after 
the october stock market crash complained that their brokers had 
placed them in unsuitable investments or had engaged in 
unauthorized trading a requirement that brokers disclose past 
violations of that nature may have prevented additional 
transgressions 
wall street executives have labeled nasaas proposal red 
letter disclosure after hester prynne the adulteress in the 
scarlet letter who was required in puritan new england to wear a 
red letter a 
they argue that if brokers had to reveal their disciplinary 
history customers would shun brokers guilty of any offense

in the meantime the nasd said investors can get a form for 
requesting information about a broker or securities firm by 
contacting nasd regional offices or by writing the nasd membership 
department po box 9401 gaithersburg md 20898 or by calling

a man who hoped to float from 
florida to the bahamas drifted more than 600 miles during his 20 
days in a raft buoyed by his thoughts of hot cereal and strawberry 
ice cream while waiting for rescuers 
kenneth maffei who was rescued monday said he survived on rain 
for drinking water and tiny shrimp crab and fish from seaweed he 
plucked from the sea 
i have a great desire to learn about cultures on the islands 
and i like to travel in unusual ways said maffei who was 
rescued by a supertanker off cape hatteras nc suffering from 
seconddegree burns and having lost more than 30 pounds 
ill be staying on land for a while maffei said tuesday 
from his hospital bed i wont be heading for any islands 
maffei 28 of santa cruz calif climbed into a tiny 
inflatable raft at sunset on april 12 and set out from fort 
lauderdale the closest island was great isaac island about 60 
miles away 
i thought i could zigzag back and forth to get there he 
said i felt very strongly that it could be done 
maffei said he studied maps and wind and current patterns at a 
library before leaving 
his equipment included oars and oarlocks and another tiny army 
surplus raft that carried food water and clothes 
but maffei an oddjob laborer had taken only a few informal 
sailing lessons in california and the tiny raft was too small for 
his 6foot3 180pound frame he had no motor no radio 
communications no signal flares no water desalination unit and no 
compass 
but he did have a strong personal will 
whenever i thought that this could be it i would say stop 
you cant think that way maffei said 
i felt i would make it he said licking his blistered lips 
so he could continue talking 
maffei said he caught high winds heavy rains and swells that 
dwarfed and repeatedly overturned his craft his supply raft 
deflated on the second day of his voyage and many of his supplies 
sank he was burned by the sun and saltwater and suffered abrasions 
from the raft 
the rains provided him with drinking water 
i held out my raincoat to catch the water and id scoop it 
up he said 
for food he caught tiny shrimp and crab and fish from seaweed 
once he had a hole in the raft which he quickly patched 
maffei said he lost track of time and overcame his fears with 
two allconsuming visions 
strawberry ice cream with fig newtons and cream of wheat with 
cream he said 
on sunday 650 miles from fort lauderdale and 20 days out he 
saw one of the many tankers that had passed him by and waved the 
tshirt he kept handy just like the other tankers this one kept 
going 
about 20 minutes later i looked back and they had turned 
he said i said to myself there are no traffic signals out 
here tankers dont just turn theyre coming back 
korean crew members aboard the 800foot bahamian oil tanker rich 
duchess climbed down a ladder to fetch maffei who was too weak to 
stand 
maffei was in stable condition at burdette tomlin memorial 
hospital after the coast guard on monday used a helicopter to bring 
him ashore 
if we had known about this ahead of time it would have been 
classified as an unsafe voyage and would have been stopped coast 
guard petty officer james mchugh said tuesday from the cape may 
station 
sometimes going through life you take risks maffei said 
youve got to take chances otherwise you cant reach your 
dreams

legislation to end all us investment in 
whitedominated south africa and impose a neartotal embargo on 
exports and imports is heading for a partisan battle on the house 
floor 
the house foreign affairs committee gave its approval to the 
disinvestment bill on tuesday voting 2714 action by the full 
house is expected to be scheduled soon 
the democraticcontrolled committee acted after voting down 
repeated attempts by republicans to dilute the measures impact 
the panel also approved by voice vote separate legislation 
urging and authorizing president reagan to impose economic 
sanctions against the government of ethiopia for alleged widespread 
and serious human rights violations including the diversion of 
international starvation relief to the ethiopian armed forces 
rep howard wolpe dmich chairman of the panels african 
affairs subcommittee said ending us investment in south africa 
and imposing a twoway embargo on most trade will not cause south 
africas white minority government to end its apartheid policies of 
racial separation 
sanctions will not of themselves bring down apartheid wolpe 
said 
but he said they will raise the cost to the white minority 
regime of maintaining south africa as one vast slave plantation 
in which whites profit from the exploitation of blacks 
this bill is the only nonviolent means at our disposal the 
least costly means of averting a terrible tragedy in south 
africa wolpe said 
opponents of the legislation said it will hurt the black south 
africans it is designed to help they predicted the loss of 
thousands of jobs not only for blacks in south africa but also for 
americans whose companies are hurt by the impact of the sanctions 
this is not a policy this is scorched earth said rep dan 
burton rind contending the bill will cost 2 million jobs for 
south african blacks by the year 2000 
supporters of sanctions acknowleged that some american jobs 
might well be lost but said that is of secondary importance in the 
battle against apartheid 
it may well be necessary in the pursuit of vital american 
interests for us to be prepared to pay a certain price ourselves 
here at home said rep steven solarz dny adding that the 
bill has been endorsed by major us labor organizations including 
the aflcio 
speaking against an amendment to enable the president to waive 
the sanctions law if it is hurting the us economy solarz said 
such a loophole would tell black south africans we are only 
prepared to help you to the extent that it doesnt hurt us 
the bill would replace a sanctions law enacted over president 
reagans veto in 1986 burton contended that the 1986 law has 
failed to put a dent in apartheid 
i sympathize with the desperation he said of the new 
legislation but acts of desperation generally hurt innocent 
bystanders and this one does it in spades 
the 1986 law barred new us investment in south africa and 
established several specific trade sanctions but it has permitted 
us companies to stay in south africa if they so choose 
the new bill would forbid any american citizen from holding any 
investment in south africa a requirement that would force the 
closing or sale of all usowned companies in the country 
it would would bar all imports from south africa except for 
certain strategic minerals 
it would prohibit all exports to south africa except for 
publications articles intended to relieve human suffering us 
economic assistance and private assistance intended to promote 
human rights health welfare religious and educational activities 
an amendment adopted during the committee debate also provided 
an exemption for food a step supporters said would make the 
legislation more attractive to house members representing farm 
regions 
prospects for the legislation are considered good in the house 
where majority democrats see the sanctions issue as a political 
plus for them in this election year however its prospects in the 
senate are less clear in part because the legislation lacks 
support of moderate republicans who were the key to passing the 
more limited sanctions bill two years ago 
the sanctions would go into effect six months after the bill was 
enacted into law 
the legislation also 
prohibits us involvement in the south african petroleum 
industry 
bars all us nuclear assistance to south africa 
directs the president to pursue international agreements aimed 
at dismantling apartheid 
requires the president to impose penalties on foreign nationals 
seeking to take significant commercial advantage of the us 
sanctions 
adds to the existing conditions for lifting sanctions a 
requirement that south africa implement united nations resolutions 
for the independence of the territory of south west africa known as 
namibia 
authorizes 40 million for economic assistance for 
disadvantaged south africans

a weeklong round of negotiations over 
increasing us beef and orange sales in japan ended in failure 
tuesday night with the united states saying it would seek to have 
japans import quotas declared illegal under international trading 
rules 
japanese agriculture minister takashi sato and us trade 
representative clayton yeutter broke off their talks after meetings 
that began last wednesday 
it was the second collapse in the negotiations since late march 
when a fouryear agreement on japanese beef and citrus import 
quotas expired 
regrettably the final japanese proposal offered only a modest 
increase in access to the japanese market yeutter said later in 
a press statement 
he said the united states would again ask gatt the general 
agreement on trade and tariffs at its wednesday meeting in geneva 
to set up a panel to hear us complaints about japans 
obstructive beef and citrus import practices 
the japanese government blocked a similar us move at gatts 
april meeting in geneva and the two countries then went back to 
the negotiations that ended in failure tuesday night 
sato a member of prime minister mamoru takeshitas cabinet 
rejoined the fiveday talks tuesday night as japans chief 
negotiator in yeutters headquarters near the white house 
sato who has been in washington for a week missed most of the 
negotiations earlier tuesday 
the united states has been demanding removal of the japanese 
import quotas on beef oranges and orange juice that it accepted in 
a 1984 accord that expired last month 
japanese beef and citrus producers who are influential in 
takeshitas governing liberaldemocratic party have argued that 
their livelihood would be threatened by increased imports 
in his statement yeutter branded the japanese quotas as 
incompatible with gatt rules he called on the japanese 
government to live up to its international obligations and 
agree to a gatt review of the us complaint instead of again 
blocking it 
it is essential that the japanese government join the united 
states and other major trading partners in pursuing and promoting 
open global trade in agriculture as well as industrial goods 
yeutter said 
that responsibility is not met he said by the use of 
gattinconsistent quotas or other barriers 
japan offered some concessions on beef but none of the us 
concern about citrus fruit was addressed to our satisfaction 
said yeutter 
the us target in the prolonged negotiations was elimination 
of the japanese beef and citrus quotas by a date certain along 
with a transparent and comprehensive package which would assure 
us beef and citrus producers full access to japans market he 
said 
in addition yeutter continued the united states wanted an 
immediate end to what he called the gattillegal requirement 
that imported orange juice be blended with japanese domestic juice 
and substantial cuts in citrus tariffs 
the japanese were willing to make concessions in some areas 
yeutter said but in exchange for lifting beef import quotas they 
wanted to substitute other measures that would sustain a high level 
of import protection this was understood to mean a proposal for 
surcharges on imports 
in addition none of our citrus concerns was addressed to our 
satisfaction under the japanese proposal us exporters and 
japanese consumers would continue to bear the cost and burden of 
japans insistence on constraining agricultural imports yeutter 
said 
sato will return to japan wednesday aides said 
the minister told reporters he regretted very much the failure 
to reach an agreement 
the japanese side was always pursuing realistic and practical 
solutions to this problem and we hope the us will in the future 
be more practical he said 
no plans for further talks were announced and sato said this 
depends on the content and outcome of us proposals to the gatt 
council 
he would not say however if japan will again seek to block 
formation of a gatt panel on the beef and orange dispute we have 
to examine japans attitude on the gatt he said the united 
states did not reject outright the japanese proposal for important 
surcharges instead of quotas sato said and this was not the main 
obstacle to an agreement

disclosures that president reagan and his wife 
consult astrologers have opened them to taunts from congress and 
criticism from scientists but the first lady isnt about to drop 
her longtime interest in stargazing an aide says 
she doesnt think that theres anything wrong with it it 
doesnt control policy and it doesnt control their lives elaine 
crispen the first ladys press secretary said tuesday 
white house officials were clearly discomfited by the revelation 
at one moment offering smiles and shrugs for reactions at others 
stern denials that serious policy matters have been left to 
soothsayers 
for the reagans it was the latest bit of gossip about their 
private lives to emerge from a recent spate of kissandtell books 
former chief of staff donald regan forced from his job last year 
after clashing repeatedly with the first lady over the presidents 
schedule has reportedly written that mrs reagan consulted 
astrologers to help arrange the presidents activities 
the presidents reaction to the uproar was quick 
no policy or decision in my mind has ever been influenced by 
astrology the president said tuesday 
reagan did not deny consulting astrologers who make forecasts 
based on the belief that the heavenly bodies form patterns that can 
reveal a persons character or future 
asked if astrology played a part in shaping his schedule reagan 
quipped you know im still looking for the fellas that tell me 
every day what im going to be doing 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater after acknowledging the 
first couples interest in astrology said he believes his own 
horoscope when it says i am destined to meet a beautiful woman 
and fall madly in love and get rich 
its all so silly mrs crispen said of the barrage of 
queries that inundated her desk dont you read your horoscope 
in response to reporters queries fitzwater acknowledged mrs 
reagan has had an interest in astrology for some time and that 
it was heightened by the march 30 1981 assassination attempt 
against her husband 
she was very concerned for her husbands welfare and 
astrology has been a part of her concern in terms of his 
activities he said 
both he and mrs crispen said the first lady had dealt with a 
friend involved in astrology who was helpful to her after the 
attempt on the presidents life but neither would reveal the 
friends name 
the spokesman said that as far as he knew reagans interest in 
astrology is limited to reading his horoscope however fitzwater 
noted the president has mentioned lucky numbers in speeches and 
jokingly has referred to the ghost of abraham lincoln residing in 
the white house family quarters 
mrs crispen said the first lady explained that her interest in 
astrology was due to the shock of the assassination attempt i 
dont think anyone realized how frightened i was i came close to 
losing him she quoted mrs reagan as saying 
mrs cripsen said the first lady has talked to this person 
about his reagans safety and travel but i dont know of any 
particular incident or example of schedule change made because of 
this 
she contended astrology was only an interest for the first 
lady and not a major factor in the reagans lives 
they both feel its unfortunate and a distraction and hardly 
relevant to the business of government fitzwater said however 
mrs crispen said mrs reagan has not lost her humor now that 
her secret had been revealed 
shes laughed about it mrs crispen said shes not 
upset because shes not got anything to hide because theres 
nothing wrong with it 
mrs crispen added that she believed mrs reagan will continue 
to talk to persons who have given her relief for the past few 
years shes the worrier and its one thing she could use 
to help her squelch that worry 
fitzwater said he expected the nations astrologers to make 
extraordinary claims about their influence on the reagans and one 
joyce jillson of los angeles immediately spoke up she claimed 
she had spent a lot of time at the white house and had played a 
role earlier in the selection of george bush as vice president 
the white house said the reagans did not know her and bushs 
office said were not aware of anyone hiring this woman 
one group of scientists said it was dismayed that the president 
and his wife have an interest in what they termed medieval 
superstition 
the committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the 
paranormal said dozens of tests in recent years have found 
little if any evidence for astrological claims horoscopes have 
been shown under the most rigorous scientific analysis to fail 
completely in predicting future events 
the consultation by political leaders of astrologers has all 
but disappeared from the modern scene the group added 
on capitol hill house speaker jim wright dtexas was asked 
what he thought about the reagans using astrologists he replied 
with a grin its all right with me im glad he consults 
somebody 
its a full moon out there now thats what brings the crazies 
out wright added 
rep james traficant dohio poked fun at the reagan from the 
floor of the house 
what can we expect from a president who schedules his press 
conferences and speeches based on the signs of the zodiac he 
asked

a group of worldfamous scientists intent on 
debunking the claims of astrologers says it is dismayed that 
president and mrs reagan use superstition and mystical 
fortune telling to make decisions 
the practice said the committee for the scientific 
investigation of claims of the paranormal harks back to ancient 
times when monarchs and emperors resorted to the musings of fortune 
tellers for advice 
we are concerned by the apparent return to medieval 
superstitition the statement said dozens of tests in recent 
years by scientists can find little if any evidence for 
astrological claims horoscopes have been shown under the most 
rigorous scientific analysis to fail completely in predicting 
future events 
the statement was released after reports on a forthcoming book 
by former white house chief of staff donald regan who says nancy 
reagan regularly consults astrologers in shaping her advice to the 
president reagan the book says also regularly reads his 
horoscope the white house later confirmed the reagans interest in 
astrology but said it did not influence any policy decisions 
if the united states is to continue its leadership in 
scientific research it is vital that the public have a clear 
understanding of the difference between science and pseudoscience 
and that decisions be based on the real world without resorting to 
mystical fortune telling and other primitive forms of 
prognostication the scientists group said 
paul kurtz chairman of the committee said he released the 
statement to counter publicity about astrology following disclosure 
of the reagans interest 
we ask the white house to confirm to what extent astrologers 
have been advisers of presidents kurtz said in the statement 
the public has the right to know who these astrologers are and 
what recommendations they have made we ask that their claims and 
alleged authorities be subjected to scientific scrutiny 
the scientists committee critically analyzes assertions by 
astrologers and by persons claiming unusual powers or perceptions 
members include nobel laureate fhc crick twotime nobel 
laureate murray gellmann noted psychologist b f skinner and 
authors issac asimov and carl sagan 
andrew fraknoi an astronomy professor at san francisco state 
university and a member of the committee said astrology has been 
put through vigorous scientific analysis dozens of times and has 
never been found to have validity 
fraknoi said that in one test two scientists examined more than 
3000 predictions by astrologers and found that they were correct 
less than 10 percent of the time 
if the predictions are wrong 90 percent of the time thats 
not the type of guidance we need from the federal government he 
said 
astrologers said fraknoi regularly use the positions of the 
uranus and neptune in making predictions even though those two 
planets were not even discovered when the concept of astrology was 
established in ancient times 
fraknoi said astrologers claim they make predictions based on 
the position of planets against a background of star 
constellations using methods developed by ancient observers 
yet he said the earths position has shifted so that 
constellations no longer are in the same relative viewing positions 
in effect all of the constellations have moved said 
fraknoi this puts the signs of the zodiac off by one whole 
sign 
the astrology concept that a persons future is shaped through 
some unexplained mechanism by the position of the stars and planets 
at the moment of birth also has been attacked scientifically he 
said 
he said a researcher checked groups of men who reenlisted in 
the marine corps based on astrology he said such a group would 
be motivated by the same or similar zodiacal signs yet said 
fraknoi there was no trend whatsoever the signs were randomly 
distributed 
another astrology concept is that people are more likely to find 
happiness with partners who have compatible signs the signs 
according to astrology are based on the time and month of birth 
fraknoi said a researcher checked 3500 marriage certificates 
and found that people are no more likely to pair up with those of 
compatible signs than they were with those of any other sign 
some astrologers said fraknoi have suggested that the 
gravitational and tidal effects of distant planets such as mars 
at the moment of birth can affect a persons future 
calculations by scientists said fraknoi show that the 
obstetrican who delivers a baby has a six times greater 
gravitational influence on a child than the planet mars the tidal 
effect of the obstetrican is greater by a factor of 2 trillion he 
said 
is this really something on which we want to base our national 
destiny fraknoi asked 
kurtz in his statement said the committee of scientists was 
concerned about damage that belief in astrology may cause 
scientists have been warning for years that the uncritical 
prominence given to astrology may have a deleterious effect on the 
public he said recent opinion polls have shown that up to 52 
percent of teenagers accept the validity of astrology the 
intrusion of astrology into the highest levels of national security 
thinking now is a cause for further concern

president reagan says he sees encouraging 
signs that religious oppression has abated somewhat in the soviet 
union 
in a speech tuesday devoid of the harsh criticism of recent 
weeks the president said mikhail s gorbachev has admitted the 
soviet union made mistakes dealing with religious believers in 
decades past and they would be rectified 
what we hope for ultimately is a willingness to see continued 
change in the spirit of glasnost when it comes to matters of 
religion reagan told a meeting on religious rights at the white 
house 
glasnost is the russian term for the soviet leaders policy of 
bringing openess to soviet society 
reagan was scheduled to address the issue of human rights again 
today in the soviet union during a speech in chicago to the 
national strategy forum a nonpartisan organization that sponsors 
educational programs on national security and foreign policy issues 
the address is another in a series of scenesetters for the 
upcoming may 29june 2 summit in moscow 
in tuesdays speech reagan said some dissidents have been 
allowed to emigrate from the soviet union some churches have been 
allowed to open and organize and the printing of 100000 bibles 
will be permitted 
these are encouraging signs and we welcome them reagan said 
but reagan added many churches have been denied recognition 
religious instruction outside the home is still illegal and the new 
bibles will scarcely serve a nation of 280 million 
so while every positive step taken by the soviets is welcomed 
we realize that this is just a beginning reagan said i 
promise you that the witness of faith you brought here today will 
not be confined to these four walls or forgotten when this meeting 
is ended 
i will carry it in my heart when i travel to the soviet union 
at the end of this month and i will say that the most fitting way 
to mark the millenium of christianity in kiev would be granting 
the rights of all the peoples and all the creeds of the soviet 
union to worship their god in their own way 
while noting the 1000th anniversary of christianity in the 
soviet union reagan also said the rights of soviet jews have 
taken up much of our official time and this is very close to my 
heart our hope is for doors to open completely to emigration and 
to full freedom for all faiths 
after the conference reagan told a ukrainian catholic leader he 
would visit an orthodox monastery in moscow despite the church 
leaders request reagan cancel the trip in protest of religious 
persecution 
he said he already made plans and he has to go myroslav 
cardinal lubachivsky told reporters 
the monastery on the outskirts of moscow the central building 
of which is more than 700 years old is being restored with 
government financial help 
the cardinal said he made the request because ukrainian 
catholics continue to suffer persecution 
today we hear so much about glasnost and perestroika he 
said but mr gorbachevs reforms have yet to touch the 
ukrainian catholic church our priests are punished or fined for 
celebrating the liturgy in private homes and the faithful live in 
constant fear of imprisonment such violations of basic human 
rights simply must not exist

the mother of ousted president 
ferdinand marcos died wednesday after appealing to president 
corazon aquino to allow her son to return from exile in hawaii as 
her dying wish 
dr sergio brillantes director of veterans memorial medical 
center said 95yearold josefa edralinmarcos suffered cardiac 
arrest at noon midnight tuesday and was pronounced dead 20 
minutes later 
mrs edralinmarcos had been hospitalized since sunday suffering 
from pneumonia diabetes and kidney failure she lapsed into a coma 
late tuesday brillantes said 
she died as mrs aquino convened her cabinets crisis committee 
to consider a request by mrs edralinmarcos to allow her son to 
return to see her one last time the request was made in a letter 
delivered tuesday to the presidential palace 
mrs edralinmarcos stayed behind in february 1986 when a 
militarycivilian uprising drove her son into exile after 20 years 
in power and lifted mrs aquino to the presidency mrs aquino 
since has refused to allow marcos to come back 
the former presidents supporters have been linked to several 
attempts to topple the aquino government on tuesday the military 
announced that troops had seized 30 rifles and 300 sticks of 
dynamite during a raid monday on a suburban machine shop owned by a 
marcos supporter 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa had said it was up 
to civilian authorities to decide whether to allow marcos to 
return but he indicated the military command was wary of such a 
request 
we will have to assess whether conditions in the past are 
still the same he told reporters on tuesday we still have 
certainly a serious threat situation in the country coming from 
communist rebels and we dont want additional problems 
before mrs edralinmarcos death justice secretary sedfrey 
ordonez told reporters today the decision on allowing marcos to 
return would have to be political and not based solely on legal 
considerations 
brillantes said mrs edralinmarcos underwent dialysis tuesday 
for her failing kidneys and was running a high fever he said she 
was comatose but she showed stable blood pressure and was 
breathing easier 
in her letter mrs edralinmarcos said she was near the end of 
her life my dying wish the one thing that will put a smile upon 
my lips when i leave this world is to see my ferdinand by my 
bedside as i say goodbye to all of you said the letter a copy 
of which was released by the presidential staff pray grant me 
this wish and this privilege as one mother to another 
the letter apparently drafted by family members included the 
thumb print of marcos mother 
in a separate letter the former presidents brother and sister 
dr pacifico marcos and mrs fortuna marcosbarba asked mrs 
aquino to grant our mothers final wish they were at her 
bedside when she died 
marcos supporters held a candlelight vigil and prayed for mrs 
edralinmarcos recovery dozens of marcos supporters jammed an 
adjacent hospital room to watch her through a small window 
mrs edralinmarcos came from a wealthy northern luzon family of 
filipino and chinese extraction marcos father mariano was a 
politician and lawyer who died in 1944 during the japanese 
occupation 
marcos was not allowed to return for the funeral of his sister 
elizabeth marcoskeon who died in december 1986

a driver is in greater danger of brain injury 
in the crash of a chevrolet g20 van than in any other vehicle 
tested by the government this year 
the national highway traffic safety administration said tuesday 
a 35 mph crash test of the g20 resulted in a headinjury criterion 
of 3665 the criterion is an index measuring the potential for 
brain injury 
the general motors corp van was crashed headon into a fixed 
barrier and the criterion was calculated from recordings made by 
an instrumentequipped dummy wearing a safety belt 
the chevrolet astro van test produced a drivers headinjury 
criterion of 1603 the ford f150 pickup 1074 the nissan van xe 
949 and the chevrolet c1500 pickup 892 
nhtsa earlier this year said the volkswagen vanagon produced a 
headinjury criteron of 1320 on the driver side 
the agency also released results showing the nissan pulsar nx 
produced a headinjury criterion of 1134 higher than that of any 
other 1988 subcompact car tested so far 
the agency earlier tested three other 1988 subcompacts the 
volkswagen fox produced a headinjury criterion of 1114 the toyota 
tercel 1005 and the toyota corolla fx 593 
the tests were conducted at 5 mph faster than the 30 mph 
required by law the higher speed produces a crash that is 
onethird more severe than at the lower speed nhtsa said 
at 30 mph 1000 is the highest headinjury criterion permitted 
only one vehicle of a given type is tested and further testing 
could produce different results nhtsa said 
compact cars tested earlier this year showed the peugeot 505 gls 
with a headinjury criterion of 1701 the nissan maxima se 907 
and the pontiac le mans aerocoupe 819 
in the large and midsize range the mercury sable produced a 
headinjury criterion of 712 and the ford taurus 707

as thousands take to the woods of the 
upper midwest in their annual hunt for morel mushrooms a company 
is on its way to stocking grocery store shelves yearround with the 
elusive delicacy 
morel hunting has become a tradition in the midwest from april 
to june with many communities sponsoring morel festivals 
complete with mushroom queens in honor of the fleeting fungus 
the fascination with the morel lies not only in its unique 
flavor which devotees say is as different from the common button 
mushroom as its appearance but in the hunt as well 
someone i spoke to once called it morel fishing rather than 
morel hunting said gloria anderson executive director of the 
chamber of commerce of boyne city which this weekend is host of 
the communitys 28thannual morel hunt michigans oldest 
one of the most common spots to find the morel is under a dying 
elm tree but it also can be found in apple orchards and almost 
everyone says not to walk past a mound of leaves because theres 
probably a morel or two underneath anderson said 
the novice simply must keep an eye out for the unique features 
of the morel especially its pitted cap resembling a sponge 
morel hunting can be hazardous because of the false morel which 
is often more plentiful and conspicuous than true morelswhen 
cooked the false morel with a wrinkled cap that looks more like a 
brain than a sponge can release a potentially deadly toxin 
most of the trouble comes in when people start 
experimenting says nancy weber a university of michigan 
mycologist 
guidebooks or searching an experienced morel hunter could make 
the job safer and easier she advises 
a lansingbased company also hopes to make it easier for morel 
lovers by enabling them to satisfy their cravings at gourmet shops 
rather than in the hinterland 
neogen an agricultural biotech company has found the secret to 
cultivating the morel indoors 
it claimed a patent in 1986 for morel cultivation and can grow 
the mushroom indoors 365 days a year by providing the environment 
that triggers its sex cycle company vice president brinton miller 
said 
plans for commercialization of the domesticated morel are under 
way and miller predicts morels will be on shelves probably only 
in gourmet shops in the united states and in switzerland next 
year he said licensing agreements for morel production are being 
negotiated with companies in the far east and europe 
there will be production capabilities to make morels available 
to anyone who wants them miller said wed love to make the 
morel a favorite at christmas nobody even thinks about having 
morels now at christmas 
because of the mushrooms short season and the laborious search 
involed morels now sell for as much as 15 to 30 per pound here 
and an ounce can cost nearly that much in some new york city 
gourmet shops even with indoor cultivation miller predicts 
wholesale prices with remain between 12 and 20 per pound 
despite the increased availability miller said he believes 
morel hunts will continue 
there are zillions of people who go out and fish for trout 
when you can get them yearround at trout farms miller said 
this is the same thing

michael dukakis isnt exactly asking jesse 
jackson to quit the race for the democratic presidential nomination 
in the wake of repetitive landslides in ohio and indiana but hes 
obviously had enough taunts to last for the rest of the nominating 
season 
its pretty tame stuff especially compared with jacksons 1984 
campaign rhetoric but democratic leaders already are urging 
dukakis sole remaining rival to tone down his rhetoric in the five 
weeks left in the primary season in hopes of maximizing the 
chance of defeating vice president george bush in november 
but whether dukakis or anyone else can cause jackson to back off 
is an open question all they really can do without risking offense 
to jacksons following is to ask politely and that doesnt exactly 
make dukakis sound like the strong effective leader he wants the 
country to think he is 
i dont mind disagreements on issues he said tuesday night 
as he celebrated his midwestern victories while losing the district 
of columbia i just hope we can both continue to campaign with 
the respect weve had for each other in the past year 
for a man who has elevated caution to an art form that amounts 
to a blunt statement that hes had enough of observations like this 
jackson critique of dukakis style the kitchen is clean and 
cool aint nothing cooking 
that is mild compared with jacksons 1984 campaign when he 
complained about party rules and waged a miniplatform fight at the 
party convention that gave walter f mondale his nomination and 
dukakis and his aides must realize that 
nonetheless its obviously beginning to nettle dukakis and it 
probably delights vice president george bush and the men who are 
planning his general election campaign as the designated republican 
successor to president reagan 
bush has taken a few shots of his own at dukakis in recent days 
although aides say his candidacy will be based on the traditional 
virtues of peace and prosperity the vice president has already 
shown hes prepared to meet dukakis likely lines of attack head on 
asked about attorney general edwin meese and his legal 
difficulties bush said he could go into a guiltbyassociation 
mode that involves massachusetts politics or dukakis campaign 
staff 
asked about dukakis criticisms of the administrations handing 
of panama bush replied i cant wait for mr dukakis to discuss 
the noriega matter one of the beautiful things about being a 
new candidate without a heck of a lot of experience in foreign 
affairs is you can make dramatic statements without necessarily 
having the proof 
all this is coming at dukakis at the same time that jackson has 
sharpened his rhetoric in the days following last weeks 
pennsylvania primary defeat 
party leaders are already hinting to jackson that with tuesday 
nights landslides it may be time to give dukakis some breathing 
room 
i would hope he wouldnt say anything that could be used 
against mike in the general election arkansas gov bill clinton 
said after tuesdays primaries 
he has at every turn in the road said its imperative for a 
democrat to be elected said clinton who added that dukakis had 
asked governors to withhold their endorsements until he could prove 
himself in the primaries 
most democratic officials arent interested in any additional 
debate as they seek to recapture the white house and end eight 
years of republican rule after gary harts two entrances and exits 
from the campaign not to mention joseph bidens political 
immolation and a long winter of turbulent primary campaigning 
theyve had all the excitement they want 
it may be boring but i love it said democratic national 
committee vice chair lynn cutler as she surveyed a race that now 
seems all but tucked away for dukakis 
judy carnahan the oregon democratic party chair said where 
i am personally disappointed is that for so long jackson did so 
well as a coalition builder and bringing people together and then 
within the last week or so seems to have a reverse type of position 
and has started attacking dukakis 
i find that very disappointing what hes managing to do is 
diminish his own stature 
under the ordinary rules of politics jackson would be long gone 
from the campaign joining bruce babbitt gary hart and the rest of 
the alsorans on the sidelines after going six weeks without a 
primary victory 
but the normal rules of politics dont apply to jackson and for 
good reason 
he alone of dukakis past and present rivals has a demonstrable 
following that numbers in the millions and can make or break a 
democratic nominee in the race to succeed reagan

democrats seeking to head off a presidential 
veto of the trade bill or gain enough votes for an override are 
wooing alaskas two senators with a promise to consider more 
lenient export rules for that states oil 
the move came tuesday with house introduction of a resolution 
authorizing technical corrections in the trade bill which 
cleared the senate 6336 last week the margin was three votes shy 
of what would be needed to override a veto 
the corrections would be made in two provisions opposed by 
alaskan oil interests 
one of the provisions would approve export of 50000 barrels a 
day of alaskan crude oil to canada but would require the oil to be 
transported first to a west coast port in american vessels the 
feature is a favorite of politically influential maritime unions 
and lawmakers from states whose ports could benefit 
the other provision would limit exports from new refineries in 
alaska to 70000 barrels and day and half of total production 
the house is expected later this week to take up the resolution 
authorizing changes with senators likely to act next week when 
they return from a recess 
house speaker jim wright dtexas described the resolution as a 
lastditch effort to dissuade president reagan from his threatened 
veto 
were trying to meet him halfway if we can wright said 
but republicans immediately scoffed that the real reason was to 
pick up the two votes from alaskas senators for an override 
attempt 
reagans opposition to the trade bill stems in large part to a 
provision to require all but the smallest companies to provide 
their employees with 60day notice of plant closings and 
largescale layoffs democrats have been threatening to make that 
an issue in fall campaigns 
more recently the president has reportedly objected to the 
alaska oil provisions wright said that was one reason the 
democrats are attempting to remove them and replace them with 
funding for a study that would not have any direct impact on 
exports 
were trying in every way to appeal to his better nature 
wright said 
but just before wrights plan went through the rules committee 
rep james quillen rtenn described it as a ploy to change 
some votes in the senate in order to override a possible 
presidential veto 
house minority leader robert h michel rill took the floor 
and accused wright of trying to win at all costs 
i am told there is a proposed new rule in the works that will 
allow the majority to delete the alaskan oil provisions in a 
lastditch attempt to manipulate a veto override in the senate 
michel said is there nothing left of the integrity of our rules 
and procedures 
despite the maneuvering one of the alaska senators ted 
stevens has said he will not necessarily back the trade bill even 
if the export curbs are dropped

this innovative yankee town which once 
considered building a dome over itself to keep out the harsh 
vermont winter is trying to tax neighboring burlington for its 
noisy use of winooskis airspace 
the western vermont town of about 6300 people sits at the end 
of burlington international airports runway and its downtown is 
just off the airports main approach 
residents say the noise from helicopters vermont national guard 
fighters and jets flying in and out of vermonts largest city can 
be unbearable 
they go right over our building alice levesque said 
recently its really an awful thing they wouldnt do that to a 
herd of cows 
winooski officials saying the planes were invading their 
airspace decided to tax burlington burlington balked 
winooski contending that burlington hadnt paid the taxes then 
filed suit in chittenden county superior court to collect on a bill 
of 90000 plus interest 
by flying that low they have essentially confiscated the land 
that is below that air said dominique casavant a physics 
professor and former winooski selectman the airport noise 
depresses land values casavant said 
yes it is unusual but this is not the first time 
winooski has set precedent casavant said 
in 1979 a dome to cover the town was proposed to save energy 
and ward off winter the proposal was the subject of an 
international symposium and federal money was requested to study 
it but the project never got out of the planning stages 
officials argue that they arent taxing the planes but the 
space they use when they land and take off 
property taxes are not novel said winooski city manager 
brendan keleher property taxes are our business 
burlington has dismissed the airspace tax although bernard 
sanders the citys outspoken socialist mayor applauded winooski 
for its imagination 
as somebody who is interested in alternatives to the property 
tax i have to congratulate our friends in the city of winooksi 
sanders said its an interesting concept but not terribly 
practical if winooski could do it so could toledo we would be 
evolved to a toll booth in the sky 
landowners have sued over airspace rights in the past but 
experts said they cannot recall a case where one city sued another 
to collect taxes for airspace 
walter hellerstein a university of georgia law professor and 
tax expert said he had not seen the suit but called the idea 
behind it bizarre 
it seems to me it would be as if the state of iowa were 
trying to tax the city of san francisco hellerstein said 
explaining that a plane might fly over the midwestern state on its 
way to the west coast ive never heard of anything like this 
but peter teachout a professor at vermont law school in south 
royalton said the lawsuit is not so farfetched even if it 
presents some practical problems 
teachout said the city faces the difficulty of placing a 
monetary value on the airspace tax values are normally established 
by properties market values 
how do you figure out what that airspace is worth he asked 
nobody is going to pay for it 
the lawsuit also has to draw a boundary on the airspace in 
question and has to show that winooskis situation is different 
from that of most other communities where planes overhead fly at 
greater altitudes teachout said 
that would be the toughest problem convincing a court it 
isnt going to be opening up the floodgates to future suits

his way home with his briefcase and a newspaper hoffman said 
this could have been anybody in metropolitan la hoffman 
said this fellow was just walking down the street minding his 
own business and these young fellows just drive by and shoot him 
it was just a random thing the poor guy was in the wrong place 
at the wrong time 
community leaders also asked street gang members to observe a 
weeklong truce in honor of mothers day and cinco de mayo the may 
5 mexican holiday 
i have a message for gang members your mothers dont want to 
lose you said steve valdivia executive director of community

the country will need to build or renovate 36 
million new housing units over the next 15 years to address the 
problems faced by americans living in substandard and overcrowded 
conditions a study reported today 
the study prepared by the urban institute said that over 6 
percent of housing units in urban areas and 17 percent of units in 
rural areas dont meet minimum standards set by the department of 
housing and urban development 
the study was financed by the national association of realtors 
the report said 77 million households are living in substandard 
units and another 32 million are in overcrowded conditions 
under the hud definition a home is classified as substandard if 
it does not have electricity lacks adequate plumbing or lacks 
sewage disposal 
we are reminded daily of the homeless on our streets and 
shelters less visible but no better off are those who live in 
inadequate housing or who pay the majority of their incomes just to 
stay off these streets nestor weigand president of the realtors 
association said in presenting the study 
the study estimated that it would cost 41 billion over the next 
15 years to build or upgrade the 36 million units it estimated 
would be needed to eliminate substandard housing in the united 
states 
the study also estimated it would take an additional 56 billion 
in subsidy payments to insure that households were not paying more 
than 30 percent of their income for housing 
the study said this would break down to an increase of 65 
billion annually over and above current government subsidy efforts 
the study did not address the likelihood of getting such 
additional funds through congress at a time of budget constraints 
imposed by the high federal deficits the reagan administration has 
generally opposed any new housing initiatives and scaled back many 
of the programs in existence when it came into office in 1981 
the realtors association study is the latest of several recent 
reports which have looked into the countrys housing needs in 
march the national housing task force issued a report recommending 
a 12year program with a goal of providing livable housing for all 
americans 
the private task force recommended the program begin with an 
initial appropriation of 3 billion to be used as seed money to 
stimulate state and local efforts to develop and renovate 
lowincome housing

the house says the united states ought to keep 
at least 20 missilefiring submarines and natos nonnuclear forces 
should be improved 
both proposals were approved tuesday on voice votes as 
nonbinding amendments to the pentagon budget bill now on the floor 
of the democraticcontrolled chamber 
the amendments affect a pair of ussoviet arms control efforts 
the strategic arms reduction talks aimed at cutting each sides 
longrange arsenals by 50 percent and the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces pact eliminating mediumrange nuclear missiles 
both superpowers have longrange arsenals of submarinelaunched 
missiles bombers and landbased missiles with the submarines 
considered to the least vulnerable to attack the start treaty 
would require major changes and restructuring of those stockpiles 
more than half the us strategic nuclear firepower is now 
contained on 36 missilefiring submarines which include 28 older 
poseidonclass subs and eight ohioclass subs seven more tridents 
are under constructions and a 16th is part of the bill on the house 
floor 
while the future composition of the us arsenal is 
undetermined it should include at least 20 subs said the 
amendment by rep stephen solarz dny 
solarz said the proposal is designed to insure that our 
strategic nuclear submarine force is not jeopardized by the start 
talks we must insure that we have the maximum number of these 
submarines possible within the overall framework of the triad 
also approved on a voice vote was an amendment by rep jack 
buechner rmo urging president reagan to upgrade conventional 
forces in the 16member north atlantic treaty organization 
reagan is already urging nato to improve its nonnuclear forces 
which will assume greater importance in deterring a warsaw pact 
attack when the americanbuilt mediumrange nuclear missiles are 
removed 
as it plowed through the bill the house also approved by close 
margins a pair of measures that give federal contractors more 
leeway in setting pay scales 
the first decision by a 213195 vote approved an overhaul of 
the davisbacon act that is a 1931 law which directs that 
employees covered by contracts on federal jobs worth more than 
2000 be paid prevailing local wage rates a figure set by the 
labor department the rates are usually those paid union employees 
the proposal passed tuesday raises the threshold figure from 
2000 to 50000 
moments later the house voted 210204 to reject an amendment 
that would have raised the davisbacon threshold even higher to 
250000 
the law was passed during the great depression to assuage fears 
that construction companies would hire cheap labor critics say the 
measure has been overtaken by events and should be changed but 
defenders including organized labor call it a linchpin of 
workers protection 
the votes generally split along party lines with democrats 
backing the 50000 threshold and republicans supporting the 
250000 threshold 
in other votes tuesday the house

approved on a voice vote an amendment banning deployment of 
any coast guard vessels to the persian gulf the pentagon has 
already announced that the plan was scuttled in the face of stiff 
congressional opposition and backers of the amendment had planned 
to drop it as unnecessary but a procedural snarl made it easier to 
simply approve the amendment than to bypass it 
gave voice vote approval to a ban on spending for the bigeye 
bomb the problemplagued chemical weapon the bill provides no new 
money for the bomb which has run into a series of technical 
problems

sen howard metzenbaum and clevelands 
republican mayor george voinovich predict that their showdown in 
november in the us senate race will be one of the fiercest and 
most expensive in state history 
you mark my words the most focusedon race in the united 
states is going to be metzenbaumvoinovich voinovich said tuesday 
after metzenbaums primary victory 
this will be a barnburner if dukakis and bush dont get them 
out voinovich and metzenbaum will the mayor said 
metzenbaum agreed there was a tough battle ahead 
there isnt a political hit list in america that doesnt 
have me at the top of it i must be doing something right in the 
senate if so many people want to beat me he told reporters in 
cleveland 
metzenbaum seeking a third term at age 70 easily survived a 
primary challenge from ralph applegate 56 who runs a small 
lawncare business in columbus and did no active campaigning with 
96 percent of the vote counted metzenbaum had 1043624 votes or 
84 percent to applegates 206184 or 16 percent 
voinovich 51 was unopposed for the gop nomination 
in the presidential primaries massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis easily outpolled jesse jackson and claimed most of the 159 
democratic delegates at stake on the republican side george bush 
had no active opposition for 88 delegates 
with 98 percent of the vote counted dukakis had 853902 votes 
or 63 percent compared with 373497 votes or 28 percent for 
jackson six other counties split the rest of the vote 
in the race for the states 159 delegates dukakis was leading 
for 115 while jackson was ahead for 41 
in the 5th congressional district ohio senate president paul 
gillmor appeared to have won a razorthin victory over the son of 
the retiring incumbent us rep delbert latta and a third 
candidate final unofficial returns showed gillmor with 28666 
votes to 28608 for robert latta rex damschroder ran a distant 
third 
in the 20th district democratic rep mary rose oakar easily 
defeated former cleveland mayor dennis kucinich with 99 percent of 
the vote counted ms oakar had 64143 votes or 77 percent to 
19454 or 23 percent for kucinich 
ms oakar said she was overwhelmed by the margin of victory 
kucinich was in a joking mood 
i hate to lose when its close but this one wasnt close so 
its not that bad he said the cleveland indians had a bad 
year last year they came back 
in cincinnati voters narrowly approved a proposal to increase 
the citys 2 percent earnings tax to 21 percent to raise money for 
repairs of deteriorating streets and bridges the hamilton county 
board of elections said the issue won 5024 percent to 4974 
percent 
voinovich a popular mayor for 8 years has claimed credit for 
pulling cleveland out of the default on bank loans that occurred 
during kucinichs stormy tenure 
voinovich has struggled to overcome what he concedes is 
metzenbaums advantage in name recognition and already has spent 
more than 1 million much of it on media ads 
the metzenbaum campaign has spent more than 800000 since jan 
1 and has a campaign warchest of more than 3 million for the fall 
election

small field tests of genetically engineered 
organisms dont pose much risk to the environment according to a 
congressional study released today 
although there are enough uncertainties that introductions 
should be approached with caution a large body of reassuring data 
derived chiefly from agriculture supports the conclusion that with 
appropriate regulatory oversight the field tests planned or 
probable in the near future are not likely to result in serious 
ecological problems concluded the review by the office of 
technology assessment 
the study said its conclusions applied to developments likely in 
the next five years mostly in agriculture and mostly to organisms 
produced using the socalled recombinant techniques for 
inserting genes of one species into the dna the genetic material 
of another 
so far there have been about two dozen field tests of one kind 
or another in 12 states and four foreign countries the study said 
these include plants engineered to resist pests pesticides or 
diseases bacteria to confer on plants resistance to frost and new 
animal vaccines 
researchers are planning engineered microbes that can 
concentrate metallic ores and digest toxic wastes 
it is important to note that modifying organisms for specific 
human ends is not new the study said selective breeders of 
plants and animals have been transferring genes for millennia 
often creating forms through centuries of selection that differ 
from their original stocks more than the forms produced by 
recombinant dna methods 
in agriculture a new crop strain or rotation probably could 
ease or control damage if any from experiments gone awry the 
report said 
in those rare circumstances of a negative impact on a natural 
community the consequence seems most likely to be a transitory 
disturbance of plant or animal community structure the study 
said 
the worst possibilities appear to be to disrupt a fundamental 
ecosystem process it said 
the existence in ecosystems of many species performing the same 
functions and the resilience of ecosystems are persuasive 
arguments against the likelihood of such consequences it said 
regulatory agencies soon should have enough experience to sort 
planned introductions into broad categories for which low medium 
or high levels of review are appropriate ota said 
counter examples can be provided from existing experience to 
negate almost any proposed category from review but experience 
is piling up so fast that the agencies might be able to ease 
requirements in some cases even to the point of exemptions from 
review the report said

the united states had a record trade deficit 
last year with countries ruled by communist governments the us 
international trade commission reports 
overall trade was also a record with total exchanges in both 
directions increasing to 138 billion from 117 billion in 1986 
but the united states bought 25 billion worth of goods more than 
it sold compared with 16 billion the previous year 
the report made available this week details only the second 
time since 1965 that the united states has had a deficit in trade 
with these countries 
the deficit would have been greater except for the us 
government subsidies on the sale of wheat a major export to 
communist nations the soviet union china poland and bulgaria 
along with us agricultural interests all benefited from these 
subsidies 
the soviets agreed to buy 4 million metric tons or about 144 
million bushels for delivery before sept 30 their first 
purchases since october 1985 by the end of the year they had 
agreed to buy another 48 million tons or about 174 million 
bushels for the following crop year us exports of wheat to the 
soviets were worth 389 million in 1987 
us subsidies on these sales varied from 19 to 40 a ton they 
were given to meet competition from other countries largely in 
western europe which also subsidized their exports 
the commission an independent us government agency said that 
although the soviets had a good overall grain crop last year wheat 
output declined by nearly 15 percent and much of what they produced 
was not quality wheat 
china bought 4 million tons sales of us wheat to china were 
worth 139 million in 1987 
the growth of us imports from communist governments was almost 
entirely the result of increased buying from china over a third of 
the us puchases from china were clothes and other textiles for a 
total value of 25 billion up from 21 billion the year before

for the first time there are highlevel 
moves in napa valley toward limiting establishment of new wineries 
in the nations top wineproducing region 
the napa county board of supervisors and the napa valley 
vintners association believe the time may have come to put the 
brakes on winery development in the valley north of san francisco 
twenty years ago the valley had 33 wineries by 1978 the number 
more than doubled to 74 today there are about 200 in the valley 
which is only 30 miles long by four miles wide 
during those years a napa wine beat out the best wines of 
france in a paris blind tasting establishing napa wines as world 
class 
since then buyers from a dozen countries have been purchasing 
napa wineries and uncounted vineyards up and down the state prime 
napa producing vineyard land sells for up to 42000 an acre 
we must preserve this place said robert a dwyer executive 
director of the vintners association representing the most 
successful us wine producers whats at stake is the quality of 
life here 
with the growing success of napa wines land prices rose but 
that didnt stop buyers sapporo brewers of japan recently paid 
more than 35000 an acre to abbott vineyards for producing land in 
the prized carneros area 
another section of producing vineyards went to domaine mumm of 
france for 42000 an acre bare land it takes four years for a 
new vine to produce mature grapes goes for 2000022000 an 
acre still its a sellers market 
the mark of napa valley is magic cabernet sauvignon grapes from 
the valley can get a 25 percent higher tonnage price than grapes 
grown elsewhere and which might even be of higher quality 
in midmarch the vintners association voted to submit a 
proposal to the county planning commission barring further winery 
construction in napa countys designated agricultural watershed 
districts 85 percent of the county 
the association also wants a winery production zone to 
grandfather all the existing wineries in the county the issue 
is to go before the commission in midjune 
dwyer who spoke of a valley whose traditions go back to 1838 
said the theory is to give legitimacy to the wineries that are 
here anybody who wanted to rezone agricultural preserve land 
would have to jump through some pretty restrictive hoops 
the action came on a note of alarm the vintners some of whose 
vineyards were planted 125 years ago had noticed that the planning 
commission over 18 months had received applications for use permits 
for 40 prospective wineries 
within two weeks a record 27 applications were received for new 
wineries 
we usually get only two maybe three applications a month 
planning director jim hickey said 
i think were reaching the limit and they supervisors want 
to examine the density issue he said that has never come up 
before the board wants the department to look into the question 
how many wineries should be in a given geographical area what 
would be the criteria

vice president george bush was heading west 
today after celebrating his lock on the republican presidential 
nomination as a first step a tremendously important step 
bush backers threw an over the top party for him tuesday 
night at a washington hotel a few blocks from the white house the 
vice president actually secured the 1139 delegates needed for the 
nomination a week earlier in the pennsylvania primary 
bush was making a threeday campaign trip through california 
montana and idaho aides said the trip was important to bushs 
effort to position himself for the fall campaign and to keep his 
workers energized 
at tuesday nights celebration which came as bush rolled up a 
trio of primary wins in ohio pennsylvania and the district of 
columbia the vice president rejoiced in his success but told 
campaign aides and volunteers now weve got a long way to go 
a son george bush jr had more direct advice sometimes a 
son can say things a father cant we want you to go out there and 
kick some mike dukakis and kick him hard 
the reference to the democratic frontrunner by the younger bush 
recalled bushs offcolor remarks to new jersey longshoremen in 
1984 following his debate with democratic vice presidential 
candidate geraldine ferraro 
bush jr told the rally our dad needs a real job 
bush himself said his mathematical lock on the nomination last 
week wrapped this thing up sooner than i think any of us thought 
might take place 
it all boiled down to working together he said and yet i 
dont feel any finality to what has happened now at all 
the vice president said his lock on the nomination was a first 
step a tremendously important step but he cautioned against 
complacency 
still bush declared to rousing cheers the party is united 
let mike dukakis go around here talking about pink slips 
despair pessimism in the united stats he said ill be the 
guy out there talking about hope and opportunity and challenge 
republican party chairman frank fahrenkopf told the gathering 
tonight we officially celebrate the fact that george bush will be 
our nominee following the convention in new orleans 
bush planned campaign stops in sacramento and los angeles today 
on thursday he was to visit a high school in east los angeles and 
attend a gop barbecue near boise idaho 
on friday he campaigns in montana and nebraska 
i think that the importance of the west is evident said 
campaign spokesman peter teeley california is extraordinarily 
important to the november outcome as a result we have to get out 
there and begin to build a base of support 
bush planned three separate trips to california and other 
western states between now and the june 7 california primary 
we cant ignore the west teeley said weve got 
organizations in place and people on the ground that have been 
working for us youve got to keep those troops energized

jewish settlers in israels 
embattled northern border cheered the armys incursion into 
southern lebanon but said the operation would provide only 
temporary relief from arab guerrilla attacks 
if the lebanon war didnt do the job this operation certainly 
wont said moni levy 34 secretary of this communal farm about 
two miles south of the border levy was referring to the 1982 
israeli invasion of lebanon that led to a threeyear occupation 
israeli troops on monday night launched their largest operation 
in lebanon in two years moving north of israels selfdesignated 
security zone to search for arab guerrillas 
the incursion followed a week in which palestinian guerrillas 
twice penetrated israels northern border illing two israeli 
soldiers five guerrillas also were killed 
since then residents say life in northern border settlements 
has become more tense 
fewer people leave their homes at night they jump at every 
little sound said amos or secretary of kibbutz dafna another 
communal farm about one mile from the border 
or said his children had taken to playing soldiers and 
guerrillas after last weeks raids 
they put rags on their heads and pretended they were 
guerrillas on a hostagetaking mission he said 
when the alert was sounded last week indicating a possible 
guerrilla infiltration residents of the communal farms went into a 
practiced routine they have come to know all too well over the 
years 
women locked themselves into their small onestory homes with 
the children for a nervewracking vigil until the guerrillas were 
caught 
the men grabbed weapons they keep in their homes and headed for 
fences or watchtowers to guard their settlement 
kibbutzniks as residents are called have learned important 
lessons from past guerrilla attacks 
they remember vividly the night of nov 25 1987 when a lone 
palestinian guerrilla landed a hang glider inside the border made 
his way to an army post and killed six soldiers before being shot 
to death 
during that night we learned how hard it was for the women in 
the houses to stay alone without knowing what was going on levy 
said since then he said the kibbutz has set up a hot line 
staffed by volunteers and a social worker who people can call when 
a real alert is on 
levy described elaborate exercises held jointly with the army 
every few months in which a hostagetaking operation is staged at 
kfar szold 
every few months the army takes a house shoots a little bit 
in the air then takes a few hostages here levy said 
he said each kibbutz in the region had prepared for the worst by 
training a team of arabicspeaking residents to negotiate with 
guerrillas in case a hostage situation developed before the army 
arrived 
in other exercises kibbutzniks practice storming a guerrilla 
outpost in an area outside the settlement levy said 
similar training exercises have become a part of life in 
metulla a border town of 1500 overlooking the hills of southern 
lebanon 
everybody under 65 years of age has a job said bialik 
belski owner of the towns arazim hotel he said tasks range from 
transporting the elderly into shelters to standing guard at the 
edge of town 
yossi goldberg head of metullas city council commended the 
armys defense of the northern settlements but he complained the 
government had not fulfilled its obligations to the town where 
50 percent of our problems are securityrelated 
goldberg said metulla badly needs a medical clinic because the 
nearest hospital is an hours drive away in the northern town of 
zefat he said metulla had been promised more psychologists to help 
residents deal with fears of attack but none had been provided 
the government has made a lot of promises it hasnt kept 
goldberg said we expect the government to take care of its 
citizens 
when the army launched its search operation monday night 
residents in kibbutz kfar szold were relieved 
it can only help if they clean up the place once in a while 
levy said i hope it will do something 
along with sighs of relief came skepticism that the operation 
would have any longterm impact 
there will be a deterrent effect for some time but then 
the guerrilla activity will just increase again or said 
there is no alternative to going in after the guerrillas 
belski said but they will come back every minister in the 
government knows that

more beer and fewer pork chops are what the 
future holds for the average chinese the department of agriculture 
predicts 
during the 1980s chinas beer production increased more than 
sevenfold and is expected to have reached 5 billion liters in 
1987 says david schoonover the agricultural counselor at the 
us embassy in beijing 
the goal for the current fiveyear plan likely will be 
fulfilled in 1988 two years early 
that figure still allows only a modest gallon or so a year for 
the average chinese because the countrys population is now well 
over 1 billion a liter is slightly larger than a quart 
that gallon average compares with more than 38 gallons a year 
for the average west german and 24 gallons for each man woman and 
child in the united states according to the latest figures 
available from the us beer institute 
when it comes to pork the main source of meat for the chinese 
the prospect is for a shortage schoonover finds 
his brief report is quoted in the may edition of the 
departments foreign agriculture 
it says supplies of pork in china are already short but gives 
no figures on consumption over 90 percent of chinese pigs live 
with only one to three other pigs on small family farms he 
calculates he says it is now being proposed that production be 
turned over more to larger units that can take advantage of 
economies of scale 
in economies run by communist governments the small plots 
permitted to private farmers are generally much more productive 
than larger state farms 
from the us farmers viewpoint what pigs and beer have in 
common is that both are products of grain a major us export 
the new policy of concentrating pig production on large state 
farms cooperatives and in specialized households is likely to 
encourage greater imports of feed grains schoonover wrote 
currently the diets of 90 percent of chinas hogs are 
comprised mostly of slop he wrote 
he reports that chinas homegrown barley is not up to the 
standard required by brewers he says in 1986 china imported 
200000 to 300000 metric tons of malting barley with canada the 
main source of supply 
he also implies that china may need to import hops the other 
main ingredient of beer he says the country grows enough hops fr 
its own needs in most years and even exports some depending on the 
weather but adds it does not have the equipment to prepare and 
store the crop in surplus years

democratic voters in ohio and indiana gave gov 
michael dukakis good news on two fronts broad support as their 
presidential nominee and a relatively free rein to pick a vice 
presidential running mate 
overall the signs dont look bad for november for dukakis 
if he wins the presidential nomination said abc news poll analyst 
doug muzzio 
he does well in the horse race against bush muzzio said 
he brings the reagan democrats back home and while hes not 
winning the black vote he shows the ability to get it in the 
general election 
if there was a downside to dukakis landslides in tuesdays 
primaries it was that a plurality of his ohio voters had 
reservations about the massachusetts governor and sizable shares 
of voters were unfamiliar with his ideology 
dukakis had limited success drawing black voters from jesse 
jackson who has enjoyed massive black support dukakis won 12 
percent of the black vote in indiana but only 4 percent in ohio 
cbs newsnew york times polls said 
nonetheless about 60 percent of jacksons supporters said they 
would vote for dukakis if he were the nominee against george bush 
abcs exit poll said a third said they would not vote but the 
turnout of black democrats in past elections indicates otherwise 
muzzio said 
one issue for the democrats is whether jacksons voters would 
accept a ticket that did not include him at least as the vice 
presidential nominee and the abc poll indicated many would muzzio 
said 
while 80 percent of jacksons voters said they wanted him to be 
the vice presidential nominee if dukakis wins majorities 57 
percent in ohio and 63 percent in indiana said the ultimate 
choice should be up to the winner 
even greater shares of the dukakis voters more than 80 percent 
said the nomination winner should pick his own running mate rather 
than being bound to choose the secondplace finisher the finding 
jibed with high unfavorable ratings of jackson among dukakis 
supporters 
when abc asked voters if they favored jackson sen albert gore 
jr or someone else to run for vice president with dukakis only 
about 15 percent of the democrats in both states chose jackson 
just over 30 percent took gore and pluralities about 40 percent 
said someone else 
in the cbstimes poll about 60 percent of dukakis supporters 
said jackson should not be offered the vice presidential 
nomination and only as many said they would vote for dukakis in 
the fall if jackson ran with him 
without a running mate specified 77 percent of the democrats 
said they would vote for dukakis over bush in november with 10 
percent for bush and 9 percent saying they wouldnt vote the 
cbstimes polls said 
among the dukakis backers tuesday were sizable numbers of 
democrats who voted for president reagan in 1984 the abc polls 
said seventeen percent of the democrats in indiana and 16 percent 
in ohio said they backed reagan in 1984 twothirds of them in ohio 
and 81 percent in indiana said they would support dukakis over bush 
in november 
it indicates theyre coming home in one sense said muzzio 
not only does dukakis win landslide wins in ohio and indiana but 
in the numbers he can see some not bad news for november 
one less positive sign for dukakis was in the strength of his 
support in ohio where a plurality of his voters 45 percent said 
in the cbstimes poll that they backed him with reservations to 41 
percent who supported him strongly in indiana however 51 percent 
of dukakis support was strong 
also while 45 percent of democrats in ohio and 53 percent in 
indiana said dukakis was just about right ideologically as 
opposed to too liberal or too conservative considerable numbers 
34 percent in ohio and 28 percent in indiana said they didnt 
know 
dukakis is still somewhat of an unknown ideologically said 
muzzio a lot of people still dont have a handle on him this 
late in the primary season 
the polls had margins of sampling error of 3 points

michael dukakis edged a bit closer to laying claim 
to the democratic presidential nomination with a pair of landslide 
primary victories in ohio and indiana 
asked tuesday night whether he thought democratic rival jesse 
jackson could take the lead away from him now dukakis said its 
going to be difficult 
even so the massachusetts governor vowed to campaign 
aggressively in the remaining primary states he said he hoped to 
lock up enough delegates to win the nomination and to broaden his 
exposure for a likely fall campaign against vice president george 
bush 
i want people to get to know me more and more and the way to 
do that is to go out and campaign hard said dukakis 
dukakis was spending a day at the statehouse today and attending 
a fundraiser in new jersey and a democratic party dinner in new 
york city tonight 
asked if his primary wins on tuesday night and in recent weeks 
were a trend that jackson should take note of he said i hope 
so jackson scored a victory in tuesdays district of columbia 
primary however 
i feel great about today and the results today dukakis said 
dukakis who has come under increasing criticism from jackson 
lately refused to say whether he thought jackson should tone town 
the rhetoric 
hes going to have to make that judgment dukakis said 
im going to try to keep this as positive as i can 
dukakis was campaigning thursday in west virginia and nebraska 
both states hold primaries next tuesday 
the governor was in a jovial mood following his two primary 
victories joking about the white house admission that nancy reagan 
sometimes seeks the advice of an astrologist before setting the 
presidents schedule 
i hope that the nations decisions beginning in january 1989 
will be based on something other than horoscopes he said 
later he referred to reagans pending endorsement of bush as 
the astrological endorsement

the end of the primary season 
all the way to california and new jersey he said at a 
victory party at a washington hotel we keep on winning

votes or 802 percent compared with 14969 or 177 percent for 
massachussetts gov michael dukakis

three for dukakis

illegal aliens who left the country 
briefly without permission from immigration officials may be 
eligible for an extension of todays amnesty deadline a federal 
judge has ruled 
us district judge lawrence k karlton on tuesday declared 
invalid a rule that made aliens ineligible for legalization if they 
left the united states since november 1986 
karlton scheduled a thursday hearing on a motion to force the 
us immigration and naturalization service to extend the amnesty 
deadline through the end of november 1988 for those affected 
aliens who were discouraged from applying because of the rule 
would then have an opportunity to gain citizenship said ralph 
abascal an attorney for california rural legal assistance 
abascal said late tuesday that 50000 to 100000 illegal aliens 
could be affected by karltons order which found the ins had 
failed to carry out the intended meaning of the immigration reform 
and control act 
thomas laughlin chief of the ins legalization office in 
sacramento said he had not seen the ruling 
im not sure how it will affect us or who will be eligible 
he said 
the immigration reform act granted amnesty to illegal aliens who 
have lived in the united states continuously since jan 1 1982 
the deadline to apply is midnight tonight 
a nov 30 deadline has been set for undocumented farm workers 
who have picked perishable crops for at least 90 days in recent 
years 
karltons ruling was prompted by a lawsuit by catholic social 
services the rural legal assistance organization and other 
immigrantrights groups the suit challenged the ins interpretation 
of what congress meant by the phrase brief casual and innocent 
departures 
that phrase was used to describe those brief trips out of the 
united states by illegal aliens that would not break the continuous 
residency requirement spelled out in the law 
ins regulations interpreted brief casual and innocent trips 
as a departure of not more than 30 days for legitimate emergency or 
humanitarian purposes no trips could be made without ins 
permission it said 
abascal said many illegal aliens had gotten terse messages such 
as your father is dying and they run across the border 
upon returning they are afraid they have lost their eligibility 
for amnesty and fail to apply he said still others were told 
flatly that they didnt qualify for amnesty 
in a separate order issued earlier in the class action lawsuit 
karlton said it is this courts view that the statute requires a 
casebycase determination of whether an absence is brief casual 
and innocent 
karlton said tuesday his order applies to all obviously eligible 
people who departed and reentered the united states since nov 6 
1986 the date the immigration reform legislation took effect 
in his 24page ruling karlton concluded that congress did not 
intend the brief casual and innocent absence exceptions to 
apply only to absences authorized by the ins the agencys 
interpretation 
other sections of the reform act karlton said reflect 
congressional recognition that the legalization program might fail 
because of the illegal aliens natural fear of the ins

comedian johnny carson said he will write his 
own material for the tonight show and end its reruns next week 
because he saw no chance for a quick end to the 2monthold 
scriptwriters strike 
carson said he will write his opening monologue and 
introductions when the show resumes on videotape next wednesday no 
striking writers will be used he said 
cheryl rhoden a spokeswoman for the striking writers guild of 
america said carson is not a union member and writing his own 
material would not be a strike violation 
the tonight show went into reruns when the guild struck the 
motion picture and television industry on march 7 
we have been negotiating in good faith with the writers guild 
of america for the past 10 weeks and it appears we have exhausted 
every possibility of reeaching an agreement even though countless 
attempts were made carson said 
there are numerous tonight show staff members many have 
been with us for over 20 years who are in danger of losing their 
jobs if this strike goes on much longer carson said i cant 
let that happen i also cant turn my back on the tonight show 
audience whove remained loyal these past 25 years its time to 
go back to work 
ms rhoden said carsons company had met with the guild six 
times since march 23 with the last formal session on april 28 
carson tonight inc carsons production company has been 
rebuffed in efforts to either get a waiver from the guild or reach 
an independent agreement that would permit his writers to resume 
work 
carson tonight inc was informed one week ago by wga 
negotiators that no independent contracts would be ratified until 
at least 10 percent of the 9000plus membership had been offered 
employment by independent production companies said carsons 
attorney ed hookstratten 
the attorney said that information came after carson had 
agreed to almost 100 percent of the unions contract conditions 
the guild has approved only two independent contracts so far 
with the new smothers brothers comedy hour and ivan reitman 
productions makers of the movie ghostbusters 
the main issues in the strike are payment for foreign broadcasts 
and reruns and the writers degree of creative control they have 
over their work there have been no formal negotiations since 
mediated talks broke off march 10

banks that closed two months ago 
following the imposition of us economic sanctions will open on 
monday but there will be limits on the amount of money customers 
can withdraw 
the announcement was made tuesday by the president of the 
banking association edgardo lasso the association represents 93 
of the 117 banks operating in panama most of them foreign 
political instability brought on by the attempts of washington 
and local opposition leaders to oust panamas strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega has crippled the nations oncebustling 
economy 
we are trying to reactivate the economy lasso said in a 
television interview but to prevent a run on accounts withdrawal 
amounts will be restricted as specified by the governments banking 
commission he said 
also tuesday the roman catholic church said it was withdrawing 
as mediator in the conflict over noriega until the civilian 
government stops criticizing it publicly noriega head of the 
15000member defense forces is the power behind the civilian 
government in panama 
conditions for reopening the banks limit withdrawals to 25 
percent of checking account balances as of march 3 the day the 
government closed the banks a maximum of 10000 may be withdrawn 
withdrawals of up to 50 may be made from savings accounts one 
month after banks reopen while payment of interest is restricted 
and subject to cash availability in each bank 
the banking commission has promoted a gradual reopening of the 
banks 
on april 18 it let them begin accepting deposits but because 
of limits on withdrawals about 75 percent of the checks deposited 
bounced analysts and business people said 
a week later about a dozen additional services were resumed 
including handling letters of credit collecting outstanding loans 
transferring funds within panama and making foreign exchange 
transfers 
but business people said the operations were largely on paper 
and did little to help resolve their problems of liquidity and 
credit 
both the march 3 closing and the reopening applied to the 67 
banks holding licenses to conduct both local and international 
banking business others also closed their doors because of the 
impact of the crisis 
some banks had closed even earlier after noriega ousted 
president eric arturo delvalle feb 26 following the presidents 
attempt to fire the general 
a statement from the catholic church on tuesday accused the 
government of attacking it and archbishop marcos gregorio mcgrath 
since the attacks have proliferated in government news media 
we assume the government rejects the mediation of the church it 
said 
the church had offered to negotiate a way for noriega to step 
down but the opposition demanded his departure as a condition for 
talks 
the government refused and the church suspended the effort a 
week after accepting the role at the end of march 
the church has held the government responsible for the crisis 
but also blamed the economic domination of foreign powers and 
the corruption in the public and private sectors 
noriega is under federal indictment in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges which he denies 
after the indictments were issued in february the reagan 
administration imposed economic sanctions in an effort to pressure 
the general to leave 
washington froze panamanian assets in the united states and told 
us citizens and companies to stop making payments to the 
panamanian government except for bills relating to utilities and 
services such as garbage collection 
the united states still recognizes delvalle who is in hiding 
as panamas chief executive

defense secretary frank c carlucci 
anticipating congress will pass legislation making it easier to 
close unneeded military bases has set up established a bipartisan 
commission to select likely facilities 
he named former sen abe ribicoff dconn and former rep jack 
edwards rala as cochairman of the commission 
some have suggested that this may be an exercise in 
futility carlucci wrote on tuesday in a memo to the service 
secretaries and joint chiefs of staff referring to past efforts to 
close military bases 
to the contrary i am convinced that the commissions efforts 
can be fruitful in developing a process and criteria for closing or 
realigning bases and proposing candidates by the end of the year 
congress has prevented the pentagon from closing unneeded 
military bases for more than a decade with individual members 
always stepping in to protect facilities in their district 
under a plan proposed by rep dick armey rtexas however 
congress would approve shutdowns before the doomed bases are 
actually named

speed up processing emigration applications

would emigrate if given the chance he said most have not applied

employment and other opportunities during the long often unending 
period while waiting for approval 
but he said a good many of them also are not fully aware 
today of what the possibilities are that you can indeed fill out 
the forms get them filed and theres a chance within six weeks or 
two months perhaps to get your application processed

people who have unsafe sex with 
aidsinfected lovers may be more likely to get the deadly disease 
after drinking a few beers or moderate amounts of other alcoholic 
beverages a study suggests 
alcohol does affect the immune system alcohol makes you more 
vulnerable to aids infection said dr omar bagasra who 
presented the study tuesday at the annual meeting of the federation 
of american societies for experimental biology 
im not saying not to drink or not to have sex only to have 
safe sex if youre going to have sex make sure to use condoms 
said bagasra a microbiologistimmunologist at the university of 
medicine and dentistry of new jersey 
bagasra said the study also suggests moderate drinking may speed 
the development of fullfledged aids in people who have been 
infected but show no symptoms of the disease 
previous research suggests that because alcohol reduces 
inhibitions drinking makes people more likely to engage in unsafe 
sexual activity that can spread the aids virus such as anal 
intercourse without condoms bagasra said 
he said his study indicates moderate alcohol consumption also 
may reduce the bodys biological resistance to infection by the 
virus once it gets in the bloodstream 
bagasra and philadelphia researchers dr andrea kajdacsyballa 
of hahnemann university and dr harold lischner of temple 
university based their findings on an experiment using blood from 
six healthy heterosexual volunteers the diseasefighting white 
blood cells were grown with the aids virus in laboratory glassware 
the blood cells were tested after the volunteers spent one month 
without drinking alcohol then 13 to 17 hours after each drank an 
average of four beers or the equivalent in other drinks 
the virus grew 25 to 250 times faster in the white blood cells 
after the volunteers drank and each cell contained more viruses 
three to seven hours after the volunteers had no alcohol left in 
their bodies their cells still produced smaller amounts of 
interleukin2 and soluble immune response suppressor factor two 
substances necessary for proper functioning of the diseasefighting 
immune system 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the immune system 
by destroying certain white blood cells and other cells 
its a very interesting study and deserves being followed up 
with larger clinical and epidemiological studies said dr john 
leedom head of infectious diseases at the university of southern 
california and aids service director at los angeles countyusc 
medical center 
leedom cautioned that the drinkers blood cells were exposed to 
higher doses of the aids virus in laboratory glassware than they 
would be inside the body but he said alcoholics are more prone to 
infections such as pneumonia and meningitis than other people and 
several studies have linked certain cancers to moderate drinking 
other scientists have suggested that drugs and alcohol may be 
cofactors required for aids infection to occur and it will be 
interesting to see if bagasras study can be repeated in other 
laboratories said janet nicholson chief of clinical immunology at 
the us centers for disease control 
bagasra said he plans to repeat the study in july with up to 200 
volunteers 
people are infected by this virus for years before they get 
sick something tips the balance leedom said people who drink 
even moderate amounts of alcohol might make their blood cells 
more susceptible not only to virus particles that come in from 
outside during sexual episodes but they might be rendering them 
more susceptible to infection from a neighboring cell thats 
already infected

a revised united methodist hymnal includes 
portrayals of god as a feminine figure and casts mankind out in 
favor of people but leaves a few old favorites unchanged 
the nations secondlargest protestant denomination on tuesday 
also adopted a new conservative summary of doctrine that 
underscores the primacy of scripture 
delegates to the 96 million member denominations governing 
conference overwhelmingly adopted the new hymnal that generally 
shifts to inclusive language for humans such as using all for 
men and people for mankind 
but members decided to retain masculine pronouns for god in the 
books psalms denying the request of several delegates to use 
genderneutral nouns such as gods rather than his 
the new hymnbook was extensively updated with nearly half its 
625 songs fresh for methodists new compositions ethnic folk 
hymns spirituals and gospel songs or imports from other 
denominations 
but old favorites and classics of their 18th century 
hymnwriting founder john wesley still occupy a prominent place 
with o for a thousand tongues to sing by his brother charles 
leading off the hymn section 
work on the book replacing the old hymnal of 1966 had 
continued for four years delegates approved the new hymnal by 893 
to 69 
an exciting and historical moment said the rev c rex 
bevins of lincoln neb after applause by the 3000 people 
the legislative body whose 11day meeeting ends friday meets 
every four years to set the churchs course for the next 
quadrennium 
delegates overwhelmingly supported the new doctrinal summary 
which replaces a 1972 version it was described as reflecting a 
general swing to conservatism attempting to stabilize beliefs 
against counter influences 
pluralism or divergency a hallmark of the previous more 
flexible statement of doctrine has been stricken from the new 
document 
it gives us a clearer definition of who we are said the 
rev thomas a langford a duke university theologian it puts 
into sharper relief the marrow of our convictions 
the rev james heidinger of wilmore ky executive secretary of 
an evangelical caucus good news praised the document as providing 
a firmer doctrinal foundation replacing a past smorgasbord of 
belief 
the church has suffered 16 years of doctrinal confusion and 
uncertainty due to theological pluralism suggesting we might 
believe just about anything he said that kind of expression 
doesnt attract members 
however he said the document leaves room for diversity 
around the central core of faith 
some theologians initially had been sharply critical of the new 
document saying it overly elevates scripture above reason 
experience and tradition and tends to curb theological exploration 
however several additions were made to clarify our 
thinking examine the nature and purposes of god and human 
freedom and responsibility 
the heart of our task the document asserts is to reclaim 
and renew the distinctive united methodist doctrinal heritage 
which rightly belongs to our common heritage as christians 
methodists generally are not fundamentalists who consider the 
bible literally factual in all matters however the new document 
makes scripture the primary authority 
tied to it in a subordinate role are the three other strands of 
the methodist quadrilateral reason tradition and experience 
theology also is portrayed as subordinate to doctrine but 
contributing to it

winston churchills official biographer says the 
prime minister used an astrologer in a political ploy to get the 
united states to enter world war ii by predicting nazi germany 
would lose the war 
oxford university historian martin gilbert said the plan in 
mid1941 when britain was desperate to end american neutrality 
didnt work 
churchill never used an astrologer personally but he once used 
one politically gilbert said tuesday the historian has just 
finished the eighth and final volume of churchills biography 
in the summer of 1941 gilbert said a convention of 
astrologers in the united states dominated by progerman groups had 
predicted the victory of hitler in the war which was clearly a 
good reason for america staying out of it 
learning of this churchill at once dispatched to the states 
the astrologer louis de wohl who proved from the same constellation 
of stars and moons and whatever else astrologers use that hitler 
would in fact lose he said 
gilbert said this brought much discomfort to those who claimed 
otherwise but didnt bring the united states into the war that 
happened after the japanese bombed pearl harbor on dec 7 1941 
the white house acknowledged tuesday that nancy reagan consults 
astrological forecasts to help plan president reagans activities 
the disclosure came after former chief of staff donald t regan 
reportedly wrote in his forthcoming book that mrs reagan consulted 
astrologers to determine the timing of presidential speeches and 
announcements

the government said strikes plaguing 
poland threaten to derail reforms it initiated to breathe life into 
a weak economy claiming that it it grants the demanded pay raises 
all poles stand to lose 
we have waited very long for this chance and it is important 
that it not be wasted government spokesman jerzy urban told a 
news conference tuesday echoing a theme repeated constantly in the 
communist regimes official media 
since april 25 there have been at least four major strikes and 
several minor work stoppages 
workers in virtually every sector want pay increases of up to 60 
percent to counter price increases of 42 percent in the first 
quarter of this year that came about from cuts in government 
subsidies the more radical strikers want the solidarity 
independent trade union movements legality restored 
since world war ii workers have demanded higher pay in response 
to higher prices and the government has usually given in but 
sometimes only after violent strikes 
this time authorities have met increasing labor unrest with 
declarations that the old way of labor unrest never really worked 
and that in any case there is no more money 
polands poverty is clearly visible horses instead of tractors 
pull plows office buildings stand halffinished for years 
ordinary items such as toilet paper are in chronic short supply and 
the average annual income is about 1080 
most hard currency poland earns goes to service a foreign debt 
of 39 billion the largest in the soviet bloc poland borrowed 
heavily from the west during a 1970s boom providing relative 
prosperity but much of the money went for consumption and 
illconceived investments 
good times ended with sharp price increases in 1980 the 
subsequent labor upheaval in which solidarity was born and the 
martial law crackdown of december 1981 that brought four years of 
western economic sanctions all contributed to a general economic 
decline 
hoping to spur public involvement the government held a 
referendum last year seeking support for its reform plan it won 
most of the votes but not the binding majority polish law requires 
to pass such a plan 
the reforms begun jan 1 were intended to improve the economy 
by introducing competition and encouraging more private enterprise 
subsidies on staples were slashed and prices rose to reflect true 
cost 
officials say strikes threaten to kill the plan urban said 
tuesday the government is determined to protect its program of 
reforms but the labor trouble may put it off or derail it 
he said the reforms end the governments role as the final 
source of cash the government will not make up the difference 
between what enterprises can afford to pay and what they must pay 
for labor peace urban added 
industry minister jerzy bilip said on television monday in 
terms of the whole country for surely the whole country would not 
remain impartial some 600 billion zlotys 15 billion would be 
demanded in pay raises 
despite tough official words however managers have found ways 
to grant raises workers at the strikebound nowa huta steel mill 
were told to expect 50 a month more 
strikes by bus drivers in bydgoszcz and factory workers in 
stalowa wola also were settled with promises of pay raises of at 
least 50 percent 
solidarity has endorsed the general direction of reforms but 
complains about how the changes have been put into effect it also 
said true reform requires independent trade unions that can 
negotiate with authorities 
solidarity was outlawed under martial law and attempts by union 
activists to have it legally registered in plants across the 
country have failed in court challenges

pope john paul ii met with a group of polish 
pilgrims that included two solidarity leaders and said the laws of 
god dictate that poles be allowed to govern themselves and decide 
their own fate 
the meeting tuesday was the pontiffs second in three days with 
pilgrims from his homeland in which he addressed the strife there 
about 500 poles attended a mass the pope said in a chapel of st 
peters basilica on tuesday 
the italian news agency agi said that among those at the mass 
were solidarity leaders kornel morawiecki and andrzej kolodziej 
who were released from a warsaw prison last week for medical 
treatment in rome 
thousands of poles have gone on strike in the past week in 
polands worst labor unrest since the 1981 martial law crackdown on 
solidarity the first independent labor federation in the soviet 
bloc solidarity has been outlawed since 
in a homily carried by vatican radio the pope said he prayed 
that the problem of sovereignty that is independence of our 
country be rooted most profoundly in another problem the problem 
of the sovereignty of society and of the people of poland today 
one can speak of sovereignty of independence of a nation only 
when in the context of this nation there is a people sovereign 
and independent who can by rule and fact decide their common 
life john paul said 
times historic conditions situations can change but these 
principles always keep their identity they are simply the laws of 
god laws written in the human heart in the nature of man 
vatican radio on monday carried other remarks by the pope about 
his homeland in a meeting sunday with polish pilgrims he urged 
progress in polish labor relations

afternoon 
state attorney general bob corbin demanded the money in a 
strongly worded letter released tuesday 
asked in an interview if the money would be turned over mecham 
said nope why should it be it isnt his corbins it isnt 
the states 
mecham said the money was still safely in the bank and that 
he planned to handle it properly although he would not give 
details 
he corbin would have tried to confiscate it long ago if he 
thought he could mecham said 
corbin in a letter to former top mecham aides jim colter and 
edith richardson asked them to surrender the money by 5 pm 
today if they dont he said i will direct the commencement of 
all appropriate actions against each and both of you 
gubernatorial spokesman vada manager said gov rose mofford 
planned to ask corbin to file a lawsuit if the money is not 
returned state funds rightfully ought to revert to the state 
manager said 
mecham was convicted in his senate impeachment trial april 4 of 
misusing 80000 from the governors protocol fund by loaning it to 
his auto dealership during the trial mecham aides testified that 
the protocol fund created with receipts from the january 1987 
inaugural ball totaled 92000 and was being kept in a valley 
national bank account 
mecham also was convicted by the senate of trying to thwart an 
investigation of an alleged death threat the former governor faces 
a may 19 criminal trial on charges of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan 
during the senate trial mechams defense contended the protocol 
fund was not state money and that it was loaned to mecham pontiac 
in an effort to get a higher rate of interest for the protocol fund 
however corbin said tuesday the senate conviction showed that 
the senators believed the protocol fund was state money belonging 
to the governors office 
mrs richardson and colter are the official signatories to the 
protocol bank account 
corbins letter to them said at the request of governor rose 
mofford and inasmuch as the monies in the account belong to the 
office of the governor of the state of arizona i am writing this 
letter to demand that you and each of you forthwith surrender and 
turn over said monies to the office of the governor of the state of 
arizona 
mecham would not say if he considered the money to be his 
personal fund 
well just handle it properly he said thats all i want

interior minister tomas borge said the 
government and the rebels began peace talks because both sides had 
suffered heavy losses but he said the sandinistas will resume 
fighting if the peace talks fail 
well mobilize the entire nation borge said during a 
wideranging interview tuesday night that also touched upon 
longstanding rumors of differences between him and president 
daniel ortega 
borge one of nine commandants in the directorate of the 
governing sandinista national liberation front is regarded as one 
of the most hawkish members of ortegas cabinet 
since the march 23 signing of a vaguely worded temporary truce 
talks aimed at achieving a lasting peace have foundered the latest 
round of direct negotiations between the leftist sandinista 
government and the ussupported rebels known as contras took 
place in managua 
borge said nicaragua was drawn to the negotiating table because 
it has paid a high cost in blood in the war which has crippled 
its economy since it began in november 1981 but if the contras 
were not badly beaten militarily or held land they would never 
negotiate with us he said 
the sandinistas once refused to hold direct talks with the 
contras or allow them to come to nicargua borge acknowledged the 
backpedaling but emphasized we will never discuss political 
power with the contras 
we understand the negotiations with the contras are indirect 
talks with the united states he added 
the sandinistas maintained for years that any talks to end the 
war should be with the united states because it financed the 
contras 
borge dismissed rumors that the directorate was split between 
his followers and those of president ortega 
the worst enemies of revolutions are the revolutionaries 
who fight among themselves borge said we all discuss and 
discuss until were in agreement there are certain contradictions 
thats natural and helps contribute and move things forward 
the handling of an ongoing strike has been regarded as an 
example of differences between borge and the president while 
ortegas brother gen humberto ortega met with contra leaders in 
the capital last week interior ministry troops detained dozens of 
people outside a union hall where more than 30 people were on a 
hunger strike 
borge defended the action tuesday night as a way to restore 
public order 
two union leaders and three women strike sympathizers were 
shoved into police vehicles on tuesday after speaking with 
reporters a block from the hall about 40 people have been taken 
into custody since last week 
our police are absolutely antirepression they never are 
abusive or use torture or murder borge said 
construction workers and car mechanics went on a hunger strike 
april 25 in support of a wildcat walkout that began feb 25 to 
demand higher wages 
borge said the sandinistas would give up power if they lost in 
elections but said that would be the end of the nicaraguan 
revolution 
and this is impossible nothing can kill the revolution he 
added 
the marxistled sandinistas came to power in a 1979 uprising 
that ended the dictatorship of anastasio somoza the sandinistas 
promised a better life social programs and equality to the more 
than 3 million nicaraguans the government now says many of its 
projects were lost in the war 
weve paid a high price to defend our national sovereignty and 
dignity borge said noting that projects to improve education 
and health fell short of projections and that there were food 
shortages he blamed the problems in part on the war and the 
errors we committed 
asked if the government was marxistleninist borge said the 
teachings of those two thinkers was a universal science and 
anyone who doesnt study it is either mentally retarded or 
ignorant he said marxistleninist theory was an important 
guide in our decisions 
borge praised the sandinista relationship with the soviet union 
which provides most of nicaraguas aid he said the soviet union 
helps us and respects us and we appreciate it

a jury deliberating the nations first 
deathbyproducttampering case is trying to decide if a woman 
killed her husband and a stranger with poisoned painkillers to 
escape an unhappy marriage and collect insurance 
the us district court jury today was to begin its second day 
of deliberations in the trial of stella nickell 44 of auburn 
mrs nickell is charged with two counts of causing death by 
tampering with a product involved in interstate commerce and three 
counts of tampering if convicted she could face life in prison 
she was accused in the june 1986 death of her 52yearold 
husband bruce and of sue katherine snow 40 also of auburn who 
died two weeks later both victims swallowed cyanidelaced 
extrastrength excedrin capsules 
the deaths touched off a nationwide tampering scare and prompted 
excedrin manufacturer bristolmyers to recall its capsuled 
nonprescription medicines 
prosecutors portrayed mrs nickell as an unhappy wife beset by 
financial problems who poisoned her husband to collect 176000 
from his life insurance policies they contended ms snow as an 
innocent stranger 
the prosecution said mrs nickell put tampered painkillers on 
shelves of local stores to make her husbands death appear random 
and to lead doctors who had concluded nickell died of emphysema 
to the true cause of his death 
mrs nickells attorney has defended her as the victim of a 
daughter who lied when she said her mother had asked how much 
cocaine would cause an overdose and where to hire a hit man to end 
the marriage 
only mrs nickell had the motive opportunity and ability to 
commit the crimes assistant us attorney joanne maida told the 
jury in closing arguments monday 
defense lawyer thomas hillier countered that the governments 
case was built on the testimony of one unreliable witness mrs 
nickells daughter cindy hamilton 
without cindy hamiltons testimony the government case 
collapses like a house of cards hillier said wheres one 
person other than cindy hamilton willing to stand up and say its 
stella nickell 
cindy hamilton is not telling the truth he told jurors 
during his closing argument 
court documents indicate the major break in the tampering case 
came when ms hamilton came forward with her account in december 
1986 a year before her mother was arrested 
jurors were told last week of a 300060 award offered by 
pharmaceutical companies to anyone who provided information leading 
to the arrest of the tamperer or tamperers 
ms maida said in closing arguments that mrs nickells plan 
failed because she was careless in mixing the poisonous capsules 
greedy for insurance benefits and owned two of the five tainted 
bottles of painkillers found 
mrs nickell stood to receive 71000 if her husband a state 
employee died of emphysema as pathologists first concluded but 
she could have gotten 176000 if the death was ruled accidental 
the prosecutor said

a special grand jury blasted mayor w wilson 
goode and his top aides for morally reprehensible behavior in 
the 1985 move bombing that killed 11 people and destroyed 61 homes 
but didnt recommend indictments 
the panel which released its findings tuesday called the 
failed eviction effort may 13 1985 this citys greatest 
tragedy it ended in a fiery siege with the police bombing of a 
barricaded west philadelphia row house occupied by members of the 
radical group move 
criticism of the 279page grand jury report was swift 
a special commission goode formed after the confrontation found 
the mayor grossly negligent members of that commission which 
released its findings in march 1986 were outraged at the findings 
of the county grand jury 
im totally speechless said commission member julia m 
chinn we know 11 people died on may 13 how can they say no one 
should be penalized for it to me i dont see this as 
justice 
district attorney ronald castille said the panel spent nearly 
two years and 250000 in its investigation and voted 164 against 
filing charges 
the father of a then13yearold boy one of the two survivors 
from the move compound said he was confused and dismayed by the 
report 
what the grand jury came up with made no sense said andino 
ward father of michael moses ward who was known as birdie africa 
there has to be some responsibility justice is blind but in 
philadelphia it appears to be very ignorant 
the grand jury rejected the boys contention that police gunfire 
had kept some people from fleeing the move house while it burned 
those killed were inside the house 
the jury said it considered but discarded charges of conspiracy 
murder involuntary manslaughter aggravated assault reckless 
endangerment arson causing or risking a catastrophe failure to 
prevent a castastrope criminal mischief and perjury 
goode said after the grand jury released its report that he had 
learned much from the tragedy 
we are a stronger government a stronger city goode said 
noting the event was the most fully investigated in philadelphia 
history i am committed to make sure that such tragic events 
never occur again 
goode declined to discuss details of the report or the events of 
the siege 
it has been my belief all along that i had not done anything 
that is criminal and i am satisfied that the district attorney 
concluded the same thing goode said 
the grand jury contested goodes statements that he ordered 
officials at the scene to put out the fire shortly before 6 pm 
saying evidence showed that his call came no earlier than 625 pm 
while the conduct of city officials in handling move is 
entirely unacceptable it is not the proper subject of criminal 
prosecutions the report concluded 
this citys greatest tragedy is an epic of governmental 
incompetence it details an operation marked by political cowardice 
in its inception inexperience in its planning and ineptitude in 
its execution 
we do not exonerate the men responsible for this disaster 
rather than a vindication of those officials this report should 
stand as a permanent record of their morally reprehensible behavior 
and the terrible cost of their misjudgments 
a federal grand jury is investigating whether the civil rights 
of the 11 victims five of them children were violated by the 
bombing and fire that followed its report is expected by the 
summer

lech lech 
eight years ago as a little known labor agitator he had to

eventually led to the founding of the solidarity labor federation 
and brought down a government 
i am not your leader im tired walesa 44 told the 
striking shipyard workers on tuesday you need a new walesa many 
more new walesas 
much has changed since solidarity was recognized by the 
government in accords signed in this baltic port that ended the 
1980 strike wave 
walesa has put on some weight he won the 1983 nobel peace prize 
and solidarity was banned after a december 1981 martial law 
crackdown 
but his trademark moustache remains and he still works as an 
electrician at the shipyard 
since 1980 walesa has taken on bodyguards and a driver as part 
of his entourage fame has complicated his life making it busier 
and making him the subject of an occasional death threat 
when he attends a union meeting or travels to see visiting 
foreign dignitaries he more likely will be driven than drive 
himself 
old people women and children pressed to shake walesas hand as 
he stepped out of the car and walked up to the shipyard gate which 
was decorated with solidarity banners pictures of pope john paul 
ii yellow flowers and a sign proclaiming occupation strike 
the strikers shouted his name and patted him on the back as he 
approached a makeshift podium to deliver a speech 
policemen patrolled nearby but did not intervene 
walesa told the strikers that he wasnt their leader 
ive done what i had to do walesa told them but i dont 
want a past i only want bread calm and peace for us all i want 
to help poland enter a road of reforms 
the strikers wore solidarity badges and armbands on their blue 
overalls many also wore yellow hardhats as they sipped tea and 
smoked in the balmy sunshine 
dozens of strikers crowded the rooftops of nearby buildings to 
listen to the speech outside the plant people pressed together to 
catch a glimpse while others climbed on the iron shipyard gate 
they joined in occasional solidarity chants and chatted with 
the strikers some of whom guarded the entrances to the shipyard 
and checked the plastic identity cards of yard workers going in or 
out 
over a loudspeaker an announcer read names of workers whose 
relatives had come to the gate to bring them food and cigarettes 
cheers arose when workers and sympathizers delivered loaves of 
bread cans of sardines and jars of honey and jam in large canvas 
bags and wheeelbarrows 
just outside the gate a redandwhite polish flag with the 
solidarity logo was placed near the three tall concrete crosses 
joined by three anchors the monument honors scores of baltic coast 
workers including at least 27 in gdansk killed during the harsh 
goverment response to riots against price increases introduced just 
before christmas 1970 
the monument was dedicated dec 16 1980 fulfilling a pledge 
made by walesa during the early days of the 1980 solidarity strike

director of the cia and an israeli general in attempts to sell arms 
overseas according to testimony in the racketeering trial of rep 
mario biaggi 
the testimony tuesday came as part of the defenses attempt to 
show that the scandalplagued south bronx defense contracting firm 
did not need biaggis help in obtaining work because it already had 
highlevel connections in the reagan administration and elsewhere

federal court on charges of turning wedtech into a racketeering 
enterprise that paid public officials millions of dollars to obtain 
government contracts

approached former cia official max hugel in 1985 for help in 
selling a tug barge to yugoslavia

doctors today performed 
followup surgery on a 17monthold girl who had just been 
separated from her siamese twin sister in an intricate 7hour 
procedure hospital officials said 
mpho and mphonyana mathibela who had been joined at the head 
were separated tuesday by a 40person medical team at baragwanath 
the main hospital in soweto township outside johannesburg 
mphonyana the smaller and weaker of the two began bleeding 
from the incision in her head early today and required additional 
surgery the hospital said following the operation she was 
returned to the intensive care unit 
both girls were in critical but stable condition the hospital 
said 
i always knew they would be all right said sophie 
mathibela mother of the girls i feel so happy 
in september doctors at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore 
separated west german siamese twins joined at the head the two 
boys benjamin and patrick binder survived and were released in 
march but they reportedly are suffering some physical and mental 
problems 
the johns hopkins doctors advised the baragwanath doctors before 
tuesdays operation and called to offer congratulations following 
the successful surgery 
dr robert lipschitz head of the operating team said before 
the operation that the chances for success were not good he 
performed two operations on the girls last october in preparation 
for tuesdays procedure 
the girls shared a major blood vessel in their heads which 
doctors partially clamped in the earlier operations in the hope 
that lesser blood vessels would take over the functions of the 
shared vein 
ms mathibela an unmarried 33yearold domestic worker who 
earns about 60 a month gave birth to the twins dec 7 1986 
she said initially that she was so horrified that she refused to 
see the girls for three days once persuaded to see them i 
immediately accepted and loved my little gifts from god ms 
mathibela said 
the girls had a combined weight of 33 pounds before the 
operation 
mpho appears to be developing normally and recently began to 
speak while mphonyana is slightly smaller and does not appear to 
be as advanced hospital officials said 
ms mathibela was asked to make a fivedollar contribution to 
the costs of the operations estimated at 700000 the costs are 
being covered by the hospital and the university of the 
witwatersrand medical school 
the sowetan a daily newspaper that covers the black township 
has set up a trust fund for the twins that has raised 26000

plans to require random drug testing of 
government employees are meeting strong opposition from a group of 
justice department attorneys who plan a legal challenge to the new 
program 
the drug testing would be required for government employees 
ranging from white house chief of staff howard baker down to 
secretaries and butlers under plans unveiled tuesday by 42 federal 
agencies 
officials at the department of health and human services 
forwarded employee drugtesting plans from the agencies to 
congress technically clearing the way for the agencies to begin 
testing the workers they have designated 
stephen sachs a private washington attorney said he has met 
with a number of justice department lawyers who feel the program is 
much more expansive than had been anticipated 
our contention is that they cannot do mandatory random 
drugtesting without some probable cause or some kind of 
individualized suspicion he said 
he said justice department officials have said in the past there 
is no drug problem at the department 
as a practical matter many of the various testing plans already 
have been blocked by court suits other federal employee 
organizations have said they also will sue once their agencies 
attempts to implement testing 
at the white house the plan would affect 370 employees 
including baker secretaries butlers ushers chefs maids 
receptionists and tradesmen in the presidential residence 
ray kogut director of personnel for the office of 
administration said about 1200 of the 1600 people working in 13 
separate agencies under the executive office of the president will 
be affected 
president reagan and vice president george bush will not be 
required to submit to random testing however they have 
voluntarily given specimens in the past kogut said 
kogut said the 100 percent coverage figure also applies to the 
national security council staff the office of the vice president 
the council of economic advisors and its staff the office of 
policy development office of the us trade representative and 
office of science and technology policy 
the defense department said hhs had certified drugtesting plans 
that could ultimately cover about 20 percent of its civilian work 
force or more than 200000 federal workers the army already has 
begun testing some of its civilian employees 
the mandatory random drug testing at the justice department 
covers some 4700 employees in the attorney generals office us 
attorneys offices nationwide and in the six divisions of the 
department criminal civil antitrust tax lands and civil rights 
about 7 percent of the 4700 would be tested annually under the 
justice department plan which will go into effect in several 
months 
in addition there are 9300 other justice department employees 
who could be tested if there was reasonable suspicion to suspect 
they were using drugs applicants for those posts also would face 
drug tests 
separate drug testing programs already are under way or are 
about to begin for certain employees at four justice department 
agencies the fbi drug enforcement administration immigration and 
naturalization service and the bureau of prisons 
the hhs guidelines regarding clinical urine collection 
procedures and testing laboratory accuracy were first issued more 
than a year ago and formally published in final form in the federal 
register last month 
the hhss own internal plan calls for testing for marijuana and 
cocaine it says 8661 of the agencys approximately 130000 
employees are liable for testing and that it envisions testing 10 
percent of the 8661 in any given year

a pencilshaped pump implanted for the first time 
to save a heart transplant recipients life will become a common 
emergency treatment for heart attack victims a texas heart 
institute surgeon predicts 
the temporary device smaller than a penny is known as the 
nimbus hemopump it will be tested for 18 months and requires the 
approval of the us food and drug administration officials say 
i must say its the most remarkable thing ive seen or 
experienced dr oh frazier director of the institutes cullen 
cardiovascular surgical research laboratories said tuesday a 
device this small to take over the function of the human heart is 
really incredible 
in its first human application the device was inserted april 26 
into the heart of a 62yearold colorado man the patient whose 
name was undisclosed underwent a heart transplant earlier but was 
suffering from rejection and faced certain death frazier said 
hes in the game frazier said he was out of the game 
monday a week ago totally out and the only reason hes in it is 
because of the device i say that with absolute certainty 
the pump is inserted through the femoral artery in the leg and 
is passed with a tube until it gets to the left ventricle the 
hearts main pumping chamber the tube stays in and is hooked to 
the outside power source 
there spinning at 25000 revolutions per minute it can provide 
100 percent of the blood flow to the body and enable the heart 
muscle to rest and heal 
the main thing is all other devices require the chest to be 
open major surgery frazier said this is placed in a 
simple incision 
unlike an intraaortic balloon pump now used to treat heart 
patients the hemopump does not require a beating heart to function 
effectively doctors said 
the device has been in testing for two years and the fda is 
allowing testing at texas heart institute for four patients a 
second patient given the pump last week died although frazier said 
that patient suffered from complications unrelated to the pump 
we think this is a major important adjunct to treatment of 
patients otherwise dying of heart failure frazier said adding 
that he was skeptical of its success when he first saw it two years 
ago 
but he predicted that once testing is completed and the fda 
authorizes its use it will be a common operation for emergency 
rooms receiving heart attack victims 
for heart failure this is going to be the treatment of 
choice frazier said its easily introduced and can be used in 
any hospital that performs openheart surgery i think it has 
farreaching implications in the treatment of these patients with 
acute heart failure 
besides the texas heart institute officials said mercy hospital 
in des moines iowa and humana hospital in louisville ky have 
fda permission to test the pump in humans

fighters in battle fatigues and carrying automatic weapons 
searched cars and frisked occupants said the witnesses who spoke 
on condition of anonymity

soviet media painted a somber picture of the 
industrial strikes now under way in poland saying the labor unrest 
is a menace to economic reforms being pursued by the warsaw 
government 
the communist party daily pravda today accused antipolish 
centers in the west and an internal opposition in the 
moscowaligned country of trying to exploit the discontent for 
their own ends 
pravda said the airwaves were filled with broadcasts from 
western radio stations urging the poles to enlarge the scale of 
the protest and to increase their demands 
the tass news agency said the strikes in gdansk wroclaw and 
other areas of the country are harmful to polands economy but it 
also quote a polish government spokesman as saying the strikes did 
not threaten the government and it gave a veiled reminder that the 
regime in place enjoys soviet backing 
the strikes that are held now and that are sought to be 
organized do not threaten the socialist state as it has durable 
internal and external foundations spokesman jerzy urban was 
quoted as saying in warsaw on tuesday 
but strikes threaten the economic reform urban continued 
they can put off or undermine it and the reform is our national 
opportunity to overcome the difficulties of life and economic 
stagnation 
an estimated 7000 workers were on strike at the lenin shipyard 
in gdansk and work stoppages also had spread to at least two other 
industrial facilities 
workers are demanding higher wages to offset governmentimposed 
price increases on food and consumer goods government officials 
say the price increases were needed to balance goods with the money 
supply 
the heightening of tension endless demands and the staging of 
strikes can only hamper the processes of democratization and 
reforms tass quoted urban as saying 
tass said urban claimed the latest round of strikes is 
dissimilar to the labor crisis which began in poland in the early 
80s bad leadership was partially responsible for that crisis he 
said 
now the strikes have broken out at the very start of the 
process of transition to radical reforms in a situation when there 
is no need to stop work in order to speak out loud and be heard 
urban said the strikes are groundless and harmful both from the 
political and economic viewpoints 
pravda apparently referring to martial law said solidarity had 
played on feelings of poles and what came of this is known to 
everyone 
solidarity was the first independent union in the soviet bloc 
but was outlawed after martial law was declared in december 1981 
tass reported that polands minister of industry erzy bilip has 
rejected demands for wage increases saying the pay increases would 
contradict the second stage of reform

the mother of ferdinand marcos died 
today but president corazon aquino said the exiled president will 
not be allowed to return for the funeral because he remains a 
threat to national security 
in hawaii marcos issued a statement saying he was shocked at 
the death of his 95yearold mother josefa edralinmarcos marcos 
spokesman gemmo trinidad told reporters that marcos said he will 
keep trying to return to the philippines but wont violate any 
laws to go back 
marcos said in his statement that he would exhaust all 
possibilities that may be available to us to return to our 
motherland to help save her from the threatened communist takeover 
or a possible civil war 
before mrs edralinmarcos died vice president salvador laurel 
said marcos should be allowed to come home laurel cited mrs 
aquinos previous claims that marcos followers no longer posed a 
threat to her government 
dr sergio brillantes director of veterans memorial medical 
center said mrs edralinmarcos suffered cardiac arrest at noon 
midnight tuesday edt and was pronounced dead 20 minutes later 
in a nationally televised address mrs aquino expressed 
condolences to the marcos family but added 
after careful assessment in consultation with the leadership 
of both chambers of congress and the cabinet committee i regret 
that considerations of national welfare which are above the 
individual interest forbid us from allowing the former president 
to return 
mrs aquino said respect for parents was an important value in 
filipino society but she added there are other values involving 
national stability and the common good of our people whose primacy 
i am dutybound to uphold 
marcos was not allowed to return for the funeral of his sister 
elizabeth marcoskeon who died in december 1986 
rafael recto marcos lawyer in the philippines said the 
decision went against philippine and christian ethics 
we have a government of neobarbarians recto said they 
act like theyve never had mothers 
hundreds of marcos supporters gathered outside the hospital 
where mrs edralinmarcos died many of them wept while others 
shouted antiaquino slogans and called for a revolution 
in ilocos norte home province of the marcos family flags were 
lowered to half staff and masses were said 
before mrs edralinmarcos died today mrs aquino met with 
cabinet members to consider a request mrs edralinmarcos made 
tuesday to allow her son to return for a final visit the meeting 
ended after receiving news of her death the request was made in a 
letter delivered to the presidential palace 
it was a very difficult but very serious decision said 
national security adviser emmanuel soriano who attended the 
meeting we might summarize it in terms of what is best for the 
common good at this time what is best for national stability at 
this time 
sen leticia ramosshahani a distant cousin of marcos and 
sister of defense secretary fidel ramos said marcos was still a 
political force to be reckoned with 
six senators including opposition leader sen juan ponce 
enrile issued a joint statement supporting marcos return on 
humanitarian grounds 
marcos supporters have been linked to several coup attempts 
mrs aquino told air force cadets on monday that the threat from 
marcos supporters had been neutralized but police said today that 
they seized more than 40 rifles 300 sticks of dynamite and 
hundreds of rounds of ammunition during two raids this week on 
buildings owned by marcos supporters 
mrs edralinmarcos stayed behind in 1986 when a 
militarycivilian uprising drove her son into exile after 20 years 
in power and lifted mrs aquino to the presidency mrs aquino 
since has refused to allow marcos to return 
mrs edralinmarcos was hospitalized sunday with pneumonia 
diabetes and kidney failure she lapsed into a coma late tuesday 
brillantes said 
in her letter to mrs aquino mrs edralinmarcos said 
my dying wish the one thing that will put a smile upon my 
lips when i leave this world is to see my ferdinand by my bedside 
as i say goodbye to all of you pray grant me this wish and this 
privilege as one mother to another 
the letter which was released by the palace was apparently 
drafted by family members and included the thumb print of marcos 
mother 
mrs edralinmarcos came from a wealthy northern luzon family of 
filipino and chinese extraction she was born feb 14 1893 in the 
northern town of sarrat which was also marcos birthplace 
she earned a masters degree in english literature from the 
university of the philippines and taught school for 42 years 
marcos father mariano was a politician and lawyer who died in 
1944 during the japanese occupation

a united airlines jumbo jet that landed at tokyos 
airport with just one of its four engines working took off today 
for san francisco with no passengers aboard an airline spokesman 
said 
robert leu said a team of united airlines engineers sent from 
the united states inspected the boeing 747 thoroughly and found 
no defects in the aircraft and deemed the aircraft airworthy 
the jetliner will be taken to the companys maintenance 
operation center in san francisco where it will be examined by the 
national transportation safety board he said 
aviation sources in washington said that the tanks supplying 
fuel to the three dead engines were found to be dry when the plane 
landed safely on monday at new tokyo international airport 
but leu said the aircrafts six tanks are all interconnected and 
the fuel supply system had plenty of fuel remaining on arrival at 
the airport better known as narita 
each tank can supply fuel to each engine he said and the 
aircraft had 23500 pounds of fuel upon arrival at narita this 
craft had considerably more than our own requirements he said 
the federal aviation administration requires 16000 pounds of 
fuel remaining on arrival while united requires 19000 pounds leu 
said 
the jetliner en route to tokyo from los angeles was flying at 
39000 feet with 258 people aboard one hour and 15 minutes from its 
destination when the first engine lost power united announced 
tuesday 
half an hour later a second engine shut down and shortly before 
landing a third engine lost power 
a boeing 747 has a maximum fuel capacity of 320000 pounds and 
burns about 23500 pounds of fuel per hour while cruising with all 
four engines operating according to the manufacturer 
according to a report in the yomiuri shimbun a tokyo newspaper 
the gauge that indicates how much fuel is feeding into the engines 
showed there was almost no fuel going into engines one and four and 
that the no 3 engine was also malfunctioning 
leu declined to comment on the cause of the engine failure 
saying it was still under investigation

a pipe bomb blew out the door of an art museum that 
has been criticized in the cuban community over the handling of 
works by artists considered procastro but there were no injuries 
police said 
its a barbaric act to bomb a cultural center like the cuban 
museum museum vice president ramon cernuda said adding that the 
bombing tuesday was an attempt to intimidate directors of the cuban 
museum of arts and culture 
this is what happens when demagoguery reigns in this city 
he said 
police said they were unsure whether the pipe bomb was connected 
to the controversy but the bombing occurred about an hour after 
directors met to discuss a controversial exhibit planned for later 
this month 
we have only that a pipe bomb was thrown through one of the 
cuban museum windows by somebody on foot or in a car said police 
spokesman armando villorin said damage was limited to the glass 
door and a section of plaster wall inside the museum 
the museum flap began when cernuda included works by artists 
considered sympathetic to the cuban government in an april 22 
auction 
cernuda was the target of numerous threatening phone calls and 
was asked by other museum officials to resign but he refused

a syrian businessman who has undertaken several 
mediation missions for the release of french hostages in lebanon 
was expelled from france arab diplomatic and french government 
sources said

administrative procedure that does not require judicial approval to 
expel omran adham who is said to be close to president hafez assad 
of syria 
in an interview today with radio monte carlo pasqua neither 
confirmed nor denied the expulsion but said 
we cannot accept anyone of foreign nationality in our 
territory who by his actions hampers the efforts of the french 
government and risks causing harm to those who are being held 
hostage 
pasqua said adham had not served as an intermediary for the 
french government since march 1986 in negotiations aimed at 
freeing french hostages 
adham left france on tuesday by plane for another european 
capital after the expulsion order was signed by pasqua the sources

pennsylvania lottery officials are reviewing 
security measures in the wake of an insider scam that almost 
allowed two men to get away with a 152 million jackpot 
lottery officials revealed tuesday that a ticket turned in last 
week for the jackpot was bogus and an employee at the company that 
runs the lottery computer had been charged along with a man who 
claimed the prize 
gov robert p casey ordered a suspension of the contract 
extension for control data corp until the commonwealth is 
totally satisfied that all reasonable safeguards against fraud have 
been built into the security system 
one of the two men charged in the case henry arthur rich 
worked for control data as a troubleshooter for the lotterys 
mainframe computer 
state attorney general leroy s zimmerman alleged rich used a 
control data computer to identify unclaimed jackpots and to print a 
copy of the winning ticket from the july 15 super 7 drawing 
also charged was mark s herbst who claimed the prize last 
thursday 
both men were arraigned on charges of theft by unlawful taking 
theft by deception criminal conspiracy and forgery and were held 
in the dauphin county prison in lieu of 50000 bail 
rich also was charged with unlawful use of a computer and 
tampering with public information 
if convicted herbst could be jailed for up to 31 years and 
fined 70000 zimmerman said rich could face 40 years in prison 
and 90000 in fines 
zimmerman said officials have no evidence of anyone else 
participating in the scam or of any other bogus tickets in 
pennsylvania or delaware where rich also had access to the lottery 
computer 
james scroggins the lotterys executive director said the scam 
was discovered last thursday shortly after herbst received the 
first 469989 installment of the prize 
when herbst claimed the jackpot he said he had been using the 
ticket as a bookmark and checked the numbers after seeing a 
newspaper story about the unclaimed prize 
but the bogus ticket was printed on a blank from a scranton 
outlet while a computer check showed the actual winner was sold in 
bucks county the holder of the ticket bought in bucks county has 
never come forward 
a spokesman at control data said tuesday the firm had been told 
by the state revenue department not to comment although revenue 
officials said no such order had been given 
a previous insider incident occured in the april 24 1980 
drawing of pennsylvanias daily number the drawing was fixed by 
altering pingpong balls used to pick the winning digits 
the socalled 666 case named after the winning numbers also 
resulted in tighter security for the televised drawings as well as 
the convictions of six participants

the rules for covering presidential elections 
have changed and jesse jackson has won a place in historyr 
according members of a panel of journalists at a 75th anniversary 
dinner for the columbia university graduate school of journalism 
the panel members were benjamin bradlee executive editor of the 
washington post patrick buchanan cohost of cable news networks 
program crossfire max frankel executive editor of the new 
york times and judy woodruff an anchor on the macneillehrer 
newshour 
the press now has the power to destroy said buchanan 
referring to the failure of gary harts candidacy for the 
democratic nomination following revelations he spent a weekend with 
a miami model 
the panelists noted that the infidelities of president kennedy 
and the polio of president franklin d roosevelt were largely 
ignored in coverage of their presidential races 
frankel said there has been a maturing of reporting and 
analysis but added that journalists have not been cured of the 
urge to predict and handicap the races 
television has made progress ms woodruff said but is still 
too dependent on snappy eightsecond sound bites and is too 
preoccupied with polls 
bradlee said the 1988 campaign has become the longest ever and 
the length was hindering coverage however the character issues 
have changed the rules of journalism he said and the other 
panelists agreed with him 
jesse jackson changed the political arena for better and 
forever he said he called jackson the candidate of the 
left which he said was still vital and alive in the country 
jackson went beyond winning a victory or winning the 
nomination he won a place in history said frankel 
the panel was moderated by albert hunt washington bureau chief 
of the wall street journal almost 300 people attended the dinner 
and panel discussion in the rotunda of low memorial library

oregon have agreed to pay 394 million to settle securities fraud 
claims against them stemming from a bond default on two abandoned 
nuclear power plants 
the agreements announced tuesday bring to about 243 million the 
total settlements reached so far in the giant legal action begun in 
1982 after the washington public power supply system walked away 
from the plants and defaulted on 225 billion in bonds 
money from the bonds was used to start construction of the 
plants wppss nos 4 and 5 
the 15 parties settling tuesday with plaintiff bondholders 
included 10 in the oregon public entities group which held 8 
percent of the plants and a group of five washington agencies 
with 18 percent interest in the plants

washington agreed to pay 74 million 
also this week 24 utilities called the small utilities group

interest in the plants 
the settlements are subject to approval by us district judge 
william browning who has presided over the lawsuit it is 
scheduled to go to trial sept 7 in tucson ariz 
the case dubbed multidistrict level 551 resulted from the 
biggest default in the history of the municipal bond market 
eightyeight utilities agreed to build the two wppss plants 
during the 1970s but the plants were abandoned after cost overruns 
and an assessment that the power from the plants would not be 
needed

a decade ago one is operating and two others have been partially 
completed but mothballed with prospects uncertain they will ever 
be finished 
bonds that went to pay for the other three plants are being paid

federal ethics officials want to know why 
attorney general edwin meese iii solicited 30000 lawyers and 
businessmen to pay more than 3000 apiece to a profitmaking 
organization to attend a conference 
the office of government ethics on tuesday launched an 
investigation into meeses april 26 letter said frank q nebeker 
the head of the ethics office 
meeses letter written on his official stationery and 
emblazoned with the justice department seal was sent to 30000 
people whose names were provided by everyone from the american 
bar association the advisory committees on both sides to the 
american chamber of commerce in japan said norm swanson 
chairman of the citizen ambassador program the profitmaking group 
that is a cosponsor of the meeting along with a japanese federation 
a presidential order on ethics forbids federal officials from 
engaging in conduct that might present the appearance of 
favoritism conflict of interest or loss of objectivity in 
governmental decision making the appearance of such a problem is 
enough to trigger an investigation it also is a crime to use the 
justice department seal for nonauthorized purposes 
meanwhile sources said tuesday that meese reversed a justice 
department position on the breakup of american telephone amp 
telegraph co at a time when he owned 14000 in regional bell 
stock and the los angeles times reported today that a senate 
subcommittee will report that meese violated government policy when 
he tried to help the wedtech corp 
meese will be heading a us delegation to the aug 29sept 1 
legal and economic conference in japan called the usjapan 
bilateral session a new era in legal and economic relations 
justice department spokesman terry eastland said the department 
was unaware that a profitmaking organization was involved but he 
contended meeses involvement might still be justified 
the us sponsor for the meeting is the citizen ambassador 
program of people to people international the kansas city 
mobased people to people international is a nonprofit 
organization set up originally in the state department by 
thenpresident dwight eisenhower swanson said 
the citizen ambassador program however is a profitmaking 
organization that works exclusively to set up international 
exchanges for people to people swanson said tuesday night in a 
telephone interview from his home in spokane wash 
yes the citizen ambassador program is forprofit which is 
how eisenhower established the program with the intention of making 
it selfsupporting swanson said 
the cost for participants is listed as 3240 swanson said he 
said the amount includes transportation and lodging and an 800 
registration fee set by the japanese organizing committee 
swanson acknowledged his company is paying 100 to people to 
people international for each person who signs up for the 
conference but he denied that it was a payoff 
ever since the beginning of the people to people organization 
the relationship has been that the delegates on any project pay a 
fee to people to people international to become members swanson 
said his company collects the fee from participants and pays it to 
people to people and the new members hopefully become involved in 
chapter projects penpal projects sister city projects and 
others 
swanson said he could not say how much profit his company might 
earn 
i wish i knew he said its not large it depends on the 
participation in the conference 
eastland said the justice department became involved when 
people to people international came to us and represented 
themselves as a nonprofit taxexempt organization 
to the extent that theyre linked to some group that is 
profitmaking that was not known by those making decisions on the 
attorney generals participation he said 
it could be argued that the department could engage in a joint 
venture so long as it was in the departments interest and 
obviously we have an interest in international legal questions 
meese sent out a similar letter and hosted a us delegation to 
a similar conference sponsored by people to people international in 
china last summer eastland said 
justice department legal and ethics authorities reviewed both 
cases to make sure the attorney generals participation was 
permissible he said 
the department covers meeses expenses for the trips this year 
he will be making an official visit at the same time to japanese 
minister of justice yukio hayashida 
however expenses for meeses wife ursula for last years trip 
were paid by people to people international in return for the 
frankly exhausting role that she fulfilled in being head of the 
womens contingent for the conference swanson said 
eastland said that was permissible under department regulations 
swanson said the cost for the china meeting including 
transportation was about 2500 
the twopage letter from meese says in part although 
attended and assisted by senior officials of the governments of 
both japan and the united states the conference is fittingly a 
nongovernmental one administered on behalf of the japanese by 
japans federation of economic organizations keidanren and on the 
american side by the citizen ambassador program of the people to 
people international organization 
i invite and encourage your participation sincerely edwin 
meese iii attorney general 
in connection with the atampt breakup administration sources told 
the associated press on tuesday that meese was urged by his friend 
e robert wallach to get involved then obtained a white house 
waiver letting him make a decision and approved a reversal of the 
departments previous position urging a federal judge to lift 
restrictions barring the regional bell companies from entering 
various new types of business 
meese whose telephone stock holdings and meetings with regional 
bell executives have been under criminal investigation received 
wallachs advice in a memo in middecember 1986 the sources said 
meeses attorney james rocap said tuesday that he had no 
knowledge that mr meese ever saw or read the memo and that 
meeses decision to seek a waiver was based solely on the advice 
of the attorney generals staff 
wallach is under indictment in the wedtech scandal in which 
meese remains under criminal investigation 
the los angeles times reported today that the senate 
governmental affairs subcommittee on oversight of government 
management will report that meese as counsel to president reagan 
in 1981 violated a white house ban on intervening in government 
contracts on behalf of friends when he tried to help wedtech 
meeses lawyer nathan lewin disputed the subcommittees 
findings saying meeses actions did not give the appearance of 
impropriety and did not fall within the scope of the white 
house regulation

michael dukakis harvesting another pair of landslide primary 
victories sounded ever more confident of his claim to the 
democratic presidential nomination while rival jesse jackson vowed 
today hes in the race all the way despite setbacks in ohio and 
indiana 
republican george bush looked ahead to the fall and cautioned 
his supporters weve got a long way to go 
jackson scored an expected victory tuesday in the district of 
columbia but found himself slipping an additional 120 delegates 
behind dukakis who won handily in ohio and indiana 
his latest victories moved dukakis to fewer than 600 delegates 
from the 2081 he needs to clinch the nomination he also moved 
more than 600 ahead of his only rival 
but jackson gave no sign he was ready to end what he called a 
struggle for the direction of our party and the soul of our 
nation 
were within striking distance jackson said on cbss this 
morning program its not over really till its over whats 
next is west virginia and nebraska oregon new mexico california 
new jersey 
asked if he is in the race for the long run jackson replied 
all the way 
jackson was seeking support today among house democrats and then 
holding strategy sessions with aides before flying off to nebraska 
which holds its primary tuesday as does west virginia 
meanwhile former democratic candidate bruce babbitt said he 
would accept the no 2 spot on the presidential ticket but would 
advise frontrunner dukakis to select a southerner 
bruce babbitt is from southern arizona thats not enough 
babbitt said on the cbs show its got to be somebody from the 
south sam nunn or chuck robb 
but nunn the georgia senator frequently mentioned as a vice 
presidential candidate said today he has not very much 
interest in taking the post 
on a scale of one to 10 10 being the most interest my 
interest is about level one so i have not very much interest 
nunn said on nbctvs today show 
the senator said he would discuss the possibility with dukakis 
when the candidate wants to talk 
ive never desired that job so well just have to roll up our 
pants when we get to the creek and were not to the creek yet 
he said 
democratic party leaders tempered their euphoria over the latest 
signal that their nomination marathon was over with concern that 
jacksons recent attacks on dukakis could provide campaign 
ammunition for the republicans in the fall 
i would hope he wouldnt say anything that could be used 
against mike in the general election said gov bill clinton of 
arkansas who predicted dukakis would win the democratic nomination 
on the first ballot at the partys convention in july 
judy carnahan chairman of the oregon democratic party said 
jacksos recent attacks were very disappointing what hes 
managing to do is diminish his own stature 
that view was by no means unanimous 
lynn cutler vice chair of the democratic national committee 
said she wasnt concerned about jacksons rhetoric 
i dont believe any of it is stuff were going to see coming 
back at us out of george bushs mouth she said hes trying to 
draw distinctions and i dont blame him for that i dont think 
there is anything there that is problematic 
questioned today about the democratic leaders concerns jackson 
said well in this stage im trying to help my chances and 
thats the first issue because both of us are running for the 
nomination 
im not pushing dukakis im pulling dukakis and pulling bush 
into facing issues that will make a difference in this country 
he said on the cbs program i challenge judgment distinction and 
differences but not integrity 
when dukakis was asked if he thought jackson should tone down 
his attacks the massachusetts governor replied hes got to make 
that judgment im going to try to keep this as positive as i can 
in recent days jackson has repeatedly pressed dukakis to 
provide more details of his plans for improving education and day 
care and reducing the federal budget deficit 
no prominent democrats were ready to call on jackson to end his 
campaign and dukakis appeared content to see the contest play out 
through the final democratic primaries on june 7 
clinton said there were a number of governors who were willing 
to endorse him dukakis before this time but were discouraged 
by dukakis 
he just didnt want to be perceived as trying to stop 
jackson said clinton he wanted to win the votes in the 
primaries ahead 
riding high after a streak of primary victories that included 
connecticut wisconsin new york pennsylvania indiana and ohio 
dukakis said tuesday night he thought it was going to be 
difficult for jackson to deny him the nomination 
bush celebrated his lock on the nomination at a hotel within 
walking distance of the white house and urged his supporters not to 
let up 
i dont feel any finality to what has happened now at all 
he told a cheering crowd weve passed the first step a 
tremendously important step but now weve got a long way to 
go 
the vice presidents son george bush jr urged the partisan 
crowd we want you to go out and kick some mike dukakis and kick 
him hard 
bush went over the top in his quest for a gop convention 
majority last week in pennsylvania and at his washington rally he 
offered this preview of the fall campaign 
let mike dukakis go around here talking about pink slips 
despair pessimism in the united states ill be the guy out there 
talking about hope and opportunity and challenge 
there were 254 delegates at stake in the three primaries 
the latest associated press tally gave dukakis 1486 and jackson 
927 
in ohio with 99 percent of the precincts reporting dukakis had 
860896 or 63 percent to 378315 or 28 percent for jackson 
in indiana with 98 percent of the precincts reporting dukakis 
had 436955 or 70 percent to jacksons 138496 or 22 percent 
in the district of columbia final unofficial returns showed 
jackson had 67812 votes or 80 percent while michael dukakis had 
14969 or 17 percent jackson captured 13 of the districts 16 
democratic convention delegates dukakis won 3 
on the republican side bush had 648478 or 81 percent of the 
republican vote in ohio with 99 percent of the precincts reporting 
341332 or 83 percent in indiana with 98 percent of the precincts 
reporting and 5620 for 89 percent in final unofficial returns in

scientists say a balloon flight over 
antarctica has given them confirmation that supernovas are the only 
origin of gold and other heavierthaniron elements such as copper 
and lead 
the 1987 supernova explosion itself was one of the most 
significant events in 20th century astrophysics and now its 
giving us an opportunity to answer old questions on the origin of 
matter in the universe said carl rester director of apex the 
recently established laboratory for astrophysics and planetary 
exploration at the university of florida 
elements lighter than iron are formed under normal conditions 
within stars but scientists have long theorized it would take the 
shock waves and extremely high temperatures of a supernova 
explosion to form most elements heavier than iron 
supernova explosions are rare and cause a star to suddenly 
become 10 million to 100 million times brighter 
when astronomers spotted supernova 1987a last february rester 
saw a unique opportunity and quickly mobilized several agencies to 
investigate 
on jan 8 researchers at the university of florida and the nasa 
goddard space flight center launched a balloon carrying an 
instrument called grad for gamma ray advanced detector from near 
mcmurdo station in antarctica 
for three days it floated 22 miles above the earth suspended 
from a helium balloon the size of a football field from that 
vantage point it had a clear view of supernova 1987a unobstructed 
by the earths atmosphere 
the balloonsuspended instrument detected gamma rays from the 
radioactive decay of cobalt56 to iron56 proving that cobalt 
which is heavier than iron was formed in the supernova 
national aeronautics and space administration researchers had 
detected radiation from cobalt56 late last year but rester says 
the grad project provided much more detail 
colorshift readings also indicate the supernova did not explode 
symmetrically as an expanding sphere rather it exploded with 
lobes and fingers protruding in several directions with 
significant mixing of its core and mantle 
rester said a ucla scientist is examining the data to try to 
further reconstruct the explosion which occurred 170000 years 
ago though the light reached the earth only last year

iraqi warplanes bombed an iranian oil 
refinery and a petrochemical complex today and iran claimed its 
antiaircraft gunners shot down three of the attacking jets 
the iraqi raids were the first major attacks on iranian cities 
since the two persian gulf war foes halted the latest round of 
their socalled war of the cities april 21 they pounded each 
others cities with more than 300 missiles feb 29april 21 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia quoted a 
military communique as saying one formation of fighterbombers 
attacked and set fire to the refinery in the southwestern city of 
shiraz the refinery one of five in iran has a capacity of 48000 
barrels a day 
other warplanes hit a petrochemical plant in the area the iraqi 
report said 
irans official islamic republic news agency also monitored in 
cyprus said several people were killed in the raids on shiraz 
two frenchbuilt mirage f1s were downed in the second raid 
irna said 
the agency reported that one pilot bailed out and was captured 
there was no word on the fate of the other pilot 
tehran radio said a third iraqi jet was shot down but did not 
say where or give any other details 
irna said an industrial plant in the oilproducing gachsaran 
region 100 miles west of shiraz also was bombed in another iraqi 
raid 
there was no mention of that raid in the iraqi communique which 
declared that iraq would inflict further painful blows on the 
iranian regime until it complies with the un security council 
ceasefire resolution passed last july 20 
iraq has said it will abide by the resolution if iran does 
tehran has said it will not comply until iraq is branded the 
aggressor 
the iraqi air force attacks irans refineries and other oil 
installations to throttle the iranian economy and force and end to 
the 7yearold war 
oil industry sources have reported that irans refining capacity 
has been cut by about onethird in recent weeks because of the 
bombing this has forced iran to import unprecedented amounts of 
refined products such as kerosene and jet fuel the sources said 
they spoke on condition of anonymity 
iran has reported iraqi warplanes repeatedly have flown over its 
western cities in the last few days irna said the intruding jets 
were driven off by antiaircraft fire 
both countries have claimed their border towns have come under 
artillery fire recently 
both have reported continued artillery battles and skirmishes 
along the 730mile frontline in the past two weeks but there has 
been no major ground action since april 18 when iraq recaptured 
the southern faw peninsula iran seized control of the peninsula in 
february 1986 
iran has reported sending tens of thousands of men to the front 
in a renewed mobilization following naval clashes with the united 
states in the persian gulf the us navy said it sank or disabled 
six iranian vessels in the april 18 fighting

it was an auction that publicitysavvy andy 
warhol would have loved with enthusiastic buyers shelling out more 
than 25 million for the late pop artists possessions from 
plastic watches to paintings 
by the time the final gavel fell tuesday on sothebys 10day 
warhol sale an estimated 60000 people had passed through the 
auction houses galleries to view his private collection 
were thrilled said diana d brooks president of sothebys 
north america i think that from start to finish it was one of 
the great sales in sothebys history 
the sale brought in 253 million well above sothebys official 
preauction estimates of 9 million to 13 million but close to 
predictions by independent experts 
our feeling when we figured the estimates was that we wouldnt 
add any warhol factor said ms brooks i think what were 
seeing today is an indication not only of the warhol factor but 
of a very strong art market 
but a strong art market does not explain some of the sales such 
as the 2640 paid for three commercially manufactured plastic 
watches bearing the likenesses of cartoon characters fred 
flintstone judy jetson and gumby 
you cannot connect that with the normal art market said 
jeffrey deitch a vice president for the citibank private banking 
group who buys art for the banks clients warhol had lots of 
enthusiastic admirers and people want something that he chose it 
means something to people 
for whatever reason buyers were willing to pay dearly for just 
about anything owned by warhol the artist who elevated the 
ordinary like campbells soup cans to art warhol died in 
february 1987 
sales figures included 23000 for a pair of cookie jars 
55000 for a set of salvador dali ear clips and 605000 for a 
roy lichtenstein painting sailboats 
proceeds from the auction go to the andy warhol foundation for 
the visual arts which was established by the artist to support 
cultural institutions 
the highestpriced item at the sale was an untitled 1967 
painting by cy twombley that fetched 990000 a record for a work 
by that artist it was one of many records set during the sale 
the enthusiastic bidding though was a turnoff to some 
professional art dealers 
its a joke to attempt to buy here complained geert von der 
veen of toronto i dont think there are many dealers who could 
touch those prices or want to youd look crazy 
still he would not say private collectors who claimed their 
piece of the warhol legacy had made a mistake 
certainly in the past 30 years that ive been in the business 
it really hasnt mattered if someone overpaid even grossly 
overpaid for a work of art van der veen said time proved them 
right eventually

speedtheplow has more on its mind than 
madonna 
in fact the broadway debut of one of rocks biggest stars is 
not the reason to see playwright david mamets brash biting and 
lewdly funny look at the film industry 
in speedtheplow mamet examines the art of the movie deal 
which is not to be confused with the art of making a good movie 
the play in three short acts skewers hollywood producers with the 
same savage humor that mamet used to dissect chicago real estate 
salesmen in his pulitzer prizewinning glengarry glen ross 
speedtheplow which opened tuesday at broadways royale 
theater is a small narrowly focused evening but its absolutely 
on target ambushing the egomaniacs who decide what reaches the 
silver screen 
mamet has created two wonderful wouldbe hollywood magnates 
the kind of guys who wear expensive baggy italian suits no ties 
and talk exclusively in movie industry lingo dropping such lines 
as greenlighting a project or doing a courtesy read of a 
new book for the head of the studio they have no ready cash and no 
apparent class 
these two producers are also good friends and mamet has some 
telling comments about what success does to relationships both 
male and female bobby joe mantegna is the new head of production 
at a major studio and charlie ron silver has just wangled the 
services of a major star for a prison film they need each other 
all systems are go on the prison flick until a temporary 
secretary played by madonna suggests a film based on a novel 
about the historical effects of nuclear radiation its that book 
the studio chief wanted bobby to read and shes ready to be cut in 
on the deal 
mantegna and silver are superb mantegna is all oily charm hes 
ready to shake hands and stab backs at the same time silver 
matches mantegnas obnoxiousness and has a thirdact temper tantrum 
that will probably bring him a tony nomination 
the play has received an extraordinary amount of attention 
because of madonna but she is a minor and not very successful part 
of speedtheplow her acting is tentative devoid of any 
personality she has none of the oomph needed to hold her own with 
the more flamboyant mantegna and silver 
director gregory mosher long associated with mamets plays 
gives the play a hardedged staccato style the actors machinegun 
their lines to each other 
the setting designed by michael merritt is odd long flowing 
curtains frame bobbys new office a collection of furniture 
covered with dropcloths 
speedtheplow wins this seasons award for most obscure 
title its a variation on a line in the conspiracy of charles 
duke of byron by elizabethan playwright george chapman the 
expression means do your work well or at least get on with 
it mamet and two members of his cast have followed that advice 
in other reviews 
frank rich of the new york times called the play riveting 
theater and a worthwhile funny evening mamet rich writes 
has developed into a more inventive storyteller than most people 
working in the movies 
he also praised the intelligent scrupulously disciplined 
comic acting of madonna whom he said needs only more 
confidence to relax a bit and fully command her speaking voice 
but howard kissel drama critic for the daily news says 
madonnas performance falls short being vacant on the stage 
requires more effort than it does in real life he writes 
elegantly designed impeccably directed speedtheplow is 
mamets clearest wittiest play he concluded i bet it would 
be even funnier with an actress 
clive barnes new york post review said the play is crammed 
with wonderful dazzling brilliant lines and it calls the cast 
of three twothirds perfect and onethird hopeful 
madonna tries hard in a judy holliday role but sounds more as 
if she were auditioning than acting and the audition is scarcely 
for the big time said barnes 
madonna is ok sort of but mamets speedtheplowwith 
the irresistible joe mantegna and a riveting breakthrough 
performance by ron silver is a vicious scabrous hilarious 
meanspirited joy of a play linda winer said in newsday 
madonnas performance was a gutsy try but in a scene that 
she must carry the play comes to a screeching stop while we wait 
for her to finish and for the professional actors to regain 
control said winer

students here boycotted school for a day and it 
was their parents idea theyre protesting a lack of library 
books and sports equipment 
we are breaking our necks trying to get the kids to school 
said principal richard p schnettler having adults tell them not 
to go to school this has an effect on them 
the juarez school council organized the demonstration to demand 
more money for library books especially those for computer 
science and those in the spanish language and physical education 
equipment 
about 1500 of the 1763 students at the predominately hispanic 
benito juarez high school stayed away from classes tuesday 
a group of some 200 parents who organized the boycott stood 
outside the school to turn away all students except seniors who 
need to fulfill class requirements for graduation 
after spending a couple of hours at the school the group 
marched two miles to board of education headquarters and met with 
deputy superintendent joseph lee who told them of the lack of 
funds 
theyre getting their fair share said board spokesman bob 
saigh in fact they might be getting more than their fair 
share 
protest organizers later met with schnettler but failed to 
resolve anything the principal said 
the library is firstclass he said none of us is denying 
the need for more books 
at a meeting of 350 parents and school officials monday night

communist authorities agreed to let 
catholic intellectuals mediate in two major strikes a solidarity 
activist said today after lech walesa warned of a bloody 
revolution if workers dont get a say in reform 
at the huge lenin shipyard where solidarity was born in 1980 
workers in the third day of an occupation strike backed down from a 
demand that the outlawed independent labor federation be legalized 
nationwide 
walesa a solidarity founder said strike leaders decided to 
limit the demand to solidaritys shipyard branch because they felt 
they had a greater chance of success 
there will be many different strikes around the country even 
if they crush the shipyard we will do it walesa told strikers 
after returning to the shipyard today the only reason the entire 
country is not on strike is that it is too early 
polands roman catholic bishops declared in a statement today 
that polish society has the right to seek to be in charge of its 
own fate the statement urged authorities to find common 
solutions for poland by meeting with representative groups 
it was the first official statement by the church on polands 
worst wave of labor unrest since 1981 
in warsaw solidarity activist henryk wujec said authorities had 
agreed to permit a mediation role for five independent 
intellectuals linked with the catholic church which claims 94 
percent of poles as followers 
he said the five had split into two groups one leaving for the 
lenin steelworks in the krakow suburb of nowa huta the other for 
the 12000worker shipyard in this baltic port 
the five included andrzej stelmachowski chairman of the warsaw 
catholic intellectuals club his wife said he left today at the 
request of church authorities for the nowa huta steelworks now in 
the ninth day of a strike 
at church headquarters in warsaw a secretary said a meeting was 
in progress and no one could comment but there would be an 
announcement later 
the mood was subdued in gdansk this morning there was no heavy 
police presence as had been the case tuesday night 
about 3000 workers spent the night in the yard and during the 
day their numbers rose to 7000 said strike committee chairman 
alojzy szablewski 
like the shipyard workers the 15000 striking steelworkers in 
nowa huta are demanding higher wages an independent union 
reinstatement of fired union activists and release of political 
prisoners 
chief government spokesman jerzy urban told a warsaw news 
conference tuesday that legalizing solidarity is not a question 
that can be an object of negotiations it is not negotiable 
communist authorities crushed the movement with martial law in 
december 1981 
at the shipyard tuesday walesa told strikers if we dont 
achieve a real reform this time then we will have a bloody 
revolution 
however the 44yearold electrician also said zdzislaw 
sadowski the deputy prime minister and architect of the 
governments reform program is trying to do something let him 
talk to us and we can do it together 
the government raised prices 42 percent this year as part of an 
attempt to overhaul the ailing economy 
the strikes began april 25 with an 11hour stoppage by transit 
workers in the northwestern city of bydgoszcz the strikers won a 
60 percent raise 
the next day a strike began at nowa huta the countrys 
largest steel plant workers at the defenseoriented foundry in the 
southeastern city of stalowa wola won promises of higher pay in a 
twoday strike that ended saturday 
walesa today denied a report which originated with local 
solidarity activist joanna wojciechowicz that 5000 gdansk 
shiprepair and port workers were idle tuesday in sympathy with the 
lenin shipyard strike 
on tuesday police in warsaw dispersed protesters who marched in 
support of the strikers while in krakow poznan and gdansk 
university students staged sympathy strikes opposition spokesmen 
in the four cities said 
government and opposition spokesmen confirmed a brief work 
stoppage tuesday at a railroad car plant in wroclaw and opposition 
spokesmen said about 1000 miners occupied the rudna copper mine in 
western poland for eight hours 
police have rounded up about a dozen opposition figures and 
apparently cut off the telephones of others sources said others 
went into hiding 
walesa told reporters that bogdan lis of gdansk and eight other 
regional solidarity leaders were arrested 
urban called the detentions preventive 
he also reiterated the government position that bowing to 
strikers demands for pay raises of up to 60 percent would upset 
economic reform and said strike leaders are professional 
politicians working for western powers 
walesa who won the 1983 nobel peace prize led the august 1980 
strike in gdansk that toppled a government and cosigned the 
accords that made solidarity the only free labor movement ever 
officially recognized in the soviet bloc 
the current labor trouble is the worst in poland since the 
crackdown on solidarity led by the countrys current leader gen 
wojciech jaruzelski

the soviet union conducted a nuclear weapons test 
this morning on the steppes of soviet central asia to upgrade its 
military technology the official tass news agency said 
it said the 20 kiloton to 150 kiloton underground blast at the 
semipalatinsk test range in kazakhstan occurred at 5 am moscow 
time but did not give the exact power of the blast 
twenty kilotons equivalent to the power of 20000 tons of tnt 
was the force of the us atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima japan 
in 1945 
this was the fifth soviet nuclear weapons test this year 
the soviets have proposed a moratorium on all such tests but 
us officials have objected because that they disagree with soviet 
proposals on how to enforce the ban 
a group of soviet scientists visited nevada last week to study 
ways of verifying ussoviet compliance with a possible test ban 
in january american scientists visited the semipalatinsk range for 
the same purpose

families of the 16 people killed in amtraks 
deadliest passenger train crash will share a 58 million settlement 
reached with conrail but relatives said they could never be 
compensated for the loss of loved ones 
no its not fair but maybe its as fair as things get id 
just as soon see them bankrupt the fact is what you want is your 
kid back after that nothing is fair said ann finkbeiner whose 
17yearold son thomas c colley was killed in the collision jan 
4 1987 at chase 
more than 175 people were injured when three linked conrail 
engines skidded through a stop signal into the path of a 
660passenger amtrak train traveling about 120 mph 
the tentative settlement of the families lawsuits announced 
tuesday is subject to the approval of consolidated rail corps 
board of directors and various courts 
the baltimore sun in todays editions quoted an unidentified 
attorney as saying some families will get more than 1 million 
based on factors that jurors would have considered had the cases 
gone to trial 
some of the victims had no economic dependents some were wage 
earners with families some were trapped for 11 hours and some were 
killed instantly the lawyer said 
but roger horn whose daughter ceres 16 died in the collision 
said it could be 580 million and there still would be no 
satisfaction in it would i rather have my daughter back at the 
dinner table at night of course 
horn said the image of lawyers with sharp pencils coming up 
with some horrible measurement of the worth of a life makes me just 
want to throw up every time i think about it 
horn said he hoped attention on the settlement would not 
distract from the continued effort for improved rail safety 
i know there will be public interest in this settlement and 
thats not bad or inappropriate but what is really important is 
not the lawsuit but reform legislation in washington and here we 
are 16 months after the accident and we dont have a single line 
of reform legislation passed yet horn said 
he and other relatives of those killed have pushed 
unsuccessfully for legislation to require rail bus and airline 
workers in critical positions to be randomly tested for drugs 
postaccident tests showed traces of marijuana in the blood and 
urine of the conrail engineer and the brakeman 
conrail agreed to settle the cases without conceding liability 
or the amount of damages incurred the 58 million is in addition 
to 75 million conrail agreed to place in an escrow account as a 
part of a proposed settlement of a classaction suit brought by 
those injured in the collision 
a separate lawsuit is pending in which conrail is seeking to 
force amtrak to cover all amounts paid by conrail for passenger 
injuries and deaths arising from the accident 
former conrail engineer ricky l gates who missed a track 
signal and drove three linked conrail locomotives through the track 
switch was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty 
to manslaughter 
gates still faces federal charges for conspiracy obstruction of 
an agency investigation and lying to investigators from the 
national transportation safety board about drug use

democratic primary voters nominated sen howard metzenbaum for a 
third term in ohio and picked indiana secretary of state evan bayh 
and north carolina lt gov bob jordan as candidates for governor 
in states where republicans now have the job 
metzenbaum 70 swamped a political newcomer in tuesdays 
balloting and will face cleveland mayor george voinovich the 
uncontested gop nominee who promised a barnburner of a fight 
the two have already raised more than 7 million between them 
you mark my words voinovich 51 told supporters the 
most focusedon race in the united states is going to be 
metzenbaumvoinovich 
metzenbaum said he was eager to run on his record as one of the 
most liberal members of congress and in a reference to his 
opponent and gop presidential standardbearer george bush he 
added as ive said before when the votes are counted in 
november im confident that 1988 will be a very disappointing year 
for republican candidates named george 
final unofficial returns showed metzenbaum had 1067138 votes 
or 83 percent and his lone opponent ralph applegate who runs a 
columbus lawncare business had 213120 votes or 17 percent 
also in ohio former cleveland mayor dennis kucinich who 
preceded voinovich in office and was blamed for much of the citys 
fiscal crisis failed in his latest comeback bid he lost to rep 
mary rose oakar by a 31 margin in a democratic congressional 
primary

indianas most respected political names swamped his only rival 
and will face republican lt gov john m mutz who had no primary 
opposition

bayh with a 45 percent to 32 percent lead over mutz the phone poll 
of 1017 registered voters from april 2328 had an error margin of 
31 percentage points 
mutz wasted no time in renewing his claim that bayh at 32 and 
after less than two years in statewide office is too young and 
inexperienced to be governor 
this is a comparison of abilities to lead a very large 
institution that being the state of indiana said mutz who has 
spent 20 years in state government 
introducing his family at a victory gathering mutz 52 looked 
at his son mark and said like another young attorney whos 
been practicing law in indiana for less than two years hes not 
ready to be governor 
indiana also has a senate race this year but neither republican 
sen richard g lugar nor democratic attorney jack wickes was 
opposed for his partys nomination

a chance to face gov jim martin who had no primary challengers in 
his bid for a second term martin is only the states second 
republican governor this century 
with 97 percent of the vote in jordan had 395904 votes or 80 
percent next came billy martin a servicestation employee not 
related to the governor with 59103 votes or 12 percent then 
carroll w crawford of mount ulla a former ku klux klansman with 
21692 votes or 4 percent james t lloyd of salisbury with 10158 
votes or 2 percent and bruce friedman an antinuclear activist 
from sylva with 9332 votes or 2 percent 
jordan said his battle against the governor would be a classic 
race and claimed he was steadily narrowing martins lead the 
greensboro news amp record reported that a recent survey showed 
jordan trailing martin 47 percent to 39 percent with 14 percent 
undecided the phone poll april 2326 of 834 voters had an error 
margin of 35 percentage points 
merle black political science professor at the university of 
north carolina at chapel hill said jordans challenge was to 
present a positive agenda that will excite democrats and 
independents to vote for him 
but hes also running as an underdog and hes got to give 
people reasons why jim martin shouldnt be reelected black said

democratic lt gov bob jordan has won the 
right to challenge his republican boss gov jim martin easily 
defeating four opponents in a primary election 
its the highest honor and the best opportunity the north 
carolina people have ever given me jordan said tuesday in an 
interview outside his hotel room after winning 
jordan said his general election battle against martin would be 
a classic race and said he was steadily narrowing the 
incumbents lead 
jordan had 391482 votes or 80 percent with 96 percent of 
unofficial returns in his closest opponent billy martin a 
servicestation employee not related to governor received 58150 
votes or 12 percent 
as lieutenant governor jordan 55 put forward policy 
initiatives on economic development and dropout prevention 
including a controversial plan to withhold drivers licenses from 
minors who quit school 
he attacked martin 52 as a governor who had done little of 
substance while taking credit for democrats accomplishments 
martin who had no opposition for the gop nomination hopes to 
become the first republican governor in north carolina to serve 
consecutive terms he was only the states second gop governor this 
century 
martin a former sixterm congressman and davidson college 
chemistry professor pointed to glowing economic statistics during 
his term and questioned jordans leadership skills 
early in the campaign newspaper polls showed martin with leads 
ranging from 14 to 30 percentage points but the greensboro news amp 
record reported last week that a survey it commissioned showed 
jordan trailing by only 47 percent to 39 percent with 14 percent 
undecided the phone poll april 2326 of 834 voters had an error 
margin of 35 percentage points

swayed by a complaint from prince charles city 
authorities said today they have withheld permission to build a 
ninestory apartment house overlooking the kensington palace 
residence of the heir to the british throne 
the planning committee for the london boroughs of kensington and 
chelsea said it deferred its decision after receiving a letter 
from a very eminent neighbor just before a tuesday night 
meeting 
regalian property ltd wants to put up a building with 45 
apartments worth between 46 million and 112 million each on 
twothirds of an acre near the palace 
the letter to the council written on buckingham palace 
stationery was signed by david wright the princes deputy private 
secretary said a borough spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the building seems to us to be an overdevelopment of the 
site the spokesman quoted the letter as saying 
he said the committee would reconsider the application only 
after the architect revised the plans 
charles intervention came as no surprise the prince has 
outspokenly criticized modern architects whom he has accused of 
ruining londons skyline and ignoring the opinions of ordinary 
people 
committee chairman simon orrewing said the panel might have 
withheld permission regardless of the princes opinion because the 
new building was too tall and the architecture insensitive 
but the letter from the palace added some sway i certainly 
cant deny that he added

defense secretary frank c carlucci 
acknowledged today the reagan administration scuttled plans to send 
coast guard ships to the persian gulf because of strong 
congressional opposition 
there were considerable objections on the part of the 
capitol hill when we consulted the hill and we decided it would 
be best not to go ahead at this time carlucci said on cbss 
this morning program 
the pentagon had been considering taking up to six coast guard 
boats off antidrug patrols and sending them to the gulf but the 
idea was sharply criticized by democrats and republicans alike 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said earlier this week that the plan was a nonstarter 
from the beginning and im glad carlucci could understand that 
that idea was going nowhere 
sen john warner rva said the decision came after carlucci 
listened carefully to those of us in congress including myself 
and the leadership who suggested that this would not be the right 
time to take coast guard vessels from the united states 
the administration is using its naval fleet to protect 11 
kuwaitiowned but usflagged tankers the navy announced this 
week that it will respond to pleas for help from any neutral 
merchant ships which are attacked in the wartorn gulf 
carlucci said the coast guard ships have an advantage over navy 
warships because theyre shallowdraft ships and therefore less 
vulnerable to mines and we looked at it from a military point of 
view 
two us ships have struck mines in the gulf in the last year

after an appeal by miamis mayor the 
state house criminal justice committee has approved a measure that 
would let voters decide whether to impose a sevenday waiting 
period for all handgun purchases 
miami mayor xavier suarez said the coolingoff period was needed 
to help prevent a repeat of shootings like three in the miami area 
aimed at law enforcement officers one of whom was killed 
ive been on national tv the last few days constantly 
answering questons on miami being dodge city said suarez our 
circumstances right now in miami are not good 
if the measure approved by the committee tuesday is passed by 
the full house and senate voters will decide in november whether 
to add the waiting period to the florida constitution 
rep ron silver the measures sponsor said he proposed the 
waiting period in part to counteract the damage to the states 
image from a 1987 law making it easier for people to carry 
concealed weapons 
as a result of the legislation we passed we have 
nationally achieved not the reputation i would like said silver 
we have achieved bad press 
silver said that if his legislation fails he would back a 
signature drive to place the constitutional amendment on the 
november ballot signatures from several hundred thousand 
registered voters across the state would be needed

more americans received federal tax refunds 
this year than last despite a thorough revision of the tax law and 
a confusing withholding form the internal revenue service said 
today 
through april 29 the latest figures available the irs had 
certified 555 million refunds compared with 554 million at the 
same time last year refunds were claimed on 795 percent of the 
returns that had been processed up from 791 percent a year ago 
apparently withholding was more in line with tax liability 
than we had been expecting said irs spokesman johnell hunter 
tax experts had anticipated that fewer people might qualify for 
refunds this year because the new tax law required all employees to 
file new w4 withholding forms with their employers in 1987 
the first version of the new form was designed to match tax 
liability with withholding but it was so confusing that the irs 
eventually developed an alternative w4a that was simpler but 
less accurate 
another forecast that fewer people would itemize deductions 
under the new law was closer to target through april 15 
slightly fewer than half the 49 million couples and individuals who 
filed the long form 1040 itemized deductions compared with 60 
percent last year 
through friday the irs had received 986 million returns a 2 
percent increase over 967 million in the same period in 1987 
before the year is out the agency anticipates 1076 million total 
filings compared with 104 million last year 
some other statistics from this years filing season 
almost 48 million people have asked so far for automatic 
fourmonth extensions beyond the april 15 filing deadline at this 
time last year the irs had counted about 44 million for reasons 
the irs cannot explain the number of extensions fluctuated 
significantly among the 10 regional centers at philadelphia 
extensions were 28 percent below last years mark while at 
cincinnati they were up 47 percent 
the average refund this year has been 850 compared with just 
under 849 last year 
the irs has processed 699 million returns so far this year 
down 02 percent from 70 million in 1987 
only slightly more couples and individuals hired professionals 
to fill out their returns this year despite confusion about the 
new law through april 15 456 percent of the returns were 
professionally prepared compared with 449 percent at the same 
time last year

bayh will face lt gov john m mutz 52 who was unopposed for 
the republican nomination current gop gov robert d orr who at 
71 is the nations oldest governor was barred from seeking a third 
straight term 
bayh if elected would be the states youngest chief executive 
this century only jonathan jennings first governor of indiana 
after it became a state in 1816 and james b ray the fourth were 
younger 
a poll published sunday by the fort wayne journalgazette showed 
bayh with a 45 percent to 32 percent advantage over mutz in a 
preview of the fall race the telephone poll of 1017 registered 
voters from april 2328 had an error margin of 31 percentage 
points

bayh in claiming victory said this campaign begins tonight

would compare abilities to lead a very large institution that 
being the state of indiana

an issue of bayhs youth and his relative lack of experience after 
only two years in statewide office 
introducing his son mark at a victory gathering mutz said 
like another young attorney whos been practicing law in indiana 
for less than two years hes not ready to be governor 
senate minority leader frank l obannon whose name was placed 
on the democratic ballot by bayhs campaign in case bayh lost a 
challenge to his eligibiity ran a distant third the state supreme 
court said last week that bayh met the states fiveyear residency 
requirement despite a sojourn in washington

teamsters president jackie pressers recurring 
health problems have made him incapable of preparing his defense 
against federal racketeering and embezzlement charges according to 
a letter filed in federal court 
the letter handdelivered by pressers lawyer john r climaco 
to us district judge george w white sharply contradicts a 
medical report by an endocrinologist hired by the government and 
appears to be a prelude to a request to delay the trial set to 
open july 12 
the doctor hired by federal prosecutors dr john j canary 
said on feb 26 that presser could work four hours a day 
he presser has been advised by his treating physicians and a 
renowned endocrinologist that dr john canarys findings border on 
the preposterous climaco wrote he is not currently capable of 
assisting in his defense 
climacos letter tuesday was his first public comment after 
published reports that presser had health problems that required 
two recent hospital visits pressers medical history includes 
openheart surgery in 1985 and the removal of a malignant lung 
tumor in january 1987 
the letter and a motion filed in federal court tuesday repeated 
climacos demands for documents showing the symbiotic 
relationship among presser codefendant anthony hughes and the 
fbi 
its time to remove the cloak of secrecy the government has 
used to hide the facts of this case from the defendants and this 
court the motion states 
the motion says the governments file is essential to show a 
jury the importance length and value of the informant 
relationship which existed between cooperating citizens presser 
hughes and the fbi 
federal prosecutors asked white on monday to order pressers 
lawyers to provide them with pressers latest medical records

living the life of a wellrespected lawabiding citizen under a 
dead mans name 
the new life he had built for himself was shattered tuesday 
police said when florida law agents arrested the man who called 
himself danny lee wallen 
agents said wallen general manager of a seafood restaurant was

the famed cape hatteras lighthouse in north 
carolina could be moved about 500 feet inland to save it from an 
eroding seashore a committee of experts decided in a national 
research council report 
the report said that errosion has placed the 208foottall 
landmark which has flashed its warning to mariners for more than 
100 years in danger of being damaged or destroyed by a severe 
hurricane 
errosion has whittled the beach to within 160 feet of the tower 
according to the report which was made available this week 
moving the lighthouse would be a more practical way of saving it 
than trying to protect the site from erosion by the sea the study 
said other methods of protecting the lighthouse such as building 
a seawall around it also were examined 
the landmark structure is the tallest brick lighthouse in the 
united states and weighs about 2800 tons the lighthouse was built 
in 1870 on a point of the north carolina barrier islands to warn 
sailors of the diamond shoals area just outside the islands 
the national park service asked for the study the national 
research council is the operating agency of the national academies 
of sciences and engineering the study does not comment on the 
advisability of saving the lighthouse but addresses only the 
technical ways of doing so

the state attorney general says that to 
avoid the appearance of a conflict he will turn over his 
investigation of gov rose moffords financial disclosures to a 
county attorneys office 
former gov evan mecham criticized attorney general bob corbin 
for the tuesday decision saying corbin should have the guts to 
do his duty corbins office is currently prosecuting mecham for 
campaign reporting violations 
corbin said tuesday he decided to withdraw from the 
investigation of whether mrs mofford had violated financial 
disclosure statutes because he is next in line to become governor 
if i were to bring charges i would be accused of doing it to 
become governor he said but he said the investigation would be 
called a whitewash if it cleared mofford 
mrs mofford succeeded mecham because she was secretary of 
state her successor as secretary of state cannot become governor 
because he was appointed not elected 
there is no legal conflict corbin said but there is an 
appearance i decided it would be better if we had somebody else 
take a look at it 
mrs mofford has acknowledged that she erred in not reporting a 
series of loans land holdings or other deals on her 
financialdisclosure statements dating back to 1978 she filed 
amended reports last week and made public 150 pages of legal 
documents 
her news aide vada manager said mrs mofford feels she will be 
exonerated and has no problem with an independent counsel 
conducting the investigation 
corbin said tuesday night that he had asked pima county attorney 
stephen neely to conduct the probe corbin said neely would have 
the option of bringing in another county attorney if necessary to 
assist in the investigation 
in the past corbin has called on neely or other county 
attorneys to handle cases when the attorney generals office has 
had a conflict 
mecham who is being prosecuted by corbin for failing to 
disclose a 350000 campaign loan was critical of the attorney 
general for withdrawing from the mofford probe 
tell him to have the guts to stand up and do his duty said 
mecham whose criminal trial begins may 19 dont take a powder 
dont run out of it conflict of interest when did conflict of 
interest have anything to do with him dont hide behind a conflict 
of interest 
corbin had a conflict of interest when he investigated mecham 
but that didnt dissuade him the former governor said

the army has conducted 173 
openair trials of organisms that simulate hazardous germ warfare 
agents over the last decade at this base in western utahs desert 
a spokeswoman said 
information provided to congress by dugway scientists shows that 
since 1978 the army conducted eight major experiments involving 
biological agents at the base those experiments required 173 
releases of organisms into the air 
the purpose of the experiments is defensive according to the 
army they allow the military to test such items as germ warfare 
detectors and alarm systems designed to alert troops they are under 
germwarfare attack to test whether certain chemicals might 
protect against an attack and to see how well tankprotection 
systems work 
dugway spokeswoman kathleen whitaker said that in 1977 the army 
released information about openair testing up to that time those 
documents listed at least 84 tests at dugway some using simulants 
for hazardous germs and some using actual biological agents that 
were banned in 1969 
a simulant is an organism that is similar to hazardous germs 
exhibiting some of the same characteristics but is not considered 
harmful itself by army scientists it can be either naturally 
occurring or a manmade strain 
according to the deseret news however some scientists believe 
that certain of the simulants are more dangerous than the army 
thought 
four trials in 1978 used the simulant serratia marcescens the 
test was to determine whether substances used to neutralize 
chemical weapons could do the same against biological weapons 
the army has said that organism is harmless but has since 
discontinued its use in 1979 victor yu a specialist in 
infectious diseases published an article saying the organism can 
cause meningitis wound infection and arthritis 
one hundred sixtysix of the remaining 169 tests since 19877 
used the niger variant of bacillus subtillus which the army also 
says is safe 
however rutger university professor leonard a cole in his 
book clouds of secrecy said doctors fear bacillus subtillus 
may cause infections and invade the bloodstream in debilitating 
diseases he said some scientists have also suggested that the 
organism can easily serve as a carrier for other dangerous viruses 
whitaker the army spokeswoman said the niger strain is 
harmless although other strains are not 
the last such openair test according to the army was 
conducted in september 1986

conservative sunni moslem sect saudi arabia like the other 
persian gulf arab states is run by sunnis while irans islamic

city councilor graham richards and a member of parliament mia 
loonat made the application to have the beaches opened to all 
races 
the measure was opposed by constitutional development minister 
chris heunis and the administrator of cape province gene louw 
richards called the decision a small victory for those of us 
fighting what sometimes seems to be a losing battle against the 
continuous inroads made by the government against basic human 
rights 
most beaches in the larger coastal cities of durban and cape 
town are open to all races however many beaches in smaller 
communities remain segregated

space shuttle astronauts and launch 
pad workers conducted an escape drill from a mock launch pad fire 
and explosion today in a rehearsal designed to help improve safety 
following the challenger tragedy 
several personnel received makebelieve injuries in the disaster 
exercise and 11 including two astronauts were evacuated by 
helicopter to two hospitals that conducted their own emergency 
rehearsals 
the other five astronauts and some pad workers were treated for 
minor injuries at the scene nasa said 
the astronauts all rookies who have not flown in space rode 
elevators to the 195foot level of launch pad 39b as if they were 
to board a shuttle on launch day 
although there was no shuttle on the pad they simulated entry 
into a spacecraft cabin following a report of smoke somewhere on 
the launch pad test director frank merlino called a major 
emergency and ordered an evacuation 
with water spraying the area as it would in a real emergency 
the astronauts and the seven members of the spacecraft closeout 
crew donned oxygen masks and made their way to seven slidewire 
baskets at the cabin level of the pad 
seven firerescue workers rushed to the pad from a station a 
mile away as they fought a mock fire at the 175foot level an 
hydraulic explosion occurred and test observers declared five 
of the firefighters injured 
they and the other simulated injured personnel were ferried by 
helicopter to hospitals seven went to florida hospital near 
orlando and four to jess parrish memorial hospital in titusville 
all those on the pad made their way to the baskets each of 
which holds three people but did not ride them down 1200foot 
cables to the ground 
some officials believe the swift 50 mph ride and abrupt halt in 
netting at the bottom would be risky and should be attempted only 
in an actual emergency 
instead the baskets were sent down with ballast and the 
astronauts and others took an elevator to ground level and 
reentered the baskets those not injured made their way to a 
concrete bunker near the launch pad 
nasa has said it plans to test the baskets with human passengers 
sometime before the next space shuttle flight that flight has been 
postponed until late august or early september nasa administrator 
james c fletcher said today 
the shuttle fleet has been grounded since the challenger and its 
seven crew members were lost in an explosion 73 seconds after 
launch on jan 28 1986 
a faulty booster rocket joint that allowed flames to escape 
caused the challenger tragedy and the biggest delay in launching 
the next shuttle has been in assembling the two rocket boosters 
that power it into orbit 
officials said the drill today would allow the astronauts to 
test new crew escape equipment intended to give them a better 
chance to survive a launch oad problem 
among the most important features of the upgraded system is the 
addition of more fire detection equipment and a backup electrical 
relay line that would flash a warning to launch directors if a pad 
emergency occurred 
fireinhibiting metal plating also has been added to the 
platform that connects the launch tower to the shuttle cabin two 
slidewire baskets have been added and all have been wrapped in fire 
resistant material 
astronauts participating today were frank culbertson ken 
cameron carl meade david low kathryn thorton pierre thuot and 
jerome apt 
another emergency drill is scheduled friday to rehearse a rescue 
of crew members from a shuttle that has crashlanded in a swamp 
near the shuttle landing runway here

jesse jackson said today he believes he still 
can capture the democratic presidential nomination despite 
resounding losses to michael dukakis in ohio and indiana jackson 
won the race for the district of columbias much smaller delegate 
package 
jackson told reporters he was concerned about fairness in the 
allocation of delegates who will choose the nominee but did not 
say specifically how he might challenge the process 
i can only appeal very openly for fairness he said at a 
washington news conference 
were within striking distance jackson said earlier on 
cbstv its not over really till its over whats next is west 
virginia and nebraska oregon new mexico california new jersey 
we look forward to these remaining contests and we are not only 
setting the pace for the campaign but setting the agenda as well 
jackson met early today with about 50 or 60 members of the house 
democratic caucus the caucus chairman rep richard gephardt of 
missouri characterized it as a very warm and successful 
meeting and said everyone admires the grace and tone with 
which jackson has conducted his campaign 
at his news conference jackson said dukakis leads him by only 8 
percentage points in the popular vote he said that margin should 
be reflected in the voting by super delegates those delegates 
selected by virtue of holding important party positions or public 
office 
the super delegates will do america a super favor by not 
interfering in the process i simply want fairness he said 
although the super delegate process was set up to enable those 
delegates to commit to the candidate of their choosing jackson 
said they should follow the popular vote and he suggested they 
should not take a bandwagon approach to the nomination before the 
primary season is over 
if super delegates wait until after june 8 they are in a 
better position as judges to help bring balance rather than using 
party machinery to parcel out delegates before the primaries end 
jackson said 
jackson said on cbs that he has gained victories despite the 
party machinery the pundits and the press 
the party machinery is saying in fact go for dukakis the 
pundits are saying go for dukakis in some sense the super 
delegates are moving in that direction and so against the party 
the pundits the press we press on against those odds he said 
were not about to turn back 
jackson slid further behind dukakis in the overall delegate 
count losing in ohio and indiana by margins of greater than 
2to1 in total delegates jackson trails dukakis by more than 500 
in the district of columbia which he also swept in his 1984 
presidential race jackson picked up 80 percent of the vote to 18 
percent for dukakis 
jackson scheduled a strategy powwow this afternoon with top 
advisers aides said the discussion would likely focus on mapping 
out the campaign through the remainder of the primaries and on what 
the jackson forces will do at the convention 
june 7 marks the end of the primary season with votes in new 
jersey and california 
jacksons schedule for the rest of the month includes heavy 
concentration on california which offers the biggest delegate 
prize in the nation with a few days spent in new jersey and oregon 
and brief forays to the small states remaining on the primary 
calendar 
today jackson met with 13 democratic members of congress who 
are part of a go west 88 group that is trying to focus the 
presidential contest on western issues 
rep ron wyden dore an organizer of the group said jackson 
discussed issues of concern to them including trade drugs 
immigration and energy 
he made it clear trade expansion was something very important 
on his agenda said wyden who told reporters the sessiom was a 
very positive kind of discussion the group also hopes to meet 
with dukakis he said 
despite a series of losses to dukakis jackson showed no signs 
of giving up his campaign and vowed to continue pressing the issues 
he has fought for reversal of president reagans economic 
policies and a war on drugs 
he said his campaign did not start with the kickoff of the 
primary season in iowa and will not end with the democratic 
convention this summer in atlanta 
it began in the back of a bus in montgomery alabama and now 
its three steps from the white house were on our way he said 
as he recalled the civil rights battles a generation ago

an aide to presidential candidate jesse 
jackson said today he apparently made a mistake in saying that 
jackson made about 46000 in consulting wages from entertainer 
bill cosby last year 
obviously what i said wasnt quite right there obviously 
needs to be some clarification at this point i dont have the 
clarification said frank watkins a longtime associate of 
jackson and political director of jacksons democratic campaign 
watkins said he spoke to cosby and his wife after their 
spokesman disputed watkins explanation on tuesday of jacksons 
income tax returns 
they just said they needed to talk to jackson about the 
matter watkins said adding he was trying to get the matter 
cleared up but had not been able to talk to the accountant who 
prepared the taxes 
jackson on tuesday released four years worth of federal income 
tax returns when asked about the cosby consulting fee he said he 
would provide an accounting to reporters at a later time 
jackson and his wife had income of nearly 210000 in 1987 and 
paid about onefourth of that in federal taxes they reported in 
their federal tax returns 
the bulk of the income last year 159000 came from 
personalities international inc a corporation headed by 
jacqueline jackson that provides management for clients and handles 
most of jacksons earnings from speaking fees and publications 
jackson is on contract to the corporation but is not a 
shareholder director or officer according to his presidential 
campaign he reported the money in the category of wages and 
salaries 
jackson also reported 46535 in fees for business services but 
where that money came from quickly became a source of controversy 
watkins said most of that was in consulting fees from cosby i 
dont know the nature of the work watkins said on tuesday 
but david brokaw a los angeles public relations agent who works 
for cosby quoted cosby as saying thats way off the mark 
brokaw added he did not provide reverand jackson with most of 
the 46535 for business services 
asked how much cosby did pay jackson brokaw said mr cosby 
says thats none of your business or check with irs 
cosby is a jackson supporter and has made a television ad for 
the campaign as well as doing benefit performances 
jackson promised reporters tuesday night he would provide more 
details on his finances at a briefing later his democratic 
presidential campaign released copies of his tax returns for 1984 
through 1987 
together with dividends interest and other income the couples 
1987 joint total income was 209358 before adjustments they 
reported 3474 in interest and dividend income their tax for the 
year was 53019 
jackson who is a minister and his wife reported paying 2145 
in unspecified cash contributions during 1987 
like many american families jackson and his wife took advantage 
of the working couple deduction until last year when that 
deduction was lost 
for 1987 the returns did not distinguish between income 
received by jackson and by his wife who is president and a 
director of personalities international inc watkins said she also 
was paid for speaking engagements 
on their 1986 returns 55000 was reported as income received 
by mrs jackson 
the jacksons income rose quickly after 1984 the year of his 
first presidential campaign they reported income that year of 
59453 including more than 6000 in interest income their 
federal taxes that year were 12103 according to the documents 
a year later 1985 their income jumped to 187839 they paid 
55809 in federal tax taking advantage of income averaging 
in 1986 they reported 186043 in income including 13633 in 
dividends from inner city broadcasting co which jackson holds 
stock in the jacksons paid 53103 in taxes that year 
the company headed by new york businessman percy sutton owns 
the apollo theater in new york and radio stations and is expanding 
into cable television 
jackson reported no dividends last year from inner city 
broadcasting co watkins said jackson continues to own the stock

increasing numbers of deadly weapons have been 
seized at city public schools this year and the board of education 
is considering setting up metal detectors to search students an 
official said 
bruce irushalmi director of the boards office of school 
safety said tuesday he had been asked by chancellor richard green 
to study the feasibility of metal detectors 
irushalmi said 1400 incidents involving weapons were reported 
in the last school year a figure he expects will rise by 10 
percent by the end of this school year in june the weapons include 
guns a crossbow and martial arts weapons 
he told a hearing of the city council education committee the 
detectors would act as a deterrent 
putting in a metal detector alters the image of the school 
he said but he added so do weapons 
irushalmi and ed muir head of the united federation of 
teachers safety committee linked the rise in the number of 
students carrying weapons to an increase in drug trafficking among 
them 
the metal detectors would first be installed on a pilot basis at 
a few high schools irushalmi said 
committee chairman herbert berman has introduced a bill that 
would require metal detectors in all of the citys nearly 1000 
public schools irushalmi said that would cost 4 million

farmers may be planting almost as many acres 
for the 1988 crop harvests as they did last year says an 
agriculture department analyst 
and that is having some effect on the amount of land farmers are 
putting into the longterm conservation reserve program or crp 
says ed allen of the departments economic research service 
based on surveys taken in march farmers indicated they would 
reduce 1988 plantings of major crops by only 871000 acres he said 
in the current issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
this is in marked contrast to 1987 when area planted to the 
same crops fell 241 million acres and to 1986 when the decline 
was 142 million he said 
for example the march survey showed corn plantings this year 
may be around 669 million acres up by almost 2 percent from 1987 
but last years corn plantings at 657 million acres plummeted 14 
percent from 767 million acres in 1986 
the total wheat acreage planted for the 1988 harvest was 
estimated at 651 million acres down about 11 percent from last 
year the 1987 wheat crop was planted on 658 million acres a drop 
of more than 8 percent from 721 million acres in 1986 
higher prices lower acreage reduction requirements for cotton 
and rice programs reduced paid land diversion payments and 
possibly lower program participation rates are partially offsetting 
the continued entry of area into the longterm conservation reserve 
program allen said 
commodity prices received in march were up 10 percent overall 
from a year earlier including feed grains 22 percent cotton 21 
percent oilseeds mainly soybeans 19 percent and food grains 13 
percent 
however crop prices are not high by historical standards and 
corn is still below the national average price support loan 
rate he said over the same period the index of prices paid 
interest taxes and farm wage rates increased only 44 percent 
according to usda projections corn prices may average around 
175 per bushel in the 198788 marketing year up from 150 in 
198687 the 1988crop corn price support loan nationally is 177 
per bushel 
six sign ups for the longterm crp have been held since the 
program got under way in 1986 the most recent earlier this year 
when farmers offered bids to take 45 million acres of highly 
erodible crop land from production 
although no decision on how much land will be accepted from the 
45 million acres offered in the latest bids around 23 million 
acres were enrolled in the crp in earlier rounds 
the 1985 farm law set a goal of 40 million to 45 million acres 
of land in the crp by 1990 under the program farmers agree to 
keep the land out of crop production for 10 years and get financial 
help to plant protective grass or trees plus annual rental 
payments from the government 
allen said the latest signup did not attract heavy bidding 
by farmers who wanted to enroll their land which makes the 1990 
goal of the program more difficult 
but carol fesco of the american farmland trust a private 
nonprofit washingtonbased conservation organization said she did 
not think the slowdown in crp offerings means much as far as the 
goal is concerned 
we still think that that is very possible and that we wont 
have a problem of reaching the 45 millionacre goal she said 
tuesday were going to continue working towards that we havent 
lost faith in the crp to date and neither have any of the other 
conservation or environmental groups that im aware of

a report by the agriculture department says 
federal farm policy shouldnt be counted on as the keystone of 
economic development in the countryside 
instead the development of rural americas small towns and 
farms should rest on diversification and the energies of local 
people the report said tuesday 
roland r vautour undersecretary for small community and rural 
development said cooperative federal efforts now under way are 
helping rural communities regain economic stability 
vautour said rural communities suffered from inflation in the 
late 1970s global economic recession and farmland value losses in 
the early 1980s and from a rise in foreign agricultural production 
in the past rural economic development has been dependent on 
farm policy and income he said we now recognize that the 
future growth and stability of the rural economy is dependent on 
diversification at the local level both in farm production and in 
the other business segments of community and state economies 
the 19page report itself added the current federal 
initiative on rural development stresses the need for rural 
america to look within for development possibilities americas 
small and rural communities need to realize there are simply not 
enough branch plants of major manufacturers to go around rural 
america must draw upon its own strengths and use them to promote 
development 
field hearings are being planned so that vautour can listen to 
the needs and concerns of the local officials residents students 
teachers business people and senior citizens the report said 
the report outlined rural economic development programs 
available at usda and at other federal agencies

the progovernment citizen cited an unidentified spokesman for 
south africas department of foreign affairs as saying the plans 
were under consideration and no decision has yet been taken 
if south africa agrees to train mozambican troops to protect the 
cahora bassa project it would mark a significant improvement in 
relations between the two countries 
the cahora bassa project is capable of providing cheap

iraqi warplanes bombed an iranian oil 
refinery and petrochemical plant wednesday in an escalation of 
attacks on irans economic mainstay iran said three jets were shot 
down 
the iraqi raids were the first major attacks on iranian cities 
since april 21 when the persian gulf war foes began a tacit 
ceasefire in their war of the cities after a deadly sevenweek 
missile duel 
iraq attacked after baghdad accused the iranians of shelling the 
northeastern iraqi town of darbandikhan early wednesday in a 
premeditated attempt to spark off the war of the cities again 
irans war information headquarters denied the charge and said 
the iraqis were seeking to pave the way for more iraqi attacks on 
iranian residential areas 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia said a 
squadron of fighterbombers pounded the refinery in the 
southwestern city of shiraz setting it ablaze and leaving it 
shrouded in black smoke 
the refinery one of five in iran has a capacity of 48000 
barrels a day 
other warplanes hit a highly important petrochemical plant 
in the area the agency reported 
irans official islamic republic news agency also monitored in 
nicosia said several workers were killed in the iraqi raids 
irna said iranian antiaircraft fire downed two frenchbuilt 
mirage f1s in the second raid it said one pilot bailed out and 
was captured but there was no word on the fate of the other pilot 
tehran radio said a third iraqi jet was shot down but did not 
say where or give any other details 
irna said an industrial plant in the oilproducing gachsaran 
region 100 miles west of shiraz was also bombed the iraqi 
communique made no mention of a raid on gachsaran or of any losses 
of life or aircraft 
iraqs powerful air force has been pounding irans refineries 
and other oil installations for months seeking to throttle its 
economy and force it to the negotiating table to end the 
7yearold war 
oil industry sources have reported that the bombing has slashed 
irans refining capacity by around onethird in recent weeks 
forcing iran to import unprecedented amounts of refined products 
such as kerosene and jet fuel 
iran and iraq pounded each others capitals and major cities 
with more than 300 missiles between feb 29 and april 21 hundreds 
of civilians on both sides were killed

the national aeronautics and space 
administration has set aug 25 as its internal target date for the 
first postchallenger launch and administrator james c fletcher 
says the flight might not start until early september 
our expected plan is to fly in august fletcher told the 
american institute of aeronautics and astronautics on tuesday 
whether it slops over into early september i think is not 
important we will fly this summer 
nasa had announced an august launch without a specific date but 
internally the agency was working toward an aug 4 liftoff that 
was pushed further along to aug 13 by delays in assembling the 
booster rockets for the flight 
reporters pressed fletcher on the date after his speech to the 
aiaa and he said officials were looking at aug 25 and into 
early september 
we can expect to see americans back in space he told the 
industry meeting the space shuttles return to flight this year 
will signal the resurgence of the american space program and the 
beginning of a new era of discovery and commercial opportunity in 
space 
the united states has not had a manned flight since jan 28 
1986 when the challenger blew up during liftoff claiming the 
lives of its seven crew members because one of the boosters was at 
fault nasa had the rocket completely redesigned and changed the 
way it is put together 
the redesign took time and firstflight launch targets slipped 
from the summer of 1987 to february 1988 and then june 2 1988 
late last year a component of the booster broke apart during a 
firing test and the august timeframe was announced 
the complexities of the stacking putting the four 
fuelfilled segments of the booster together have been 
responsible for much of the latest delay 
fletcher told reporters that an official launch date probably 
wont be announced until after the next booster test scheduled for 
june 9 
richard truly nasas associate administrator for space flight 
told another group of aiaa members that planning still was for an 
august launch 
fletcher has insisted that the launch date would not be affected 
by the aug 1518 republican natational convention in new orleans 
leonard nicholson manager of shuttle operations at the johnson 
space center in houston said last week that if discoverys launch 
slips past aug 31 the third flight another discovery liftoff on 
jan 19 1989 would have to be put off indefinitely the same 
situation would apply if flight 27 scheduled for oct 27 is 
delayed past nov 17

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
april 28 
the sun westerly ri on presidential hopeful albert gores 
withdrawal 
an interesting aspect of sen albert gore jrs remarks on 
quitting the democratic presidential nomination race was his 
recital of a litany of former rivals 
saying they taught me a great deal he praised four of them 
by name and the two still running as well 
from gary hart he said he learned that ideas matter from 
joseph biden the importance of grace under pressure from 
richard gephardt that passion in the service of policy is 
powerful indeed from bruce babbitt the virtue of caring less 
about what people thought than about being true to his principles 
gov michael dukakis taught him that competence is charisma in 
the eyes of americans hungry for leadership and lastly gore said 
jesse jackson showed that we are a richer party and a better 
nation when we break down barriers and fight for justice 
it was a handsome way to bow out after a hard decision

st louis postdispatch on the sinking of an iranian gun boat by 
us planes with the personal approval of president reagan 
is there such as thing as too much civilian control of the 
military 
that is a question that needs to be asked in the wake of the 
navys recent engagement in the persian gulf 
on one level this is a remarkable display of the capabilities 
of the us militarys worldwide communication systems on another 
level it shows that civilian control of the military is clearcut 
and strong 
but on reflection this incident raises the disturbing specter 
that american lives could be lost in combat because the white house 
starts issuing tactical battle orders on the basis of a political 
judgment about an ongoing battle 
the president has the duty to set the national strategy and 
civilian control of the military is an absolute 
but no president has the wisdom and intelligence resources to 
start secondguessing lowlevel field commanders engaged in combat 
to do so is to court disaster

the st paul minn pioneer press dispatch on star wars 
neither president reagan nor the pentagon can dismiss out of 
hand the critical analysis of the star wars system done by the 
congressional office of technology assessment 
the ota a nonpartisan scientific group said in a report yet 
to be released formally that the strategic defense initiative 
would suffer a catastrophic failure the first time and the 
only time it would be needed 
in short soviet nuclear missiles would get through united 
states defenses 
the reason for the failure according to ota is that software 
necessary to give computers the detailed instructions needed to 
destroy thousands of missiles heading toward targets in the united 
states cannot be produced in the foreseeable future 
congress should take the report seriously and demand answers to 
the questions raised by ota 
and there seems good reason for a scaling back in the commitment 
to a star wars system there should be enough left in the sdi 
funding to ensure that basic research can be conducted but that it 
can be accomplished with far less than 4 billion a year

the burlington vt free press on the omnibus trade bill 
president reagan is right the trade bill ought not to become 
law 
congress too must not allow debate over the omnibus bill to 
delay ratification of the uscanada trade bill 
the accord is the result of hard bargaining on both sides over a 
period of 18 months 
it is the spirit of the pact with canada that should be captured 
in the omnibus trade bill cooperation through competition and a 
winwin situation for both countries

the tricity herald kennewick wash on attorney general meese 
edwin meese who has done for the us attorney generals office 
what spiro agnew did for the vice presidency cant tell a conflict 
of interest from a wheelbarrow 
his latest difficulty arises from his approval of a 50 million 
real estate deal between the justice department and a property 
owner the justice department had intended to leave the building 
owned in part by howard m bender 
meeses wife ursula got a 40000 a year job with the multiple 
sclerosis society and the money for her salary came from the 
taxexempt bender foundation howard m bender vice president 
immediately thereafter the lease was signed 
nothing wrong here meese says 
meese is finding it difficult to attract replacements to the 
justice department for resignations he has faced since the reports 
of the cascade of conflicts 
meanwhile the cause of it all hangs on to his post seemingly 
insensitive to the hurt he is doing the president and the justice 
department as he was to giving at least the appearance of mixing 
public service with private gain

nashville tenn banner on social securitys notch baby 
provision 
until recently it appeared that there was no middle ground on 
the notch baby provision of the social security law 
for years people born during the 19171921 notch have 
had it impressed on them that they were discriminated against by 
the law that changed the formula of benefits for people who were 
born after 1916 
a report by the general accounting office gao released in late 
march gives a much clearer picture of the whole issue 
michelle m murphy of congressional quarterly reported that 
although notch babies get smaller monthly benefits than people who 
were born just before them the gao found that in most cases they 
get more and never less than similar retirees who are younger 
 
several proposals are pending in congress aimed at correcting 
the notch problem through legislation but they have one thing 
in common they are tremendously expensive 
it is significant that neither sen claude pepper dfla 
longtime advocate for the elderly nor the american association of 
retired persons has pressed for the notch legislation 
we should heed the suggestion of aarp chairman kermit phelps 
that it is time to focus attention on more substantive issues 
facing older americans such as longterm care and reduction of the 
federal budget deficit

the record hackensack nj on joe clarks call for vigilante 
justice 
following a speech before the american newspaper publishers 
association in honolulu joe clark the principal of paterson 
njs eastside high school told an impromptu news conference that 
ghetto dwellers who feel besieged by crime should bypass the cops 
and the courts and take matters into their own hands 
specifically he advised i think a few lynchings are in 
order 
on some occasions the lynch mob will be right the kid theyll 
seize really will be a mugger a dealer or worse 
but sometime the mob will be wrong but will anyone care 
that some ghetto kid had been wronged 
clark is dangerous not only because he urges people to violence 
but because he teaches that the answer to crime is still more 
lawlessness and misdirected anger 
this man is a demagogue as his call for a few lynchings 
demonstrates

lubbock texas avalanchejournal on the war in the persian gulf 
the broadened role of the united states forces in the persian 
gulf signals a further change in policy in the volatile region 
which sends a message to those who thought washington was ready to 
back away from further confrontation with iran 
in announcing that the us navy would now come to the rescue of 
socalled neutral shipping under attack in the gulf the reagan 
administration has warned both foe and ally that american policy of 
maintaining freedom of the seas is not something which can be 
compromised 
our only regret and reservation about the us role is that more 
of our allies arent more actively involved 
although britain and france have moved to bolster their naval 
forces in the area the whole project should have been a 
wellcoordinated operation in which the free world acted in concert 
for the most part this government and that of british prime 
minister margaret thatcher have demonstrated the willingness to 
defend freedom wherever it may be threatened 
it is far better to stop that threat far from ones shores than 
have it eventually rear its head on ones doorstep

los angeles daily news on the noriega ouster effort 
the wonderboys from the state and justice departments had been 
acting if they were bullies on someone elses block they kept 
drawing imaginary lines and panamanian strongman manuel noriega 
kept crossing them 
but finally as the white house made it known it is willing to 
give noriega an exit that is both facesaving and assetretaining 
the outoftowners have shown theyve learned you dont go setting 
foreign policy by mouthing off empty threats 
first the justice department indicted noriega for drug 
trafficking that counterproductive move made it more difficult for 
noriega to retire to countries with which the united states has an 
extradition treaty 
when threats of imprisonment didnt work with the dictator the 
united states switched to using economic sactions as a means of 
driving noriega out all that did was incur the wrath of the 
panamanian people 
wouldnt it make more sense to negotiate noriega out of the drug 
trade than hunt him down in the sort of bloody vigilantism that so 
resembles american adventurism of an earlier era

indiana basketball coach bob knight may be able to come up with 
great game strategies but his effort at making analogies leaves us 
wondering if the locker room smell of sweatsocks is beginning to 
take its toll 
on an nbc television special dealing with stress 
correspondent connie chung asked knight how he handled stress i 
think if rape is inevitable relax and enjoy it he said 
handle it maybe but enjoy it 
we had hoped the ageold idea of putting rape and enjoyable in 
the same sentence was beginning to disappear but obviously thats 
not the case 
whats especially disappointing is to hear such comparisons made 
by knight given his position as an educator and coach 
crimes of violence against women such as rape are constantly 
on the rise the last thing we need now is some offthecuff 
basketball coach telling the nations television viewers just to 
relax and enjoy it

the journal times racine wis on dialaporn 
it appears the infamous 900prefix telephone information 
services arent the problem state authorities claim they are 
according to wisconsin bell less than 1 percent of its 
southeastern wisconsin customers have taken advantage of the free 
blocking service 
the service would limit access to 900prefix telephone numbers 
which offer various services primarily information for a fee 
complaints have been registered with utilities and government 
officials about abuse of two of those services 
specifically targeted are the socalled dialaporn services 
offering pornographic telephone conversations and the teen 
partyline services which put teenagers throughout the country 
in touch with each other 
wisconsin bell got permission to offer a free service which 
would block access to those services in an effort to answer 
complaints 
wisconsin bell officials report however that of 716500 
customers only 2908 have asked for the blocking service 
one factor may be that the service not only blocks access to 
dialaporn and teen party lines but to all other 900prefix 
services as well 
but we suspect the real explanation is that relatively few 
wisconsin bell customers use 900prefix services at all and of 
that number fewer still have problems with it

a woman who was a passenger on an aloha 
airlines jet shortly before a section of its fuselage tore away 
over hawaii said she saw the wall of the plane undulate during 
takeoff 
as the plane was going up into the air i was resting my arm on 
the armrest and my arm started to slip towards the wall so i took 
it away and i saw that the wall was moving in and out like swaying 
in and out julie kovach said tuesday 
mrs kovach and her husband richard had been honeymooning in 
hawaii and flew from the island of kauai to honolulu on thursday 
she said she didnt realize the significance until after she 
heard that part of the jets fuselage had blown away on a later 
flight thursday a flight attendant was killed and 61 of 89 
passengers were injured 
at the time my wife julie was sitting near the window i was 
sitting in the seat next to her and i had my head back and my eyes 
closed relaxing so i didnt even notice this was happening 
richard kovach said in an interview with television station wfsbtv 
the couple said they learned about the accident after they 
returned to connecticut on friday but didnt realize they had been 
on the same plane until they saw a picture and recognized the name 
queen liliuokalani on the airliners nose 
they said they had been sitting four rows up from the wing in a 
section that later ripped away mrs kovach said she called aloha 
airlines and the federal aviation administration in washington to 
tell them of her observation 
federal safety officials have ordered the oldest models of 
boeing 737 jetliners with more than 55000 landings like the aloha 
airplane not to fly higher than 23000 feet while the accident is 
under investigation 
above 24000 feet the difference between higher cabin pressure 
and lower atmospheric pressure could be sufficient to cause a 
hazard in aircraft where there could be a structural weakness faa 
officials have said

state prison administrators can cut an 
inmates hair even if he objects for religious reasons because 
prison security outweighs an inmates individual rights a federal 
appeals court says 
a threejudge panel of the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
unanimously rejected the argument of inmate mark lee pollock from 
lucas county that prison officials violated his constitutional 
right to exercise his religion when they cut his long hair 
gail finkbeiner lawyer for pollock said tuesday she had not 
seen the ruling and declined to comment or to say whether pollock 
will appeal 
pollocks suit argued that his rights were violated because he 
adheres to the religion of the lakota american indians who believe 
that hair is sacred and should not be cut 
pollock 31 is serving a 17 to 45year sentence for 
convictions of burglary escape and badcheck offenses he has been 
an inmate since october 1981 at the states maximumsecurity 
southern ohio correctional facility in lucasville his legal battle 
with officials over haircuts has been ongoing since he got into the 
prison system 
prison officials said they have the right to cut prisoners hair 
for a variety of security and identification reasons they said 
prisoners could hide contraband including keys and pills in long 
hair could cut it off after escaping to more easily avoid 
detection and could provoke homosexual attacks from other inmates 
attracted by the appearance of long hair 
prison officials also said long hair could hinder prison 
employees in identifying inmates which could hamper roll calls 
mail calls issuing visitor passes and finding prisoners who break 
rules longer hair could also clog prison sink and shower drains 
and be more conducive to carrying lice and creating other 
sanitation problems state officials contended 
us district judge carl rubin ruled in favor of the state and 
pollock appealed the appeals court panel upheld rubins decision 
on monday 
raymond studer an assistant ohio attorney general representing 
the state said the appeals courts ruling indicated that the 
courts are starting to defer to concerns of prison administrators 
faced with complex security problems in crowded penitentiaries

the federal aviation administration today 
widened its inspections of boeing 737 jetliners for possible 
cracking and corrosion in response to an accident last week in 
which a large section of one of the jets tore free during flight 
the faa directive requires operators of older boeing 737s 
those with more than 30000 flights to be visually inspected and 
to undergo sophisticated electronic inspections if cracks are found 
faa administrator allan mcartor said the agencys action stems 
from a belief that an abundance of caution is needed in light 
of the recent accident involving aloha airlines 
last thursday a 20foot section of an aloha airlines boeing 737 
stretching from just behind the cockpit to near the wing tore loose 
as the jet was cruising at 24000 feet one flight attendant was 
swept from the plane and to her death and 61 people were injured 
although the plane landed safely 
the new inspection order covers 291 older boeing 737s the 
first ones made in the late 1960s and early 1970s in which a 
cold bonding process was used to splice together sections of 
the planes outer metal skin 
mcartor said he could not immediately say how many planes 
covered by the order were in operation in the united states 
last week the faa ordered many of the older boeing 737s to fly 
no higher than 23000 feet and said that those with 55000 landings 
should be visually inspected for corrosion or cracking 
the order today expands the visual inspections to planes with at 
least 30000 landings and requires those with 50000 landings to 
undergo socalled eddy current inspections using highfrequency 
electronic devices 
mcartor said that despite the increased focus on the older 
boeing 737s the aircraft are just as safe as newer models and if 
they were not they wouldnt be allowed to fly 
he said while the cause of the aloha accident has yet to be 
determined it is time for an abundance of caution and it is out 
of an abundance of caution that we take todays action 
mcartor said that he does not think the inspection requirements 
will disrupt air travel under the emergency faa directive visual 
inspections must be conducted within 250 landings 
the airlines must report to the faa within 48 hours on the 
result of the inspections 
the boeing 737 is widely used for shorthaul flights and more 
than 1100 of the 737200 series such as the one involved in the 
aloha accident have been built 
mcartor could not say which airlines fly the older 737s but said 
the planes are scattered across the industry

tass poked somewhat ponderous fun wednesday at 
president reagans reported faith in astrology wondering in a 
dispatch what the stars are telling the leader of the west 
it is difficult to say what the may night sky studded with 
stars predicted to the president but it hardly predicted that he 
would have to speak about the role of astrology in the politics of 
the usa the official news agency said 
recent reports in the united states that reagan and his wife 
nancy consult astrologers inspired taunts from congress and 
criticism from scientists 
some reports said donald t regan former white house chief of 
staff plans to say in a book that mrs reagan turned to 
astrologers in shaping the presidents schedule 
on tuesday reagan denied having been swayed by the stars in 
making policy decisions but tass characterized his comments as 
evasive 
when he appeared on tuesday in one of the halls of the white 
house reporters practically showered him with questions the 
agency said they wondered to what extent astrologers and 
fortunetellers influenced him when he had to make political 
decisions 
he was quick to answer but he tried to escape from direct 
answers to further questions all this has not clarified the 
questions raised and now more americans are asking themselves may 
it be true that the president determines the countrys political 
course with the help of the stars

federal regulatory agencies soon should be 
able to ease up on reviews of applications to fieldtest 
genetically engineered organisms because the tests pose little 
risk a research arm of congress said wednesday 
the agencies are piling up experience so rapidly that it 
should be possible now or become possible in the near future to 
sort planned introductions into broad categories for which low 
medium or high levels of review are appropriate the office of 
technology assessment said in a report 
so far there have been about two dozen field tests of one kind 
or another in 12 states and four foreign countries the study said 
with adequate review none of the smallscale field tests 
proposed or probable within the next several years is likely to 
result in an environmental problem that would be widespread or 
difficult to control it said 
in agriculture a new crop strain or rotation probably could 
ease or control damage if any from experiments gone awry the 
report said 
a worstcase outcome the authors wrote would appear to be to 
disrupt a fundamental ecosystem process for example the cycling 
of a mineral or a nutrient or the flow of energy in an ecosystem 
such disruptions are not however among the credible consequences 
of any introduction that seems likely within the next several 
years 
such disruptions could be difficult to control and 
farreaching in their effects and are conceivable as the result 
of releasing a new microbe with enhanced ability to degrade toxic 
waste or cellulose the report said 
many species perform the same functions in an ecosystem and 
this redundancy coupled with the resilience of ecosystems are 
persuasive arguments against the likelihood of such consequences 
crop plants and domestic livestock appear to pose the least risk 
from genetic engineering techniques the report said in suggesting 
points regulators might consider in deciding where to loosen 
scrutiny 
examples of such criteria include whether the new organism is 
changed in its structural or regulatory genes regulatory genes 
deserve more attention the report said because they govern how 
much product a cell makes through its structural genes and this 
could enhance survivability or vulnerability in the environment 
another example might be the deletion of genes which the report 
said probably dont need as much review as the insertion of genes 
deletions are far more common in nature than insertions 
although the characteristics of engineered organisms make 
certain kinds less likely than others to cause problems it is not 
now possible to describe any broad categories thay could be 
completely exempted from review the report cautioned 
counterexamples can be provided from existing experience to 
negate almost any proposed category for exemption from review 
the new recombinant techniques of genetic engineering that 
make possible the insertion of a gene from one species into the 
dna the genetic material of another have prompted research aimed 
at making among other things 
plants that can resist pests pesticides or diseases use 
fertilizers better or perhaps do without them 
bacteria that can confer frost resistance on plants 
new animal vaccines 
animals with greater meat or milk production 
microbes that can digest toxic waste better than existing 
strains or even concentrate metallic ores 
it is important to note that modifying organisms for specific 
human ends is not new the technology assessment office said 
selective breeders of plants and animals have been 
transferring genes for millenia often creating forms through 
centuries of selection that differ from their original stocks more 
than the forms produced by recombinant dna methods

a prominent utah lawyer said to be attorney 
general edwin meeses latest choice to become his chief deputy is 
undergoing a background check the white house confirmed today 
spokesman marlin fitzwater briefing reporters on air force one 
as president reagan flew to chicago to deliver a speech would not 
say if the attorney harold g christensen of salt lake city is 
the only candidate for the job 
we are reviewing a number of candidates doing background 
checks but cant confirm anyone as being the only candidate for 
a specific job fitzwater said noting there are several 
candidates for positions at justice 
fitzwater was questioned about a report in the washington post 
that christensen 62 was the third person picked to fill the 
vacancy 
the post quoting unidentified administration sources said 
meese sent the christensen recommendation to the white house on 
monday but was waiting until the background check is completed 
before making an announcement 
christensen could not be reached for comment but republican 
sen orrin hatch of utah said in salt lake city that he had 
proposed christensens name to meese 
it still has to go through a process i think he has an 
excellent chance of getting it hatch said i know ed meese is 
very high on him 
the job became vacant after the protest resignation march 29 of 
arnold burns 
burns and assistant attorney general william f weld resigned in 
the wake of continuing investigations of meese by independent 
counsel james c mckay the officials said the investigations 
hampered the attorney generals ability to lead the department 
meeses efforts to fill the vacancies have been stymied his 
first choice former federal judge arlin adams rejected the offer 
saying he had too big a legal case load st louis lawyer john c 
shepherd withdrew his name from consideration 15 days after his 
selection was announced in the wake of publicity surrounding a 
controversial case involving his law firm and his membership in 
clubs that excluded women or blacks 
christensen is a senior partner in the salt lake city law firm 
of snow christensen amp martineau sources told the post he has 
strong backing from utahs republican sen orrin hatch hatchs 
administrative assistant dee benson had been a partner in the 
firm 
christensen was president of the utah state bar in 197576 but 
has never held a government job and told the post he was not 
heavily involved in politics 
my life has been pretty much devoted to the profession he 
said adding that he has always been interested in civic things 
but had never run for office 
christensen is a widower and the father of three grown children 
who has spent much of his life in utah he was born there attended 
the state university and went to the university of michigan law 
school 
asked whether he belonged to any private clubs christensen 
said i do not belong to any clubs that exclude people

anal intercourse with or without a condom is risky the rectum 
is easily injured during anal intercourse 
remember aids is sexually transmitted and the aids virus is 
not the only infection that is passed through intimate sexual 
contact 
other sexual transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea syphilis

you wont get aids from a mosquito bite the aids virus is not 
transmitted through a mosquitos salivary glands like other 
diseases such as malaria or yellow fever you wont get it from bed 
bugs lice flies or other insects either 
you wont get aids from saliva sweat tears urine or a bowel 
movement 
you wont get aids from a kiss 
you wont get aids from clothes a telephone or from a toilet 
seat it cant be passed by using a glass or eating utensils that 
someone else has used you wont get the virus by being on a bus

you are at risk of being infected with the aids virus if you 
have sex with someone who is infected or if you share drug needles 
and syringes with someone who is infected 
since you cant be sure who is infected your chances of coming 
into contact with the virus increase with the number of sex 
partners you have any exchange of infected blood semen or vaginal 
fluids can spread the virus and place you at great risk 
the following behaviors are risky when performed with an

dating and getting to know other people is a normal part of 
life dating doesnt mean the same thing as having sex sexual 
intercourse as a part of dating can be risky one of the risks is 
aids 
how can you tell if someone youre dating or would like to date 
has been exposed to the aids virus the bad news is you cant but 
the good news is as long as sexual activity and sharing drug 
needles are avoided it doesnt matter 
you are going to have to be careful about the person you become 
sexually involved with making your own decision based on your own 
best judgment that can be difficult 
has this person had any sexually transmitted diseases how many 
people have they been to bed with have they experimented with 
drugs all these are sensitive but important questions but you 
have a personal responsibility to ask 
think of it this way if you know someone well enough to have 
sex then you should be able to talk about aids if someone is 
unwilling to talk you shouldnt have sex

married people who are uninfected faithful and dont shoot 
drugs are not at risk but if they engage in risky behavior they 
can become infected with the aids virus and infect their partners

thousands of illegal aliens hoping to take advantage of their 
last chance for us citizenship camped outside immigration offices 
around the country early today as the yearlong amnesty program 
approached its midnight deadline 
all 107 offices of the us immigration and naturalization 
service will remain open until midnight to handle applicatons from 
those seeking legal residency status 
i expect to be here forever for the rest of my life said a 
weary stanley davis chief legalization officer for the ins office 
in tucson ariz 
in houston vendors sold tacos and sandwiches to those in line 
tuesday in albuquerque nm immigration officials hired a 
mexican band to entertain the 400 people queued up 
i think we burned out two photocopiers in the past two days 
said patrice parilli director of the legalization program at 
catholic charities in san francisco where more than 25000 aliens 
from 200 countries have applied for amnesty in the past year 
as of monday 137 million amnesty applications had been filed 
nationwide and 470000 people were seeking legal status under a 
separate program for seasonal agricultural workers the ins said 
the deadline for that program is nov 30 
applicants who file by the deadline also may request up to 60 
days for submitting other documents necessary to prove they have 
lived in the united states continuously since before jan 1 1982 
in new york state the midnight deadline was extended for some 
aliens until at least may 16 because of initial confusion about the 
programs application to parents of usborn children on welfare 
they were first ruled ineligible then eligible for amnesty 
todays order by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals applies 
only in new york state and ins spokesman greg leo said it would 
affect only a few hundred families he urged all eligible aliens 
not to wait but to apply by midnight anyway 
in santa ana calif 2000 people applied for amnesty on monday 
and nearly as many applied on tuesday said legalization officer 
george newland 
i think many of these people deep down inside thought there 
would be an extension so they waited until the last minute 
newland said 
by monday 133 million people had applied for some form of 
amnesty in the ins western region said joyce leonard the regions 
acting assistant director of immigration reform the region is 
comprised of california arizona nevada hawaii and guam 
thousands of amnesty applications piled up in the los angeles 
office the regions busiest as people camped outside 
more than 13000 illegal aliens have applied for amnesty in 
oklahoma said aj irwin the ins chief legalization officer in 
oklahoma city about 1000 people have applied in the last week 
and about 50 were waiting outside the doors when the office opened 
tuesday 
we just cant handle it irwin said we were doing an 
average of 20 people a day and now were doing about 200 a day 
i asked them the aliens why did you wait why did you 
wait and a lot are saying they were afraid to come in he said 
now after a year theyre seeing that its not a trick 
jose luis navarro 40 was among the skeptics 
i thought i would go to the immigration office to apply and 
they would be there waiting to catch us navarro said 
i didnt have sufficient papers and i wasnt certain about 
the program like i am now said carlos ortiz 37 who came to the 
united states from chihuahua mexico and i didnt have the 
money 
in hialeah fla marcos castellon 40 said he had been afraid 
to apply 
i was afraid they would deport me castellon said but now 
everyone believes in the law and they accept it in good faith 
in phoenix ariz chief legalization officer eugene botts said 
he found a blocklong line upon opening tuesday and 900 people 
were processed during the day 
we had another rough one today botts said with waits of 
about four hours for applicants which before this week was 
unheard of 
in houston the legalization office stayed open during the final 
24 hours of the application period on tuesday 5000 people tried 
to apply said richard s rios the centers director 
ins officials rented three portable toilets to accommodate 
people camping outside the legalization center and vendors sold 
refreshments 
some of the applicants are freeenterprising selling tacos 
cokes salad sandwiches rios said joking that the ins approves 
of the entrepreneurs as long as they are reporting that income 
in florida officials expected the total number of amnesty 
applications to reach 125000 by tonight said ins regional 
director perry rivkind 
i think there may be a lastminute push he said but 
well take everyone even if we have to wake em up in line 
about 23000 people have applied for amnesty in new jersey with 
25 percent coming in the last month said james m gray director 
of the immigration office in camden 
its been a very successful program but i am disappointed in 
this particular area that there are an awful lot of aliens who have 
not taken advantage of this onceinalifetime chance gray said 
there are no more chances gray said an awful lot of

chinas bestknown dissident took issue with the 
governments modernization plans during a meeting wednesday with 
university students and said economic reform without democracy is 
impossible 
the concept of modernization is independent of nation or local 
people fang lizhi told the students at beijing university 
this is a common concept all over the world you should not be 
able to say chinese modernization the aim the target at least 
is the same everywhere 
chinese leaders use the slogan modernization with chinese 
characteristics to describe chinas policy of economic reform 
under party direction 
fang 52 an internationally respected astrophysicist is an 
outspoken critic of the government and was kicked out of the 
communist party last year he was accused of inciting prodemocracy 
student demonstrations in december 1986 and january 1987 
his meeting with several hundred students during an observance 
of the universitys 90th anniversary was believed to be the first 
time since his dismissal that fang was allowed to speak about 
politics in public 
we need more democracy in china fang said after the meeting 
developing a modern economy without democracy is impossible he 
said offering albania as an example of a nation where there is 
no democracy and also no economy 
he said students hadnt abandoned their hopes for democracy 
the students still are concerned about the situation of 
democracy in china now he said after the student movement of 
course they kept quiet but in their minds they want quicker 
steps toward democracy 
of the students thinking he said no change still no 
change he said of his own i never change my opinion on 
chinas politics or economy 
after the student protests fang was removed as vice president 
of the science and technology university in hefei anhui province 
and was transferred to the beijing observatory where he continues 
research and writing 
the official press has featured him in several articles recently 
in an attempt to show government leniency in allowing fang to 
continue his academic pursuits he was allowed to attend a 
conference in italy last june 
on monday the beijing review published a lengthy feature saying 
the past year during which fang published five books was his most 
productive 
fang said wednesday he would admit to error in his thinking only 
if the government could prove him wrong 
his repeated requests to visit the united states have been 
refused fang said he has received invitations from several 
american universities including harvard 
he brushed aside questions about possible trouble for speaking 
with the students im not concerned many times i speak like 
this he said 
asked whether he had trouble after an interview with the new 
york times in february fang said not too much 
in the animated 90minute discussion students voiced views 
ranging from support of chinas attempts at democracy to harsh 
criticism 
some said later that the meeting was spontaneous not organized 
by the student government or other official groups fang said he 
had been invited to a smallgroup discussion by physics department 
students

a federal appeals court today extended the 
midnight deadline for the governments illegal alien amnesty 
program in new york state giving many aliens with usborn 
children on welfare another two weeks to register 
the state has been seeking a 60day extension and the courts 
order will apply until another hearing the week of may 16 said 
chris braithwaite a spokesman for the state attorney generals 
office 
the amnesty program allows illegal aliens who have lived in the 
united states since jan 1 1982 to apply for legal status and 
us citizenship 
the deadline runs out at midnight tonight but new york state 
asked for the extension because there was initial confusion about 
the programs application to parents of usborn children on 
welfare 
the order by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals applies only 
to the illegal alien program in new york state it was not 
immediately determined whether it would apply to all aliens or only 
those with usborn children 
the immigration and naturalization service urged those eligible 
for legalization to apply by midnight tonight as it is not clear 
what the impact of this order may be 
the court told lawyers for the state and the ins to work out 
specifics of the order including which illegal aliens would be 
affected braithwaite said 
if the sides could not agree on an order this afternoon the 
court said it would issue its own order he said 
greg leo an ins spokesman in washington said he understood 
that any order will only apply to a limited class of people 
who may be ineligible for amnesty because their children have 
received afdc benefits 
the action may only affect several hundred people in new york 
leo said 
the issue arose because aliens who are likely to need public 
assistance such as welfare are among those who cannot be accepted 
in the amnesty program 
the state asked whether poor illegal aliens with usborn 
children who receive welfare in the aid to families with dependent 
children program can qualify for amnesty technically the children 
are the welfare recipients because they are us citizens 
braithwaite said there are a lot of such families but he 
had no count 
the ins initially said the parents of such children would not be 
eligible then said they would be eligible braithwaite said 
because of the confusion the state sued the ins for a 60day 
extension of the deadline and a 100000 advertising campaign 
explaining the policy 
leo cautioned that illegal aliens not involved in the litigation 
should apply by tonights midnight deadline 
ins strongly urges anyone eligible for amnesty to apply by 
midnight tonight as this is the deadline for virtually all 
potential applicants he said it would be tragic for people 
who are eligible for this program not to come forward by midnight 
on the basis of misinformation

not so very long ago condoms rubbers or prophylactics were 
things we didnt talk about very much 
now theyre discussed on the evening news and on the front page 
of your newspaper and displayed out in the open in your local drug 
store grocery and convenience store 
for those who are sexually active and not limiting their sexual 
activity to one partner condoms have been shown to help prevent 
the spread of sexually transmitted diseases that is why the use of 
condoms is recommended to help reduce the spread of aids 
condoms are the best preventive measure against aids besides not 
having sex and practicing safe behavior 
but condoms are far from being foolproof you have to use them 
properly and you have to use them every time you have sex from 
start to finish if you use a condom you should remember these 
guidelines 
1 use condoms made of latex rubber latex serves as a barrier 
to the virus lambskin or natural membrane condoms are not 
as good because of the pores in the material look for the word 
latex on the package 
2 a condom with a spermicide may provide additional 
protection spermicides have been shown in laboratory tests to kill 
the virus use the spermicide in the tip and outside the condom 
3 condom use is safer with a lubricant check the list of 
ingredients on the back of the lubricant package to make sure the 
lubricant is waterbased do not use petroleumbased jelly cold 
cream baby oil or cooking shortening these can weaken the condom 
and cause it to break

it is very important that everyone understands that a person can 
be infected with the aids virus without showing any symptoms at all 
it is possible to be infected for years feel fine look fine 
and have no way of knowing you are infected unless you have a test 
for the aids virus 
during this period however people infected with the aids virus 
can pass the virus to sexual partners to people with whom drug 
needles are shared and to children before or during birth that is 
one of the most disturbing things about aids 
once symptoms do appear they are similar to the symptoms of 
some other diseases as the disease progresses they become more 
serious that is because the aids virus keeps your bodys natural 
defenses from operating correctly 
if you are concerned whether you might be infected consider 
your own behavior and its effects on others if you feel you need 
to be tested for the aids virus talk to a doctor or an aids 
counselor for more information see below 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
you have probably heard about the aids test the test 
doesnt actually tell you if you have aids it shows if you have 
been infected with the virus it looks for changes in blood that 
occur after you have been infected 
the public health service recommends you be confidentially 
counseled and tested if you have had any sexually transmitted 
disease or shared needles if you are a man who has had sex with 
another man or if you have had sex with a prostitute male or 
female you should be tested if you have had sex with anyone who 
has done any of these things 
if you are a woman who has been engaging in risky behavior and 
you plan to have a baby or are not using birth control you should 
be tested 
your doctor may advise you to be counseled and tested if you are 
a hemophiliac or have received a blood transfusion between 1978 
and 1985 
if you test positive and find you have been infected with the 
aids virus you must take steps to protect your partner 
people who have always practiced safe behavior do not need to be 
tested 
theres been a great deal in the press about problems with the 
test it is very reliable if it is done by a good laboratory and 
the results are checked by a physician or counselor 
if you have engaged in risky behavior speak frankly to a doctor 
who understands the aids problem or to an aids counselor 
for more nformation call your local public health agency 
theyre listed in the government section of your phone book or 
call your local aids hotline if you cant find the number call

israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin in an 
interview published wednesday called for an arabisraeli peace 
settlement entailing a jointly run jordanianpalestinian state in 
60 percent of the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
he said his labor party which shares power with the rightwing 
likud bloc in a coalition insisted that jerusalem must be united 
under israeli sovereignty and remain its capital 
the jordanianpalestinian state had to be under one 
sovereignty one government one flag and one capital amman 
rabin told janes defense weekly he didnt say whether the 
sovereignty should be jordanian or palestinian 
amman is the capital of jordan 
rabin ruled out israeli withdrawal to its pre1967 mideast war 
borders saying changes must be made to be included under 
israels sovereignty 
also he said israel insisted on a defense line along the 
jordan valley which would effectively leave the rest of the west 
bank sandwiched between the israeli army and the territory of 
pre1967 israel 
rabin said this meant 60 percent of the west bank and gaza would 
be part of the jordanianpalestinian state 
to maintain israel as a jewish state and a democracy means 
not allowing a situation to develop where a considerable part of 
its citizens will be nonjewish he said 
we cannot have 3540 percent of the population palestinians 
who entertain civil rights on the other hand we cannot have a 
state in which there are no equal rights to every citizen rabin 
said 
in combating the 5monthold wave of palestinian unrest in the 
west bank and gaza he said the political guideline is not to 
allow violence to gain the upper hand it will achieve 
nothing 
he declined to deny or confirm reports that israel and china 
have jointly developed missiles saying israeli policy was to 
withhold comment on arms deals 
i will not give you a clearcut answer but by saying so i am 
not confirming anything about the relations between israel and the 
peoples republic of china rabin said 
he expressed concern about the appearance of groundtoground 
missiles and chemical weapons in the mideast arena 
rabin warned of a very very severe response if the arabs 
used chemical weapons against israel

was governor of california 
the white house confirmed tuesday that nancy reagan follows 
astrology and consults it for some of the presidents activities 
but the president said no policy or decision hes made has been 
influenced by the stars 
i refer to it as the worlds worstkept secret that president 
reagan relies on astrology theres nothing new about it said 
astrologer sydney omarr of santa monica whose syndicated daily 
horoscope is distributed to more than 300 newspapers including the 
washington post 
omarr said he has never consulted with reagan but received 
congratulations via a phone call from former white house spokesman 
larry speakes when omarr noted his 25 years with the los angeles 
times syndicate 
franklin roosevelt relied on astrology theodore roosevelt 
did george washingtons diary said he kept track of the position 
of the stars omarr said 
the confirmation of the reagans interest followed reports that 
donald t regan the former white house chief of staff plans to 
reveal in a book that mrs reagan turned to astrologers in shaping 
the presidents schedule 
its an input that they receive i dont like to use the word 
rely said joyce jillson an astrologer from the san fernando 
valley whose daily horoscope is distributed to more than 100 
newspapers nationwide by tribune media services 
interviewed on cbs this morning show today ms jillson 
said she was not surprised at the sudden controversy over the 
reagans interest in astrology 
this has been sort of in the offing for the last two weeks 
i have been hearing rumblings about this through various 
channels she said 
i think they handled it beautifully and frankly i think 
donald regan who is a sagitarrius tried to use this to get much 
more attention than it really got 
the question of reagan and astrology surfaced more than 20 years 
ago when he chose to be sworn in as governor for his first term 
shortly after midnight on jan 5 1967 
outgoing gov pat brown said reagan picked the time because he 
relied on astrology reagans aides denied that and said the 
unusual time was picked because of constitutional questions 
regarding transfer of power 
ms jillson said the reagans regularly consulted astrologers 
throughout the reagan presidency and gubernatorial tenure in 
california 
lyn nofziger a former white house political aide and longtime 
associate of the reagans dismissed the sudden interest in mrs 
reagans stargazing 
i have never once heard her allude to astrology or to the 
stars or to the moon or to the sign of the ram he said 
he said the president liked to read his horoscope and laughed 
about it and kidded about it but i have never seen him take the 
stuff seriously 
ms jillson said she was at the white house after reagans 
assassination attempt in march 1981 and helped the gop choose 
george bush as vice president 
there was talk that i did charts for all eight vice 
presidential candidates i dont deny that i determined the only 
winnable choice was george bush 
asked if she advised the reagans ms jillson said i never 
discuss my clients 
she said reagan has used astrology to pick his inauguration and 
other big events look at when he holds his news conferences 
theyre usually during a full moon he chooses those times to do 
it 
however white house deputy press secretary bj cooper said the 
reagans did not know ms jillson white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater traveling with reagn on air force one to chicago said 
today that miss jillson was crazy for trying to fabricate a white 
house relationship that doesnt exist 
mrs reagans interest in the stars was renewed after her 
husband survived the assassination attempt fitzwater said ms 
jillson said reagans charts indicated danger for that time and he 
should have been more cautious 
she added astrology was used in planning last decembers summit 
between the president and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev but 
things didnt go smoothly with mrs reagan and raisa gorbachev 
because the soviet leaders wifes birthdate is not known in the 
west 
the problem with nancy and raisa would never have happened if 
we had her birthdate she said 
the washington post said one of the astrologers that mrs reagan 
consulted was carroll righter of los angeles who was mentioned in 
reagans 1965 autobiography wheres the rest of me righter 
died saturday at age 88

the sandinista government said today 
it ordered a privately owned radio station off the air for a day 
and temporarily barred two others from broadcasting news programs 
because of their reports on a workers hunger strike 
an official of the interior ministry who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the ministry on tuesday night ordered radio 
corporacion to immediately suspend service for 24 hours the 
ministry had earlier said the suspension would last eight days 
the official said radio catolica which is operated by the roman 
catholic church and radio mundial were prohibited from 
broadcasting their regular news programs for eight days they can 
appeal the order 
barricada the newspaper of the ruling sandinista national 
liberation front said the radio stations were accused of 
spreading false information about a workers hunger strike and 
with violating laws preserving public order 
radio catolica was shut down in january 1986 after it failed to 
broadcast president daniel ortegas endoftheyear message it was 
allowed to resume operations last fall under provisions of a 
regional peace plan signed in august by ortega and the presidents 
of four other central american countries 
more than 30 construction workers and car mechanics are in the 
ninth day of their hunger strike to demand higher pay 
jose castillo osejo director of radio corporacion reportedly 
was punched in the mouth by interior minister tomas borge last week 
because the station broadcast what borge said was incorrect 
information about the fast barricada reported the altercation 
police have taken at least 40 people into custody during the 
past week in connection with the hunger strike the fasting workers 
are staying at the headquarters of the general workers federation 
a coalition of socialist antigovernment unions 
about 1500 construction workers and auto mechanics walked off 
the job in late february demanding higher pay and better working 
conditions 
the wildcat strikes are an embarrassment to the leftist 
government such strikes were illegal for almost six years under a 
state of emergency that was lifted in january again as part of the 
regional peace plan 
rebels known as contras have been fighting the sandinista 
government since november 1981 the regional peace plan is aimed at 
ending the contra insurgency and at halting rebellions in guatemala 
and el salvador

the scaling back of some favorite deductions 
under the new tax law reduced the number of itemizing taxpayers by 
15 percent this year the internal revenue service said wednesday 
and despite the major changes and a confusing w4 withholding 
form the number of taxpayers receiving refunds this year is up 
slightly over 1987 the tax agency reported 
about 31 million 51 percent of the 609 million long tax 
forms received through april 22 itemized deductions said irs 
spokeswoman johnell hunter at the same time last year 364 
million 60 percent of 603 million long forms included itemized 
deductions 
the drop comes as no surprise reducing the number of itemizers 
was a major goal of the 1986 tax overhaul in fact the reduction 
was the largest element of simplification in the big package 
in addition to cutting tax rates and boosting the personal 
exemption the new law which was reflected for the first time on 
returns filed this year eliminated the deduction for state and 
local sales taxes and limited writeoffs for consumer interest 
medical expenses and such miscellaneous expenses as union dues 
the combination of a higher standard deduction and a smaller 
total of itemized deductions made it beneficial for those 54 
million taxpayers to stop itemizing by the time the irs counts all 
the returns filed this year the number switching to the standard 
deduction will be even higher 
the number of taxpayers receiving refunds is up 03 percent to 
555 million that means about 795 percent of filers are getting 
refunds 
apparently withholding was more in line with tax liability 
than we had been expecting mrs hunter said 
other statistics released by the irs on wednesday also indicate 
that taxpayers may not have had as much trouble understanding the 
new law and revised tax forms as some experts had predicted 
for example 
fewer taxpayers asked the irs to fill out their returns about 
625000 this year compared with 770000 last year 
although the number who hired professionals to prepare their 
returns rose to 445 million 47 percent from 427 million 45 
percent the increase was less than forecast 
through april 29 the irs had received 476 million requests 
for fourmonth extensions of the april 15 filing deadline although 
this was more than the 437 million at the same time last year 
again the growth was less than anticipated 
for reasons that the irs cannot explain changes in the number 
of taxpayers seeking extensions varied sharply from region to 
region 
for example the philadelphia service center which processes 
returns from pennsylvania maryland delaware and the district of 
columbia reported requests for extensions were almost 29 percent 
below last year cincinnati which serves kentucky michigan west 
virginia and ohio showed a 47 percent drop in extensions 
through friday the irs had received 986 million returns a 2 
percent increase over the 967 million filed in the same period in 
1987 before the year is out the agency anticipates 1076 million 
total filings compared with 104 million last year 
some other statistics from this years filing season

the number of taxpayers claiming deductions for individual 
retirement accounts dropped dramatically last year when all wage 
earners were eligible to make deductible contributions to an ira 
146 million did so this year with deductible iras denied 
middleand upperincome workers covered by company pensions 57 
million deducted their full contribution and 1 million claimed a 
partial deduction 
the average refund this year is 850 up less than 2 from last 
year 
through april 29 the irs had processed 699 million returns 
down 02 percent from 70 million in 1987 
118 million returns were prepared on home computers before 
being mailed some 600000 others were prepared by professionals 
and filed via computer 
despite a lingering rumor that doing so makes it easier to be 
fingered for an audit the number of taxpayers who used the 
official peeloff stickon label rose this year about 526 
million peeled off and stuck on compared with 522 million last

we dont believe that they sanctions have or will achieve

counterproductive department spokesman charles redman said 
he was reacting to a bill passed tuesday by the house foreign 
affairs committee which now heads for debate in the full house 
redman said the trade sanctions against south africa legislated 
in 1986 by congress have not led to significant positive changes 
in south africa and we dont believe that additional ones are any 
more likely to succeed

attorney general edwin meese iii violated a 
white house ban on intervening in government contracts on behalf of 
friends when he tried to help the wedtech corp a senate 
subcommittee report concludes 
the report according to senate subcommittee staff members says 
that while meese was counselor to president reagan in 1981 and 
1982 he violated the policy despite warnings by white house 
officials not to intervene the staffers spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
meese responded to 16 memos written by his longtime friend e 
robert wallach on behalf of wedtech by directing white house 
staffers to ensure that the firm got a fair hearing from the army 
in the companys efforts to obtain a 32 million nobid engine 
contract the company was awarded the contract after meeses 
deputy james jenkins intervened in the spring of 1982 calling a 
crucial white house meeting at which officials of the army the 
small business administration and wedtech executives worked out 
their differences over price and the sba agreed to contribute 
millions of dollars in advance payments and loans to assist the 
company 
former counselor to the president edwin meese iii and former 
deputy counselor jim jenkins failed to observe the white house 
policy on contacts with procurement officials which failure 
resulted in improper favoritism toward a specific contractor the 
report said according to the senate staffers 
meeses lawyer nathan lewin disputed the findings reached by 
all nine republicans and democrats on the senate subcommittee 
chaired by carl levin dmich lewin said meeses actions didnt 
give the appearance of impropriety and did not fall within the 
scope of the white house regulation 
lewin said the white house policy was designed to prohibit a 
white house official from intervening at the request of a friend 
who was asking that a certain company be awarded a contract lewin 
said that in this instance meese was simply trying to ensure that 
wedtech was treated fairly when it was considered for the contract 
the white house procurement policy in effect since october 1981 
says that obviously no member of the white house staff should 
contact any procurement officer about a contract in which he has a 
personal financial interest or in which a relative friend or 
business associate has a financial interest 
fred fielding reagans former counsel told the subcommittee 
staff that he advised meeses office on two occasions not to 
intervene on behalf of wedtech a new york city defense contracting 
firm that was seeking government business 
fielding said he stated that this is a government procurement 
situation the white house should not be involved there shouldnt 
even be the appearance of white house involvement 
the wedtech report was prepared by the senate governmental 
affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management 
wallach and meeses former financial adviser w franklyn chinn 
face trial in new york on federal racketeering and conspiracy 
charges that include accepting funds to influence meese on behalf 
of wedtech 
the subcommittee cited testimony from white house officials that 
the effort to help wedtech was based on the presidents campaign 
promise to bring jobs and industry to the south bronx where the 
defense contractor was located 
the intervention of mr meese appears to go beyond this 
purpose and to have been due in no small part to the influence of 
welbilt consultants and personal friends e robert wallach and lyn 
nofziger said the report according to the staffers wedtech was 
then known as welbilt electronic die corp 
nofziger reagans former political director was convicted in 
feburary of illegally lobbying for wedtech

the top political and military leadership of 
the nicaraguan contras visited the state department on wednesday 
and said a deep split in the rebels top ranks was being patched up 
we have a democratic organization said enrique bermudez 
commander of the rebel forces we have a right to dissent and 
the organization has the mechanism to solve any kind of problem 
adolfo calero one of five members of the contra directorate and 
a rival of bermudez replied when asked whether the rebels were 
unified yes sure we are were all here 
bermudez vowed to stay on as military commander despite efforts 
to oust him 
he joined calero and four other members of the directorate for a 
meeting with secretary of state george p shultz state department 
officials speaking only on condition they not be named said 
shultz made general statements to the group stressing the need for 
a unified front against nicaraguas leftist government 
as recently as last week calero was reported to have described 
bermudez as the rebels noriega a reference to the embattled 
commander of panamas defense forces gen manuel antonio noriega 
two weeks ago calero led a move in the directorate to oust 
bermudez but the bid was blocked by two other members us 
officials said 
calero the senior member of the directorate is said to believe 
that bermudez in violation of the concept of civilian supremacy 
had sought to wrest control of the movement 
the washington post reported in wednesdays editions that a 
petition demanding bermudezs removal and signed by 49 rebel 
commanders is to be presented to the civilian directorate 
but bermudez said there were only about half a dozen regional 
commanders opposed to him out of a total of more than 300 
it is not a majority he said if only a few commanders 
dissent its acceptable 
the rebels briefed shultz on a meeting they had last week with 
sandinista leaders in managua 
virtually no progress was made on the goal of reaching a 
permanent ceasefire and an overall settlement of the countrys 
sixyear civil conflict 
calero said the rebels were unified in support of the temporary 
ceasefire signed between the combatants last march 23 at sapoa 
nicaragua alfredo cesar another member of the directorate joined 
calero in blaming the sandinistas for the the lack of progress 
our demands are reasonable the sandinista position has been a 
stumbling block cesar said 
calero said were all standing behind sapoa were all facing 
the sandinistas together we have to

prime minister margaret thatchers conservative 
government hurt in opinion polls by fierce opposition to welfare 
shakeups and a new property tax faces a tough battle in municipal 
elections thursday 
the local contests ranging from the big industrial cities of 
the north to town councils in the prosperous south are the first 
electoral test of mrs thatchers government since she won a third 
successive in june 
the opposition socialist labor party ended an upbeat campaign 
buoyed by revolts among rankandfile tory members of parliament 
against the tax and welfare changes which critics say will hurt 
the poor 
the political contours of britain are shifting before our 
eyes labor campaign manager bryan gould declared as the party 
hit a sevenyear high of support 
labor support has surged from the 308 percent in the 1987 
general election the conservatives won that vote with 423 percent 
of the vote this months gallup poll indicated 415 percent 
support for labor one point ahead of the conservatives 
at stake are onethird of the seats in 158 english and welsh 
districts and the entire councils of all 53 cities and towns of 
scotland there are no elections this year in london and northern 
ireland 
among the biggest prizes are birmingham britains second 
largest city edinburgh the scottish capital and the southwest 
england port of bristol all narrowly controlled by labor 
twenty million britons are eligible to vote in the elections to 
fill nearly 4000 seats last contested in 1984 about 10800 
candidates are running 
in the preelection battle opposition parties have attacked the 
governments proposed welfare changes which are aimed at ending 
what the tories call britains dependency culture nurtured by 
the welfare state 
the opposition has also criticized the new property tax 
legislation the latest conservative salvo in its battle to clip 
highspending leftwing local authorities under the changed laws 
which are getting a rough ride through parliament property taxes 
will be levied on every adult in a home instead of on the building 
critics say the socalled poll tax will double or triple 
bills for millions of households 
a rough calculation shows that a fouradult family in a 
middleclass london suburb which used to pay 930 a year on its 
house will now pay 370 per head for a total of 1480 but the 
figures vary and are disputed 
mrs thatcher calls the new tax a community charge 
insisting poll tax is pejorative because it falsely implies 
that citizens will have to pay for their voting rights 
her 101seat overall majority in the 650member house of commons 
was slashed to 25 this month in a vote on the bill 
surveys show twothirds of voters oppose the tax 
mrs thatcher argues that leftwing councils run costly policies 
geared to their own lowincome supporters and finance them by 
placing the main tax burden on the tories constituency 
businesses and middleclass households 
when the tax comes into force in 1990 mrs thatcher believes 
it will bring home to everyone rich and poor the cost of electing 
leftwing councils 
the councils which run services ranging from education to 
garbage collection raise half their revenue from property taxes 
the government provides the other half 
in an added boost for labor the elections are also the first 
since britains two centrist parties merged last march into the new 
social and liberal democratic party 
the new party known as the democrats and a breakway social 
democratic party led by former foreign secretary david owen are 
fighting each other for about 150 seats 
the gallup poll indicated 11 percent support for the democrats 
and 4 percent for owens breakaway faction 
in scotland where the tories suffered humiliation at the last 
election when they won only 10 of the 72 scottish parliamentary 
seats the territory looks even more hostile to mrs thatcher 
polls indicated 23 percent support there for the tories 
compared with labors 50 percent and 18 percent for scottish 
nationalists

rep frank horton rny urged the postal service to lower 
rates instead saying even if its just one cent i think it 
could be a tremendous step forward 
but the postmaster general said that over the next several 
years we need to improve our situation just to continue to meet 
the past schedule of rate boosts roughly every three years 
frank said the postal service needs more control over its 
budget hopes to find new sources of revenue in areas ranging from 
transportation to philately and is examining other initiatives to 
improve its management of costs 
horton said the april rate increase combined with reduced post 
office window hours because of budget cuts enacted by congress 
plays into the hands of those who want to turn mail delivery over 
to private business 
federal budget director james c miller iii has called for 
ending the government monopoly on mail service and a presidential 
commission in march advocated allowing private companies to go into 
the mail business 
frank who is a critic of such proposals said efforts to 
privatize the postal service can find fertile ground for growth 
only in shortcomings and failures of the postal system itself 
he pledged to restore full window service as soon as finances 
allow and voiced support for legislation to separate postal 
service finances from the rest of the federal budget 
frank said it was absurd for the postal service to be 
regulated by budgetary scorekeeping rules designed to bring 
about deficit reductions

sam elliotts first film lifeguard 
didnt catapult him to stardom as predicted a dozen years ago due 
mainly he says to a penchant for speaking his mind 
when lifeguard was released in 1976 elliott publicly 
attacked the studio that made the film for advertisements 
emphasizing an unsavory element that didnt exist in the film 
it was about a guy coming of age and making important 
decisions in his life and they were talking beach blanket 
bingo he said i know it had an effect on my career some 
people just dont want to hear the truth 
elliott who lives in malibu with his actresswife katharine 
ross is starring in shakedown being released friday and hes 
still speaking his mind 
im probably more outspoken now than i was before the 
43yearold actor said recently but i dont think i put off 
people as much now because of my sense of humor 
a lot of what ive said over the years was just kidding 
anyway but people didnt realize it being opinionated was all it 
was 
elliott confesses his undercover cop role in shakedown is a 
conscious effort to elevate myself in this business 
im trying to ally myself with commercially oriented movies so 
that i can become bankable and therefore get better roles he 
said ive turned stuff down because i didnt believe in it and 
i dont want to do anything i cant believe in 
if it isnt real for me it wont be real up on the screen

the judge in the irancontra trial wednesday 
ordered governent security officials to explain at a closed hearing 
the apparent lack of progress in declassifying key documents 
for the trial 
us district judge gerhard a gesell scheduled the hearing for 
friday morning and ordered the attendance of representatives of 
national intelligence agencies who are reviewing some 300000 pages 
of classified documents collected by independent counsel lawrence 
e walsh the hearing will be closed to reporters and the public 
gesell issued the order a day after walsh reported that 82820 
pages of classified documents plus another 22965 pages of 
classified or sensitive nongovernment papers had been placed in a 
security facility for examination by defense lawyers for marine lt 
col oliver l north and three codefendants 
gesell said it apeared from this report and other information 
available to the court that the interdepartmental review committee 
charged with examining classified documents is apparently failing 
to meet the requirements of this criminal action 
the judge who last week accused the reagan administration of 
intentional withholding of documents necessary for the defense 
said the closed hearing would be convened to consider the 
apparent lack of progress being made in declassifying essential 
papers 
gesells order indicated impatience with the progress that had 
been made in a week on april 28 walsh reported that 35254 
classified government documents were ready for defense review 
at the hearing on friday gesell said he would set deadlines for 
reporting the final results of the declassification process 
north and his codefendants former national security adviser 
john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and retired air 
force maj gen richard v secord also were directed to appear 
along with their lawyers and prosecutors 
under the classified information procedures act secret 
documents cannot be introduced into evidence unless they are 
declassified by the agency that generated them 
the interdepartmental task force that is reviewing the material 
consists of representatives from the white house the cia the 
national security council as well as the departments of defense 
state and justice 
gesell has warned repeatedly that unless the defendants are able 
to introduce relevant portions of the secret documents as evidence 
he would be forced to dismiss charges they conspired to divert 
profits from the usiran arms sales to the nicaraguan contra 
rebels 
during one hearing last week gesell said a stone wall is 
being built up between this court and the trial 
walsh has described the documents as containing some of the 
governments most closely guarded secrets the disclosure of which 
could jeopardize the lives of hostages being held in the middle 
east or compromise us intelligence and military planning 
some of this secret material if disclosed could expose 
people in very difficult situations to torture and death in the 
middle east walsh said 
walsh testified last week there were some documents found in 
norths office that were so secret even he shouldnt have had 
meawhile the defense has argued that the unprecedented volume 
of classified documents will make it impossible for the four 
defendants to get a fair trial under procedures imposed by the law 
for disclosing government secrets in court 
the classified procedures statute requires the defense to notify 
the prosecution in advance of trial of any secrets it wants to 
disclose in court this requirement among other things would 
force the defense to tip its hand before trial the defense lawyers 
contended in a motion filed last week to declare the laws 
provisions unconstitutional as applied to this case

interior minister tomas borge said the 
government agreed to negotiate with contra rebels because of the 
high cost of the war in lives and resources and as a way of holding 
indirect talks with the united states 
but he cautioned that if the ceasefire talks failed the entire 
nation would be called to battle the ussupported rebels 
the leftist leader in an interview tuesday night described the 
almost 9yearold sandinista government as the nicaragua we 
dreamed of despite opposition from a us administration that 
is particularly aggressive visceral expansionist and 
reactionary 
the sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolution that deposed 
the proamerican dictatorship of the late anastasio somoza the 
contras began their fight 1 years later 
weve paid a high price to defend our national sovereignty and 
dignity said borge one of nine commanders in the directorate of 
the governing sandinista national liberation front 
more than 26000 people have been killed in the war and the 
government claims the economy has suffered losses of more than 3 
billion 
recent talks in managua with the contras to work out a lasting 
armistice have faltered as the two sides attempt to define a 
vaguely worded ceasefire pact signed march 23 
a fragile 60day truce remains in effect until the end of this 
month the rebels have refused a sandinista offer to extend it an 
additional 30 days 
should the truce end without an agreement to either prolong the 
ceasefire or a lasting peace plan well mobilize the entire 
nation borge said 
he said nicaragua agreed to negotiations with the rebels because 
it has paid a high cost in blood in the war 
but if the contras were not badly beaten militarily or held 
land they would never negotiate with us he said 
the sandinistas initially refused to hold direct talks with the 
contras or allow them to come to nicaragua for discussions borge 
acknowledged the backpedaling but said we will never discuss 
political power with the contras 
we understand the negotiations with the contras are indirect 
talks with the united states he said 
the sandinistas had long said that any discussions to end the 
fighting should be with the reagan administration because of its 
aid to the contras 
borge dismissed rumors that the directorate was split between 
his hardline followers and those of president daniel ortega 
the worst enemies of revolutions are the revolutionaries 
who fight among themselves borge said we all discuss and 
discuss until were in agreement there are certain contradictions 
thats natural and helps contribute and move things forward 
he said the sandinistas would give up power if they lost in 
elections but said that would be the end of the nicaraguan 
revolution 
and this is impossible nothing can kill the revolution he 
added 
asked if the government was marxistleninist borge said the 
teachings of those two thinkers was a universal science and 
anyone who doesnt study it is either mentally retarded or 
ignorant he said marxistleninist theory was an important 
guide in our decisions 
he praised the governments ties to the soviet union which 
provides most of the countrys aid the soviet union he said 
helps us and respects us and we appreciate it

the play was praised but the critics were not as 
kind to madonna making her broadway debut in speedtheplow 
david mamets scathing comedy about two hollywood producers and a 
temporary secretary 
no she cant act headlined the new york daily news its 
drama critic howard kissel called speedtheplow mamets 
clearest wittest play but added i bet it would be even 
funnier with an actress 
clive barnes of the new york post agreed he said the rock star 
sounds more as if she were auditioning than acting and the 
audition is scarcely for the big time there is a genuine reticent 
charm here but it not yet ready to light the lamps on broadway 
frank rich of the new york times was more positive he said 
madonna serves mr mamets play much as she did the susan 
seidelman film desperately seeking susan with intelligent 
scrupulously disciplined comic acting 
she delivers the shocking transitions essential to the action 
and needs only more confidence to relax a bit and fully command her 
speaking voice the times said 
madonnas role is the smallest in the threecharacter play and 
she is on stage less than half the time the play also stars joe 
mantegna and ron silver 
but it has been madonna who sold tickets speedtheplow 
orginally was scheduled to open at the 299seat mitzi newhouse 
theater in lincoln center but ticket demand was so great than it 
was moved to the 1058seat royale theater 
even so the lincoln center theater which produced the play on 
broadway deliberately downplayed madonnas role in the production 
it declined all interviews for the star and kept publicity to a 
minimum 
by the time the show opened tuesday night it had a good but not 
overwhelming advance sale of 500000 with the favorable reviews 
the box office expected to take in more than 100000 the day after 
the opening said merle debuskey a spokesman for the show 
mantegna and silver who play the sleazy hollywood producers 
were universally lauded linda winer writing in newsday called 
mantegna irresistible and she said silver delivered a 
riveting breakthrough performance said rich the men could not 
be better mr silver gives the performance of his career 
speedtheplow is mamets third play to be done on broadway 
american buffalo starring robert duvall has a financially 
unsuccessful run in 1977 but later was revived successfully 
offbroadway with al pacino mamets glengarry glen ross which 
opened on broadway in 1984 won a pulitzer prize for drama 
mantegna won a tony award in that play 
all three stars are committed to appear in the play for six 
months

the government will have to spend 65 billion 
more a year on housing over the next 15 years if every american is 
to have a decent affordable place to live an industrybacked 
study said wednesday 
the study financed by the national association of realtors 
estimated the nation will need to spend 41 billion to help build 
or renovate 36 million housing units over the period because many 
americans now live without adequate plumbing sewage disposal or 
electricity or in overcrowded conditions 
in addition 56 billion over current levels will be needed to 
subsidize families that would otherwise have to pay more than the 
recommended 30 percent of their income for housing according to 
the study performed by the urban institute a research organization 
we are reminded daily of the homeless on our streets and 
shelters less visible but no better off are those who live in 
inadequate housing or who pay the majority of their incomes just to 
stay off these streets said nestor weigand president of the 
realtors association who presented the study at a news conference 
if we dont take some affirmative action the primary 
american dream of home ownership will not be realized for growing 
percentages of people the real estate executive said 
with the widening gap between income and housing costs home 
ownership for people between the ages of 25 and 34 has dropped 20 
percent so far in the 1980s he said 
in addition to government help to build and upgrade housing 
weigand recommended restoring tax incentives for investment in 
lowand moderateincome housing more local government action to 
encourage building and a law to allow younger people to use 
taxfree retirement funds for down payment on a home 
the study americas housing needs to the 21st century said 
77 million households are living in substandard units and 32 
million others are in overcrowded conditions 
it said more than 6 percent of housing units in urban areas and 
17 percent of units in rural areas dont meet minimum standards set 
by the department of housing and urban development hud classifies 
a dwelling as substandard if it does not have electricity lacks 
adequate plumbing or lacks sewage disposal 
the study did not address the likelihood of getting additional 
funds through congress at a time of budget constraints imposed by 
the high federal deficits 
john tuccillo realtors association chief economist said the 
group is working with members of congress on comprehensive housing 
legislation that he expects to pass next year the reagan 
administration has generally opposed any new housing initiatives 
and scaled back many of the programs in existence when it came into 
office in 1981 
the realtorsurban institute study is the latest of several 
recent reports looking into the countrys housing needs in march 
the national housing task force issued a report recommending a 
12year program with a goal of providing livable housing for all 
americans 
the private task force recommended the program begin with a 3 
billion appropriation to be used as seed money to stimulate state 
and local efforts to develop and renovate lowincome housing 
tuccillo said all the recent studies point to the same need he 
said the realtors study is the first to evaluate what it would take 
to wipe out the housing problem over a set period of time

surgeon general c everett koop is mailing 
every american household a historic pamphlet with explicit advice 
on how to avoid the deadly aids virus including the use of condoms 
in unveiling the booklet at a news conference wednesday health 
and human services secretary otis r bowen said the 17 million 
aids project represented the first time the federal government 
has attempted to contact virtually every resident directly by 
mail regarding a public health crisis 
bowen said he asked koop to play the leading role in the project 
because americans know and have faith in the health advisories of 
the surgeon general and that trust will help ensure the success of 
this effort 
koops photo appears on the cover along with a brief message 
over his signature 
some of the issues involved in this brochure may not be things 
you are used to discussing openly he wrote i can easily 
understand that but now you must discuss them we all must know 
about aids read this brochure and talk about it with those you 
love 
although fine print at the bottom identifies it as an official 
government document hhs publication no cdc hhs888404 
the slick layout produced by a private public relations company 
does not smack of officialese 
and despite the explicit language contained in the eight pages 
the booklet will not be in a plain brown envelope when it starts 
appearing in the nations mailboxes may 26 
before that time television networks have been asked to 
broadcast a series of promotional spots alerting their viewers to 
be looking for the mailer posters also are going up in 7000 post 
offices and other locations advertising you asked for answers 
about aids theyre in the mail 
the aids virus most often is spread through close contact with 
blood blood products or semen from infected persons 
the second page of the brochure bears the blue heading how do 
you get aids from sex and goes on to state that the deadly aids 
virus can enter the body through the vagina penis rectum or 
mouth 
anal intercourse with or without a condom is risky it 
continues the rectum is easily injured during anal intercourse 
the fourth page is half filled by a section boldly headlined 
what is all the talk about condoms 
not so very long ago condoms rubbers or prophylactics were 
things we didnt talk about very much it says now theyre 
discussed on the evening news and on the front page of your 
newspaper and displayed out in the open in your local drugstore 
grocery and convenience store 
for those who are sexually active and not limiting their 
sexual activity to one partner condoms have been shown to help 
prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases that is why 
the use of condoms is recommended to help reduce the spread of 
aids 
federal health officials have projected there will be 270000 
cases of aids in the united states by 1991 and that as many as 15 
million americans are infected with the virus now 
the content of the pamphlet was a closely held secret in an 
obvious although not officially acknowledged effort to keep the 
message from being diluted by political pressure from outside the 
health department 
in his remarks at the news conference koop said a careful 
reading of this brochure should enable the reader to separate true 
health information from various political agendas promoted at the 
expense of the publics health 
he said mailing the brochure is the closest we can come to 
making something required reading in every american home i hope 
that parents grandparents children and teenagers will set a time 
when they can sit down together and review the information in these 
eight pages 
i would hope that schools could do the same thing in 
classrooms where the age is appropriate added koop who came 
under stern criticism from conservatives in 1986 when his initial 
36page more technical report on aids called for sex education in 
schools to help combat the epidemic 
asked if he expects a new wave of criticism in response to the 
latest report koop said i expect everything all the time 
the surgeon general noted that legislation ordering a national 
mailer by june 30 spelled out that its content was not to be 
subject to clearance outside the health department 
we took them at their word koop said this was not 
cleared in the sense that some documents are 
koop did say it was discussed with key people at the white 
house 
asked later to elaborate dr james mason head of the centers 
for disease control said staff members of the white house domestic 
policy council asked to see a copy after cameraready pages of 
the brochure were ready to send to the printers 
no changes were made mason said 
plans for a national mailer last year were dropped largely 
because the domestic policy council suggested that such a project 
should be reviwed by the then newly appointed white house aids 
commission 
although the content was tightly controlled by bowen koop 
mason and other top federal health officials the design of the 
brochure was handled by ogilvy amp mather 
neil cameron of the companys atlanta office said focus group 
sessions held around the nation found that the explicit language 
used in the brochure was acceptable to the overwhelming majority of 
those asked to respond 
the project calls for 110 million copies to be printed in 
english and an additional 4 million in spanish the bulk will be 
mailed directly to the 107 million households served by the us 
postal service 
the chief victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have 
been homosexual men and intravenous drug users although a small 
percentage of cases are attributed to transfusions of contaminated 
blood heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women 
to their offspring 
as of april 21 aids had been diagnosed in about 59500 
americans of whom more than half or about 33000 have died since 
june 1981 according to the cdc no one is known to have recovered 
from aids

president reagan taking a conciliatory tone 
toward the soviet union said today he believes that there is 
hope for further change in soviet human rights policies 
at the same time reagan acknowledged that the united states has 
an agonizing problem in dealing with its homeless and needs to 
do more to curb unemployment and combat bigotry 
reagan made the remarks in a speech that was markedly less 
confrontational than his foreign policy address in springfield 
mass april 21 which soviet leader mikhail gorbachev rebuked as 
confrontational 
both speeches were billed as scenesetters for the may 29june 2 
summit meeting between the two leaders in moscow 
in his address here to the national strategy forum a 
nonpartisan organization that sponsors educational programs on 
national security and foreign policy issues reagan said that over 
the last three years some 300 political and religious prisoners 
have been released from soviet labor camps 
he said the changes were limited and added we encourage 
the soviets to go further 
but we applaud the changes that have taken place he said 
reagan said the united states is also heartened by the 
increased rate of people being permitted to leave the soviet union 
in a brief questionandanswer session with the audience reagan 
said he was willing to give gorbachev the benefit of the doubt 
up to a point that he sincerely wants to achieve the program of 
economic and social reforms known as glasnost 
he also expressed a dream to rid the world of nuclear 
weapons he compared the danger of nuclear weapons to a 
hypothetical situation in which the world was threatened by a power 
from outer space 
wouldnt we all of a sudden find that we didnt have any 
differences between us at all we were all human beings citizens 
of the world and wouldnt we come together to fight that 
particular threat reagan asked 
on tuesday richard schifter assistant secretary of state for 
human rights and humanitarian affairs said that applications for 
jewish emigration are now being handled reasonably fast but he 
told the national conference on soviet jewry that jews wishing to 
leave the soviet union should apply now lest the approval process 
slow down 
for his part reagan said in recent months the soviet union 
has shown a willingness to respect at least some human rights it 
is my belief that there is hope for further change hope that in 
the days ahead the soviets will grant further recognition to the 
fundamental civil and political rights of all 
reagan also noted that gorbachev has initiated some reforms 
allowing over the last three years the release of 300 political and 
religious prisoners from prison camps slowing the incarcerations 
of dissidents in mental hospital and prisons and allowing some 
broadenings of freedom of the press 
he then noted that the soviets often reply to criticism of their 
human rights record by noting that the united states has problems 
of homelessness unemployment and discrimination within its own 
borders 
yes the united states has social and economic shortcomings 
he said 
unemployment for one as a free people we have created an 
economic expansion that over the past five years has created nearly 
16 million jobs but we need to do more 
homelessness is indeed a problem and an agonizing one he 
added as a free people our churches synagogues and a host of 
volunteer organizations do much to provide the homeless with food 
clothing and medicines and yet there is no denying that a problem 
remains 
racial discrimination our strides as a free people during 
just the past three decades have been dramatic the president 
said yet the problem lingers and we continue to battle bigotry 
and prejudie 
reagan said that while socalled economic and social rights 
belong to an essentially different category from civil and 
political rights it is also true that the soviets may be 
coming to understand something of the connection between human 
rights and economic growth 
the soviets should recognize basic human rights because it is 
the right thing to do he said but if they recognize human 
rights for reasons of their own because they seek economic 
growth or because they want to enter into a more normal 
relationship with the united states and other nations well i 
want to say here and now thats fine by me 
in his springfield speech reagan had said that if the soviet 
union was changing it was because the costs of aggression and the 
real moral difference between our systems were brought home to it 
reagan also spoke sharply of the soviets in that speech and 
suggested they might not be sincere about their stated intention to 
end their military occupation of afghanistan 
gorbachev in a moscow meeting with secretary of state george 
shultz criticized reagans speech giving way to a round of harsh 
titfortat rejoinders that have marked ussoviet comments in 
recent weeks 
gorbachev decried the confrontational tone of the speech and 
said that if the soviets responded in kind it could become no 
longer possible to solve any further issues between the two 
superpowers 
in a speech tuesday the president said gorbachev has admitted 
the soviet union made mistakes dealing with religious believers in 
decades past and they would be rectified 
what we hope for ultimately is a willingness to see continued 
change in the spirit of glasnost when it comes to matters of 
religion reagan told a meeting on religious rights at the white 
house 
glasnost is the russian term for the soviet leaders policy of 
bringing openness to soviet society

us accuses japanese of protectionism but opens door to resuming 
talks 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
us trade representative clayton yeutter on 
wednesday sharply accused japan of protectionism in its dispute 
with the united states over beef and orange import quotas but he 
left open the door to restarting negotiations that collapsed here 
tuesday night 
yeutter said the japanese restrictions presumably will be be 
declared illegal by gatt the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade under a complaint process accepted by japan at a gatt 
meeting in geneva hours after breakdown of the washington talks 
such a finding would open the way to compensation or possible 
us trade reprisals or a combination of both he said 
my patience as a negotiator has come to an end yeutter told 
a news conference but he still talked of a possible resumption of 
talks 
he accused the japanese of failing to match us concessions in 
the prolonged dispute and of making a beef pricefixing proposal 
amounting to clearly the antithesis of free and open trade 
however yeutter said overall trade relations between the two 
countries are still very good and the united states would be 
happy at any time to listen to new japanese proposals provided 
they reflect a whole lot more market liberalization than surfaced 
in the last few days 
hopefully they will reappraise their position and come forth 
with much more accommodating proposals sometime in the future 
yeutter said if an opportunity arises to resolve the issue 
through negotiations in the next two to three months while the gatt 
panel is organizing itself we would be very pleased 
yeutter said during the talks he had offered to waive us 
claims for potential compensation for damages to its export trade 
if the japanese would agree to a twoyear phaseout of the quotas 
but even that was unacceptable 
the commerce department has estimated that annual us beef 
exports to japan of about 550 million could grow to about 1 
billion under free trade and exports of oranges and orange juice 
now less than 100 million a year could top 150 million 
warning that we will not tolerate stalling of the gatt process 
by the government of japan yeutter said we will be a lot 
harder to deal with once we have a decision from gatt 
we will not permit this case to spill into the next 
administration were going to resolve this dispute one way or 
another during this president ronald reagans administration 
he said 
he also accused japan of delaying action on opening markets to 
12 varieties of us processed foods in a case settled by gatt 
earlier this year the united states will pursue this with gatt in 
june he said 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng said in a statement issued 
by his washington office that the united states has insisted 
throughout on complete removal of the beef and orange quotas 
disclosing new details of his negotiations with japanese 
agriculture minister takashi sato however yeutter said the united 
states would have accepted a proposal for a threeyear phaseout of 
the beef quota if japan had not sought to raise new barriers 
he also said a twoyear phaseout of orange and orange juice 
import quotas could have been accepted but japan insisted on five 
years and offered only a 10 percent annual tonnage increase

democratic sen howard metzenbaum predicted a tough battle 
against his gop challenger cleveland mayor george voinovich but 
the outspoken liberal added i must be doing something right if 
so many people want to beat me 
there isnt a hit list in america that doesnt have me at the 
top of it the 70yearold metzenbaum told reporters in cleveland 
after he crushed a littleknown primary opponent to win nomination 
for a third term 
voters in two other primaries tuesday chose democratic 
candidates for governor in states where republicans now hold the 
top job 
in indiana secretary of state evan bayh swamped his only 
primary foe and will face lt gov john m mutz who was unopposed 
for the gop nomination with gov robert orr barred by law from 
seeking a third term democrats hope to recapture the governors 
mansion for the first time in 20 years 
in north carolina lt gov bob jordan beat four rivals for the 
chance to face gov jim martin who is only the second republican 
governor in the state this century martin seeking a second term 
was unchallenged in the primary 
voinovich a 51yearold moderate who was the only republican in 
the race promised a barnburner of a fight and said he had 
never seen people more excited about a senatorial campaign 
whether its enthusiasm for me or antagonism toward metzenbaum 
metzenbaum is among the most liberal members of congress and as 
a member of the senate judiciary committee played a key role in 
killing the nomination of robert bork to the us supreme court 
the contest is expected to be one of the most expensive in ohio 
history with the two men having raised more than 7 million 
through the end of march 
in indiana bayh has the benefit of one of the states most 
popular political names as the son of former sen birch bayh but 
mutz has been attacking him on the issues of age and experience 
he is 32 and has held statewide office less than two years 
the mutz campaign quickly unveiled television advertisements 
showing each candidates photograph atop a resume mutzs resume 
fills with his record as a successful businessman 13year member 
of the general assembly and twoterm lieutenant governor presiding 
over the states economic development program 
the lone entry on bayhs resume is a reference to 15 months as 
secretary of state after that image appears the two resumes are 
shown side by side and viewers are told mutz is ready now for 
indianas toughest job 
twoterm republican sen richard g lugar and democrat jack 
wickes an indianapolis attorney were unopposed for senate 
nominations 
in north carolina jordan acknowledged his standing as an 
underdog against a popular incumbent but said he counted on help 
from a democratic party that is unified in a way that i have not 
seen it before 
merle black political science professor at the university of 
north carolina at chapel hill said that to win jordan must 
present a positive agenda that will excite democrats and 
independents to vote for him 
but hes also running as an underdog and hes got to give 
people reasons why jim martin shouldnt be reelected 
here are the vote totals from the primaries 
in ohio final unofficial results showed metzenbaum with 
1067138 votes or 83 percent to 213120 or 17 percent for 
ralph applegate who runs a columbus lawncare business 
in indiana with 98 percent of precincts reporting bayh had 
482393 votes or 83 percent and former kokomo mayor stephen j 
daily had 66001 or 11 percent the rest of the votes went to 
senate minority leader frank obannon whose name was put on the 
ballot as a precaution by the bayh campaign when it appeared bayh 
might be found in violation of the states residency requirement 
in north carolina with 99 percent of precincts reporting 
jordan had 404091 votes or 80 percent to 61291 votes or 12 
percent for billy martin a servicestation employee from carthage

israeli forces shelled a syrianheld 
town and battled proiranian guerrillas today and then announced 
that the israeli drive into southern lebanon had ended 
israel reported that three israelis and more than 40 arab 
guerrillas were killed 
the israeli military said in a statement issued late today in 
jerusalem that the twoday operation had ended and all 
participating israeli forces had returned to their bases 
the israeli military statement said 17 israelis were wounded it 
said most of the arab guerrillas killed were members of hezbollah 
lebanons most radical shiite moslem faction 
the army statement said hezbollah guerrillas had expelled all 
the residents from the village of maydoun some 12 miles north of 
the israeli border and were using the village as a launching point 
for attacks on israeli forces and their lebanese militia allies 
dozens of hezbollah guerrillas were in maydoun when the fighting 
started today the israeli army command said it said helicopter 
gunships and israeli artillery destroyed the guerrillas artillery 
and vehicles with mounted antiaircraft guns 
israel identified two of the dead troopers as capt boaz ravid 
of beit ovad and sgt marco bernstein of nahariya the name of 
third dead israeli was not immediately made public 
security sources in south lebanon said earlier today that the 
israeli soldiers died when the army stormed shiite guerrilla bases 
a police spokesman who like the security sources spoke on 
condition of anonymity said seven guerrillas were killed in the 
shootout around the villages of maydoun and ein eltineh in the 
southwestern sector of the bekaa valley 
the villages are five miles south of the town of mashghara 
where police said a 50man syrian garrison came under israeli 
howitzer fire 
there was no immediate word on any syrian casualties and it was 
not known if the syrians responded to the israeli shellfire 
mashghara is four miles west of the israelis forward positions 
and is the syrians southern outpost in the western bekaa 
the action was the first contact between the syrians who have 
16000 troops in the bekaa and the israelis since they pushed out 
of their selfdesignated border security zone monday night to 
knock out guerrilla bases 
it was also the first time the syrians have come under israeli 
fire in lebanon since they were forced from south lebanon in heavy 
fighting when the israelis invaded in june 1982 
an israeli armored column stormed bases manned by guerrillas of 
hezbollah in hills overlooking maydoun and ein eltineh 
the villages are nine miles west of five villages the israelis 
sealed off tuesday and searched for palestinian guerrillas and 
allied lebanese militiamen 
un spokesman timur goksel said un spotters saw an israeli 
helicopter exchange fire with guerrillas in a dry riverbed 
southeast of maydoun about 430 am he said he could not confirm 
lebanese reports a helicopter was shot down 
the police spokesman said gunners of the lebanese army later 
opened up on israeli tanks with sovietmade 130mm howitzers 
deployed near lake qaroun about six miles east of maydoun 
security sources in south lebanon reported that israel sent two 
more mechanized battalions into the area during the night doubling 
the size of their force to about 2500 troops 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said tuesday he did not 
expect the operation to provoke a confrontation with syria 
israels staunchest enemy the israeli operation in lebanon is its 
largest in two years 
the clashes in southern lebanon occurred as palestinian 
protesters virtually shut down the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza strip with a general strike 
at least 180 arabs have been killed since the unrest began in 
the occupied territories dec 8 an israeli soldier and a jewish 
teenage settler also have been slain 
police said hundreds of civilians fled villages near the 
security zone during todays fighting 
reporters in the bekaa saw dozens of villagers carrying 
belongings blankets and mattresses heading for safer areas behind 
the syrian lines 
shortly after todays advance 500 israeli soldiers began 
withdrawing from five bekaa valley villages a police spokesman 
said the israelis began pulling out of ain ata memis kfeer 
khalwat and ain zeta after completing the search 
the spokesman said the israelis rounded up several lebanese 
militiamen allied with the palestinians in the five villages and 
seized large quantities of weapons and ammunition 
a resident of khiam told reporters israeli soldiers detained 30 
men in the village tuesday the israeli army declined comment 
the lebanese spokesman said the israelis used police dogs in 
housetohouse searches in ain ata and nearby villages and called 
on the population not to cooperate with saboteurs and 
accomplices 
israel set up the security zone after it withdrew the bulk of 
its army from lebanon in 1985 three years after invading its 
northern neighbor

a court ruled wednesday that 
port elizabeth must let all races onto its beaches groups of 
blacks rushed to the shore running triumphantly on the previously 
whites only sand 
the regional supreme court in the southeastern port supported a 
city councilor and a member of parliament who claimed the city 
council acted without proper authority when it passed a resolution 
in 1966 segregating the beaches of the nations fifthlargest city 
chris heunis the constitutional development minister and cape 
province administrator gene louw opposed the suit their lawyers 
said they may appeal 
heunis and president pw botha have taken a middle ground 
recently on the volatile issue of beach apartheid saying some 
beaches should be integrated but others reserved for whites the 
extremeright conservative party whose power is growing opposes 
any integration of beaches 
graham richards the white city councilor who filed the 
challenge called the court decision a small victory for those of 
us fighting what sometimes seems to be a losing battle against the 
continuous inroads made by the government against basic human 
rights 
most beaches are open to all races in the two largest coastal 
cities durban and cape town one section of durbans beachfront 
remains segregated blacks are barred from many beaches in smaller 
communities 
in january 1987 port elizabeths beaches were the scene of a 
political confrontation between botha and the rev alan hendrickse 
leader of the mixedrace chamber of parliament 
hendrickse waded into the surf in wellpublicized defiance of 
apartheid segregation laws he later apologized to botha which 
hurt his credibility with antiapartheid groups 
after learning of wednesdays ruling hendrickse said in 
parliament somebody owes me an apology 
also wednesday two african national congress guerrillas were 
sentenced to be hanged for land mine explosions that jolted 
northern farming communities in 198586 they were convicted of 
murder last week in messina near the zimbabwe border 
mzondileli nondula 25 was convicted of planting a mine that 
killed two white women and four white children in december 1985 
mthetheleli mncube 28 was convicted of setting a mine that killed 
a black man in november 1985 and of killing two white policemen in 
a subsequent escape attempt 
we have lost the battle but not the war mncube said after 
the sentence we shall win 
the anc is the main guerrilla movement fighting white domination 
in south africa 
law and order minister adriaan vlok offered to compensate 
relatives for the funeral expenses of two boys shot to death in 
1985 by policemen who were hiding in crates on a truck to entrap 
stonethrowing youngsters in a mixedrace township 
a judge ruled at an inquest march 3 into what is called the 
trojan horse incident that police acted unreasonably but on 
tuesday a prosecutor declined to press charges against the officers 
vlok said his department would pay the funeral expenses and 
legal costs borne by the families of michael miranda 11 and shaun 
magmoed 16 the families are expected to get about 900 rand 425

iran said wednesday its security men 
arrested a saudi arabian spy in tehran it also claimed the saudis 
beat up iranian diplomats and seized documents after the rupture in 
relations between the two countries 
the iranian allegations underscored the growing tension between 
the two persian gulf neighbors saudi arabia severed diplomatic 
relations with tehran on april 26 
in a brief statement the official islamic republic news agency 
said security authorities arrested an agent of the riyadh regime 
who had entered the country illegally with 300 million rials 45 
million dollars 
he will be dealt with as a spy the statement said 
convicted spies may be sentenced to death under irans islamic law 
irna also quoted an unnamed information ministry official as 
saying the man was planning to spread wahhabi faith and the 
american brand of islam 
the wahhabis are an ultraconservative sunni moslem sect most 
saudis including saudi arabias ruling family are wahhabis the 
majority of iranians are shiite moslems 
the measures that were taken were no more than the normal 
procedure in line with diplomatic norms under such circumstances 
the official was quoted as saying 
saudi arabia made no immediate comment on the arrest of the 
alleged spy 
diplomats from tehrans embassy in the saudi arabian capital of 
riyadh and a consulate in the red sea port city of jiddah who were 
given one week to leave the country returned home wednesday 
saudi arabia called totally baselesss iranian claims that 
the diplomats were beaten up and that documents were confiscated 
from the two missions 
saudiiranian ties have deteriorated rapidly in recent months 
after repeated iranian charges that the saudis are helping iraq in 
its war against iran 
last year iranians ransacked the saudi arabian embassy in 
tehran and killed a saudi diplomat saying the action was in 
retaliation for the killings of 275 iranian pilgrims in clashes 
last july with saudi security police in islams holy city of mecca 
iran has called for the overthrow of the saudi regime and said 
it must be stripped of control of islams holy shrines in mecca and 
medina 
the saudis said they will allow only 45000 iranian pilgrims to 
enter saudi arabia during this years pilgrimage the iranians have 
insisted they will send the same number of pilgrims as last year 
150000

coretta scott king has asked a judge to skip a 
trial and immediately decide whether she or boston university own 
papers of her slain husband civil rights leader martin luther king 
jr 
at issue are 83000 documents now at kings alma mater that 
range from letters to eleanor roosevelt to the outline of his i 
have a dream speech 
a sworn statement and documents turned over by the university 
support allegations that king never donated his papers to bu mrs 
king claimed in a request for a summary judgment filed last week in 
suffolk superior court 
its kind of a shortcut in the case said archer smith mrs 
kings atlanta attorney in a telephone interview wednesday the 
letter is so clear were asking the judge to cut through the 
jargon and everything else 
no hearing on the request for summary judgment was immediately 
set the case has not yet been assigned to a judge 
last december mrs king sued boston university to recover the 
papers her husband gave to the school where he earned a doctorate 
in theology in 1955 the suit claims the university has not 
properly maintained the papers and is illegally keeping them king 
sent the papers to the school in 1964 four years before his 
assassination 
mrs king wants the papers kept with 100000 more in his 
archives at the martin luther king jr center for nonviolent social 
change in atlanta 
in the request for a summary judgment mrs kings lawyers said 
that howard t gotlieb chief of reference and special collections 
for boston university libraries had indicated in a deposition that 
as far as he knew king never designated any of the papers at the 
university as an outright gift 
the university also gave mrs kings lawyers a 1964 letter by 
ga harrer then director of libraries for the university saying 
the university was interested in becoming the repository for kings 
papers 
melvin b miller a bu trustee whose law firm is representing 
the university in its countersuit against mrs king scoffed at the 
latest volley from the other side 
its strange that they think there are no questions of fact in 
this case he said everything is to be settled nothing is 
settled 
key to the entire battle is a july 16 1964 letter by king 
naming boston university repository of his papers king was killed 
in 1968 and did not leave a will 
in the letter king said the papers would remain his legal 
property but that every year he would donate part of the collection 
to the university 
mrs kings lawyers maintain that while king sent papers to 
boston university he did not take the step of making them a gift 
the university in its countersuit claims it owns the king papers 
in atlanta as well as those it has because the 1964 letter made 
boston university the depository for all kings papers 
mrs kings lawyers insist the letter did not constitute a 
contract or charitable pledge and violates laws governing wills 
they have asked that the countersuit be dismissed

to local folks theyre known as granny 
kids children who leave their homes and bigcity schools in the 
chicago area for quiet southern illinois towns and their smaller 
friendlier schools 
theyre scattered throughout the area living with their 
grannies and other relatives during the school year and heading 
for the urban north in the summer 
its hard to determine exactly how many there are because they 
list home addresses in the area when they enroll school officials 
say 
but theyre there and have been for years 
we just have to check to make sure their guardianship is in 
the hands of someone in our district said mike corzine 
assistant superintendent in the egyptian school district near tamms 
theres not a major number of them though corzine said in 
a recent interview 
gang violence drugs and overcrowding are among the reasons 
given for leaving city schools said don shaner guidance counselor 
at meridian high school in mounds 
but such problems are societal not schoolbred chicago 
board of education spokesman bob saigh said wednesday 
chicago like any other big city its got its share of 
problems he said but he added that the citys schools are 100 
percent safe i defy anybody to say theyre unsafe 
many of the imported students at local schools are carrying on a 
family tradition 
jerry richmond 15 is attending meridian like his older sister 
who graduated from there before going on to northwestern university 
at evanston 
its a lot friendlier here richmond said up there the 
teachers dont even know your name 
richmond began his freshman year last fall at evanston township 
high school in suburban chicago which has 4000 students some 
gang problems and a lot of drug traffic he said 
at midterm he transferred to the 320student meridian his 
parents sent him south more than 350 miles south to live with 
his grandparents so that he could attend a smaller quieter high 
school 
we do have gangs in the city of evanston there is no visible 
of gang problems at the school said william logan director of 
the safety department at evanston township high theres no doubt 
some kids are using drugs and selling them but its not rampant 
i think its a safe school for studets to come here and study 
if thats what they want to do logan said 
but richmonds story was not new to school administrators in 
southern illinois 
there has been a chicagotosouthern illinois school connection 
for at least 20 years said terry rueffer director of special 
programs in the century school district at ullin 
a lot of them even start when they are little shaner said 
most granny kids adapt readily to the new environment but it 
does take some adjustment 
richmonds schoolyear home of pulaski has a population of 500 
about oneeighth the student body at his hometown school 
theres not much to do he said of the village just north of 
cairo at the southern tip of the state 
my mom thought this would be a better place for me richmond 
said 
and with fewer distractions he said he can concentrate on 
another goal 
i just want to get into a good college

democrat paul simon says he is virtually 
certain that onetime presidential rival michael dukakis will be 
the nominee but he refuses to release his delegates in the 
unlikely event that michael dukakis stubs his toe between now and 
the convention 
the illinois senator who put his presidential campaign on hold 
a month ago said he would not surrender about 180 delegates 
committed to his campaign despite pressure to do so by supporters 
of jesse jackson 
chicago mayor eugene sawyer and some black lawmakers have urged 
simon to officially drop out of the presidential race they contend 
his continued presence hurts any chance jackson has of keeping the 
nomination away from dukakis 
im going to hold out until the california and new jersey 
primaries on june 7 and see whether i can still have an influence 
on the nomination simon said wednesday 
he said he was 95 percent certain that dukakis would win the 
nomination 
simon also ruled out a later bid for the white house and said he 
was focusing on a probable senate reelection bid 
im definitely getting back to my job as a senator said 
simon first elected to the senate in 1984 i took a year of my 
life to try and make a difference in this country and i think i 
accomplished that

injured astronauts and launch 
pad workers scrambled into escape baskets wednesday as they fled a 
mock fire and explosion during a space shuttle disaster drill 
for safety reasons they did not ride the baskets down long 
cables traveling instead by elevator to the ground then 
reentering the baskets to continue the exercise nasa said it will 
manrate the baskets before the next shuttle flight 
all seven participating astronauts and several other personnel 
received makebelieve injuries in the fourhour pad test two of 
the astronauts were among nine seriously injured people 
transported by helicopter to two hospitals that conducted their own 
emergency rehearsals 
the drill tested new safety procedures initiated since the 
inflight explosion of challenger and the loss of its seven crew 
members jan 28 1986 the shuttle fleet has been grounded since 
then and nasas top official administrator james c fletcher 
said tuesday that flights are not expected to resume before late 
august or september 
kathy thornton one of the astronauts taking part told a news 
conference later we felt it was really a good test we have to 
be prepared for a launch pad emergency and we very happy with the 
way the system worked today 
among new launch pad features tested wednesday were improved 
fire detection equipment more fireresistant material a new 
steelreinforced concrete underground bunker and a backup 
electrical relay line that flashes a warning to launch directors if 
a pad emergency occurs 
such an emergency took place shortly after the seven 
astronauts all trainees rode elevators to the 195foot level of 
launch pad 39b as if they were to board a shuttle on launch day 
although there was no shuttle on the pad they simulated entry 
into a spacecraft cabin about that time a smoke bomb was 
detonated on the pad and test director frank merlino ordered an 
evacuation 
with water spraying the area as it would in a real emergency 
the astronauts and the seven members of the spacecraft closeout 
crew donned oxygen masks and made their way to seven slidewire 
baskets at the cabin level of the pad 
firerescue workers rushed to the pad from a station a mile 
away as they fought a mock fire at the 175foot level a 
hydraulic explosion occurred and test observers declared five 
firefighters injured 
no one rode the escape baskets down 1200foot cables to the 
ground some officials believe the swift 50 mph trip and abrupt 
halt in netting at the bottom would be risky and should be 
attempted only in an actual emergency 
nasa has said it plans soon to test the baskets with human 
passengers 
they most seriously injured were transported in fireproof 
tanklike vehicles to a heliport for air delivery to florida 
hospital near orlando or to jess parrish memorial hospital in 
titusville 
astronauts participating wednesday were frank culbertson ken 
cameron carl meade david low thornton pierre thuot and jerome 
apt 
another emergency drill is scheduled friday to simulate a rescue 
of crew members from a shuttle that has crashlanded in a swamp 
near the shuttle landing runway

a new poll indicates twothirds of americans 
support making the district of columbia the nations 51st state 
leaders of the statehood movement said wednesday 
a telephone survey of 1011 households nationwide conducted in 
march by the opinion research corporation of princeton nj 
indicates that 66 percent of those contacted support making the 
nations capital a state an increase of 14 percentage points 
increase over a similar poll conducted a year ago 
we can proclaim today that the american people overwhelmingly 
support statehood for the nations capital said del walter 
fauntroy ddc who has introduced in the house of 
representatives a bill to establish the state of new columbia 
america now knows and cares that we achieve full citizenship 
results from the poll which carried a margin of error of 3 
percentage points also indicate that 83 percent of those surveyed 
believe residents of the district should have the same rights as 
citizens of the other 50 states 
fauntroys bill which was passed by the house district of 
columbia committee last year would create a state out of all 
nonfederal lands in the district give voting rights to a member 
of the house and two senators and establish a state government 
currently fauntroy is the only congressional representative for 
the 625000 residents of the nations capital and he cannot vote 
on the house floor 
the measure has 197 cosponsors and fauntroy said he was 
confident he will secure the 218 votes needed to assure house 
approval he said he hoped to bring the matter up for a vote 
before the fourth of july 
one former opponent rep roman mazzoli dky said wednesday 
that he has decided to support the bill after fauntroy agreed to 
study the possibility of eliminating the citys federal subsidy 
the district receives about 500 million of its 28 billion 
annual operating budget in direct federal subsidies and mazzoli 
and others have opposed creating a state that would receive federal 
money in such a way 
fauntroy who noted that 55 percent of all land in the nations 
capital is federally owned and thus off the tax rolls predicted 
that congressmen will understand the districts unique position

wendy davis hasnt slept well since leaving 
belize six years ago to come to the united states illegally but 
she expects that to change once she receives her papers under the 
federal amnesty program 
i had insomnia i worried at night that someone could come and 
take me away when my papers come im going to sleep at night 
said mrs davis one of thousands of illegal aliens who jammed 
immigration and naturalization service offices in south florida on 
wednesday the last day to apply for residency under the law 
the law permitted people who came to the united states illegally 
before jan 1 1982 and lived in this country continuously to 
apply for temporary resident status they later must apply for 
permanent status and can eventually apply for citizenship 
immigration officials expected up to 125000 aliens to apply in 
florida by wednesday morning 112000 had done so and 
applications were pouring in as the midnight deadline neared said 
richard smith deputy director of the miami ins office 
like mrs davis many said they waited until the last minute 
simply because they procrastinated lines were long at the ins 
office here but most of the waiting people were smiling 
they say this place is bad but its the best there is mrs 
davis said referring to us citizens who complain about their 
government 
but as an illegal alien i didnt have a life of my own 
control of my destiny said mrs davis 19 who married judd 
davis a chicago native last july 4 the newlyweds moved recently 
to miami beach which reminds her of belize city which she 
couldnt risk visiting as an illegal alien for fear of not being 
allowed back into the united states 
a sister and two brothers in belize keep writing asking me 
when im going to visit i wanted to go but i couldnt id say i 
was going soon as i get my papers she said beaming at the 
prospect of receiving a work permit next week and residency status 
this summer 
mrs davis mother a nurse moved illegally to the united 
states when her daughter was 3 almost 10 years later she sent for 
her children and friends smuggled three of them into the united 
states via mexico 
i went right through the border they just asked if we had 
fruits she said she lived in chicago with her mother who 
applied for amnesty tuesday and attended the kenwood academy there 
her husband who works at a miami beach apartment complex said 
his wifes easy entry compounded her immigration woes they say 
she couldnt have gotten through the border itd be easier if we 
said she swam across the rio grande 
the couple said they were advised it would be faster for her to 
receive a work permit by seeking amnesty rather than applying as a 
citizens spouse when the papers come through the davises plan to 
save up buy a home on miami beach and visit belize often

cincinnati voters approved a tax increase to 
repair streets and bridges but by such a thin margin that 
officials say they feel challenged to prove they will use the money 
effectively 
i think people are still saying that they are skeptics and we 
have to make them believe we will do the work we said we would 
said vice mayor peter strauss 
the measure received 27201 votes in favor or 503 percent to 
26920 or 497 percent 
it will increase cincinnatis earnings tax from 2 percent to 21 
percent effective july 1 the first increase in the payroll tax in 
16 years 
the tax is paid by everyone who works in the city everyone who 
lives in the city and works elsewhere and also by businesses on 
their net profits cincinnatis business community supported the 
increase while a homeowners group led by suburbanites fought it 
the increase is expected to generate 69 million in additional 
annual revenue to repair everything from deteriorating public 
buildings to potholes 
i think it indicates that people are very reluctant to raise 
taxes city manager scott johnson said of the close vote i 
dont think its people saying i looked up the street and i like 
what i see

michael dukakis underscored his standing as democratic 
presidential nomineeinwaiting on wednesday after his latest 
landslide primary victories even though jesse jackson said he 
would stay in the race because its not really over till its 
over 
republican george bush made light of astrology but noted a lot 
of voters believe in it 
there are two edges to this sword the vice president said 
as air force two carried him to california on a campaign swing 
at a news conference in boston dukakis said he welcomed 
jacksons continued candidacy so long as his rival would keep it 
positive and address issues 
the governors aides expressed irritation in recent days with 
jacksons barbed comments during the ohio and indiana campaigns 
although dukakis himself replied only indirectly 
dukakis savoring tuesdays lopsided primary victories in 
indiana and ohio picked up a handful of fresh democratic national 
convention delegates and arranged to receive the backing of half a 
dozen or more democratic governors later in the week perhaps 
including kentucky gov wallace wilkinson and louisianas buddy 
roemer both of whom earlier supported sen albert gore jr 
campaign aides said arkansas gov bill clinton was rounding up the 
support for dukakis 
pointing his attention toward the fall campaign dukakis also 
signed up veteran democratic warriors kirk odonnell and dick moe 
as advisers to his campaign 
jackson won support for his decision to stay in the race from 
bruce babbitt who dropped out last winter i think he should 
because he has something to offer and i think it makes it a little 
more interesting the former arizona governor said 
jackson spent the day in washington where he met with 
democratic house members and others after winning a landslide 
victory in the primary election in the nations capital 
in an interview with cbs he said he would remain a candidate 
after the primary season ends on june 7 and added i know 
what the boundaries are and i will respect those boundaries 
but he also appealed to party leaders to avoid flocking to 
dukakis side until after the primary season ends 
if super delegates wait until after june 8 they are in a 
better position as judges to help bring balance rather than using 
party machinery to parcel out delegates before the primaries end 
he said in a reference to 645 delegates to the democratic national 
convention who are party leaders and not elected by voters in 
primaries and caucuses 
campaign dropout paul simon said he was 95 percent certain 
that dukakis would win the democratic nomination but he said he 
would hold onto his 184 delegates to wield influence in the 
unlikely event that michael dukakis stubs his toe between now and 
the convention 
im going to hold out until the california and new jersey 
primaries on june 7 and see whether i can still have an influence 
on the nomination said simon 
dukakis has roughly 1500 delegatges in the associated press 
count out of 2081 needed to win the nomination he leads jackson 
by more than 600 
bush amassed the delegates needed to assure his republican 
nomination a week ago in pennsylvanias primary but he kept up a 
heavy schedule of campaigning with his trip to the west coast 
he told california reporters he has not yet begun selecting his 
vice presidential running mate he praised californias gop 
governor george deukmejian lavishly and said he would 
absolutely not rule him out for his ticket 
in a conversation with reporters en route he was asked about 
the reported statement in former white house chief of staff donald 
regans soontobe published book that first lady nancy reagan 
consulted astrologers about the timing of presidential events the 
president says he has never based any policy or decision on 
astrological forecasts but does not deny consulting the writings 
of astrologers 
bush referred in a joking manner to the disclosure telling 
reporters he hadnt checked his horoscope before leaving washington 
but then added that he and his wife were both geminis 
asked about the assertion that the reagans relied on the 
position of the sun and moon and stars to make decisions bush 
said i dont know about that but ill tell you one thing there 
are two edges to this sword 
there are a helluva lot of people across this country that 
read these columns otherwise they wouldnt be in the papers 
bush brushed aside a claim by astrologer joyce jillson that she 
helped reagans aides select his running mate in 1980 he said he 
never heard of her but then joked 
ill work closely with her shes brilliant

tradition calls for the first atlantic 
salmon hooked in maines penobscot river to be presented to the

i understand he ate it the very same day the salmon was 
caught sunday said fisheries spokesman paul fournier now its

gov john r mckernan jr is planning to be there along with 
members of maines congressional delegation 
the tradition started in 1912 when a salmon caught at the 
bangor pool a fishing area on the penobscot was presented to 
president william howard taft 
the tradition continued through seven more presidencies but 
pollution and dams put an end to atlantic salmon runs and forced 
the tradition to be suspended during harry s trumans 
administration 
after years of cleanup efforts the atlantic searun salmon 
returned to the penobscot and the tradition was revived by the 
reagan white house in 1982 
not all salmon fishermen vie for the privilege of giving up 
their fish in the eddington salmon club along the penobscot a 
member posted a sign that says he already paid several thousand 
dollars in taxes and doesnt want to pay any more said j

george bush a gemini made light of 
reports of astrological influence at the white house on thursday 
but suggested the issue was a twoedged sword because a large 
number of americans believe in the practice 
the vice president also hinted jokingly that an astrologer 
claiming to have helped pick him as ronald reagans running mate in 
1980 might be a useful member of his cabinet 
on another subject bush told reporters in california he would 
absolutely not rule out the states governor george 
deukmejian as a possible running mate 
bush sharing the platform with the republican governor at a 
news conference reiterated an earlier assertion that he would not 
even begin to consider the selection process until after the 
democratic convention in july 
still bush said of deukmejian the respect i have for this 
governor has no limitation 
on the subject of astrology bush said i know it is a 
fascinating titillating subject for all with particular emphasis 
on the journalistic community 
a spokesman steve hart said the vice president who has a lock 
on the 1988 republican presidential nomination does not consult 
astrologers or horoscopes or anything of the kind he doesnt even 
know where the horoscope is in the newspaper 
speaking to reporters on air force ii bush said he had not 
checked his horoscope before beginning his threeday campaign swing 
through the west 
however if youre interested were both geminis bush 
said referring to himself and his wife barbara both born in june 
bushs jocular retort matched the lighthearted manner in which 
other administration officials have responded to disclosures 
earlier this week of first lady nancy reagans interest in 
astrology 
the disclosures are contained in an upcoming book by former 
white house chief of staff donald t regan 
bush who in the past has voiced disdain for kissandtell 
books by former administration officials said it was hard to 
respond to regans specific allegations since the book hasnt been 
published yet 
i dont think anyone knows what the charge the allegation 
is he said 
on wednesday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater confirmed 
that mrs reagan had consulted an astrologer on the presidents 
plans for travel and scheduling however president reagan denied 
that any of his decisions as president had been influenced by 
astrology 
asked about the disclosures on astrology and presidential 
scheduling bush said i dont know about that but ill tell you 
one thing there are two edges to this sword 
there are a helluva lot of people across this country that 
read these columns otherwise they wouldnt be in the papers 
asked about joyce jillson a los angeles astrologer who contends 
she advised reagan campaign aides to select bush as a running mate 
in 1980 bush said he had never heard of her 
but he joked ill likely work closely with her shes 
brilliant 
then pretending he didnt quite get the name bush deadpanned 
joyce jillson secretary of what 
bush spoke en route from washington to sacramento he planned to 
spend the next three days campaigning in the west with events 
scheduled for california idaho and montana as well as nebraska 
peter teeley campaign press secretary said bush planned two 
additional trips to the west coast between now and the june 7 
california primary 
we cant ignore the west teeley said even though bush 
clinched the gop nomination a week ago by piling up more than the 
1139 delegates needed at the party convention this august in new 
orleans 
weve got organizations in place and people on the ground that 
have been working for us youve got to keep those troops 
energized teeley said in washington in advance of bushs 
departure

sida si tiene alguna pregunta llame a su banco de sangre 
que clase de comportamiento lo pone a usted en riesgo 
usted tiene el riesgo de resultar infectado con el virus del 
sida si usted tiene relaciones sexuales con alguien que este 
infectado 
ya que usted no puede estar seguro de que alguien este 
infectado el riesgo de estar en contacto con el virus aumenta con 
el numero de companeros sexuales que usted tenga 
cualquier intercambio de sangre semen o fluidos vaginales 
infectados puede transmitir el virus y ponerlo a usted frente a un 
gran riesgo 
los siguientes comportamientos constituyen un riesgo cuando se 
practican con una persona infectada usted no puede saber a simple 
vista si una persona esta infectada 
comportamiento arriesgado 
compartir agujas y jeringas para inyectarse drogas 
contacto sexual anal con o sin condon contacto vaginal u oral 
con una persona infectada o con alquien ue se inyecte drogas o

tener relaciones sexuales con una sola persona que no este 
infectada y ser mutuamente fieles 
no inyectarse drogas 
y hablando de citas 
tener citas y concoer a otras personas es algo normal en la 
vida tener una cita no es lo mismo que tener relaciones sexuales 
el contacto sexual como parte de una cita puede ser arriesgado 
uno de los riesgos es el sida aids 
como puede usted saber si la persona con la que usted esta 
saliendo o le gustaria salir ha estado expuesta al virus del sida 
lo malo es que usted no puede saberlo pero lo bueno es que 
mientras evite las relaciones sexuales y no comparta las agujas 
para inyectarse las drogas no importa 
usted debe tener mucho cuidado con la persona con quien usted 
tenga relaciones sexuales haciendo su propia decision sobre la 
persona basandose en su buen juicio esto puede ser muy dificil 
ha tenido esta persona alguna enfermedad sexualmente 
transmisible con cuanta gente ha tenido relaciones sexuales ha 
experimentado con drogas 
todas estas preguntas son delicadas pero importantes pero 
usted tiene la responsabilidad personal de preguntar 
pienselo de esta manera si usted conoce a alguien lo suficiente 
como para tener relaciones sexuales entonces usted deberia hablar 
francamente del sida si alguien se niega a hablar del sida usted 
no deberia tener relaciones sexuales con esa persona 
pueden las personas casadas adquirir el sida 
las personas casadas que no estan infectadas que son fieles y 
que no se inyectan drogas no tienen ningun riesgo pero si siguen 
un comportamiento arriesgado vea la pagina 3 ellos podrian 
infectarse con el virus del sida e infectar a su pareja si usted 
cree que su conyuge pudiera estar poniendole en una situacion 
arriesgada hable con el o ella es su vida 
por que se habla tanto de los condones 
no hace mucho tiemo los condones hule la gomita o 
preservativo eran cosas de las que no hablabamos mucho 
ahora esto se discute en las noticias de la television o en la 
primer aplana de su periodico y los condones se exhiben libremente 
en su farmacia local supermercado o tienda 
para aquellos sexualmente activos que no limitan su actividad a 
una sola pareja se ha demostrado que el uso de los conones ayuda a 
prevenir la diseminacion de enfermedades sexualmente transmisibles 
por eso se recomienda el uso de los condones para ayudar a reducir 
la transmision del sida 
el uso de los condones es la mejor medida preventiva contra el 
sida fuera de no tener relaciones sexuales y de practicar un 
compartamiento seguro vea la pagina 3 
pero los condones no son absolutamente seguros usted debe de 
usarlos apropiadamente y usted debe usarlos cada vez que tenga 
relaciones sexuales desde el principio hasta el final si usted 
usa un condon debe seguir las siguientes recomendaciones 
1 use condones hechos de latex ya que el latex sirve como una 
barrera para el virus los condones lambskin o natural 
membrane no son tan buenos por los poros en el material busque 
la palabra latex en el empaque 
2 un condon con un espermicida puede proporcionarle proteccion 
adicional se ha demostrado en pruebas de laboratorio que los 
espericidas matan el virus del sida use el espermicida en el 
interior de la punta y en el exterior del condon 
3 el uso del condon es mas seguro con un lubricante revise la 
lista de ingredientes en la parte posterior del empaque del 
lubricante para estar seguro de que tenga base de agua 
waterbased no use lubricantes con base de petroleo cold cream 
aceite para bebes o manteca vegetal para cocinar estos pueden 
debilitar el condon y ser la causa de que se rompa 
como luce una persona con sida 
es muy importante que todos entiendan que una persona puede 
estar infectada con el virus del sida aids y no mostrar ningun 
sintoma 
es posible estar infectado por anos sentirse bien lucir bien y 
no tener manera de saber que usted esta infectado a menos que a 
usted le hagan una prueba para el virus del sida 
este periodo en que uno esta infectado sin saberlo es una de las 
cosas que mas preocupan del sida durante este periodo sin 
embargo las personas infectadas con el virus del sida pueden 
transmitir el virus a sus companeros sexuales y a la gente con 
quien comparten las agujas para inyectarse drogas las madres 
infectadas pueden transmitirlo a sus hijos durante el embarazo o 
durante el parto 
una vez que se presentan los sintromas estos son similares a 
los de algunas otras enfermedades mientras la enfermedad progresa 
los sintomas se vuelven mas serios porque el virus del sida no 
permite a las defensas naturales de su cuerpo funcionar 
correctamente 
si a usted le precoupa seriamente la posibilidad de estar 
infectado usted tiene que pensar que su comportamiento puede 
afectar a otros si usted cree que deberia hacerse una prueba de

pope john paul ii on wednesday named the 
largest delegation of roman catholic clergymen ever to visit the 
soviet union as representatives at a major religious celebration 
next month 
the highlevel group of 13 includes 10 cardinals among them 
john oconnor of new york and cardinal agostino casaroli the no 2 
man in the vatican hierarchy after the pope 
john paul has often expressed the desire to visit the soviet 
union but the vatican earlier disclosed that the invitation from 
the russian orthodox church did not extend to the pope 
the vatican officials and bishops from various parts of the 
world will be attending the celebrations marking the millenium of 
christianitys arrival in what is now the soviet union 
although the invitation was in the name of the orthodox church 
the naming of such a toplevel delegation clearly demonstrates an 
attempt by john paul to improve relations with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the vatican in announcing the names said john paul attaches 
great importance to the event and hopes it will open new paths 
toward reconciliation peace and justice of which humanity has so 
much need 
in addition to casaroli the vatican delegation includes 
cardinal johannes willebrands a dutchman who heads the secretariat 
for christian unity and cardinal roger etchegaray the french 
president of the justice and peace commission 
the delegation also includes cardinals joseph marie trinh van 
can of hanoi jozef glemp roman catholic primate of poland 
julijans vaivods of latvia oconnor of new york friedrich wetter 
of munich franz koenig retired archbishop of vienna and carlo 
martini of milan 
it also includes archbishop laszlo paskai of hungary bishop 
dario castrillon hoyos of colombia head of the latin american 
bishops conference and bishop gabriel gonsum ganaka of nigeria 
representing africa 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said the delegation was not 
only the largest group of roman catholic prelates to visit the 
soviet union but was also the first vatican delegation ever to get 
a formal invitation although casaroli and other churchmen have 
visited individually in the past 
navarro could not recall such a large church delegation ever 
attending a single event anywhere 
the vatican said that while casaroli and etchegary would only 
attend the main celebration in moscow willebrands would represent 
the holy see at all events 
the pope has said often that he would travel to the soviet union 
only if he could visit his flock throughout the country 
specifically the ukraine lithuania latvia byelorussia and 
kazakhastan

the nuclear regulatory commission voted 40 
wednesday to propose a rules change that would allow the seabrook 
nh reactor to obtain a lowpower operating license without a 
siren system to warn nearby massachusetts residents in an emergency 
the proposal which will be subject to a 30day public comment 
period before a final nrc vote would apply to any plants seeking a 
5 percent power license but was aimed at seabrook 
in february the atomic safety and licensing appeal board 
blocked a lowpower permit for seabrook because there was no siren 
system in place for the six massachusetts communities that fall 
within a 10mile evacuation zone around the southern new hampshire 
plant 
the rules change would allow seabrook owners to obtain the 
lowpower license and go ahead with testing while trying to get 
approval of an alternate siren system an approved warning system 
would still be necessary to obtain a fullpower license 
new hampshire yankee the plants operator was forced to remove 
its massachusetts sirens last year after a federal appeals court 
sided with local officials state and local officials led by 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis believe no evacuation system 
can adequately protect nearby residents and are fighting to block 
the plants opening 
the companys new alert plan includes truckmounted sirens and 
sirenequipped helicopters as a backup 
critics say the license issue has grown more critical for 
seabrook owners fearing the beleaguered reactor will never be 
approved if dukakis is elected president 
the idle 54 billion plant is losing 50 million each month in 
maintenance and finance costs plant officials say 
current nrc rules do not specify offsite safety requirements to 
obtain a lowpower license but a 1982 commission explanation 
of the rules does the rules have been widely interpreted to 
require an offsite alert system such as sirens for lowpower 
licensing 
the nrc staff in recommending the rules change cited the low 
risk involved in lowpower testing 
but critics led by rep edward j markey dmass complain that 
the risk has not changed since 1982 and therefore there is no 
legitimate reason to change the regulations 
in new hampshire seabrook spokesman rob williams applauded the 
nrc decision saying it correctly addresses the very low risk of 
lowpower operation 
commissioner fred bernthal did not vote because he is leaving 
the nrc soon for a state department post said commission spokesman 
robert newlin

a man who owns a tropical fish business was 
arrested wednesday and accused of smuggling 700 baby boa 
constrictors into the united states from colombia authorities said 
the snakes which are a protected species in colombia were 
concealed in five boxes that were part of an otherwiselegal 
shipment of fish that arrived march 7 at kennedy international 
airport us attorney andrew j maloney said 
the snakes 21 inches long were discovered during an inspection 
by agents of the us fish and wildlife service at the airport 
the shipment was addressed to agremiro espana 43 of queens 
who owns miro espana co a wholesale tropical fish business he 
was charged with violating the federal lacey act which outlaws the 
interstate or foreign transportation of illegally captured wildlife 
the charge carries a maximum sentence upon conviction of five 
years in jail and a 250000 fine 
under colombian law it is illegal to export boa constrictors 
said john meehan a special agent with the wildlife service 
the snakes are a protected species under the convention on 
international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora 
a treaty to which the united states is a party 
all but 38 have been returned to their natural habitat in 
colombia said meehan the rest will be used in the prosecution of 
the case and may eventually be given to american zoos 
the snakes were all newborns meehan said 
he said baby boas can be bought in south america for about 5 
and resold in the united states for as much as 200 adult boa 
constrictors which grow up to 15 feet in length bring much higher 
prices 
meehan said boa constrictors are very popular among amateur 
herpetologists because of their docile temperament and because they 
are increasingly difficult to obtain

a series of explosions at a space shuttle 
fuel plant rocked this southern nevada city wednesday destroying 
the facility and a marshmallow plant killing at least one person 
injuring 96 and leaving scores of others missing 
flames and orange smoke rose 100 feet into the sky and buildings 
shook 10 miles away in las vegas after the midday explosions at the 
pacific engineering amp production co of nevada the plant 
manufactures ammonium perchlorate an oxidizer used in fuel for the 
shuttles solid rocket boosters but nasa said the accident was not 
expected to delay resumption of shuttle flights 
what we see is pretty much total devastation said fred 
gibson an executive at the plant 
all roads to henderson a town of 25000 midway between las 
vegas and hoover dam were closed because of concern that toxic 
gases might escape 
at the command post near the blast site clark county fire 
spokesman mark hector said at least one person had been killed 
emergency workers were forced to stand by for fear of additional 
explosions state records showed 125 people worked at pacific while 
the nextdoor kid marshmallow plant employed 85 but few employees 
of either plant had been seen at hospitals authorities said 
there are people out there who are probably dying said 
janet smith a spokeswoman for mercy ambulance in las vegas whose 
company dispatched ambulances to the site this is going to be a 
daylong and nightlong event because no fire unit has been out there 
people are out there on the desert wandering aimlessly if 
they were lucky enough to have escaped she said 
david coats administrator of saint rose de lima hospital said 
96 injured people had been brought in he said most of the injuries 
were minor but at least three were critical 
gibson asked if toxic products could have leaked said the 
plants ammonia tanks could not be seen we cant tell at the 
moment whether these tanks are secure 
one of our pieces of equipment malfunctioned and caught on 
fire the fire spread quickly and there was an explosion gibson 
said at least two blasts followed the main blast within seconds 
he said the smoke was so thick he couldnt see if any of 
pacifics buildings were still standing i suspect there are 
none gibson said 
emergency workers warned residents away from the area as smoke 
billowed across the entire las vegas valley all schools in the 
area were evacuated and closed for the day united blood services 
of las vegas made an emergency appeal for contributions to help 
victims and hospital workers were called in or put on standby 
throughout the area 
one victim with an open skull fracture was being flown by 
helicopter to valley hospital in las vegas said tina ashcraft 
life flight helicopter dispatcher 
our windows blew out it blew the frame off the door we are 
probably five or six miles away the thing is on fire said lee 
hall secretary at the henderson convalescent hospital 
ms hall said hospital officials were checking for injured 
patients and employees a window blew up in somebodys face 
she said 
several people injured in the blast were taken to nearby saint 
rose de lima hospital where the explosion also shattered windows 
hospital spokeswoman marcia hawkins said 
ms hawkins said many patients were cut and bruised 
the windows blew the workers are helping the patients ms 
hawkins said its near here and all we can see is the black 
cloud of smoke 
in las vegas buildings shook and a huge plume of smoke was 
visible in the air people leaving offices for the noon hour stood 
on the streets gawking at the smoke 
a worker at hoover dam bob baker said he was deep inside the 
dam when the blast rattled windows at the power plant in the belly 
of the facility he did not feel the dam itself shake 
jay herman an engineer who was less than two miles from the 
plant site said he heard three blasts the first worse than any 
sonic boom i thought it was a plane crash but there was too much 
smoke 
he said the second blast five minutes later almost knocked us 
over and when the third hit he crawled under a desk i thought 
it was a nuclear bomb 
nasa said in washington that pacific engineering provides the 
ammonium perchlorate to morton thiokol nasas prime contractor for 
the motors as well as to some department of defense programs 
don amitor a spokesman for nasas marshall space flight center 
in huntsville ala said mortonthiokol had enough ammonium 
perchlorate in supply for the next five shuttle launches under the 
present schedule the fifth launch would be in mid1989 
amidor said a kerrmcgee plant also in henderson is capable of 
making enough ammonium perchlorate for boosters to support eight 
space shuttle flights a year

president reagan abandoning his harsh criticism 
of the kremlin credited the soviet union on wednesday with making 
progress on human rights and said gradual improvements were better 
than no change at all 
striking a conciliatory tone in a presummit address reagan 
readily acknowledged that the united states has its own problems 
with homelessness racial discrimination and unemployment as 
moscow has charged 
reagans remarks appeared intended to soothe soviet anger about 
his demand for the kremlin to tear down a wall of oppression 
and his claim that the soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan was 
being made under pressure 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev told secretary of state 
george p shultz in moscow last month he was tired of reagans 
sermons and the soviet government accused washington of imperial 
arrogance 
in his remarks to a chicago group reagan went out of his way to 
credit gorbachev with loosening restrictions on religion freedom 
of speech and emigration 
we applaud the changes that have taken place and encourage the 
soviets to go farther reagan said we recognize that changes 
occur slowly but that is better than no change at all 
in a brief question and answer session with the audience reagan 
said he was willing to give gorbachev the benefit of the doubt 
up to a point that the soviet leader sincerely wants to achieve 
the program of economic and social reforms known as glasnost 
the president said he believed gorbachev was pursuing the 
reforms because of economic problems in the soviet union 
reagan said he hoped he could offer gorbachev at this months 
ussoviet summit some suggestions as to how he could move ahead 
with glasnost 
that i think is preferable to staging a kind of contest with 
him so that someone looks like a winner or loser reagan said 
he also expressed a dream to rid the world of nuclear 
weapons he compared the danger of nuclear weapons with a 
hypothetical situation in which the world was threatened by a power 
from outer space 
wouldnt we all of a sudden find that we didnt have any 
differences between us at all we were all human beings citizens 
of the world and wouldnt we come together to fight that 
particular threat reagan said 
reagans speech was part of a series of addresses intended to 
frame the issues he will highlight at the summit in moscow with 
gorbachev may 29june 2 his audience was the national strategy 
forum a nonpartisan organization that sponsors educational 
programs on national security and foreign policy issues 
the president said the soviets have had limited successes in 
improving their economy 
i do not bring this up simply for the sake of sounding 
critical reagan said he said he mentioned it because of a 
development of tremendous significance in recent months that 
the soviets themselves are beginning to talk about shortages in 
their country 
on human rights reagan said some 300 political and religious 
prisoners had been released from labor camps over the last three 
years and that the incarceration of dissidents in mental hospitals 
and prisons had slowed and in some cases stopped 
and while the press remains tightly controlled by the 
communist party and the state weve seen the publication of 
stories on topics that used to be forbidden topics like crime 
drug addiction corruption even police brutality the president 
said 
these changes are limited and the basic standards contained in 
the helsinki accords still are not being met reagan added 
underscoring his theme reagan said we welcome the human 
rights progress the soviets have made and believe there is good 
reason to hope for still more 
reagan said there is no guarantee that the progress is 
permanent he said the late soviet leader nikita s khrushchev 
loosened things up a bit but that it was reversed later 
and for the nearly three decades until our own day oppression 
and stagnation once again became the determining characteristics of 
soviet life reagan said 
and just as previous hopeful moments in soviet history ended 
all too soon so too glasnost todays new candor will 
succeed if the soviets take steps to make it permanent to 
institutionalize it he said 
asked by reporters about the softened tone of reagans rhetoric 
white house communications director tom griscom said the speech was 
different because the topic was different such as human rights 
versus regional issues 
is there anything wrong with saying since 1985 weve seen 
things that are positive and we hope to see more he said 
in an april 21 speech in springfield mass reagan said two 
of the most basic rights that we have called on the soviets to 
comply with are the right to emigrate and the right to travel how 
can we help but doubt a government that mistrusts its own people 
and holds them against their will 
in the new spirit of openness why doesnt the soviet 
government issue passports to its citizens i think this would 
dramatically improve ussoviet relations 
the speech led to gorbachevs complaint to shultz about us 
sermonizing

for six years richard mckeand went on with 
his life thinking an appeals court had cleared him of an armed 
robbery conviction 
but recently an arrest warrant with his name on it surfaced and 
now he is in jail awaiting transfer to serve a fiveyear prison 
term for robbing a convenience store a decade ago 
as it turns out the appellate court had rejected his appeal and 
the paperwork apparently got lost 
part of the confusion likely resulted from the death of his 
attorney former texas house speaker price daniel jr who was shot 
and killed a few months after mckeands trial then daniels 
assistant in the case frank hughes relocated 
mckeand 29 who was arrested last week had made no attempt to 
hide he had continued to list his number in the telephone book 
while working as an oil rigger 
everybody knows what he did was wrong said his 
sisterinlaw rayleene mckeand 24 but the courts should have 
taken care of it right then before hed built a new life everybody 
changes after 10 years 
i remember he was very young and didnt have a record he 
wasnt a bigtime bandit said state district judge carroll 
wilborn jr who prosecuted mckeand 
mckeand and another teenager thomas williard reeves used a 
shotgun to rob a convenience store of 100 on july 2 1978 they 
were pulled over by police 1 hours later confessed and turned 
over the money and weapon 
reeves who agreed to a threeyear sentence in a plea bargain 
and testified against mckeand was released from prison in 1981 
after serving 11 months 
mckeands mother betty mckeand said some community business 
leaders have offered to write a letter asking that her son be 
pardoned or paroled 
she said her sons attorneys had not told him that the appeal of 
the 1979 conviction had been denied in 1982 and a warrant had been 
issued for his arrest 
she said her son now has an acre or so of land with a mobile 
home and recently bought a truck mckeand married with a 
5yearold son separated from his wife this year after seven 
years he was looking forward to his son visiting him during the 
summer his mother said 
court records show an arrest warrant was issued oct 6 1982 
the warrant was later returned unserved from the sheriffs office 
these things sometimes happen said sheriff ce chuck 
morris we handle about 100 warrants per month theres a 
horrendous workload i dont know whether a secretary misplaced it 
or what 
the appellate court was reviewing its records last month and 
noticed it had never been notified about mckeands arrest it sent 
a letter to the district clerk the error was discovered and a new 
warrant issued

word that city funds will be withheld from 
the cinco de mayo parade if presidential candidate jesse jackson is 
its grand marshal has angered a parade organizer 
chief administrative officer rudy nothenberg recently notified 
the mission economic and cultural association that it would not be 
reimbursed for parade expenses on grounds that taxpayers money 
shouldnt be used for such explicitly political purposes as an 
appearance by jackson 
jackson is a candidate in californias democratic primary on 
june 7 
association director roberto hernandez said withholding the city 
money could cost the group 14000 and would be hypocritical 
because politicians such as mayor then assemblyman art agnos 
former mayor dianne feinstein state sen milton marks and other 
politicians have participated in the parade some as grand marshal 
but nothenberg responded that public officials who have joined 
the cinco de mayo festivities were city or state officeholders at 
the time 
theyre incumbents he said he jackson is a candidate 
the issue is very clear this is a partisan political event we 
do not allow city money to be used for political events

this year the head of the virginia republican party said wednesday 
north who has been indicted on charges of trying to defraud the 
government in the irancontra scheme has remained silent on a move 
to draft him as the state gops senate nominee 
but if north intends to seek the seat of republican sen paul s 
trible jr who is not running for reelection he needs to declare 
soon says state gop chairman donald w huffman of roanoke 
itll be tough unless they actually get north to say im 
running huffman said of the draft effort even then he said 
norths indictment would pose a major obstacle to winning the 
nomination 
tim phares an organizer of the draftnorth movement said north 
may have sent a signal about political plans in a commencement 
speech monday at the rev jerry falwells liberty university when 
he talked about finding good candidates for office 
obviously we cant read his mind but thats how we interpret

understanding of the importance of the west 
thirteen lawmakers from seven western states attended the

addressed the key issues very well he laid out a specific agenda 
addressing our concerns and seemed to understand that a western

frank lorenzo chairman of texas air corp 
said wednesday the turmoil surrounding eastern airlines continues 
to ravage the financial performance of the air carrier with 
losses expected through the first half of this year 
lorenzo in remarks to the international aviation club said 
eastern a texas air subsidiary will post continuing losses during 
the second quarter 
he blamed it in part on the airline unions campaign against 
eastern the refusal by the machinists union to agree to 
concessions and the series of government investigations of the 
miamibased airline which has been in the center of labor turmoil 
for years 
the present environment is having a serious impact on eastern 
it continues to ravage the financial results and the future of this 
great airline lorenzo said 
currently we are looking at very sizable and continuing losses 
in the second quarter because of all the activities that are taking 
place and their impact on travelers 
eastern has not made public its financial results for the first 
quarter of 1988 although texas air officials have made clear that 
the carrier lost money last year eastern lost 1816 million 
including a staggering 143 million in losses during the fourth 
quarter 
easterns president philip bakes several weeks ago 
acknowledged that the airline was losing some bookings because of 
the recently announced federal aviation administration 
investigations into the carriers safety procedures and its labor 
battles 
lorenzo said wednesday that he welcomed the faa investigation 
and said he anticipates it will put into perspective the 
misinformation and nonsense thats been peddled to the media the 
faa and congress by easterns unions 
last month the faa announced it was seeking 823000 in 
penalties from eastern for past safety violations and that it was 
beginning a planebyplane inspection of the carrier 
faa administrator allan mcartor told reporters wednesday that 
the eastern inspections are expected to be complete in about a 
week he said inspectors continue to uncover some infractions 
requiring corrective action in 7 percent to 8 percent of the planes 
checked 
mcartor said that while in many of those cases the planes had to 
be taken out of service briefly he did not consider the percentage 
of infractions unusually high 
lorenzo characterized the problems found by the faa inspectors 
so far as minor and said they likely would have been discovered by 
airline employees had the government inspectors not been present

medical health and education groups hailed 
the governments new aids booklet wednesday as clear direct and 
compassionate and said it should be required reading for all 
americans 
the pamphlet understanding aids was developed by the 
public health service under orders from congress and will be sent 
to every household with a mailing address on may 26 
despite some grumbling over the length of time it took to 
produce the eightpage pamphlet there was almost unanimous praise 
for its content 
this pamphlet should be required reading for every american 
citizen the american hospital association said in a statement 
everyone who reads this mailer will understand the disease 
better and i hope this understanding will lead to urgency and 
compassion and replace panic and fear rep henry waxman 
dcalif said in a statement headlined at long last 
information 
waxman chairman of the house energy and commerce health 
subcommittee said the booklet comes years after any reasonable 
american would have expected it and two years later than similar 
efforts by other nations such as britain 
he said it took two acts of congress to pry the information 
loose from what he termed white house censors congress 
expressly prohibited the booklet receiving clearance from anyone 
outside hhs 
the pamphlet says people cannot get aids from casual contact 
such as kisses mosquito bites sweat tears clothes telephones 
or toilet seats it also describes explicitly how the aids virus 
enters the body and what can be done to minimize risk including 
instructions on the correct use of condoms 
amid the chorus of approval rep william dannemeyer rcalif 
disputed the booklets assertions and said it would mislead the 
public 
you get the impression that none of us have anything to fear 
from associating with people who have the virus arc aidsrelated 
complex or aids nothing could be further from the truth 
dannemeyer said the report should not go out to the american 
people 
asked why americans should listen to him rather than the battery 
of scientists doctors and others endorsing the pamphlet 
dannemeyer said public health officials have exercised questionable 
judgment so far in handling the aids crisis he said they havent 
shut down homosexual bathhouses or required that infected 
individuals be reported to authorities by name among other things 
and said president reagan had been poorly served by his health 
appointees 
but dannemeyer was a lonely voice of protest the pamphlet won 
praise from a diverse range of interest groups ranging from gay 
organizations to the american medical association labor unions to 
the american red cross 
jeff levi executive director of the national gay and lesbian 
task force called the booklet long overdue and generally a very 
positive step it is compassionate accurate straightforward and 
nonjudgmental the strong statements about casual contact are 
particularly important 
scott d thomson executive director of the national association 
of secondary school principals said the booklet is highly 
readable for youth and will help families discuss aids in a 
candid yet friendly framework 
the material is specific and may offend some people said 
elizabeth whelan executive director of the american council on 
science and health but in dealing with matters of life and 
death sensibilities should not dictate educational efforts aimed 
at prevention she said 
in addition to being mailed to all american households the aids 
booklet will be available at planned parenthood clinics and other 
facilities 
faye wattleton president of planned parenthood called the 
pamphlet a frank and thorough guide that her group is happy to 
distribute we are pleased and relieved that this nation is 
finally acknowledging that the aids epidemic is a health issue not 
a moral issue she said in a statement

actress lynda carter teamed up with medical 
experts wednesday to call for medicare coverage of mammogram 
screening tests to detect breast cancer in older women 
although i am a professional actress and entertainer i speak 
to you today not as a public figure but as a private person a 
woman who has many female family members and friends for whom 
breast cancer remains an everpresent threat and concern ms 
carter told a house appropriations subcommittee 
mammography can pick up many breast cancers when theyre very 
small even before they can be felt ms carter said but for 
economic reasons mammography isnt accessible to many of the women 
who need it 
she said that making the tests more readily available makes 
sense for financial as well as humanitarian reasons because 
early detection of breast cancers avoids the high costs to treat 
cancers discovered later 
all of us can help in our own way to bring about this needed 
change she said all of us have a stake in making it happen 
because we are women or because the lives of women important to us 
are affected by the issue 
ms carter appeared alongside dr marvin a rich president and 
director of amc research center in denver before the subcommittee 
on labor health and human services and education and related 
agencies 
rich said medicare most medicaid programs and the majority of 
private insurers do not pay for routine screening mammograms only 
for tests that are performed after symptoms of breast cancer have 
appeared 
he said the cost of the test averaging at least 100 is a 
significant deterrent to utilization of mammography by many of the 
women who need it 
because 40 percent of all breast cancers occur in women over age 
65 and the risk of breast cancer climbs 15 percent for every five 
years of age after 65 it is essential that women in the 
medicareage population receive annual screening mammograms to 
detect tumors in the early most treatable stage he said

two congressmen moved wednesday to protect a 
historic civil war battlefield introducing legislation for the 
federal government to purchase the land next to the battle site in 
order to block a planned shopping center 
the bill authored by reps robert mrazek dny and michael 
andrews dtexas would direct the interior department to purchase 
from a developer a 600acre plot of land adjacent to the manassas 
national battlefield park where two important civil war battles 
were fought 
the congressmen who are civil war buffs say plans for a 12 
million squarefoot shopping center would violate the battlefield 
site 
weve come to this conclusion because both of us feel theres 
no other choice said andrews both of us are convinced that 
the local developers and politicians intend to build the shopping 
mall 
the landpurchase bill comes a week after mrazek attached 
language to a house appropriations panel supplemental spending bill 
that would block any federal highway money for road improvements 
associated with the shopping complex 
the 3800acre manassas battlefield about 27 miles west of 
washington was the site of the first significant land battle of 
the civil war in 1861 
in a second threeday battle in 1862 24000 union and 
confederate casualties were recorded as union forces that had been 
as far south as richmond 60 days earlier were pushed back into the 
nations capital 
the battles known in the north as the battles of bull run and 
in the south as the battles of manassas helped convince union 
officials that the war would be a protracted affair 
developers originally sought to build the shopping center on a 
plot of land where historians say confederate gen robert e lee 
had his battle headquarters but have met with opposition from 
local preservationists 
last thursday hazelpeterson companies agreed to move the 
complex a short distance away at the suggestion of interior 
department and national park service officials 
mrazek and andrews rejected that move 
i dont think that compromise is what were looking for at the 
battlefield said mrazek who noted that the developer has 
upgraded plans for the development several times i dont think 
the property ought to be desecrated and thats what we view it 
as 
the landpurchase bill will be referred to the house interior 
committee 
rep french slaughter rva whose district includes the 
battlefield site has not yet studied the landpurchase bill but 
would support a move to reroute roads now running through the 
battlefield he said 
interior department officials were unavailable for comment on 
the latest proposal 
in addition to asking the federal government to use its right of 
eminent domain to acquire the land andrews a member of the house 
ways and means committee said he will ask his panel to reexamine 
tax breaks given to developers building near national park sites 
the question is are we really going to protect the buffer 
zones around national parks andrews asked this is an 
egregious example of where developers have been invited in by the 
local politicians 
andrews said he hoped to move the bill out of committee and onto 
the house floor by july

an attorney for a woman who got aids during a 1983 
transfusion charged wednesday that the blood bank that supplied the 
tainted blood neglected to take adequate precautions against the 
deadly disease 
susie quintanas lawsuit against a blood bank and two doctors 
opened wednesday before a sixperson jury in denver district court 
similar suits have been filed but lawyers said this may be the 
first case in the nation in which a jury will decide an aids 
victims claim against a blood bank in a 1986 california case a 
jury was chosen but the lawsuit was settled out of court before the 
trial ended 
it was just like a time bomb waiting to send an aids virus 
into a persons body that person turned out to be susie 
quintana a bruce jones said of the plasma supplied to his 
client after she was injured in a gun accident 
jones said in his opening statement wednesday that testimony 
would show the doctor who treated quintana used the blood banks 
plasma despite offers by family members to share their blood 
because of their concern about aids 
quintana 50 of dolores is suing united blood services whose 
blood bank in albuquerque nm supplied the contaminated blood 
dr edward g merritt quintanas doctor and dr donald kearns a 
denver infectious disease expert who first tested quintana for 
exposure to aids 
the defendants attorneys planned opening statements later the 
doctors have defended their treatment of quintana as proper and a 
lawyer for the blood bank previously said that tests for detecting 
aids in blood were not available until two years after the woman 
was infected 
judge john w coughlin is presiding over the case which began 
with jury selection on monday 
chris quintana 53 also a plaintiff in the lawsuit claims his 
wifes illness affected the couples sex life and potentially 
exposed him to aids as well the quintanas seek substantial 
damages but their lawsuit does not name an amount jones said 
wednesday 
quintana has had fullblown aids since september 1987 but her 
husbands tests have been negative said jones 
chris has not had an easy time since susie was told she has 
aids jones said wednesday thank goodness hes not infected 
but they didnt know that at the time they had sexual relations 
after the transfusion 
quintana was brought to southwest memorial hospital in cortez in 
may 1983 for treatment of an accidentally selfinflicted gunshot 
wound jones said merritt was the doctor who treated her he said 
one hour later that unit of frozen plasma was put into 
susies body said jones you are going to hear evidence that 
over that onehour period that ron quintanas eldest son could 
have given blood chris quintanas husband could have given 
blood 
jones claimed that the centers for disease control in atlanta 
was aware as early as january 1983 of the need to make blood safe 
from aids identifying male homosexuals and intravenous drug 
abusers as highrisk groups 
united blood services he said issued a joint statement with 
the red cross and other organizations following a cdc meeting that 
january that recommended ways for the public to avoid contaminated 
blood but he said the statement failed to call for blood donors to 
be asked about their sexual preference 
jones said kearns initially tested quintana for exposure to aids 
and told her the tests were negative and merritt also told chris 
quintana that his wife did not have aids exposure 
biopsy tests performed in fall 1985 confirmed that quintana had 
been exposed to the aids virus said jones

what was planned as a quick surprise strike at 
guerrillas in south lebanon encountered stiff resistance leading 
some israeli experts to question the wisdom of the operation 
israeli officials initially said the operation that began monday 
night was small in scale and would last only about 24 hours but 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said wednesday the soldiers were in 
a tough battle 
an army announcement later said the operation ended wednesday 
night with three israeli soldiers dead and 17 wounded it said more 
than 40 guerrillas were killed nearly all in maydoun village a 
stronghold of the proiranian hezbollah or party of god 
at first the primary objective appeared to be convincing 
villagers not to provide guides and other aid to guerrillas who 
have made a dozen raids across israels northern border since last 
november 
a military source said privately however that the original 
plan changed when the guerrillas stood and fought 
the newspaper haaretz said israeli officials were angry about 
information leaks just before troops entered lebanon under cover of 
darkness 
early publication of the army operation in lebanon without the 
approval of military censorship chased away hundreds of guerrillas 
who were the main objective of the operation and in fact caused 
the main goal of the operation to fail the independent daily 
said 
some military analysts who criticized the mission said it may 
encourage more attacks across the frontier rather than deterring 
the guerrillas 
yossi olmert of tel aviv university said the results wont be 
very significant 
he said guerrilla activity in the past two decades shows that 
after military actions like this theyll just try harder again 
against us just to make a show of force 
olmert also expressed doubt that the thrust to within a few 
miles of syrian army lines in east lebanon would encourage syria to 
control the guerrillas 
its very likely that syria is not impressed by this 
operation he said in an interview 
yehoshua saguy former chief of army intelligence predicted the 
guerrillas would only suffer a temporary setback 
in an israel television interview he said the immediate 
achievement will be a relative calming down and decline in attempts 
to infiltrate and attack for the not too distant future 
saguy also said we will have to repeat such operations to 
prevent the guerrillas from reorganizing in the area 
israel ended a threeyear occupation of south lebanon in june 
1985 many israelis were left with deep suspicions about future 
military entanglements and the new operation raised immediate 
questions 
its always easier to go in than it is to come out 
transportation minister chaim corfu told the associated press 
military commentator ron benyishai predicted in the daily 
yediot ahronot that guerrillas would resume and even redouble their 
efforts to get into israel 
palestinian guerrilla groups will continue military action to 
show support for palestinians who have rebelled for five months 
against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip he said 
ariel merari an expert on terrorism at the independent jaffee 
center for strategic studies in tel aviv said the effect of such a 
quick thrust would not last long especially without the element of 
surprise 
the main achievement is immediate if it comes as a surprise 
he said if it doesnt come as a surprise what remains and that 
is doubtful is deterrence of the local population from cooperating 
with terrorists

an electronic implant in the inner ear has not 
restored full hearing to any of the 3000 profoundly deaf who have 
received the device but it has provided at least some help to most 
patients a panel of experts concluded wednesday 
the device called a cochlear implant uses electrodes implanted 
in the middle ear to send impulses to the hearing nerve the 
impulses are created by amplified sounds which are picked up by a 
microphone from outside the body and relayed to the electrodes 
a national institutes of health panel that examined the use and 
success of the cochlear implant during a conference this week 
reported wednesday that though results from the device have been 
mixed there is a promise of improvement as the technology develops 
reports have sometimes claimed a spectacular return of normal 
hearing in deaf people with cochlear implants said robert i 
kohut chairman of the panel and a professor at the wake forest 
university medical center in winstonsalem nc unfortunately 
to date no person can be documented to have had normal hearing 
restored by this device 
the committee report said that less than 1 percent of the 15 
million hearingimpaired americans are potential candidates for the 
cochlear implant 
those who could use the device the committee said should be 
profoundly deaf adults who receive no benefit from hearing aids 
who previously could hear and speak who are in generally good 
health and who have the intelligence and psychological strength to 
learn how to interpret the sounds detected by the implant 
of the 3000 who have received the implant the report said 
only about 5 percent have experienced an improvement sufficient for 
them to communicate without lip reading about 60 percent to 70 
percent have experienced what the group called significant 
improvement another 2 percent to 15 percent of the patients have 
stopped using the device because they found it irritating or 
unhelpful the rest received more limited improvement 
using the device on children is still controversial the 
committee said though about 20 centers around the country are 
putting the implant in young children on an experimental basis 
estimated cost of the procedure is 10000 to 20000 
the group said there was great difficulty in predicting prior to 
surgery who will benefit and who will not some patients have had 
such success with the implant that they can talk on the phone 
while others who appeared to be equally fit candidates have not 
benefited 
a patient wearing the implant hears static and buzzing sounds 
that vary in intensity and tone the patient must learn to 
interpret these sensations as sound 
irwin j shumacher 67 a washington man who received a cochlear 
implant in 1980 was asked by the panel wednesday to explain what 
he hears from his implant 
it sounds like a radio that is just a little off center 
like static he said 
shumacher said he is able to understand some speech although he 
has one major problem when people tell jokes he said their 
voices tend to drop when they come to the end 
so i sometimes miss the punchline he said

a federal court jury convicted the reputed boss 
of the genovese organized crime family and eight others wednesday 
of a massive racketeering scheme that rigged multimilliondollar 
bids in the construction industry 
but in an apparent setback for a government effort to oust the 
current leadership of the teamsters union genovese boss anthony 
fat tony salerno and two others were acquitted of tampering 
with national teamsters elections 
federal prosecutors and defense lawyers declined to comment on 
the verdict citing a judicial gag order the order remains in 
effect because the jury will reconvene next week to consider 
forfeiture proceedings against the convicted defendants 
teamsters officials proclaimed the verdict a vindication 
salerno 77 who is already serving a 100year prison term for a 
1986 conviction and eight of 10 codefendants were convicted of 
racketeering and racketeering conspiracy both of which carry 
maximum 20year prison terms 
in all salerno was convicted on 28 counts including extortion 
mail fraud and illegal gambling in addition to racketeering 
salerno grimaced slightly and sat down after his conviction on 
the first count was announced he saluted the jury from his seat 
when they acquitted him on the teamsters charges 
he was acquitted on a total of five counts including wire fraud 
for allegedly engineering the 1983 election of jackie presser and 
his predecessor roy l williams as president of the 17 
millionmember teamsters 
reputed cleveland mobster john peanuts tronolone and 
clevelad businessman milton maishe rockman also were acquitted 
of tampering with teamsters elections 
it was not immediately known what affect the acquittals would 
have on reported plans for a government civil suit to seek the 
ouster of presser and other teamsters officials because the union 
is allegedly extensively influenced by mobsters 
sources in the justice department speaking on condition of 
anonymity had said the suit was drawn up but not filed to avoid 
prejudicing the salerno trial 
us attorney rudolph giuliani has declined to confirm those 
reports and would not comment wednesday because of the gag order 
spokesmen for the justice department could not be reached 
immediately for commen after the verdict 
in washington teamster officials said the verdict once and 
forever shatters law officials claims that organized crime 
figures engineered the elevation of first williams and then presser 
to the unions presidency 
teamster general counsel john r climaco said presser and other 
top officials of the union feel vindicated and are comforted 
by the fact that after over one year of testimony this jury was 
able to accurately ferret out the truth 
for the past two years it has been widely reported first 
through calculated media leaks and then through the use of 
innuendo and even perjured testimony that the elections of 
williams and presser had been engineered and manipulated by 
organized crime elements climaco said today that myth has 
been once and forever shatttered by the jury verdict in the salerno 
case 
tronolone and rockman were acquitted of all charges against 
them including racketeering conspiracy and wire fraud 
in addition to salerno those convicted of racketeering were 
four new york area businessmen edward halloran of pelham nicholas 
auletta of pelham manor alvin o chattin of dix hills and richard 
costa of scarsdale two other alleged genovese capos matthew 
matty the horse ianniello and vincent dinapoli dinapolis 
brother louis and reputed lucchese crime family capo aniello 
neil migliore 
various defendants were convicted of rigging bids on numerous 
construction projects including more than 30 million in concrete 
work for the jacob k javits convention center in manhattan 
it took the court clerk and jury forewoman nearly an hour to 
work their way through the 40page verdict sheet the jury began 
deliberating april 26

federal agencies that fail to require 
seatbelt use on roads running through us parks and other lands 
will be called before congress to explain why a house committee 
chairman said wednesday 
obviously this administration has not been willing to show 
the best example when it comes to federal areas and belt use 
rep john dingell dmich said in a speech to the society of 
automotive engineers 
dingell chairman of the house energy and commerce committee 
vowed to use his subcommittee on oversight and investigation to 
force greater seatbelt use in government he said he would call in 
representatives of federal agencies to explain the rulemaking 
process 
if the example wont come from the administration perhaps the 
example will come from the oversight committee dingell said 
he said the defense department has cooperated in his campaign to 
require seatbelt use but civilian agencies are more 
recalcitrant 
the national park service proposed a seatbelt use requirement 
as part of a revamping of its safety rules dingell said 
however when the rules were finalized this requirement was 
quietly dropped 
the park service in a letter said the proposed rule was removed 
because of adverse public comment dingell said further 
investigation showed that all but one of those comments came from 
the park service employees he said 
a park service spokesman andrew ringgold said the agency 
follows state law in determining seatbelt use where states 
require seat belts the parks also require them where states have 
no such requirement neither does the park service 
our philosophy was that states were the appropriate 
authorities to regulate traffic and that national park service 
traffic regulations should be limited to situations that are either 
unique to park areas or that are not consistently addressed by 
state traffic regulations ringgold said 
also the public would be confused by mandatory seatbelt use in 
parks situated in states lacking such a requirement ringgold said 
more than half the parks administered by the service require 
seat belts be worn ringgold said about 8000 miles of public road 
run through park service land he said 
thirtythree states and the district of columbia have enacted 
laws requiring seatbelt use but the public has been lukewarm to 
the use of seat belts despite their known and obvious benefits 
dingell said

rep roy dyson on wednesday openly 
confronted rumors that have spread since the apparent suicide 
sunday of his top aide firmly denying that either he or the aide 
tom pappas was homosexual 
tom and i were very very good friends he was like a brother 
we had a personal and professional relationship the maryland 
democrat said at a news conference three days after pappas 
apparently jumped to his death from the 24th floor of a new york 
hotel 
was he pappas a homosexual dyson was asked 
no he was not dyson replied 
to the same question about himself he responded firmly and 
without emotion no i am not 
dyson said he thinks pappas jumped to his death because he could 
see his reputation being ruined by a story in sundays washington 
post that pappas forced young male staffers to attend social 
functions he arranged fired one staffer who refused to stay at a 
staff party and asked another male staffer to perform a striptease 
at an office retreat 
dyson complained that the story was based on interviews with a 
few disgruntled former staffers and gave only one side of the story 
he said he doesnt think publicity about pappas including 
earlier stories that he failed to properly report payments he 
received from campaign funds will hurt his chances of beating a 
littleknown republican opponent wayne gilchrest in november 
i am ready to go i love campaigning he said 
he said he could not answer questions about the campaign funds 
because repubicans have lodged a complaint with the federal 
election commission 
until the news conference dyson 39 had been in seclusion 
since the 46yearold pappas died the two men and a third 
staffer todd skipper were in new york for the weekend 
dyson said he talked with pappas after the story was read to him 
sunday and that he seemed to be holding up very well he said 
pappas denied the allegations in the story but knew that the 
damage had been done 
dyson said pappas was totally devoted to him and the 1st 
congressional district i think he sensed he was losing it he 
said 
a note left in the hotel room by pappas did not seem like a 
suicide note to me dyson said the note was not addressed to 
anyone and did not mention any names he said 
addressing specific incidents in the post story dyson said he 
has discussed them with other staffers since sunday and they have 
shed a distinctly different light on them 
he said he does not remember pappas ordering an aide to perform 
a strip tease although he was present at the retreat where the 
incident allegedly happened 
other staffers told him there is a different explanation for 
that incident he said but he refused to discuss it saying in 
time well get to that 
dyson also discussed the firing of aide andy hira when he 
refused to remain at a party at an annapolis hotel earlier this 
year he said he was present and that pappas told hira he had to 
attend because it was a party for constituents who had come to hear 
the congressman announce he would run for another term 
he hira said he was not going to stay in the room with those 
old bags dyson said 
at that point i think tom told him he was no longer on the 
staff dyson said 
he said he did think it was improper for pappas to advertise in 
a missouri newspaper for young men to fill staff positions and to 
require them to send pappas a photograph he would have put a stop 
to that had he known it he said 
dyson said pappas made some mistakes but called him a man of 
integrity of compassion

israeli soldiers shelled a syrian army 
garrison wednesday and used tanks to chase proiranian guerrillas 
from villages then israel announced that its twoday invasion of 
south lebanon was over 
the israeli military command in jerusalem reported three israeli 
soldiers and more than 40 arab guerrillas killed and 17 israeli 
troopers wounded it said all israeli forces had returned to their 
bases 
israeli artillery shelled the 50man syrian garrison at mashgara 
while other units were storming a nearby town with tanks driving 
out guerrillas and knocking down houses 
whether the shelling was deliberate was not clear and the 
syrians did not shoot back 
lebanons state radio quoted a syrian general in the bekaa 
valley who was not identified as saying we are watching 
closely we shall fight them if they make further advances 
no casualties were reported among the syrians who came under 
israeli fire for the first time since being forced out of south 
lebanon by the israeli invasion of june 1982 syria has 16000 
soldiers in the bekaa 
we have taken all the necessary measures and precautions to 
avoid friction with syrian forces col raanan gissin the army 
deputy spokesman told reporters in tel aviv 
troops flashed victory signs as they rolled back into israel in 
armored vehicles and tanks covered in dust 
at a border checkpoint in the israeli town of metulla soldiers 
were offered candy and cold drinks i couldnt care less about 
the sweets i just want to go home one shouted 
another trooper sat glumly on an armored personnel carrier 
holding the helmet of a dead comrade 
a military source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
unexpected resistance from the lebanese shiite militiamen altered 
the israeli plan for a quick operation which israeli officials 
expected would last only 24 hours 
the original plan changed with the clashes occurred said 
the source 
security sources said israel added two mechanized battalions to 
its operation tuesday night doubling to 2500 troops the size of 
the force that began the thrust the night before 
invading soldiers penetrated several miles beyond the security 
zone israel has maintained just north of its border since ending 
a threeyear occupation of south lebanon in june 1985 the zone 
ranges from 6 to 10 miles deep 
defense minister yitzhak rabin of israel had told parliament in 
jerusalem earlier wednesday the soldiers met resistance and might 
continue the operation for two more days 
a statement from the military command said most of the 
guerrillas killed belonged to hezbollah a radical shiite moslem 
group loyal to iran 
the operation was conducted in the framework of the ongoing 
defense policy and with the aim of hitting terrorists recently 
deployed in the security zone and on its outskirts the statement 
said 
lebanese police said israeli troops stormed maydoun village in 
the western sector of the bekaa on wednesday after 11 hours of 
street battles with shiite militiamen they blew up several houses 
and retreated just before sundown the police said 
shiite factions said eight militiamen were killed and 20 wounded 
according to the israeli army guerrillas expelled all residents 
of maydoun last year and built fortifications and trenches 
turning the village into a fortified outpost of the shiite 
terrorist group 
at mashgara the syrians took cover in sandbag positions and 
foxholes during six hours of shelling by 155mm howitzers mashgara 
is five miles north of maydoun 
syrian troops in the bekaa were put on maximum alert when 
helicopters landed israeli soldiers before dawn tuesday near their 
lines in the mount hermon foothills 
the hills around maydoun and nearby ein eltineh are traditional 
strongholds of hezbollah whose name means party of god 
police said hezbollah guerrillas who claimed responsibility for 
several raids into the security zone in the past two years were 
overwhelmed by the israeli onslaught 
a spokesman said five fighters were killed and 16 wounded trying 
to stop the israeli advance 
wednesdays thrust took israeli forces 9 miles west of five 
villages they entered tuesday in search for palestinian guerrillas 
and allied leftist militiamen 
at noon wednesday the israelis withdrew from the villages of 
ain ata memis kfeer khalwat and ain zeta after completing the 
search the police spokesman said 
ain ata mayor hussein qadi 70 said an israeli officer told 
him do not allow saboteurs into your village and well not come 
again 
i told him the guerrillas do not ask our permission to attack

a house appropriations subcommittee on 
wednesday recommended spending 100 million next year on the 
proposed superconducting super collider research project 
the amount approved by the energy subcommittee was 40 million 
more than it had originally recommended but was less than 
onethird the 363 million asked by president reagan 
this is the first hurdle for funding said rep carl 
pursell rmich the only subcommittee member whose state is a 
candidate for the project to survive it is important that the 
project receive adequate support at this stage 
rep tom bevill dala chairman of the subcommittee said the 
legislation limits spending to research and development leading to 
the 44 billion physics research project which will include a 
53mileround particle accelerator 
we feel like the 100 million is adequate to hold the team 
together the scientists and also to go ahead with the necessary 
reserch and all the preliminaries getting ready for 
construction bevill said 
but he added that this money is not to be used for purchsing 
equipment or starting construction 
bevill said the subcommittee increased its recommendation with 
the backing of the house democratic and republican leadership 
the senate budget committee has recommended 200 million for the 
super collider and other highenergy and nuclearphysics projects 
but has not recommended an appropriations amount 
bevill said he and other subcommittee members would support 
legislation authorizing the super collider project but i think 
every one of the panel feels as i do that weve got to have some 
extra revenue before we commit this government to a project that is 
going to cost somewhere between 53 billion and 9 billion 
the 53 billion estimate includes anticipated inflation the 9 
million estimate was produced by bevills staff 
the super collider would fire subatomic particles against each 
other at high speeds for research into the nature of matter 
seven states arizona colorado illinois michigan north 
carolina tennessee and texas have been selected as potential 
sites for the project which is expected to create 4000 permanent 
jobs and have an annual budget of 280 million 
supporters argue that the super collider is needed to keep the 
united states competitive in the next century opponents say the 
project would siphon muchneeded money from other scientific 
research 
meanwhile a group of arizona business education and labor 
leaders presented the energy department with a plan to pay for the 
super collider without immediate outlays by the federal government 
ian macpherson assistant attorney general and arizonas super 
collider coordinator and robbie aiken washington representative 
of phoenixbased pinnacle west corp said the plan would create a 
state agency to issue bonds for construction of the project which 
would be leased to the federal government

the us economy has enjoyed healthy growth so 
far this year with even such depressed sectors as energy and 
farming showing improvement according to an economic assessment 
released wednesday by the federal reserve 
the central bank said continued moderate growth of the 
nations economy was confirmed by the reports received from the 
feds 12 regional banks 
economists at the regional banks survey economic conditions in 
their districts and the reports are compiled for use by fed 
policymakers when they meet every eight weeks to review monetary 
policy the next meeting of the federal open market committee will 
be on may 17 
the government reported last week that the overall economy as 
measured by the gross national product expanded at an annual rate 
of 23 percent from january through march it was a far better 
performance than the recession that many analysts had feared 
immediately following the oct 19 stock market collapse 
this betterthanexpected growth has led to expectations that 
the central bank may soon begin tightening up on credit conditions 
and boosting interest rates as a way of fighting inflationary 
pressures 
such an action would seem to be consistent with the generally 
upbeat economic assessments contained in the fed report wednesday 
the report said manufacturing activity remained strong 
primarily because of strong growth of us exports it said housing 
activity has shown some improvement following the slump at the end 
of last year caused by high interst rates and consumer jitters 
caused by the stock market collapse 
the atlanta federal reserve bank which covers georgia 
tennessee alabama florida and part of mississippi reported that 
textile mills in the region were running at near capacity in part 
because of rising export sales 
several regional banks in the west reported a pickup in oil 
drilling activity the dallas region said oildrilling had 
rebounded sharply with the number of rigs in use growing for the 
first time in six months 
in agriculture the report said farm incomes were expected to be 
high this year but down slightly from the 1987 level because of 
smaller government payments and smaller profits in the livestock 
sector 
farmland values are generally rising in most areas and farm 
financial conditions appear to be strengthening the report said 
the dallas bank found that the number of farmers and ranchers 
leaving agriculture had slowed considerably while the atlanta and 
the st louis districts predicted that cotton acreage should be up 
substantially this year

the public doesnt get to walk through this particular valley of 
temptation the twoday taste show at the convention hall is 
designed for potential customers from the food service and retail 
food industries

honey ham that he says has only 25 calories per serving 
ham has a bad reputation because people perceive it as

a big wrapped loaf in the deli cooler 
if zitin thought he had a hard time marketing his meat consider 
jeff groezinger who was pushing headcheese made of pork 
tongues and pork snouts people love it really he said 
the battle of the pizzas at the taste show was intense sam

the top court of the united methodist church 
gave the goahead wednesday to a fouryear scientifictheological 
inquiry into homosexuality 
the ninemember judicial council said the study is intended to 
provide a base of information to assist the church in resolving 
the difference of opinion within the church regarding the 
interpretation of homosexuality in the context of the christian 
gospel 
the goahead to the homosexual study one of the most extensive 
ever undertaken by a church came after its legality was questioned 
under a church rule barring funds to gay groups or to promote 
acceptance of homosexuality 
the church court held that providing for the study clearly was 
not in conflict with the proscription no estimate was given of 
the cost of the study authorized at the churchs governing 
conference held every four years 
earlier in the conference the 96millionmember denomination 
strongly reaffirmed a ban on active homosexuals in the clergy and 
condemned such activity 
the rev james a wall of chicago a methodist and editor of the 
ecumenical weekly christian century said that undertaking the 
study leaves our position under a question mark 
the simple fact that the study is being made says there may be 
something that was missed by the delegates in their actions he 
said 
in authorizing the study the conference said homosexuality 
has proved to be particularly troubling to conscientious christians 
of differing opinions with biblical theological and scientific 
questions about it in dispute 
to try to get the answers the church directed a study enlisting 
the best biological psychological and sociological 
information as well as theological and ethical analysis 
scientists and other experts from outside the denomination will be 
consulted 
the conference attended by nearly 1000 delegates also called 
for a moratorium on the patenting of animals produced by genetic 
engineering and authorized a major study of the ethical and other 
implications of such technology 
meanwhile a chinese protestant leader who addressed the 
conference said christianity is growing rapidly in his country and 
voiced hope for reconciliation between chinese catholics and the 
vatican 
i would say i hope very much and pray very much for 
normalization between the chinese church and the vatican and for 
reconciliation between the two sides bishop k h ting head of 
the china christian council said at a news conference 
chinese catholicism broke ties with the vatican after communism 
came to power and functions independently as the catholic patriotic 
association rome has made numerous recent moves for reconciliation 
without avail 
ting said there are 8 million christians in china about 4 
million protestants and 4 million catholics he said protestants 
are increasing twice as fast as the population 
however he discounted western evangelical reports of 50 to 70 
million chinese christians conversion to the christian faith is 
not not that easy he said

a senate subcommittee said wednesday it had 
referred to the justice department for criminal investigation a 
navy officials testimony about his lobbying contacts on a 130 
million pontoon contract for scandalplagued wedtech corp 
testimony of everett pyatt assistant navy secretary for 
shipbuilding about his reasons for agreeing to set aside the 
pontoon contract for wedtech contains serious inconsistencies and 
contradicts relevant documents warranting further investigation 
the senate subcommittee on oversight of government management 
concluded in a report on wedtech and its involvement with attorney 
general edwin meese iii 
pyatts testimony before the subcommittee last year was sent to 
the justice department last december and has been under review 
said senate subcommittee aides who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity 
pyatt who was instrumental in awarding the pontoon contract to 
wedtech denied at the hearings that he spoke to wedtech lobbyists 
lyn nofziger and mark bragg before the contract was awarded in 
april 1984 
nofziger convicted earlier this year of illegal lobbying on 
behalf of wedtech and other clients was president reagans white 
house political director until january 1982 
the senate subcommittees report said the evidence includes 
statements by former wedtech executive mario moreno former wedtech 
consultant e robert wallach and a calendar of pyatts secretary 
showing that pyatt met at least three times with nofziger in 
september and october 1983 
the calendar also shows pyatt accepted an invitation to an 
anniversary celebration of the nofzigerbragg firm on feb 2 1984 
pyatt also failed to disclose the full scope of his 
relationship with nofziger and bragg said the report by the senate 
subcommittee on oversight of government management 
it wasnt until after last years hearings that pyatt supplied 
the subcommittee with office calendars indicating that he spoke to 
nofziger and bragg on the phone on at least 60 other occasions in 
1984 1985 and 1986 
the posthearing documents supplied by pyatt showed he had a 
breakfast and two other meetings with nofziger in 1983 seven

leader as well as a manager one of the ways you demonstrate that 
you can lead is you go out and win elections

after spending more than 2000 and 
eight years seeking help from attorneys illegal immigrants 
santiago and beatriz casares took their six children and applied 
for amnesty on their own wednesday the last day of the program 
they said they gave up on one lawyer last week after it took him 
a year to tell them their papers were no good 
he wanted to charge us 1750 more to arrange the amnesty 
said casares who says he has lived in edinburg with his wife since 
1979 
they borrowed the 420 family application fee from relatives in 
time to spend tuesday night and early wednesday wrapped in blankets 
outside the immigration and naturalization services legalization 
center here 
the couple and their children were among about 1000 people in 
line when the center serving the lower rio grande valley opened 
wednesday 
mrs casares came to the united states legally from reynosa 
mexico with a border crossing card in 1979 and never returned her 
husband said casares said he swam the rio grande a river that 
forms the border between texas and mexico 
they have worked various construction yard mowing and migrant 
farm labor jobs since then 
mrs casares said many employers paid them in cash because they 
did not have social security numbers but whenever they were given 
a check she saved receipts 
she also held on to rent receipts from the fourroom house they 
have rented for eight years i thought we might need them 
someday mrs casares said 
all the while they put their faith in people representing 
themselves as immigration attorneys in an effort to become legal 
residents 
most of the more than 2000 they spent on the lawyers was for 
identification letters they would have to renew monthly 
usually for 40 they said 
such letters have little value said charles perez chief 
legalization officer at the harlingen ins center 
all that is is a letter saying they are clients of an attorney 
and that the authorities have to call the attorney before deporting 
them perez said adding he has heard of similar fraud schemes 
throughout his 33year career with the agency 
there are lawyers who thrive on that he said or the 
attorneys may have been notaries public who prey on mexicans 
who think the title means the same as notario publico a term 
for lawyer in mexico perez added 
casares 42 said the first attorney took 1600 of their money 
over seven years then told them he could not do anything for them 
the second man took 600 in a year before the casares family 
decided a week ago they were wasting their money and their quickly 
expiring time 
they said they would use their rent receipts check stubs and 
other papers to show they have lived in this country since before 
jan 1 1982 as called for in the 1986 amnesty law 
on wednesday the couple and their older children born in mexico 
received slips of paper telling them to report to the center nov 3 
for legalization interviews 
mrs casares said she is confident their applications will be 
accepted and that their landlady will vouch for them if necessary

about 100 police officers their guns drawn 
briefly took over a oneblock area of a residential neighborhood 
intending to wrest control of a cluster of suspected crack 
houses 
a lot of people were dealing out of multiple locations 
deputy police chief john laux said after tuesday nights raid 
they are taking over a block and saying this is our block 
were saying its a block and were going to take the block 
back 
seven persons were arrested in the raids on seven suspected drug 
houses which police said was the departments largest single 
police criminal action in recent memory there was no shooting 
during the raid 
one man faces possible felony charges was carrying 13 doses of 
crack 600 and a handgun when police broke into one of the 
suspected crack houses laux said 
the sweep only turned up two other small amounts of the drug and 
one shotgun laux said if any charges are filed against the 
remaining suspects they would be misdemeanor charges laux said 
in that respect it was disappointing laux said it 
certainly is nicer if somebody is there holding a large amount of 
drugs but the message still goes out to the neighborhood that we 
will not let them take over city blocks and ply their illegal 
trade 
the raids were prompted in part by hundreds of calls from 
residents to police and to city council member sharon sayles 
belton who accompanied officers on the operation 
the calls have been coming in every day of the week whenever 
youre in the office she said people are frustrated that the 
narcotics unit cant come immediately but concrete information has 
to be pulled together first people dont understand that they see 
it at all hours on the street 
in fact police said most of the houses raided by special 
assault teams tuesday had been raided at least once in the past few 
months 
in addition to making undercover purchases in the crack houses 
in recent weeks surveillance officers witnessed drug deals taking 
place in front of several of the houses said sgt doug smith who 
organized the entry teams 
neighbors said drug dealing has been prevalent not only on their 
block but on surrounding blocks as well 
you can bust em and bust em and bust em but that doesnt 
mean theyre going to go away said a man drinking beer on his 
steps next to one of the houses that was raided this has been 
going on for months its gotten real bad theres little kids here 
and everything

ignoring a veto threat the house voted 
wednesday for a deep reduction in spending for president reagans 
star wars antimissile defense program 
after a long series of votes the democraticcontrolled chamber 
ended up approving 35 billion for the strategic defense 
initiative as star wars is formally known 
the decisions came as the house worked on a huge bill 
authorizing pentagon spending for the fiscal year which begins oct 
1 
reagan had sought 48 billion for star wars compared with the 
current 39 billion budgeted for the fiveyearold program 
the star wars budget was approved wednesday on a 223195 vote 
after three earlier votes which rejected both total elimination of 
all star wars money and granting reagan his entire request along 
with another proposal to provide 41 billion 
first the house voted 312105 to reject an amendment that would 
have granted reagans entire 48 billion request then it turned 
down 299118 another proposal to eliminate the entire sdi budget 
after that a 227190 voted turned back the 41 billion budget 
recommended by the armed services committee 
later the house voted 244174 to limit spending on the 
socalled phase one of sdi to 40 percent of the total star wars 
budget phase one is aimed at developing an early version of 
the missile defense and current plans called for raising the level 
of phase one spending within the sdi program from 40 percent to 
50 percent 
defense secretary frank carlucci said the 35 billion sdi 
figure in the house bill isnt enough and warned that he will 
recommend a reagan veto unless star wars spending is increased 
if the congress sends the president a defense bill that 
contains a funding level for sdi that is in my view inadequate i 
would have no choice but to recommend a veto of that bill 
carlucci said in a letter read during the debate 
the votes were part of the complicated congressional budget 
process and the 35 billion spending level means the final 
congressional sdi figure is likely to be around 41 billion 
thats because the pentagon budget bill that will be considered 
by the senate starting next week proposes 46 billion for star 
wars reagans sdi program traditionally has fared better in the 
more conservative senate even though that chamber also is 
controlled by democrats 
differences between the two bills including the sdi budget 
will eventually be reconciled by a housesenate conference 
committee if the senate votes 46 billion and the house figure 
remains at 35 billion the likely compromise will be around 40 
billion said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed 
services committee 
during four hours of debate sdi critics and supporters repeated 
their past statements critics contended the program wont work 
because it is technologically unfeasible while supporters argued 
that sdi scientists have made a number of breakthroughs and us 
advances worry the soviet union 
rep barbara boxer dcalif called star wars an astrological 
dream our president decided to pursue a reference to reports 
that reagan and his wife nancy follow astrology 
but rep john r kasich rohio said the debate no longer is 
whether we ought to have an sdi the experts on both sides all 
support it 
rep norman dicks dwash said it makes no sense to spend 
billions on longshot futuristic dreams when the budgets for 
nonnuclear weapons such as tanks and planes are being reduced 
rep charles bennett dfla said sdi is full of halfbaked 
proposals and he urged the house to prevent a rush to deploy 
inadequate and destabilizing weapons in space 
for rep william dickinson rala the house was being 
reckless counterproductive to reduce the sdi budget below the 
current figure 
rep duncan hunter rcalif urged increases in sdi spending 
because he said were asking a question with this research and 
we have to devote resources to answer this question

opposition political parties ranging from the rightist social 
christians to the communists

preparing to leave for the general workers federation building 
about a mile away where the hunger strikers were holed up the 
opposition leaders had planned to hold a rally at about noon but 
it did not take place

group was invited to meet with cmdr doris tijerino head of 
the sandinista police and taken by bus to meet the commander she 
did not elaborate 
police also detained two opposition leaders augustin jarquin 
anaya and armando guadamuz both of the social christian party as 
they arrived at the workers federation headquarters 
this is the repressive customs of the sandinista front 
guadamuz said before the police led him away they are violent by 
tradition 
more than 40 people have been taken into police custody in 
connection with the hunger strike since it began april 25 
police cordoned off the front of the workers federation building 
and officers ringed the area reinforcements waited in military 
trucks

corporacion was shut down immediately and radio mundial and radio 
catolica a roman catholic radio station had their news broadcasts 
restricted 
jose castillo osejo director of radio corporacion was punched 
in the mouth by interior minister tomas borge last week because the

a spill of 28000 gallons of acid into a 
gulf coast shipping channel has killed thousands of fish and left 
environmental officials threatening to shut the plant responsible 
the phosphoric acid that spilled into the 30footdeep mouth of 
the alafia river was a 54 percent concentration according to 
gardinier inc which reported the spill soon after it occurred 
sunday 
thats real strong it would burn you badly said roger 
stewart hillsborough county environmental protection commission 
director 
gardinier a subsidiary of cargill inc of minnesota that makes 
fertilizer from the acid reported the spill from a storage tank 
sunday by leaving a message on the commissions telephone answering 
machine 
the company said theres nothing wrong stewart said but 
tuesday thousands of fish and other wildlife including blue 
crabs flounder and ray were floating dead on the water 
the time has come for that plant to shut down ive got an 
attorney working on that said stewart adding that environmental 
protection agency officials were en route to the scene from atlanta 
on wednesday 
stewart said experts had not decided whether to let the acid 
dissolve or churn up the brackish 3000footwide mouth of the 
river to dilute the acid with seawater 
the acid overflowed sunday from one of gardiniers 5500ton 
tanks said gray gordon the plants vice president for industrial 
relations company engineers estimated 200 tons of the acid spilled 
into the river he said 
gordon said a plant operator was trying to pump the liquid from 
a tank to another area where it would be mixed with phosphate rock 
instead an open valve that the operator thought was closed allowed 
the liquid to flow into another tank causing it to spill over 
gordon said 
company officials at first thought the acid was trapped in a 
retention pond around the tank gordon said 
residents fishing near the plant monday and tuesday said they 
noticed milkycolored water and dead fish and crabs in the river 
and called the commission 
the county recently cited gardinier after a cloud of sulfur 
dioxide and ammonia sickened residents and diners in a restaurant 
across the river april 7 the company which was cited for not 
notifying the county blamed the leak on an improperly programmed 
computer that opens and closes valves 
after heavy rains in 1987 stormwater retention ponds 
overflowed and gardinier dumped 137 million gallons of acidic 
waste into hillsborough bay the spill resulted in a massive fish 
kill and the state fined gardinier 200000

drexel burnham lambert inc told congress on 
wednesday that it will stop allowing its employees to buy junk 
bonds the firm underwrites a practice that had been criticized as 
unfair and possibly illegal 
drexel chief executive frederick joseph informed rep john 
dingell dmich by telephone that the firm was stopping purchases 
of new issues by socalled insider accounts which had been the 
focus of congressional hearings last week said dennis fitzgibbons 
dingells spokesman 
drexel which was instrumental in developing the market for 
highyield highrisk junk bonds had allowed employees and 
partnerships formed by employees to buy bonds from hot new issues 
even though that sometimes denied public customers the opportunity 
to buy all of the bonds they wanted 
dingell who is chairman of the house energy and commerce 
committee had raised questions about the legality of the trading 
and its fairness to the customers 
employees according to the committee were able to make 
substantial profits by purchasing newly issued bonds from the firm 
and holding them for several weeks or months and then reselling 
them 
joseph in 6 hours of hearings last thursday defended the 
practice as perfectly proper saying bond prices were not as 
subject to manipulation in the same way as stock prices but he had 
acknowledged that he was troubled by the appearance of a conflict 
steven anreder a drexel spokesman in new york said the firm 
was barring employees and employee partnerships from buying new 
public issues of debt securities to avoid any appearance of 
possible unfairness 
dingell praised the decision as a very good step adding in 
a statement it should lay to rest questions associated with the 
fairness and legality of that particular practice drexels 
decision is both good from the standpoint of the public interest 
and wise 
however fitzgibbons said dingell has made no decision regarding 
his committees ongoing investigation of drexel 
dingell has been criticized by rep thomas bliley rva for 
subpoenaing michael milken chief of drexels beverly hills 
calif junk bond unit to appear before the committee even though 
milken had indicated in advance that he would refuse to testify 
based on his constitutional protection from self incrimination 
dingell said the firms retreat indicates that the behavior of 
the committee was correct and fair in bringing these matters to 
light

afghanistan has asked the world to help it 
repair the damage of war and resettle millions of refugees 
neighboring pakistan where most of the refugees live called the 
request a propaganda tactic 
pakistan and the united states armed and supported moslem rebels 
who have fought sovietsupported governments since a communist coup 
in april 1978 
the kremlin has had military forces in afghanistan since 
december 1979 but has agreed to withdraw its estimated 115000 
soldiers in nine months beginning may 15 
pakistan will support aid for the people of afghanistan at the 
proper time but this is not the appropriate time while soviet 
troops have not started to withdraw mansoor suhail press 
spokesman for the pakistani un mission said wednesday 
he called the afghan request a propaganda tactic to seek 
legitimacy of the kabul regime which was installed by the soviet 
union a regime which is not acceptable to the people of 
afghanistan 
more than 5 million afghans about onethird of the population 
have fled their country since the civil war began at least 3 
million live in border camps and cities in pakistan that serve as 
bases and supply points for the guerrillas 
afghanistans ambassador shah mohammad dost asked the economic 
and social council for urgent consideration of the request for 
assistance after the soviets leave but did not name a figure 
the council which held its first meeting of 1988 on tuesday 
will consider next week whether to put the question on its agenda 
dost said in a letter to the secretarygeneral and council that 
the withdrawal agreement mediated by the united nations and signed 
april 14 in geneva paved the way for normalizing the situation in 
and around afghanistan 
this enables the government of afghanistan to embark upon a 
huge reconstruction effort to undo the enormous damage inflicted by 
the war and to resettle the afghan refugees returning to their 
country he said 
such an effort is beyond the domestic means available to 
afghanistan and requires the assistance of this world body 
the 18member economic and social council makes recommendations 
to the general assembly which has voted overwhelmingly every year 
for withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan

a star that may be the least massive ever 
found has been located by three princeton university 
astrophysicists at a point 3000 light years across the milky way 
the star was discovered when it repeatedly eclipsed a heavier 
rapidly spinning companion pulsar star the national science 
foundation announced wednesday 
discoverers of the pair of stars were andrew s fruchter daniel 
r stinebring and joseph h taylor all of the physics department 
at princeton 
the astronomers said the dwarf star interrupts or eclipses the 
radio signals from the pulsar star at regular intervals as the two 
stars circle each other every nine hours and 10 minutes 
measurements of this interval helped determine the size of the two 
stars 
the dwarf star is possibly the smallest star ever seen 
stinebring said in the nsf announcement its also unlike typical 
stars in that it does not shine by its own nuclear reactions nor 
is it anything like a planet 
he said the pulsar star which is much heavier though smaller in 
circumference than the dwarf star is spinning at the rate of 622 
times per second this is the secondfastest spin of the 440 known 
pulsars the fastest rotates at 642 times per second 
pulsars are small dense stars thought to be remnants of 
exploded stars or supernovas pulsars emit radio signals that are 
pulsed by their rotation 
the pair of unusual stars was discovered using the worlds most 
powerful radio telescope at the arecibo observatory in puerto rico 
the pulsar was first seen march 3 by fruchter two weeks later 
the princeton team discovered that the pulsar signal was 
interrupted for 50 minutes during each pulsar orbit 
by carefully measuring the eclipse the team discovered that the 
dwarf star is about 50 percent larger in circumference than the 
sun but has only about 2 per cent of the suns mass 
stinebring said this means that the dwarf star is only 25 times 
more massive than jupiter the largest of the suns planets

rangel said there is no intention to work any less in the 
face of gov michael dukakis widening lead he said the jackson 
camp sees no reason to ease up on criticism of dukakis in the 
interest of party unity and that jackson supporters will be ready 
to make their wishes known at the convention 
theres no marriage unless we get to the wedding he said 
jacksons heavy losses to dukakis in ohio and indiana on 
tuesday and his runaway victory in the district of columbia left 
the delegate count at 927 for jackson to 1500 for dukakis 
the seven states remaining on the primary calendar hold 577 
delegates including 314 in california and 109 in new jersey 
meanwhile jackson aide frank watkins said wednesday that he 
apparently made a mistake in saying that jackson received about 
46000 in consulting wages from entertainer bill cosby last year 
that was my mistake they have not paid him any money they 
cosby through his production company have paid money to 
personalities international i dont know the details of that 
watkins said in a telephone interview on wednesday 
personalities international inc a company headed by jacksons 
wife received payments for his other speaking engagements and 
publications the company paid jackson 159000 as an employee and 
consultant last year according to the tax forms 
watkins said he did not know how much cosbys production company 
gave the firm or what the payment was for and said any details 
would have to come in writing from jacksons lawyer john bustamante 
or his accounting firm washington pittman and mckeever neither 
bustamante nor the accounting firm immediately returned messages 
left at their chicago offices wednesday evening 
the discrepancy arose when cosby through a spokesman disputed 
watkins explanation tuesday of the 46535 business services 
income reported on jacksons 1987 tax return watkins said then it 
was mainly consulting fees paid by cosby 
meanwhile jackson who has made a point of stressing party 
unity said at a news conference that he is not happy with the 
delegateselection process in some states but did not specifically 
say he would challenge it 
he said dukakis leads him by only 8 percentage points in the 
popular vote and that margin should be reflected in the voting by 
super delegates those delegates selected by virtue of holding 
important party positions or public office 
the super delegates will do america a super favor by not 
interfering in the process i simply want fairness he said 
the super delegate system allows those delegates to back the 
candidate of their choosing but jackson said they should follow 
the popular vote suggesting they should not try to settle the 
nomination before the primary season is over 
were within striking distance jackson said its not 
over really till its over 
the party machinery is saying in fact go for dukakis the 
pundits are saying go for dukakis in some sense the super 
delegates are moving in that direction and so against the party 
the pundits the press we press on against those odds he said 
were not about to turn back 
the democratic caucus chairman former presidential candidate 
rep richard gephardt of missouri said everyone admires the 
grace and tone with which jackson has conducted his campaign and 
characterized the morning meeting as warm and successful 
in his meeting with 13 democratic members of congress who are 
part of a go west 88 group jackson discussed issues of 
concern to western states 
rep ron wyden dore an organizer of the group said they 
talked about trade drugs immigration and energy 
he made it clear trade expansion was something very important 
on his agenda said wyden who told reporters the sessiom was a 
very positive kind of discussion

three thunderous explosions destroyed a 
space shuttle fuel plnt and a candy factory wednesday generating a 
fivesquaremile toxic cloud injuring more than 150 people and 
leaving others unaccounted for authorities said 
because of toxic smoke and flames it was not immediately known 
whether all the workers at the plants escaped authorities 
initially said one person had died and there were unconfirmed 
reports nine people had died said mike cool assistant clark 
county manager gov richard bryan later said there were no 
confirmed deaths although two people were missing 
flames and orange smoke rose into the sky and buildings shook 
10 miles away in las vegas after the midday explosions at the 
pacific engineering amp production co in the southern nevada 
community of henderson 
it flipped cars over knocked pedestrians to the ground and 
windows in the whole town shattered said susan russo 37 of 
henderson who was getting gasoline when the blasts occurred 
we have tried to count noses were uncertain whether weve 
accounted for everyone what we see is pretty much total 
devastation said fred gibson pacific spokesman 
all roads to henderson a town of 54590 people midway between 
las vegas and hoover dam were closed residents were told to keep 
windows closed against the toxic cloud 
two of the blasts which leveled the fuel plant and the kidd amp 
co marshmallow factory next door registered on earthquake 
seismographs 200 miles away at the california institute of 
technology in pasadena calif said spokesman bob finn 
the first blast at 1153 am measured about 30 on the 
richter scale of ground motion the second at 1157 am had a 
magnitude of 35 i find that absolutely amazing that is 
extremely powerful said finn 
the fuel plant manufactures ammonium perchlorate an oxidizer 
used in fuel for the shuttles solid rocket boosters but nasa said 
the accident was not expected to delay resumption of shuttle 
flights 
the explosions followed a fire that began when one of our 
pieces of equipment malfunctioned gibson said the fire spread 
quickly and there was an explosion at least two blasts followed 
shortly 
more than 150 people were injured at the plants and in 
surrounding neighborhoods according to tallies from hospitals 
most had cuts and bruises from flying glass and debris others 
suffered burns broken bones or shock 
firefighters were unable to enter the site for nearly three 
hours after the explosions because of the threat of additional 
blasts and the toxic cloud 
two hundred people were believed to be at the fuel plant at the 
time of the blasts said clark county spokeswoman lisa godwin the 
candy plant employed 85 people but few employees of either plant 
had been seen at hospitals authorities said 
there are people out there who are probably dying said 
janet smith a spokeswoman for mercy ambulance in las vegas which 
sent ambulances to the site people are out there on the desert 
wandering aimlessly if they escaped she said 
the toxic cloud five miles square and moving to the northeast 
contained hydrochloric acid and it is very important that no one 
be within five miles of the smoke or fire said doug bradford a 
spokesman for the city of las vegas the strategy is to let it 
the plant fire burn 
hospitals reported treating at least 154 people and at least 
four were in critical condition 
more than 70 residents of the glen halla nursing home two miles 
from the blast were evacuated to the las vegas convention center 
after the explosion damaged their building officials said 
emergency workers warned residents away from the area as smoke 
billowed across the entire las vegas valley all area schools were 
evacuated and united blood services of las vegas appealed for 
emergency contributions 
our windows blew out it blew the frame off the door we are 
probably five or six miles away said lee hall secretary at the 
henderson convalescent hospital 
nasa said in washington that pacific engineering provides the 
ammonium perchlorate to morton thiokol nasas prime contractor for 
the motors as well as to some department of defense programs 
don amitor a spokesman for nasas marshall space flight center 
in huntsville ala said mortonthiokol had enough ammonium 
perchlorate in supply for the next five shuttle launches under the 
present schedule the fifth launch would be in mid1989 
pacific is one of two companies that supply ammonium perchlorate 
for all us solid fuel rocket engines including the space 
shuttle minuteman and titan projects the other is kerrmcgee 
also near las vegas 
the pentagon said pacific received no department of defense 
contracts in fiscal 1988 although they had two in 1987 totaling 
675000 
currently we have no information that department of defense 
work is in any way related to the fire the pentagon said in a 
statment 
kidd based in ligonier ind expanded to the gibson business 
park and opened its 36500squarefoot plant about two years ago

congress refused to go along wednesday with a 
reagan administration plan to negotiate with a private firm for 
lease on a space factory that would be put in orbit by the space 
shuttle and serviced periodically by astronauts 
the house space science subcommittee in an action approved by a 
voice vote said the national aeronautics and space administration 
may call for bids on a socalled commercially developed space 
facility but that it cannot award contracts without the express 
permission of congress 
the committees instructions are part of a bill that would 
authorize 115 billion to be spent by nasa in the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 it requires nasa to submit the results of its 
request for proposals to congress before the next presidential 
budget message next january or february 
president reagans new space policy announced in february 
included an intent for the federal government to lease space as 
an anchor tenant in an orbiting space facility that is 
financed constructed and operated by the private sector 
nasa which had strongly opposed such a facility until that 
time came to congress and said it would lease 70 percent of the 
factory for five years at 140 million a year the agency declared 
its intent to issue requests for proposals within two months 
saying the facility was needed to bridge the time span until a 
space station is in orbit in the mid1990s 
a houston firm space industries inc has designed such a 
robot space factory but the house subcommittee specified that 
proposals must be submitted by more than one company 
some critics see any government agreement for the commercially 
developed space facility as usurping funds and thus killing the 
space station and the space subcommittee specified in its bill 
that the money for the facility must not come out of funds for 
other projects 
last friday four influential members of the senate commerce 
committee sent a letter to nasa administrator james c fletcher 
saying they will not permit nasa to enter into a lease in the next 
fiscal year and that they object to even a request for a proposal 
their argument that the idea had not been studied sufficiently 
and its need had not been established was carried on in the house 
subcommittee hearing the subcommittee however voted 188 against 
a proposal that would have shelved the idea completely until next 
year

roman catholic leaders are trying to 
negotiate an end to a hunger strike by at least 5000 workers and 
students before pope john paul arrives next monday on his first 
visit to bolivia 
the hunger strikers who began their fast last week oppose 
government economic programs and demand higher wages hundreds of 
students and workers have marched through the streets of la paz 
almost daily in antigovernment protests 
interior minister juan carlos duran said extreme leftist groups 
organized the hunger strike and the protest marches to create a 
climate of social unrest that will show a distorted image of 
bolivia when the pope arrives 
on pope pauls fiveday visit here next week he will travel 
from the 13000foothigh city of la paz to the lowlands and will 
meet miners farmers and indians as well as church and government 
officials 
church officials here are also trying to softpedal a letter 
sent by a group of bolivian priests to the vatican last month 
protesting the appointment of foreign bishops 
it seems strange to us that after nearly half a century of 
evangelization in america we must still import the ecclesiastical 
hierarchy to teach santify and rule christians in bolivia said 
the letter 
the protests originated after three foreign bishops were named 
in april to run dioceses in la paz 
according to figures released by the church 634 of the 834 
priests working in bolivia are foreigners as are 17 of the 29 
bishops 
church officials have been meeting with leaders of the bolivian 
workers central trying to resolve the hunger strike 
the workers central represents most workers in bolivia its 
secretarygeneral simon reyes says the situation of hunger and 
misery can no longer be supported and for this reason the protests 
will continue until our demands are met we cannot hide the 
dramatic reality economic and social reality from the eyes of the 
pope 
the workers central demands a wage increase higher than the 10 
to 20 percent given by the government last month with the increase 
the minimum monthly wage is 35 the workers central says a worker 
needs 10 times that amount to subsist 
the workers central also demands bigger budgets for health and 
education the vatican ambassador to bolivia the rev santos abril 
y castello said the roman catholic church sees with great 
preoccupation how the social situation in bolivia could tarnish the 
visit of the holy father

outside and then it was obvious you could just look at the 
skyline ms roberts said i never heard one person complain 
that it interrupted their bingo and their keno 
the gamblers mostly local residents returned to their games 
after the evacuation 
it doesnt seem to bother them it was like a thunderstorm

south africa cuba and angola made progress in 
ussponsored negotiations on ending the civil war in angola and 
will meet again in africa within weeks the united states announced 
wednesday 
chester crocker us assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs said the agreement to meet again was an important step 
toward getting cuban and south african troops to withdraw from 
angola and securing independence for south africancontrolled 
namibia or southwest africa 
we were impressed by the tone of the discussions by the 
absence of polemics and the iterations of seriousness crocker 
said of the unprecedented meeting between south africas white 
generals and the cuban and angolan leaders 
crocker also raised the prospect of the united states and soviet 
union guaranteeing an eventual settlement similar to the deal for 
the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan 
but it is fair to be skeptical crocker told a news 
conference at the us embassy at the end of the twoday talks 
there are big tough issues that lie ahead gaps need to be 
bridged we do not think they should be unbridgeable 
the place and date for the talks in africa has not been decided 
crocker said 
he said the talks at a london hotel focused on an angolan 
proposal put forward in march for about 40000 cuban troops to 
leave angola in a phased withdrawal while south africa pulled its 
forces out of angola and namibia no specific timetable for the 
withdrawal was described 
the cubans went to angola in 1975 to defend the marxist 
government against prowestern rebels of unita the national union 
for the total independence of angola the united states aids unita 
south african troops are in southern angola to back unita and 
attack bases of the southwest african peoples organization or 
swapo which is fighting for namibian independence 
in past months fighting has intensified around the strategic 
southern city of cuito cuanvale where angolan and cuban forces are 
apparently hanging on under attack from unita and south africans 
south africa which has acknowledged 50 servicemen killed in 
angola in recent months says it has up to 3000 troops in the 
country angola says 9000 south africans are there with heavy 
artillery 
crocker said the talks reflected improved ussoviet relations 
there may be a mutual recognition that it could be useful if 
the difficulties in these negotiations are addressed periodically 
between us and the soviets and some effort made to explore how 
it might be possible for our two countries to support a 
settlement he said 
the talks took place after crocker conferred in london last week 
with soviet deputy foreign minister anatoly adamishin 
unita and swapo were not invited to the discussions which 
crocker described as confined to sovereign governments he 
added that us support for unita continued and was not part of the 
negotiations 
the united states has been trying for eight years to get the 
cubans out of angola cuba and angola backed by the soviets have 
demanded a south african withdrawal angola and independence for 
namibia 
previous settlements have foundered partly on us support for 
south africas argument that it cannot accede to united nations 
demands for preindependence elections in namibia while cuban 
troops remain in neighboring angola 
earlier the united states south africa cuba and angola issued 
a joint statement saying the meeting took place in a 
constructive atmosphere and progress was made

the state department has never filed an 
official protest with the south korean government over evidence 
that americandesigned m16 rifles built in korea have been sold to 
foreign countries in violation of a uskorean agreement 
according to a general accounting office report 
gao found that there was little us oversight of the program 
and confusion over which government agency should be in charge of 
the 1971 pact which banned sales to foreign nations without us 
permission and placed a cap on the number of rifles korea could 
produce 
when presented with evidence of illegal foreign sales us 
officials usually instructed embassy officials to remind korea of 
the seriousness of such sales a strong official government 
protest was never lodged gao said 
the agreement included colt industries firearms division of 
hartford conn which set up the korean rifle plant in exchange 
for perweapon royalties 
government officials told gao investigators that the programs 
management was left largely to colt 
a state department official close to the m16 program agreed 
there was some confusion over who was supposed to be watching 
every element of implementation and how much daytoday watching 
was appropriate the official said a more meticulous accounting 
arrangement may be necessary in the future 
but the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
defended the governments actions in following up on illegal sale 
evidence saying an official government protest was not necessary 
and that reminding korean officials of the agreement had been 
successful 
colt sued korea after the connecticut company stopped receiving 
royalties in 1982 that was the year the korean government which 
operated the plant turned over ownership to daewoo precision 
instruments a private company 
the gao report a copy of which was obtained wednesday by the 
associated press said records show that korea produced more m16 
rifles and spare parts than allowed under the agreement it also 
found that m16s and parts were sold to third parties without us 
permission a violation of the agreement 
the thirdparty nations were not mentioned in the report which 
was declassified a colt official said tuesday that the company had 
evidence of m16 sales to indonesia 
sukhan kim a washington attorney representing the korean 
defense ministry in the colt suit said korean officials have told 
him neither the government nor daewoo has sold m16s or parts to 
other countries or violated the production cap 
he declined further comment citing the pending litigation

mike tyler administrator of the state occupational safety and 
health division said his division will investigate the explosion 
which plant officials said followed a fire 
we investigate any catastrophe said tyler we would be

pacific engineering has always been a pretty good risk 
pacific engineering owned by state sen jim gibson and his 
brother fred gibson has been in business a long time and they 
have had no previous multiple injury problems or explosions at all 
as far as i know lewis said 
the space shuttle fuel plant was established in 1959 it 
manufactures ammonium perchlorate an oxidizer used in fuel for the 
shuttles solid rocket boosters but nasa said the accident was not 
expected to delay resumption of shuttle flights 
siis handles claims for insurance benefits from workers injured 
at work

immediate response including the employment security department

former gov evan mecham on wednesday 
refused to relinquish the 92000 protocol fund that figured 
prominently in his impeachment trial and his successor said she 
will sue to get it back 
the people who put it in the fund said it belongs to me 
said the former republican governor if we go by the intent of 
the giver well its mine 
on april 4 the senate convicted mecham of misusing 80000 from 
the fund by loaning it to his auto dealership he also was 
convicted of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death 
threat upon conviction he was removed from office 
on tuesday attorney general bob corbin released a letter in 
which he gave mecham until 5 pm wednesday to return the money to 
the office of gov rose mofford the deadline passed without action 
by mecham 
mrs mofford and corbin both said the senate essentially 
determined the protocol fund was state money when it convicted 
mecham if misusing it 
mrs mofford said before the deadline that she will sue to get 
the money back she said she will put the money in the state 
general fund 
the former governor said in a telephone interview he was looking 
forward to a lawsuit to determine whether he or the state owns the 
money 
the fund was created with receipts from mechams inaugural ball 
in 1987 
after it was determined under state law that the money could not 
be used to pay off campaign debts the maricopa county attorney and 
the inaugural reached an agreement to put the money into a fund to 
finance things like receptions and gifts for visiting dignitaries 
mecham said wednesday some of the money was spent but he would 
not say how much of the 92000 was left 
the former governor also faces a may 19 trial on felony charges 
of concealing a 350000 campaign loan

an amateur radio buff was convicted 
wednesday of sending a false distress report that prompted an 
allout search for a downed plane jan 8 at the height of one of 
the worst snowstorms of the year 
a us district court jury deliberated two hours before finding 
mark blair guilty of making a false report to the government 
blair 29 could receive up to five years in prison at sentencing 
july 1 
imagine the power he felt making this navy plane run east to 
west and north to south assistant us attorney peter papps 
said referring to a navy plane that for nearly four hours flew low 
over risky terrain searching for a small downed jet with a badly 
injured pilot and three dead passengers 
the report of the downed plane sparked a search that cost about 
50000 and involved up to 100 people 20 aircraft and six police 
agencies 
defense lawyer paul twomey said he will appeal on grounds of 
insufficient evidence this case is garbage absolute garbage 
twomey said 
blair testified he couldnt have committed the hoax because he 
was asleep and wasnt aware that a plane was reported down until he 
woke and turned on a police scanner 
blair said he then overheard the pilot tell the navy plane that 
he believed passengers were dead that he had lost a lot of blood 
was having trouble staying conscious and could see and hear the 
navy plane overhead 
that recollection conflicted with times given by david webster 
the navy reservist who piloted the navy plane other critical 
testimony came from timothy dinan 24 who lived in blairs 
apartment building 
dinan said he heard the scratchy sound of a twoway radio 
through an open window in blairs apartment and a clear voice 
saying i am in trouble i am losing blood 
when police searched blairs apartment and a storage shed they 
seized radio equipment and printed material that included the name 
dale the name given to searchers by the man who said he was the 
injured pilot 
the materials also contained highlighted references to radio 
frequency used that night and information about police emergency 
codes

the revelation that president reagan and his wife 
consult astrologers was greeted by the british press wednesday with 
the sort of relish that even the sorriest soothsayer could have 
predicted 
white house watchers wild about nancy the stargazer 
blared the headline in the daily telegraph which went on to report 
that washington was abuzz with claims that nancy really 
believes what the stars foretell 
newspapers in italy west germany and sweden gave relatively 
straightforward coverage to the presidents denial tuesday that his 
policies or decisions were influenced by astrology 
but their british counterparts could not resist poking fun at 
the reagans or the former administration officials who have 
revealed juicy white house gossip 
there is no wrath like that of a former reagan aide 
apparently said the independent newspaper or to put it 
another way former reagan aides will do anything to get their 
memoirs on the bestseller list 
donald t regan former white house chief of staff reportedly 
asserts in a forthcoming book that nancy reagan regularly consulted 
astrologers in shaping the presidents schedule 
the tabloid daily mirror devoted almost an entire inside page to 
the hubbub it also listed under the banner headline star 
struck the famous people who purportedly sought insight from 
astrologers 
among them were albert einstein queen elizabeth i and napoleon 
bonaparte 
einstein once wrote that astrology was a science in itself 
that taught me many things according to daily mirror 
columnist louise montgomery 
elizabeth i the 16thcentury english monarch rarely acted 
without the advice of astrologer john dee and french emperor 
napoleon commissioned at least two astrological charts and placed 
his trust in the movement of the stars she added 
a sober headline in the independent said reagan takes a dim 
view of stargazing tales while the tabloid daily express banner 
headline proclaimed ronnie and nancys starstruck white house 
in sweden aftonbladet bannered the story saying reagan 
governed by the stars while the liberal expressen had a large 
picture of the presidential couple and a headline reading nancy

bahamian prime minister lynden o pindling broke 
his silence wednesday to deny taking bribes from drug smugglers as 
claimed at the trial of reputed cocaine kingpin carlos lehder rivas 
i have never been offered a bribe and have never accepted a 
bribe he said in a statement released to the associated press by 
ken heinrich miami bureau chief of bahamas news bureau a 
government news agency 
pindlings government had repeatedly said it would not comment 
on allegations made at lehders trial until it was over the 
defense rested monday without calling any witnesses 
several witnesses at the jacksonville trial which is expected 
to go to the jury next week after six months of testimony have 
charged pindling filled his pockets with money from smugglers such 
as lehder who allegedly used normans cay in the bahamas as a 
transfer point for colombian cocaine bound for florida and georgia 
george william bill baron 42 a marijuana smuggler 
testified in february about paying 3 million to 5 million in 
bribes to pindling baron also testified lehder was paying pindling 
a flat 200000 a month 
george baron in accepting what he believed was an open 
invitation to perjure himself in plea bargaining told a story 
about me that is patently false and a complete fabrication which 
can easily be shown to be such by even a casual observation of the 
alleged facts and the circumstances he described the pindling 
statement said 
according to recent news reports grand juries in jacksonville 
tampa and miami are looking into pindlings affairs us attorney 
robert merkle whose district includes jacksonville and tampa has 
refused comment on the claim 
i would be surprised however if anything came out of those 
investigations pindling said this is so because the testimony 
given concerning me is totally and absolutely untrue 
pindlings name has frequently been tied to drug investigations 
in 1984 a royal commission of inquiry in the bahamas found that 
pindling had more money than known income but that none of that 
appeared to be drugrelated 
pindling won reelection a year ago invoking the fear common to 
small nations in the western hemisphere that the united states is 
meddling in their affairs 
lehder has been charged with smuggling 33 tons of cocaine from 
colombia via normans cay to the united states from 1978 to 1980 
he is accused of being a leader of the medellin cartel believed 
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into united 
states

the united auto workers and chrysler 
corp reached tentative agreement wednesday on a jobprotecting 
contract covering 66000 employees in 15 states 
the twoyear agreement was reached after about 40 hours of 
nonstop bargaining it would replace a threeyear contract that 
runs out sept 14 
the new pact would expire on the same date in 1990 putting 
chryslers contract in sync with the rest of the big three 
automakers for the first time in a decade 
negotiators adapted to the no 3 automaker the socalled pattern 
contract established last fall at ford motor co and general motors 
corp 
the agreement will be presented friday to the uaws 140member 
national chrysler council for approval before it is put to a 
ratification vote next week 
the pattern contract protects jobs by requiring companies to 
keep on the payroll workers whose jobs are eliminated for any 
reason except slow sales it also requires hiring of one worker for 
every two who leave the company 
the pattern forbids plant closings except for those announced 
before negotiations began 
in addition the agreement includes 1000 signing bonuses and 
lumpsum payments of 3 percent in 1989 and 1990 and provides 
profitsharing for the first time profitsharing will follow the 
formula in place at ford and gm 
the chrysler agreement also includes the union leaderships 
commitment to encourage its local unions to consider accepting 
socalled modern operating agreements japanesestyle practices in 
which workers are organized into teams 
talks began april 18 two to three months earlier than normal 
in an effort to mend three months of discord between the company 
and its workers over various job security and retirement issues 
we achieved the full pattern settlement we set out to achieve 
and we accepted no deviations from what we have in effect today at 
gm and ford union president owen bieber and vice president marc 
stepp said in a statement 
anthony st john chryslers chief bargainer and vice president 
for human resources called the agreement affordable and 
equitable and said the bonus is in recognition of the uaws 
contribution to chryslers productivity and profits during the past 
few years 
unlike the gm or ford contract the chrysler contract also 
includes the companys commitment that executives will receive 
neither cash nor stock bonuses in years when the profitsharing 
formula produces no payout for workers 
the two sides negotiated through the weekend to settle separate 
but related contracts covering about 7000 former american motors 
corp workers in wisconsin 
the national contract will cover workers left on the job after a 
former amc plant employing 5500 in kenosha wis closes

an attorney for a woman who got aids during a 1983 
transfusion charged wednesday that the blood bank that supplied the 
tainted blood neglected to take adequate precautions against the 
deadly disease 
susie quintanas lawsuit against a blood bank and two doctors 
opened wednesday before a sixperson jury in denver district court 
similar suits have been filed but lawyers said this may be the 
first case in the nation in which a jury will decide an aids 
victims claim against a blood bank in a 1986 california case a 
jury was chosen but the lawsuit was settled out of court before the 
trial ended 
it was just like a time bomb waiting to send an aids virus 
into a persons body that person turned out to be susie 
quintana a bruce jones said of the plasma supplied to his 
client after she was injured in a gun accident 
jones said in his opening statement wednesday that testimony 
would show the doctor who treated quintana used the blood banks 
plasma despite offers by family members to share their blood 
because of their concern about aids 
quintana 50 of dolores is suing united blood services whose 
blood bank in albuquerque nm supplied the contaminated blood 
dr edward g merritt quintanas doctor and dr donald kearns a 
denver infectious disease expert who first tested quintana for 
exposure to aids 
ubs attorney douglas irish told the jurors they will have to 
base their decision on scientific knowledge at the time and the 
judgment that was used 
you will hear from doctors that there is a risk that 
any blood transfusion can carry some disease irish said 
the blood banks lawyers earlier said tests for detecting aids 
in blood were not available until two years after the woman was 
infected 
susan fisher an attorney for merritt said merritt was not even 
in charge the night the woman was treated 
kearns attorney joseph jaudon said kearns was called in as a 
consultant and saw the patient on frequent visits spent time 
with her answered her questions and talked with her 
judge john w coughlin is presiding over the case which began 
with jury selection on monday 
chris quintana 53 also a plaintiff in the lawsuit claims his 
wifes illness affected the couples sex life and potentially 
exposed him to aids as well the quintanas seek substantial 
damages but their lawsuit does not name an amount jones said 
wednesday 
quintana has had fullblown aids since september 1987 but her 
husbands tests have been negative said jones 
chris has not had an easy time since susie was told she has 
aids jones said wednesday thank goodness hes not infected 
but they didnt know that at the time they had sexual relations 
after the transfusion 
quintana was brought to southwest memorial hospital in cortez in 
may 1983 for treatment of an accidentally selfinflicted gunshot 
wound jones said merritt was the doctor who treated her he said 
one hour later that unit of frozen plasma was put into 
susies body said jones you are going to hear evidence that 
over that onehour period that ron quintanas eldest son could 
have given blood chris quintanas husband could have given 
blood 
jones claimed that the centers for disease control in atlanta 
was aware as early as january 1983 of the need to make blood safe 
from aids identifying male homosexuals and intravenous drug 
abusers as highrisk groups 
united blood services he said issued a joint statement with 
the red cross and other organizations following a cdc meeting that 
january that recommended ways for the public to avoid contaminated 
blood but he said the statement failed to call for blood donors to 
be asked about their sexual preference 
jones said kearns initially tested quintana for exposure to aids 
and told her the tests were negative and merritt also told chris 
quintana that his wife did not have aids exposure 
biopsy tests performed in fall 1985 confirmed that quintana had 
been exposed to the aids virus said jones

the law granted protection to about 100 officers accused of 
atrocities during military rule 
fortyeight other appeals of lower court rulings upholding the 
law are pending but wednesdays case was considered decisive 
the law was approved by the official colorado party and the main 
opposition party the national party after former commanding gen 
hugo medina threatened to order accused army members to refuse to 
appear for trial 
president julio sanguinetti who became president when the 
military surrendered rule in 1985 signed the amnesty law in 
december 1986 under pressure from the military 
according to human rights organizations about 50000 uruguayans 
one in every 60 citizens were arrested and many were tortured 
during the militarys harsh 12year reign scores more were 
reported slain or missing

the release of three french hostages by proiranian 
kidnappers in lebanon follows reports of intense diplomatic 
activity on their behalf by premier jacques chiracs government 
there was no immediate indication whether france made 
concessions in talks with representatives of iran chirac and other 
french officials refused to answer questions about the negotiations 
there were unconfirmed reports in beirut in recent days that 
france had agreed to pay iran 670 million the amount owed to iran 
on a billiondollar loan made by the late shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi payments were frozen by the french government after the 
1979 islamic revolution in iran 
ten french hostages have been freed since the conservative 
premier took office in march 1986 the government says an 11th 
hostage was killed 
although chiracs government has denied making deals releases 
often coincided with expulsions of iranian exiles cash payments to 
iran on a disputed loan or other apparent concessions 
the final releases occurred four days before chirac faces 
president francois mitterrand a socialist in the presidential 
runoff election 
chirac trails in opinion polls and commentaries have said 
release of the hostages could give him the boost he needs 
politicians on both sides saluted the release of journalist 
jeanpaul kauffmann and diplomats marcel fontaine and marcel 
carton and denied that there would be political ramifications 
the first politician who declares that this liberation was 
obtained for the electoral calendar that politician will dishonor 
himself said alain juppe spokesman for the chirac campaign 
i dont want to make it an electoral game but you have to 
have the courage to say it when jacques chirac came to power 
there were 10 frenchmen held hostage in lebanon today there are 
none 
charles hernu a former socialist defense minister said we 
must not mix up these two things frenchmen and frenchwomen know 
that in a liberation of this kind no partisan exploitation is 
possible 
after chirac announced the release at a campaign rally in 
strasbourg however the audience began chanting were going to 
win were going to win 
families of the freed hostages reacted with joy undiluted by 
considerations of secret dealing or politics 
joelle kauffmann told the associated press her husbands release 
was a great present 
interviewed on french television as she drank champagne with 
friends and relatives mrs kauffmann said she got the first word 
by telephone from the wife of french special envoy jeancharles 
marchiani but thought the call a hoax 
im sorry i took it badly mrs kauffmann said i told 
her ive had enough with jokes this past month she was very 
disappointed she said you can believe me or not but i am 
marchianis wife they called me from there lebanon and told me 
to tell you this so there 
among the mysteries of the sudden release was a possible 
connection with frances expulsion tuesday of syrian businessman 
omran adham under procedures of absolute urgency he was 
involved in previous efforts to free the hostages 
le monde said without giving sources that the expulsion was 
prompted by an article in the prosyrian beirut newspaper al haqiqa 
saying france had sent negotiators to beirut and tehran iran asked 
for arms in exchange and chirac responded favorably al haqiqa 
reported 
the french paper said adham inspired the article 
al haqiqa said france paid 50 million francs 9 million for 
the release last november of french hostages roger auque and 
jeanlouis normandin 
french officials have denied paying ransom and insist they have 
not dealt directly with terrorists only with governments like 
irans that might have influence with the captors 
iran had offered to help win the release of french hostages in 
lebanon if france repaid the 1 billion loan made before the 
islamic revolution cracked down on iranian exiles and stopped 
selling arms to iraq which has been at war with iran since 
september 1980 
french officials said privately iran also sought its own 
supplies of french arms and freedom for five men convicted in a 
1980 attempt to assassinate shapour bakhtiar the last prime 
minister before shah mohammad reza pahlavi was overthrown in 
february 1979

arizonas attorney general withdrew from 
an investigation of gov rose moffords financialdisclosure forms 
wednesday citing a possible conflict of interest in his being next 
in line to succeed her 
maricopa county attorney tom collins agreed to take over the 
investigation from attorney general bob corbin who is prosecuting 
former gov evan mecham on charges of omitting a 350000 loan from 
his disclosure forms 
mrs mofford said she saw no conflict to having corbin 
investigate her and mecham said he believed corbin should handle 
the probe for the sake of consistency but corbin said he 
considered it inappropriate because he might be accused of 
benefiting from mrs moffords ouster or of having partisan motives 
corbin collins and mecham are republicans while neely and mrs 
mofford are democrats 
collins said he had agreed to take the case because he felt he 
could probably do it well quicker than anybody else and at a 
lower cost than if they had to appoint a special prosecutor 
this is clearly a damned if you do and damned if you dont 
case collins added predicting that mrs moffords supporters 
would accuse him of partisanship if he brought charges against her 
and that mechams supporters would accuse him of throwing the case 
if he declined to press charges against her while corbin proceeds 
with the case against mecham 
since i am not running for reelection i feel that i am 
perfectly positioned he said 
collins accepted after pima county attorney steve neely declined 
to take the case said corbin 
neely did not return calls to his office wednesday and a 
spokeswoman kathi barber said he would not explain why he had 
decided against taking the case 
i didnt ask him corbin said i assume he had his 
reasons 
mrs mofford elected as secretary of state succeeded mecham 
upon his impeachment and removal last month 
her replacement as secretary of state cannot become governor 
because he was appointed rather than elected and corbin is the 
next highest elected official 
as secretary of state for 10 years mrs mofford was in charge 
of explaining disclosure requirements for state officials 
the associated press disclosed on april 22 that she had not 
reported loans land holdings and partnerships dating back to 1978 
and mrs mofford saying she had made an honest mistake filed 
amended reports a week later 
mecham has said that his legal troubles also stem from an 
honest mistake and he accused corbin on wednesday of ducking 
the issue by delegating the job instead of taking the case to a 
grand jury 
i think he needs to be man enough to stand up and do his 
duty mecham said 
mrs mofford had no immediate reaction to collins taking over 
the case press secretary vada manager said

a group of worldfamous scientists intent on 
debunking the claims of astrologers says it is dismayed that 
president and mrs reagan use superstition and mystical 
fortune telling to make decisions 
the practice said the committee for the scientific 
investigation of claims of the paranormal harks back to ancient 
times when monarchs and emperors resorted to the musings of fortune 
tellers for advice 
we are concerned by the apparent return to medieval 
superstitition the statement said dozens of tests in recent 
years by scientists can find little if any evidence for 
astrological claims horoscopes have been shown under the most 
rigorous scientific analysis to fail completely in predicting 
future events 
the statement was released after reports on a forthcoming book 
by former white house chief of staff donald regan who says nancy 
reagan regularly consults astrologers in shaping her advice to the 
president reagan the book says also regularly reads his 
horoscope the white house later confirmed the reagans interest in 
astrology but said it did not influence any policy decisions

not all the animals running loose in new york 
city are dogs cats or freewheeling cab drivers it is a jungle out 
there 
i dont expect to see a zebra but then again this is fun city 
so youll never know said george s watford head of rescue 
services for the american society for the prevention of cruelty to 
animals 
in 28 years with the humane society watford has seen 
alligators baboons bears barn owls caimans chimpanzees and 
eagles foxes horses lambs lions mandrills and monitor lizards 
parrots peregrine falcons pigs raccoons sea turtles and sheep 
swans tarantulas and tigers 
they all make their way to special aspca preserves such as the 
room marked exotic animals at the manhattan shelter there in 
the din of baying dogs and mewling cats one can occasionally hear 
a hiss screech or roar more common to the wilds of the amazon or 
deepest africa 
last year officials say the organization captured 5304 exotic 
animals a category that includes everything but dogs and cats 
but it takes something special to turn the head of an aspca veteran 
people consider bats exotic said watford we dont we 
get a lot of them flying through new york city 
the manhattan shelter had three quail in its exotic ward one 
recent day they had been seized from a pet store because selling 
the birds is illegal two weeks earlier the brooklyn shelter 
confiscated a ram from a moslem family planning to slaughter it for 
a feast 
in december a south american cargo ship 400 miles offshore 
radioed that an osprey had crashlanded on its deck once the 
vessel was in the harbor a shelter worker was dispatched in a 
motor launch to retrieve the fisheating hawk now on the 
endangered species list 
in the greatest hits category nothing tops the burmese python 
that police discovered protecting a queens drug dealers apartment 
ive never seen anything that large anything that weighed 
more than me in the snake area and i weigh 200 pounds said 
watford the python was estimated to weigh 300 to 350 pounds it 
measured 16 feet long and at least 30 inches around at the head in 
the exotic animal room the snake stood straight up on its tail and 
sniffed the ceiling 
police told watford the diet of the guard snake had been 
fullgrown rabbits six at a time 
if it got around your neck god knows what would happen he 
said it was certainly capable of swallowing a 12yearold kid 
whole 
watford does not always know how the animals come to new york 
how does a sea turtle end up in a bathroom in upper manhattan 
he said with a shrug but he does know how they come to the 
attention of the aspca 
they run amok 
take snakes owners wake up one morning and its not where 
its supposed to be its not in the glass aquarium maybe the 
neighbor finds it in her bathtub or under her bed or in her bed 
that creates the kind of environment that is quite frightening 
sometimes the animals are involved in crimes richard a orzo 
a 32year veteran of the rescue service remembers a monkey trained 
to perform specialized burglaries the owner would cut circular 
holes in the windows of brooklyn liquor stores and send the monkey 
in for cocktails 
sometimes the animals kill two years ago a queens woman was 
found dead in her home near aquariums full of venomspitting cobras 
theyre fascinating theyre beautiful said watford 
people fall in love with snakes even the most venomous type 
just a nick and it could kill you 
often it is not humans but the animals who are imperiled 
scores of barnyard animals have been confiscated before they could 
be sacrificed in religious ceremonies 
we take a dim view of the killing of any animal said 
watford 
once captured the animals are given to zoos sent to animal 
farms or when possible released into the wild they are not 
returned to their owners keeping exotic animals is against new 
york city health codes 
the owners who sometimes have invested thousands of dollars do 
not always relinquish the beasts gracefully 
police took custody of an ocelot after the forest cat ripped 
open both arms of its mistress a bronx woman her arms were placed 
in casts and her cat was placed with the aspca 
when she came to visit shelter workers left her briefly alone 
with her pet and she was next seen trying to spirit the ocelot out 
the door cradling it in her casts

oars ripped into the teacolored charles to the cadence of the

watching to see how the shift affected their speed she took a few 
notes on a dogeared pad but she instantly detected the stronger

hatton would arrange six fiveminute races before deciding on

the anxiety level is tremendous these days hatton said 
the olympics has everyone on edge now everything is on the line 
all the time its tough mentally as well as physically 
for more than a year the lives of about a dozen elite female 
rowers have centered on the weathered boston rowing club boathouse 
down the street from harvard yard for some the old building will 
be a gateway to seoul south korea 
its come down to this and everyone is looking for the little 
edge that little extra to put them on the team said hatton a 
coxswain on the 1980 team pulled from the olympics by the us 
boycott protesting the soviet intervention in afghanistan 
except for an unlikely surge by a college team in upcoming 
races the olympic womens team will come from the brc and

when the peabody museum was established in 
1799 thousands of artisans in canton and other ports in the orient 
were crafting elaborate objects from porcelain silks ivory 
silver and rare woods for export to the west 
but the goods made by easterners for western commercial 
consumption never have been treated as a separate scholarly 
discipline or gathered in one place 
enter the peabody which calls itself the nations oldest 
continuously operating museum the museum will dedicate an 81 
million new wing to house the first permanent collection of asian 
export art in the world on may 14 
we consider the asian influence on our decorative arts second 
only to the classical influence of greece and rome said crosby 
forbes curator of the asian export collection our debt to asian 
culture and our awareness of these influences needs to be more 
emphasized 
forbes and other scholars in the field spent over 20 years 
promoting the concept of a field devoted to the disparate objects 
materials styles and destinations of asian decorative art 
the collection is a combination of 2000 pieces from the 
peabody established by the east india marine society in 1799 and 
8000 from the china trade museum of milton mass located in a 
home built by a sea captain in 1833 
the two merged in 1984 and the new museum is the first to treat 
products exported from the orient as one body of art the victoria 
and albert museum in london contains a small gallery with about 120 
items of chinese export art and other museums display random 
pieces of asian made items 
about 1000 objects are displayed in the peabody museums 
threestory new wing a welllighted and spacious area that 
features central displays explaining the key components of asian 
trade 
forbes said exports from china began as early as 1498 and 
flourished after 1557 when the portuguese settled macao giving 
westerners a formal presence in asia and opening a permanent market 
to the west 
those voyages of exploration and discovery that started in the 
15th century and attempted to find the route to asia were primarily 
to obtain spices which were sort of essential to the rich 
forbes said 
the spanish began regular trips in the late 16th century while 
the british and dutch east india trading companies were established 
in the early 17th century 
forbes said american colonists first imported goods through 
europe then set up direct trade with the orient chinese porcelain 
has been found at trading posts in jamestown and williamsburg va 
and nova scotia he said 
in the 18th century alone when the trade peaked about 40 
million pieces of porcelain were exported to europe newspapers in 
new england frequently advertised up to 20 different kinds of 
oriental cotton into the early 19th century 
asianexport decorative arts were made in china japan 
indonesia the philippines india and ceylon now known as sri 
lanka tea coffee spices textiles and porcelain accounted for 
about 90 percent of the exports the rest were special orders such 
as furniture paintings and carved wood 
the peabodys collection includes chinese porcelains owned by 
george washington and thomas jefferson a pair of lacquer card 
tables brought to salem 50 years before japan opened to trade in 
1854 a silver cup dating to 1840 depicting a rowing race between 
foreigners on the pearl river at canton and a massive moon bed 
made for the philippines centennial in 1876 
the quality of goods in asia was very high forbes said 
the materials were there you could have lacquers porcelains 
and silks that were not available in europe 
because wages were low and raw materials abundant the products 
were cheap for western consumers importers paid the local rate for 
silver and another 15 percent to 25 percent for labor compared to 
a 100 percent markup in the united states 
the influence of asian export art ranges from pavilions and 
pagodas depicted in ceramics and wallpapers to the fluting on 
teapots made by american silversmith paul revere 
in addition the community of asian artisans some 250000 in 
canton alone from 17501842 was in touch with western influences 
and applied itself to making these remarkable objects forbes

the signs are everywhere that 
panamas health system has been thrown into disarray by the 
nations political and economic crises 
an entire floor of one hospital is boarded up and closed 
thousands of doctors and nurses have been sent home on unpaid 
vacations 
pharmacists are running out of everything from heart medicine to 
surgical gloves 
were living on borrowed time said dr luis casco arias a 
prominent physician 
since panama became a cashonly society with the closing of 
banks march 4 because of us economic restrictions it has been 
hard often impossible for patients to pay their medical bills 
for hospitals and clinics to pay their workers for pharmacists to 
pay suppliers 
government hospitals began turning away all but emergency cases 
in march during a fiveweek strike by doctors and nurses demanding 
payment of their salaries 
in time patients stopped going to the dentist or seeking 
elective surgery and laboratory tests because of the money problems 
and the uncertainty 
one 28yearold woman said she has delayed a hysterectomy for 
two months and wonders if shell develop complications during the 
wait 
i told my doctor that im optimistic the woman said he 
told me hes pessimistic 
casco arias said patients with serious problems are being cared 
for 
health minister franciso sanchez cardenas said a 25 percent drop 
has been noted in the number of people seeking medical care at 
governmentrun hospitals and clinics 
the panamanian people have understood they should go for 
medical services only when it is really required he said 
sanchez denied reports from medical associations of shortages of 
food and medicines in state facilities at the same time he 
acknowledged that the cashstarved government has requested and 
received a donation of drugs from cuba and is expecting more from 
other sources 
the health ministry agreed to put the cuban antibiotics through 
laboratory tests after the national association of pharmacists 
questioned the quality of the drugs 
doctors and nurses at government clinics say they are working 
only 12 hours a week instead of the usual 40 the modern 
fourstory paitilla medical center a private hospital has closed 
off its second floor 
dr fernando boyd a dentist said the private arango clinic 
where he works is opened only half a day and half the 45member 
staff has been sent home on unpaid vacations for a month 
boyd added that some of his patients have been unable to pay 
even part of their bills 
but if somebody comes to you and is pain what are you going 
to say he said 
horacio icaza president of casa del medico the countrys 
largest medical supply firm said his sales fell to 9000 in the 
first three weeks of april from a monthly average of 500000 
before the crisis 
he added that his warehouse is 75 percent empty and some of his 
us suppliers are refusing to sell him more supplies until he pays 
his bills 
icaza said he has large and small rubber surgical gloves but is 
out of medium sizes and has run out of units for intravenous 
feeding he has casting material for setting broken bones but has 
run out of the stockings that are put on a patients foot before 
the cast is set 
icaza said he recently sold his last two tubes used in cases 
where brain fluid must be drained 
im the only supplier of those in the country icaza said 
and if you run out of those the patient is a goner 
pharmacists say they are running short of some of the most 
commonly used drugs including some heart medicines antibiotics 
and tranquilizers 
druggist manuel dominguez said his sales of tranquilizers are up 
30 percent 
demand is up because there is a lot of tension over whats 
happening in this country he said 
but psychiatrist ramiro diaz said he is seeing 30 percent fewer 
patients 
in my field we know there are people who feel down or stressed 
we call it nerves but theyd rather live with it than spend the 
50 an hour he said 
the stress level of the whole community is way up he added 
my own is too

an 18thcentury graveyard on the 
grounds of a new us forest service campground will be left intact 
through a trial policy adopted this year to recognize the religious 
views of american indians 
the gravesite which forest service archaeologist janet g 
brashler believes dates from at least 1791 contains no remains of 
any tribal members 
but the policy put into effect jan 29 by the forest service 
encompasses all human burial grounds regardless of race 
it comes down to first amendment freedom of religion rights 
brashler said 
the gravesite policy was developed in conjunction with american 
indian and archaeology groups she said it is in effect in the 
eastern and southern regions of the forest service which include 
land east of the mississippi river and will be put into effect 
nationwide if successful 
prehistoric american indian sites as well as homesteads dating 
from the 17th 18th 19th and early 20th centuries are scattered 
throughout appalachia archaeologists believe 
weve had lots of problems both at the federal and state and 
graverobber levels where desecration was taking place with 
increasing frequency said suzan harjo executive director of the 
washington dcbased national congress of american indians 
any place where there are indian remains it takes place 
although the plan specifies that the graves should be left 
undisturbed if possible it does make provisions for scientific 
study brashler said 
we need to be allowed to study and obtain samples of material 
thats going to be a bone of contention brashler said 
the policy would allow some human remains to be exhumed but 
only after the forest service consults with the tribes involved 
brashler said any human remains exhumed must be returned to the 
ground she said 
the issue is a pantribal concern brashler said it 
actually represents two conflicting world views archaeology as a 
science and what we know about descent and cultural practices and 
religious views 
the western european view of death relating to ones ancestors 
is so different than native americans view of death and 
ancestry brashler said its a deeply personal and spiritual 
thing for some of them 
tribal groups especially in the great lakes area and in the 
west were concerned that their ancestors were being unearthed from 
public lands with little concern for the tribes religious beliefs 
brashler said the new policy was sparked by complaints from 
american indians about national forests in wisconsin minnesota and 
michigan which are rich in tribal artifacts california has also 
developed a tough policy to protect gravesites brashler said 
the forest service policy requires that agency workers in each 
state deal directly with tribes to work out a plan to handle each 
specific gravesite regardless of whether it belongs to those 
tribes 
they feel that the tribal affiliation is not important 
brashler said descecration of one is descecration of all 
in west virginia where no active american indian tribes are 
left administering the policy would be slightly different she 
said 
it will involve making good faith efforts to research who the 
people are in those graves brashler said 
the tiny graveyard at seneca rocks is nearly hidden by brush 
the graves some marked by worn rocks that once were headstones 
resemble shallow trenches brashler said the indentations could 
indicate the people were buried in coffins 
the forest service archaeologist said she believed the graveyard 
was in use for 50 to 60 years one headstone contains a barely 
decipherable inscription including the year 1791 
the hill overlooking seneca rocks was a popular homesite for 
settlers in the 18th and 19th centuries brashler said walking 
through the future campground she identified several signs 
indicating people had lived there 
chips and flakes of stone unearthed when workers leveled the 
ground for the campsite show the site also was inhabited by 
american indians brashler said 
there must be some great spiritual significance the site held 
but well never know she said 
the graveyard will be preserved in place and brashler said the 
forest service may clean it up and post some explanatory signs 
archaeologists say hundreds of historical homesites are located 
throughout the region although many are hard to identify 
one difficulty of managing historic sites in the eastern 
united states is you cant see them except for such artifacts as 
stone chips brashler said theres nothing there its not like 
the big stone pyramids in mexico and egypt 
many of the sites were occupied from the postcivil war period 
to the depression but prehistoric american indian camps also are 
scattered throughout the area brashler said 
they give a really nice indication that even the mountains 
were occupied for thousands of years she said

in an era when the investment climate seems as 
changeable as the spring weather it takes a special discipline to 
think longterm in managing your money 
but many of the typical investors financial objectives require 
longterm strategies retirement planning for example or saving 
to pay a childs college tuition 
thus say many advisers on personal financial matters now may 
be a particularly appropriate time to check into stocks of 
companies that offer dividend reinvestment plans or drps 
stocks you might well say i dont want any part of 
stocks they way the market goes up 80 points down 100 and that 
computer program trading 
well the point of systematic investing through some arrangement 
like a dividend reinvestment plan is to smooth out all that 
shortterm volatility and maybe even turn it to your advantage 
the first corporate drps were created in the 1960s based on an 
idea borrowed from mutual funds where they had long been popular 
and remain so to this day 
the basic principle is simple instead of sending stockholders a 
check for their quarterly dividends the company in question 
automatically invests the payout in more shares for their accounts 
as drps spread they acquired extra features beyond the 
dividend some companies offered participants the right to invest 
additional cash at no charge 
owners of international business machines stock for example 
can invest as little as 10 or as much as 5000 each quarter at 
general motors the range is 20 to 5000 
as a further inducement some companies issued stock to drp 
participants at discounts of 3 percent to 5 percent below the 
market price though these discounts have been growing scarcer 
lately standard amp poors corp still counts 47 exchangelisted 
stocks that offer them including such familiar names as chase 
manhattan texas utilities and xerox 
even without a discount the savings on brokerage commission 
costs can be significant traditionally most companies with drps 
have charged no fees or only a modest service charge to buyers 
drps plainly are not for people who need current income from 
their savings or who are looking to make fast trading profits but 
thats just the point 
with regular investing in a drp you gain the benefit of dollar 
cost averaging your money buys more shares per dollar when the 
price is low 
if youre investing in specific companies for the long term 
dividend reinvestment offers a sound forcedsavings technique that 
could be particularly attractive for retirement plans or childrens 
funds says william brennan publisher of the financial 
newsletter brennan reports in valley forge pa 
drps come with no guarantees dollarcostaveraging wont help 
much if you do it in a stock that falls into the basement and takes 
up permanent residence there 
these programs require some good recordkeeping for tax 
purposes whats more the dividends you reinvest count as taxable 
income in the year in which they are paid even though you dont 
actually receive the money 
you wont find brokerage firms volunteering much information on 
drps since these plans bypass brokers 
but if a companys stock looks good enough to you to warrant a 
longterm commitment you can determine what sort of drp if any 
it offers by inquiring directly at its shareholder relations office 
several independent investment advisory services and investor 
groups offer information and in some cases active help in drp 
investing 
some examples 
standard amp poors offers a current brochure listing almost 600 
companies with drps price 2 write public relations dept 
standard amp poors corp 25 broadway new york ny 10004 
a more elaborate directory of some 1000 companies describing 
details of each plan is published by evergreen enterprises po 
box 763 laurel md 20707 which charges 2495

businessman guy smith met jesse jackson across a 
negotiating table in 1981 when smith was a vice president for 7up 
corp and jackson was pressuring corporations to expand 
opportunities for blacks 
they met several times with subordinates and alone coming up 
with a covenant under which 7up agreed to spend 61 million to 
improve its minority hiring and spending program 
today smith says i am a republican but if jesse is the 
democratic nominee i will vote for him 
he never one time wanted us to give something to somebody he 
wanted us to give opportunity for blacks which ultimately was 
great for the 7up business recalled smith now a phillip morris 
vice president 
it was a different side of jesse jackson that smith and other 
corporate executives saw different from the man the public had 
come to know as a fiery spokesman for black concerns who led 
street demonstrations railed against city hall blasted the 
administration in washington and spouted militant rhetoric 
the public jackson as head of his civil rights organization 
operation push people united to serve humanity was honing his 
skills as a champion headline grabber always able to seize on an 
issue or tactic that would put push in the news 
during those years he began to develop a less flamboyant side 
with the tactics of conciliatory persuasion that he is showcasing 
in his campaign for the 1988 democratic presidential nomination 
for instance he was given credit for successful mediation of 
the devastating 1980 chicago firefighters strike 22 people died 
in fires during the strike after marathon sessions with blacks 
who were insisting on affirmative action before they would unite 
with white unionists and with white firefighters and city 
officials 
that side of jackson has become more dominant in the years since 
his 1984 presidential bid 
gone are the dashikis blue jeans and leather vests that were 
the uniform of jacksons youthful protest days 
also gone is much of the confrontational rhetoric typified by 
his remarks on the day he launched push in 1971 power must not 
be blind it must be used to picket vote and if necessary to 
engage in civil disobedience we will be as nonviolent as we can 
be and as violent as we must be 
in chicago it is difficult to find many associates who dont 
offer the observation that jackson has grown and matured since 
those days 
today in impeccable business suits and silk ties jackson 
projects himself as a conciliator and mediator holding himself 
above the fray of campaign attacks and holding out the promise of 
understanding to all constituencies 
even in the heat of the new york primary when mayor ed koch 
called jackson a liar jackson brushed it off 
one former critic chicago radio commentator lu palmer says he 
set aside his misgivings about jackson after determining his ego 
wasnt as big as it used to be 
i was one of jesses greatest critics in the 70s i was not 
convinced he was as serious about the movement as he was about 
himself palmer said i had quit attending push because i was 
convinced jesse was not for real now im one of his biggest 
supporters 
but some say its the old jackson in a new package 
jesse is for jesse everything else is no 2 said marshall 
field former owner of the suntimes newspaper he declined further 
comment 
many who have been critical in the past seem reluctant to say 
anything negative about jackson today as he glows in the successes 
of his presidential campaign 
former chicago mayor jane byrne contends jackson was always 
capable of both protesting and trying to bring people together i 
dont see him any different today she said 
but jackson backers point out that times have changed since the 
south carolina native arrived in chicago as a semininary student in 
the early 1960s and jackson has changed with them 
those were the days when he was absolutely confrontational 
said bishop hh brookins of the african methodist episcopal 
church a longtime ally that was the only way he got coverage 
was to be confrontational hes much more thoughtful now than he 
once was i attribute that to maturing at the public level 
in the push days when jackson was fighting to improve the 
economic and political clout of blacks he achieved many of his 
goals through boycotts or the threat of boycotts public attacks on 
adversaries during revivalstyle push meetings and an ability to 
mobilize black followers 
recognized today as a master at using the news media jackson 
made every effort to cultivate reporters especially those from the 
black press said nate clay a former push spokesman and now editor 
of the weekly chicago metro news 
a workaholic who has skimmed several newspapers by 6 am 
jackson knew how to make headlines clay said he gave his staff 
tips on how to give reporters short snappy quotations 
he did not hesitate to call up editors and make his views 
known on editorials and stories and before long jackson was the 
one who was called by reporters for comment on the various civil 
rights stories of the day 
if i was critical of him hed almost always call and try to 
talk it out said chicago tribune columnist mike royko even if 
i was 100 percent right id spend the next three days walking 
around with my liberal guilt throbbing 
royko said jackson tried to persuade rather than intimidate him 
but a former chicago suntimes official said that jackson would 
make threatening calls unless the suntimes did exactly what he 
wanted 
he would say it was antiblack and threaten to make a 
public uproar over the matter said the newspaper official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity

on one occasion jackson saw a new black reporter on tv clay 
recalled 
he started asking around the room who is that a week or so 
later this reporter was at jesses house jesse told him he had an 
exclusive for him 
that was typical of the way jackson would cultivate anybody 
who could do him a favor clay said jesse has a knack of going 
around picking up people like some people pick up stray dogs 
he certainly was very fiery in those days said chicago 
political consultant don rose who now says his previously reported 
description of jackson conniving to grab the mantle of the slain 
dr martin luther king has been overblown 
rose said in a recent interview that the day after kings 1968 
assassination in memphis jackson asked rose to set up a couple of 
tv interviews for him in chicago 
in general conversation according to rose the two subsequently 
fell to discussing how jackson had terrific potential to become 
the leader of the movement 
but rose said there was no concerted plan as he had been quoted 
saying to engineer that eventuality 
in any event jackson for two days wore a turtleneck even in a 
king memorial service of the chicago city council stained with 
what he said was kings blood 
he told the council i come here with a heavy heart because on 
my chest is the stain of blood from dr kings head 
jacksons biographer barbara reynolds said that more than 100 
articles in the year after kings assassination reported that 
kings blood was on jacksons shirt and that jackson had cradled 
the dying leader or that he was the last person king had spoken to 
all these details are disputed by some king associates who were 
present on the balcony of the lorraine motel in memphis tenn 
where king was shot 
jackson has been vague in more resent interviews on the events 
in memphis he said in an interview on televisions phil donahue 
show in april that it was not true he had not touched the dying 
king he said he ran up to the balcony after a sheet had been put 
over the body i then got up from a very bloody scene he said 
blood was everywhere 
mistrust of jackson lingers from those days kings widow 
coretta scott king and some other civil rights colleagues refuse 
to endorse jackson 
in his campaign jackson frequently cites his ties to king but 
the rev hosea williams an atlanta city councilman said jackson 
could never work as a team person with king or other members 
of the southern christian leadership conference 
williams recalled a staff meeting where jackson stubbornly 
challenged kings ideas 
it got so ridiculous that dr king got up and walked out as 
he got to the door he turned around and he said jesse if you 
want to start your own national orgnization you can do so but you 
dont have to destroy me 
ultimately jackson split with sclc leaders over finances and 
the leadership of the operation breadbasket arm of sclc which he 
headed 
jacksons longtime friend and pastor the rev clay evans 
contended some were jealous of jackson because of his stature and 
support 
in chicago he was the movement evans said without him 
there wouldnt have been any movement 
jacksons fame grew as he took on everything from housing 
discrimination and youth problems and signed minority opportunity 
pacts with such companies as anheuser busch burger king heublein 
and coca cola 
one day he would be launching boycott against coca cola telling 
blacks dont choke on coke the next day he might be pledging 
to defeat a proposed police chief or school board member 
nobody wants to be on pushs socalled list said heublein 
spokesman erik pierce he wasnt just a ragtag individual he was 
head of a significant organization 
push had 32 chapters nationwide and jacksons weekly sermons 
were carried on live radio every saturday 
i think anybody that was in business knew about jesse 
jackson said frank sellinger former head of schlitz brewery 
the schlitzpush pact was signed before sellinger arrived in the 
late 1970s but he said he heard from jackson later when jackson 
fought the brewerys efforts to force out an unprofitable black 
distributor 
if push decided to get on your case about something you got a 
real fight on your hands said evans push became the eyes the 
ears and the feet of the black community 
those who dealt with jackson say he was as canny and in control 
behind closed corporate doors as he was firing up his followers 
it wasnt a lot of yelling but it was youre going to do 
this said pierce of heublein 
he was very businesslike i found him to be tough but fair 
said former schlitz spokesman ben barkin he said jackson made it 
clear his demands were either or else 
former heublein spokesman john cox said he never dreaded going 
to the push negotiations jackson was electric and charismatic 
and a sharp negotiator

the inmate who beat debow was placed in the same cell even 
though empty cells were available 
kuehn said the state had repeatedly warned the city its jail was 
being operated unsafely the city was in an indefensible 
position he said debows attacker was only the bullet the 
weapon was trained and held by the city 
carr called the case the avalanche that broke the camels 
back if not that it would be something else 
east st louis has long suffered a rough ugly reputation its 
history of gangsters gambling dens and gun battles in the streets 
has been updated only in the particulars especially in politics 
last year for example a candidate for alderman was arrested 
hours before the polls opened for barging into a radio station and 
threatening to shoot another candidate the host of a callin show 
charges were dismissed 
since 1980 guilty pleas have been entered by a police captain 
who took bribes a sergeant who sold drugs a precinct committeeman 
who committed murder and a st clair county board member charged 
with unlawful use of a weapon he shot at a man he mistakenly 
thought stole his car said county states attorney john baricevic 
two of last years mayoral candidates were convicted in years 
past of extortion and a third was found guilty of forging 
government checks and mail fraud one had also pleaded guilty to 
trying to arrange anothers murder 
gentry himself faces trial on charges of misusing city money to 
buy campaign advertisements for officer other charges are pending 
against officers administrative assistant and a second man a 
convicted rapist and unsuccessful aldermanic candidate 
the city denies allegations that some police go without cars or 
radios or cope with equipment in dangerously poor repair baricevic 
said some police have bought their own radios and detectives have 
used their own cars 
if a cop gets shot at how does he get help he doesnt 
baricevic said if he tries to get away in some of the 
cars youve got to roll down the window to get out of the car 
because of the everrising crime problem state troopers were 
called in two years ago to help fight gangs and armed bandits 
preying on motorists 
the public response was overwhelming said bob fletcher 
state police spokesman people would wave to them from windows 
its like the vets from world war ii coming into towns into france 
its the kind of things that brings tears to a cops eyes 
as of may 1 the state police had made 2250 criminal arrests 
and robberies and gang activities are down said capt bobby henry 
the city has received other assistance operating on grants the 
east st louis community foundation established an alcohol 
treatment center and schoolwork program but the association 
fizzled in 1987 
former un ambassador donald mchenry an east st louis native 
and a former chairman of the community foundation said that 
despite hard work from many residents and the outside aid most 
of it was probably wasted due to inappropriate programs 
corruption inefficiency and poor coordination 
a former foundation director offers another assessment city 
leaders said handy lindsey make their own rules about 
everything if you come to that community and are not prepared to 
play by their rules they run you out 
nobody seriously gives a damn about east st louis lindsey 
said i think people who run it give a damn about their own 
personal fortunes 
still lindsey and others agree hope lies along the riverfront 
bonds have been issued to build a port a waste recycling facility 
and middle and upperincome housing 
but some are skeptical the project will even get off the ground 
because of deadlines and legal questions theres very little 
evidence the projects will come to fruition said barry 
freedman executive director of target 2000 a private economic 
development firm 
a management company has sued the city for breach of contract 
alleging that a man acting for officer tried to solicit a 500000 
finders fee and when no money was paid the company was illegally 
dropped from two riverfront projects 
even if officers plans fail freedman is confident the 
riverfront will be developed he mentioned other plans for 
rejuvenation including a proposal to extend a st louis park 
across the river and make a national park 
freedman admits that promoting the city isnt easy 
people tend to discount it automatically he said once 
they get past it theyre surprised at what they find the 
perception is worst than the reality

banks will reopen for nearly normal 
operations next monday after being closed for two months because of 
panamas economic and political crisis the president of the 
bankers association announced tuesday 
edgardo lasso the bankers association president said in a 
television interview that to avoid a run on the banks the amount 
of cash depositors can withdraw will be restricted 
we are trying to reactivate the economy of the country 
lasso said 
we will take care of the public in all banking activities 
within the restrictions set by the governments banking commission 
late in march he said 
conditions for reopening the banks limit withdrawals to 25 
percent of checking account balances as of march 3 the day the 
government ordered banks closed it sets a maximum of 10000 with 
the rest frozen for 90 days 
withdrawals of up to 50 may be made from savings accounts one 
month after banks reopen 
payment of interest is restricted and subject to cash 
availability in each bank 
the commission has promoted a gradual reopening of the banks on 
april 18 it let them begin accepting deposits because of limits 
on withdrawals however about 75 percent of the checks deposited 
bounced analysts and business people said 
a week later about a dozen additional services were resumed 
including handling letters of credit collecting outstanding loans 
transferring funds within panama and making foreign exchange 
transfers but business people said the operations were largely on 
paper and did little to help resolve their problems of liquidity 
and credit 
the association represents 93 of the 117 banks operating here

xerox corp expects to continue nudging its 
share of the world copier market higher with a new generation of 
copiers offering more features at higher prices 
the new 50 series unveiled tuesday is named in honor of the 50th 
anniversary of the 1938 invention of plainpaper copying it 
includes xeroxs first personal copier a model made for it by 
sharp corp of japan 
the new copiers are the successors to the 10 series which 
helped the company begin to regain market share from japanese 
rivals after its inception in 1982 
wayland hicks a xerox executive vice president said xerox 
should continue recapturing market share from the japanese with the 
new machines although the recovery will come more slowly than did 
the rapid decline of the 1970s and early 1980s 
overall i would say theyre pretty impressive said eugene 
glazer who follows xerox for dean witter reynolds inc 
xerox long had resisted introducing a personal copier saying it 
could not justify the investment necessary to compete with japanese 
companies such as sharp canon inc and ricoh ltd that dominate 
the low end of the market 
glazer said that even now the companys new personal copier is 
not key to the companys strategy it required only a small 
investment by xerox because it is being manufactured by sharp 
the xerox personal copier is a close cousin of sharps z55 
except for the exterior casing a small change in the paperfeeding 
mechanism and alterations in the cartridges that make it impossible 
for sharp cartridges to be used in xerox copiers and vice versa 
the list price of 1295 for the basic model is about the same 
as the list price of 1299 charged by sharp for its z55 actual 
retail prices for both could be substantially lower 
xerox makes the other new copiers itself the machines range in 
size up to the 5090 duplicator which starts at 145000 makes up 
to 135 copies a minute and can bind pages automatically 
chester carlson the inventor of the dry copying process 
created the first xerographic image on oct 22 1938 his efforts 
to market the invention were met with an enthusiastic lack of 
interest he later recalled until the former haloid co of 
rochester ny picked it up in the late 1950s haloid became 
xerox corp 
while the new xerox copiers can not be compared directly with 
their predecessors because they have more features the prices are 
about 5 to 10 percent higher than 10 series machines with similar 
copying speeds said roy haythorn a vice president for marketing 
haythorn said the strength of the japanese yen made it possible 
for xerox to raise prices while remaining competitive with japanese 
rivals xerox recently announced price increases on its 10 series 
copiers 
the personal copier will be sold mainly through retail stores 
and office products dealers and will be available to resellers and 
agents later this month ordertaking for the big 5090 duplicator 
will begin in major cities in the second half of the year 
the rest of the line will be rolled out starting in major 
midwestern cities beginning this month

texaco inc is counterattacking takeover 
strategist carl icahn its largest shareholder and most threatening 
potential antagonist 
alleging that icahn has violated securities laws texaco asked a 
federal court tuesday to thwart his ability to use his texaco stock 
in moves against the oil giant 
the suit filed at us district court in white plains ny 
asked the court for an order blocking icahn from soliciting 
proxies acquiring additional texaco stock or voting the shares he 
already holds representing a 148 percent stake in the company 
the nations thirdlargest oil company also asked the court to 
void icahns nomination of five candidates including himself 
for texacos 14member board in elections to be held at the 
companys june 7 annual meeting in tulsa okla 
texaco said the purpose of icahns activities was either to 
force the company to buy back his shares at a premium to force its 
acquisition by a third party or to acquire texaco and liquidate its 
assets in each case netting large profits 
in seeking that goal texaco claimed icahn attempted to 
deceive investors and manipulate the market for texaco stock 
with false and misleading statements the company said icahns 
group also had an illegal secret agreement to coordinate its stock 
purchases with those of another substantial buyer who was not 
named in the suit 
icahn repsponded with a onesentence statement issued at his new 
york office saying we believe the lawsuit is without merit and 
will vigorously defend our right to communicate with other texaco 
shareholders 
since last fall when he began buying texaco shares at prices 
between 29 and 34 per share icahn has been an outspoken critic 
of the companys management he has offered to withdraw his slate 
of directors if the company puts itself up for sale for 55 a share 
or more which texaco officals have refused to do 
texaco stock fell 62 cents to 49 a share tuesday in new york 
stock exchange composite trading 
federal judge gerard goettel scheduled a hearing for all parties 
at 10 am thursday 
icahns involvement with texaco began in the last months of its 
multibilliondollar legal battle with pennzoil co in 1985 a 
houston court ruled that texaco before buying getty oil co had 
improperly interfered with pennzoils bid to acquire part of getty 
it awarded pennzoil a judgment that stood at 103 billion in 
april 1987 when texaco filed for federal bankruptcy court 
protection to avoid having to post a similar amount while appealing 
the houston judgment 
late last year icahn interjected himself as a mediator between 
the two companies in december without his participation the 
companies agreed on a 3 billion settlement that formed the 
keystone of texacos bankruptcy reorganization plan 
texaco emerged from bankruptcy last month and paid the 3 
billion to pennzoil it subsequently expanded its original plan to 
sell 3 billion of assets to 5 billion mindful of the threat that 
icahn might attempt to take over the company in order to sell it 
off piecemeal to raise the value of his shares 
among other things texacos suit alleged that icahn said he 
did not intend to dispose of his stock or seek control of the 
company when in fact his true purpose was to force the sale of the 
company acquire the company himself and liquidate it or to extract 
greenmail from the company 
texaco also contended that 
icahn illegally exploited confidential information he acquired 
concerning the status of the settlement talks with pennzoil in 
order to acquire part of his texaco stake 
icahns proxy for the slate of directors he plans to run 
fails to disclose important information about both icahn and his 
nominees including previous sec charges of serious violations 
of federal proxy rules and material arrangements or 
understandings he had made with members of his proxy slate

mexico will maintain its current level of 
crude production until opec agrees to cut its own production 
according to the government newspaper 
energy secretary fernando hiriart was quoted tuesday in the 
newspaper el nacional as saying mexico would maintain its export 
target of 136 million barrels a day until the 13member cartel 
reaches agreement on a production cut 
mexico the worlds sixth largest oil producer was one of 
several nonopec producers that last week held talks with the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries about reducing output 
in a joint effort to bolster sagging world prices 
hiriart said opec had not rejected the proposal and would 
reconsider it in the coming months 
opec wound up several days of meetings monday in vienna 
austria without reaching agreement on the production cutback 
proposal 
the cuts were to be made in conjunction with mexico and five 
other nonopec producers which offered to lower their output by 5 
percent or about 200000 barrels a day if opec members did the same 
other noncartel producers involved in the talks were egypt 
china malaysia oman and angola 
while not an opec member mexico carefully monitors its 
decisions and often follows its lead on pricing and production 
policies 
the nations economy is heavily dependent on its oil industry 
which is the no 1 source of foreign revenue needed to service its 
foreign debt of about 100 billion the second highest in the 
developing world after brazil 
in an effort to ease the oil dependence president miguel de la 
madrid has pushed in recent years to expand sales of nonoil goods 
to foreign buyers 
a recent report from the national institute of statistics said 
the nation earned 18 billion in petroleum sales in the first 
three months of this year compared to 35 billion in nonoil 
exports 
in all of last year the nation gained 79 billion from crude 
sales a 412 percent increase over 1986 when oil prices plummeted 
on the world market 
the united states bought nearly 47 percent of mexicos oil 
exports last year followed by spain with 152 percent and japan 
with 139 percent according to pemex the staterun oil company 
last july the government boosted its export volume to 136 
million barrels a day after maintaining an export target of 132 
million barrels a day in the first half of 1987 
prior to the 1986 collapse in oil prices the daily export 
platform had been 15 million barrels

a jurys failure to reach a verdict on charges 
that two former bank executives defrauded continental illinois 
national bank amp trust co shouldnt deter other probes of such 
whitecollar crime federal prosecutors say 
we sent up the best trial lawyer to try an extraordinarily 
complex case they did a good job us attorney anton valukas 
said tuesday the verdict is not going to deter us in any of our 
bankfraud cases 
after a 6week trial the jury was hopelessly deadlocked 
and could not reach a consensus tuesday in the cases of former 
continental executive john lytle and william patterson former 
executive of the nowdefunct penn square bank of oklahoma city 
the jury acquitted codefendant jere sturgis an oil contractor 
from tulsa okla of wire fraud 
the government maintained that patterson manipulated his 
debtplagued codefendants in schemes to save his own failing bank 
by defrauding continental 
continental nearly collapsed in 1984 following a run on deposits 
sparked partly by revelations of bad energy loans and survived 
mainly because of a 45 billion government bailout 
patterson was a penn square vice president until the banks july 
1982 collapse and lytle headed continental illinois 
energylending division 
the government charged that lytle caught in spiraling personal 
debt to finance a luxurious lifestyle accepted kickbacks from 
patterson in exchange for financing highrisk energy loans for penn 
square customers in 1981 and 1982 
the indictment cited lytles involvement in 44 million in loans 
made by continental to 12 penn square customers many without any 
documentation 
i am very disappointed lytle said after us district judge 
milton shadur declared a mistrial after a week of deliberations 
i had hoped for a resolution 
valukas said he would huddle for a few days with assistant 
prosecutors before deciding whether to seek another trial 
outside the courtroom patterson and his attorney warren 
bickford had nothing to say to reporters but in oklahoma city 
another patterson attorney burck bailey said he was disappointed 
we were hopeful that the jury would return a verdict of not 
guilty but of course were pleased on the other hand that there 
was no guilty verdict returned bailey said 
sturgis was jubilant after the jury found him innocent 
what can i say the dream came true he said 
attorneys for lytle and patterson contended continental was 
saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive 
lending policy not because of a fraud scheme 
lytle and sturgis were accused of engaging in a related 
buyback investment scheme that began with lytle buying into 
sturgis oil operations in may 1981 
sturgis allegedly bought lytle out less than a year later at 
triple the original investment to improve his chances of getting a 
continental loan through lytle prosecutors said 
the buyback scheme was devised as a way for lytle to clear much 
of his personal debt and for sturgis who was being pursued by 
creditors over 100 million in business loans to find a new 
lending source prosecutors said in closing arguments

notes usg issued to acquire masonite corp in 1984 the lawsuit 
said

valuable and proprietary information about usgs financial 
condition and longterm business prospects the suit said

bargainers for chrysler corp and 
the united auto workers met through the night in attempting to 
smooth out by today some lastminute snags in a proposed labor 
contract covering 66000 autoworkers 
negotiators who stopped only for meals from tuesday morning on 
had hoped to wrap up the contract by tuesday night but by evening 
uaw president owen bieber and chrysler vice president anthony st 
john said they still had to resolve several unspecified major 
issues 
weve got some issues were both having some difficulties 
with st john said late tuesday were sort of in a holding 
pattern 
nevertheless union officials said they still expected a 
settlement today 
bieber said the lastminute snags were a normal part of the 
bargaining process and would not keep negotiators from working 
until they reach a settlement 
bieber and uaw vice president marc stepp spent much of tuesday 
meeting with st john and other chrysler officials at the socalled 
little big table where they use their authority to settle 
issues including contract economics that cant be resolved at 
lowerlevel negotiations 
the two sides were working to fit an industrypattern contract 
established last fall at ford motor co and general motors corp to 
the muchsmaller chrysler 
the pattern contract already includes 3 percent lumpsum bonus 
payments instead of wage increases in 1989 and 1990 but 
negotiators must settle on the amount of funding for a crucial 
jobprotection program 
that program requires the company to continue paying workers it 
otherwise would lay off for any reason other than slow sales until 
funding runs out 
workers also were expecting a socalled signing bonus similar to 
the 2120 they each received for ratifying a threeyear agreement 
in 1985 
if it doesnt include an upfront bonus that would make 
ratification difficult at my plant said john danski president 
of local 1264 at chryslers sterling heights stamping plant 
theres all this money flowing out of chrysler right now like 
lee iacoccas 179 million in 1987 earnings danski said i 
feel that our workers should get a piece too 
under the pattern profitsharing formula chrysler workers would 
have received an average of 1800 to 2000 each union officials 
said but unless the money is presented as a signing bonus 
chrysler workers wont get 1987 profitsharing 
both sides have withdrawn several demands that didnt fit the 
fordgm pattern 
chryslers current threeyear contract expires sept 14 but 
would be replaced by a twoyear pact as soon as members ratify one 
once the two sides reach a settlement it must be approved by 
the 140member national chrysler council before it can be submitted 
to the rankandfile for a vote the council meeting could occur as 
soon as friday if a settlement is reached today 
on monday the uaw announced tentative settlements covering 
about 7000 wisconsin workers who were employed by amc when 
chrysler bought it in august and a local agreement covering 6500 
of them who work at plants in kenosha wis 
the settlements cleared the way for a final push toward 
agreement on the national chrysler contract which will cover about 
1200 wisconsin workers after a 5500worker assembly in kenosha 
closes at years end

britain said today it would investigate the 
kuwaiti governments acquisition of a 22 percent stake in oil giant 
british petroleum co plc to determine whether the investment harms 
the public interest 
the department of trade and industry said it would refer the 
acquisition made by the kuwaiti governments londonbased 
investment vehicle the kuwait investment office to the 
monopolies and mergers commission 
trade secretary lord young said the implications of bp coming 
under the influence or control of a government with substantial oil 
interests and which is a member of opec raised questions of public 
interest 
britain the worlds fifthlargest oil producer is not a member 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and hasnt 
cooperated with the cartels efforts to control prices via 
production restraints 
bp shares were down about 9 cents to 499 on londons stock 
exchange at about midday 
the monopolies commission will deliver its report within four 
months the trade department said 
the investigation does not necessarily reflect a government 
intention to force the kuwaiti government to sell any of its stake 
but might serve as a warning against further purchases 
the kuwait investment office which refused to comment on the 
referral has said it is only interested in the bp stake as a 
longterm investment it has not indicated any plans for a takeover 
bid 
last week bp chairman sir peter walters told shareholders at 
their annual meeting that the kuwaiti stake is a higher 
shareholding than one would wish to see and that it created 
potential uncertainty about the companys future 
oil industry analysts said the government would be breaking new 
ground in studying the stake but some discounted the possibility 
that kuwait would attempt to acquire bp 
theres just no great takeover story in this said carol 
bell an oil industry analyst with the london investment firm 
phillips and drew ltd 
the kuwait investment office has accrued the stake over the last 
six months it began acquiring bp shares after the government sold 
off its remaining 315 percent stake in the oil company in the fall

attorney general edwin meese iii was urged by 
his friend e robert wallach to get involved in a 
telecommunications industry issue at a time when meese owned 
14000 in regional bell stock administration sources say 
meese subsequently obtained a white house waiver permitting him 
to make a decision and then approved a reversal of the justice 
departments previous position urging a federal judge to lift 
restrictions that were barring the regional bell companies to enter 
various new types of business 
meese whose regional telephone stock holdings and meetings with 
regional bell executives have been under criminal investigation 
received wallachs advice in a memo in middecember 1986 according 
to the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
james rocap a lawyer representing the attorney general in a 
nearlyyearlong criminal investigation of meeses activities said 
tuesday he had no knowledge that mr meese ever saw or read the 
memo 
rocap said that wallachs memo had nothing to do with 
meeses decision to seek a white house waiver permitting the 
attorney general to approve the reversal in justice department 
position 
the decision to seek the waiver was based solely on the advice 
of the attorney generals staff out of an abundance of caution 
said rocap 
wallach is now under indictment for alleged racketeering in the 
wedtech scandal in which meese remains under criminal 
investigation in addition it was wallach who got meese involved 
in a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline project which is another part of 
the ongoing criminal investigation of the attorney general 
the independent counsel investigating meese also is examining 
the 40000ayear job held by meeses wife and funded by a 
washington real estate family which is leasing space to the justice 
department 
according to the sources the memo from wallach to meese said 
the justice departments antitrust division was making major 
decisions in the telecommunications industry breakup wallach said 
the decisions appeared to be going in the correct direction but 
that meese should involve himself in the issue said the sources 
wallach said in the memo that he based his comments on a lunch 
with mh whom the sources identified as michael horowitz the 
former counsel for policy analysis and law at the white house 
office of management and budget 
horowitz said in an interview tuesday that he was beginning to 
delve into telephone industry issues as a private washington lawyer 
at the time that he had lunch with wallach horowitz said that he 
did not recall any details of the lunch but that the two men may 
have discussed telecommunications issues 
horowitz had joined the firm of dickstein shapiro and morin 
and wallach was of counsel to the firm which was analyzing for 
the regional bell companies factual submissions they had made to a 
consultant peter huber huber was hired by the justice department 
to help the antitrust division determine whether restrictions on 
the regional bell companies should be lifted wallachs memo refers 
to the huber report said rocap 
on jan 20 1987 meese obtained a waiver from thenwhite house 
counsel peter wallison declaring that meese and his wifes 
telephone stock holdings were not substantial enough to influence 
him or to cause the public to question his integrity 
on feb 2 1987 meese approved a reversal in justice department 
position and asked a federal judge overseeing the breakup of atampt 
to lift most of the restrictions on the types of business which the 
regional bell telephone companies could enter the restrictions 
included bans on making telephone equipment and providing 
longdistance and computer services 
independent counsel james mckay has been trying to determine 
whether meese may have violated federal conflictofinterest laws 
by becoming involved in the issue when he owned stock in the 
regional bell companies 
the white house waiver was based partly on incorrect or 
incomplete information supplied to wallisons office by the 
attorney generals staff 
the stock was worth 14000 but the attorney generals staff 
told wallisons staff it was worth 9611 in addition wallison 
wasnt told that meese already had met with executives of four of 
the companies in 1985 and 1986 the executives urged that the 
restrictions on their companies be lifted 
rocap says the meetings with the bell executives were courtesy 
calls which did not constitute substantial involvement by meese 
in the issue

showers a little cooler generally good conditions for crops that

the european economic community 
commission said wednesday that most eec states have made 
signficant progress in adopting eec law designed to prevent 
major industrial accidents 
eec environment commissioner stanley clinton davis while 
calling this encouraging said there was a need for a better 
inspection service in many member states 
the eec commission has pressed the 12 eec states to adopt its 
safety regulations after the november 1986 accident at sandoz 
switzerland when large quantities of poisonous chemicals were 
discharged into the rhine river 
eec law forces industries that store or use dangerous chemicals 
to reduce chances of an accident through strict safety measures and 
public information campaigns it also compels member states to 
ensure their industries apply the law and provide regular 
information about accidents to the commission 
most member nations have amended their laws to comply with the 
eec regulations clinton davis said in a statement 
the only countries that have not taken any action are italy and 
greece according to the commission

ltv corp today announced a bankruptcy 
reorganization plan that calls for no further layoffs or plant 
closings but includes scaling back steel operations and 
restructuring the company around existing business units 
dallasbased ltvs board of directors has already approved the 
plan which will be submitted to creditors of the 
steelandaerospace giant for consideration said raymond a hay 
chairman and chief executive officer 
ltvs bankruptcy filed in july 1986 is one of the largest in 
corporate history liabilities total about 6 billion and include a 
2 billion liability to the governmentrun pension benefit guaranty 
corp ltvs largest creditor 
principal components of the reorganized ltv will be a smaller 
but major steel company concentrating on flatrolled products two 
aerospacedefense operating groups and a streamlined energy 
products company sized for todays market place hay said 
todays action reflects our commitment to emerge from chapter 
11 as quickly as possible with a strong reorganized company that 
will be competitive in each of the industries we serve hay said 
the settlement of claims and the financial restructuring of 
the company as proposed in the plan are major steps in 
fulfillment of that commitment hay said 
hay said he doubted the company would emerge from chapter 11 
this year because all creditors would have to agree on the 
reorganization plan which would then be submitted to bankruptcy 
court 
bankruptcycourt protection under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy laws gives a beleaguered company a reprieve from 
creditors while it devises a plan to stay in business and pay its 
debts 
while hay said he anticipated no additional layoffs or plant 
closings he noted that the company is studying several 
costcutting options and does not plan to reopen any plant it has 
already closed 
ltv has 48115 employees worldwide 
the reorganization plan also includes improving the bar segment 
of ltvs steel business which hay said has been consistently 
unprofitable 
this is the most difficult part of the plan since we cannot 
come out of chapter 11 with any unprofitable businesses he said 
since 1986 more than 35000 claims have been filed against ltv 
although some were thrown out or discovered to be duplicates that 
leaves about 32000 claims to be addressed in the reorganization 
plan 
ltv has also been feuding with the pension benefit guarantee 
corp over steel pension plans the agency took over the plans in 
1987 but then turned them back to ltv arguing that the company 
should have to fund them 
ltv has argued it cant afford to do that and the matter is in 
court hay said the three ltv pension plans involved will remain 
terminated in the interim although he expects the pbgc to see a 
substantial recovery of the money ltv owes it 
the cost associated with these pension plans was one of the 
major factors that put ltv into chapter 11 hay said the 
reduction of costs resulting from their termination is crucial to 
the companys successful reorganization

sears penney and montgomery ward the names 
once dominated american retailing but growing competition from 
specialty retailers and discount stores keeps challenging the 
giants to rethink the business they helped create 
the way they used to do business known as general 
merchandising isnt working anymore 
its a very mature industry said joseph ronning a retail 
industry analyst with the investment firm brown brothers harriman 
inc mature means there is little opportunity for growth 
as a result sears roebuck and co the nations largest 
retailer is retooling its sales strategy and revamping its 
management structure 
jc penney co inc the fourthlargest retailer already 
enjoying some success from its shift to apparel is moving its 
headquarters from new york to texas to cut costs 
and montgomery ward amp co the 11thlargest retailer is going 
private just three years after many observers expected it to go out 
of business 
at their height sears penney and montgomery ward stores 
numbered in the thousands where they had no branches consumers 
could buy from their catalogs 
but changes in american society affected the way consumers 
shopped and the way these companies did business 
the 70s was an era where people went to shopping malls and 
had more time said barbara loren a consultant with lorensnyder 
marketing inc in troy mich 
in the 1980s ms loren said working women have less time to 
shop and when they need an item they go to the store where they 
are most likely to find it increasingly specialty retailers are 
the place they turn 
ms loren cited toys r us as a specialty retailer that has taken 
away business from general merchandisers 
i know toys r us will have the best selection and the price is 
right she said i know i am going to come out with what i 
want 
home improvement stores such as home depot and electronics 
stores such as circuit city also drained business away 
the specialists were clearly becoming the leaders in the 
industry said bernard f brennan chairman of montgomery ward 
if we didnt begin to specialize we didnt have much of a chance 
to survive 
a further toll was exacted by discount store chains such as k 
mart and walmart which offered name brands at lower prices while 
general merchandisers sold goods under their own labels 
penney was the first to change in 1983 the company began to 
move toward specialty retailing by focusing on its clothing lines 
it discontinued hardware and automotive items and closed 
unprofitable stores 
the strategy worked penney in business for 86 years has seen 
its profitability improve dramatically 
it was doordie at montgomery ward in 1985 after years of 
losses the retailer closed its catalog operation and weakest 
stores and eliminated moneylosing lines 
we clearly went to certain categories in which we had consumer 
acceptance already brennan said in an interview 
the 116yearold montgomery ward is now a specialty retailer 
concentrating on appliances apparel automotive items and home 
furnishings 
but sears headed by edward a brennan brother of montgomery 
wards chairman has been slow to catch on to new trends and has 
become a follower instead of the industry leader it once was 
they were the biggest and most powerful the mostly likely to 
be bound by tradition than anyone else said monroe h 
greenstein an analyst with bear stearns amp co 
the attitude at sears was this is what sears is what weve 
always been and what well continue to be he said as a result 
the 102yearold sears stagnated 
the company tried to capitalize on its strong points starting a 
chain of paint and hardware stores in 1983 but not until 1987 did 
sears begin a push into specialty retailing 
its first steps were through acquiring other retailers such as 
western auto stores now it is experimenting with neighborhood 
stores outlets focusing on specific merchandise lines such as 
home fashions 
in its fullline stores the company is trying to jazz up its 
image teaming with mcdonalds corp and walt disney co to market 
clothing toys and other merchandise and while it has sold 
appliances only under its own kenmore label sears will now offer 
brand names a strategy working for montgomery ward 
sears also recognizes its internal structure must change in 
march the company announced it would overhaul its staff reducing 
the number of management levels and making each part of the 
business more independent it also wants to cut its costs which 
some analysts call the highest in the business 
sears merchandise group chairman michael c bozic indicated 
sears has become a giant bureaucracy that has to be more 
manageable we want to measure everything in a smaller arena 
he said in an interview 
some analysts are cautiously optimistic sears can do it 
greenstein said sears plans should increase their market share 
but just how sucessful the company will be is anybodys guess 
walter loeb an analyst with morgan stanley amp co predicted the 
restructuring would be a difficult process that has to go slowly 
to be careful not to step on any toes but that should pay off 
more important loeb said sears has to be more responsive to 
what the consumer wants 
ronning of brown brothers harriman was skeptical noting 
sears continuing growth in financial services through its coldwell 
bankers real estate allstate insurance and dean witter reynolds 
investment operations 
sears is a company shifting from a retailer to a financial 
services company ronning said that is pretty much what the 
thrust of the company is 
montgomery ward however is a proven success story before 
brennan became chairman in 1985 the retailer owned by mobil 
corp was losing money by transforming itself into a chain of 
what montgomery ward calls valuedriven specialty stores it 
became a profitable and attractive property that found the 
financial backing to go private 
brennan said his company will continue to develop its specialty 
format but he doesnt see it branching into other directions 
we are very comfortable with our structure he said 
penney is hoping to reduce its overhead by moving to texas the 
company wont say how many managers will relocate but some reports 
put the number as low as 15 percent 
theyve done a very expeditious job of replacing management 
with qualified people said loeb it may be disruptive but 
wont hurt them long term 
penney wont fall behind retail trends by being in texas 
because todays technology including teleconferencing and 
satellites will ease the way ms loren said adding you dont 
have to be living in new york to accomplish their goals

department stores have to be special these days 
to hold on to their share of the retail market 
they have to offer something that you cant find somewhere 
else said barbara loren a consultant with lorensnyder 
marketing inc in troy mich 
competition from specialty retailers who have taken business 
away from general merchandisers like sears jc penney and 
montgomery ward has put big department store owners on the 
defensive as well 
consumers who flocked to a lazarus or may department store for 
clothing electronics and toys often turn now to stores like 
limited circuit city and toys r us 
as a result department stores as a whole have very very 
limited growth potential said fred wintzer an analyst with the 
investment firm alex brown amp sons inc in baltimore 
some stores such as bloomingdales and nordstrom are perceived 
as unique with natiowide appeal and therefore can move into new 
markets and win new customers 
customer service also can set department stores apart from the 
specialty crowd but its been a problem for some companies 
tackling the service issue means more than adding sales help and 
making merchandise returns easier stephen e watson chairman of 
daytonhudson department stores co said it also may involve 
changing store layout and appearance 
the issue of how the store looks and its presentation is 
important said watson noting that consumers dont want to buy 
new clothes in a rundown drab store 
it also means improving the merchandise mix which today means 
updating fashion lines so a department store can better compete 
with specialty apparel retailers 
the strategy has worked but it also has changed the image of 
the department store industry and moved the stores in the direction 
of specialty retailing 
they are purveyors of the current fashion image said 
joseph ronning an analyst with brown brothers harriman inc 
department stores have evolved from being true department stores 
to being what are primarily fashion stores one of the best 
success stories in department stores is rh macy amp co inc said 
ronning crediting edward s finkelstein the retailers chairman 
for turning the company around 
finkelstein came in and made major changes in the herald 
square store gussied up the first floor put in more inventory 
per square foot the analyst said 
macy also revamped the merchandise in all its stores and in the 
process won praise as a retailing innovator 
other department store owners also recognize their problems and 
are trying to resolve them crumbling downtown stores are being 
refurbished and newer stores in shopping malls are also getting 
makeovers batus inc the owner of marshall fields plans to 
spend 110 million just to renovate the chains flagship store in 
downtown chicago 
monroe h greenstein an analyst with bear stearns amp co cited 
dillard department stores a growing chain in the midwest and may 
department stores co the nations seventhlargest retailer as 
being among the nations strongest department store owners 
they have been more flexible with the changing times said 
greenstein some department store companies learned too late they 
should have changed their oldfashioned ways gimbels failed to 
keep up with the times and went out of business 
other examples of how not to run a department store company were 
associated dry goods corp and federated department stores inc 
ronning said both companies poor use of assets left them 
vulnerable to takeovers associated was bought out by may in 1986 
and federated is being acquired by campeau corp 
analysts dont expect much growth in department stores but they 
also dont foresee trouble for the industry as a whole 
they continue to have a future said greenstein but you 
have to be a strong operator

a consumer in search of a television tablecloth 
or jacket has a variety of stores where he can shop his choice 
likely will depend on how much he wants to spend the brand hes 
looking for and the time he has available 
the options include specialty stores department stores 
discount stores general merchandisers and hypermarkets 
analysts point out that the distinctions among retailers are 
becoming more and more blurred for example department stores have 
taken on a more specialized slant by concentrating on apparel and 
supermarkets are selling more general merchandise 
these are the major categories of retailers and the markets they 
serve 
specialty stores these concentrate on a specific type of 
product such as apparel home improvement items or toys they can 
be independent stores or part of a chain such as gap home depot 
toys r us and kinney shoe 
specialty stores appeal to consumers because they offer a wide 
selection of items within one category of merchandise theyre also 
smaller than other retailers and less timeconsuming to shop some 
specialty retailers in particular fashion stores offer a certain 
image that a consumer may be looking for 
discount stores these offer a variety of merchandise 
categories including national brands at lower prices they offer 
the convenience of onestop shopping and onestop checkouts 
discount stores include chains such as walmart k mart venture 
and target 
hypermarkets such stores as biggs and hypermart usa offer the 
same merchandise as discount stores plus a fullline supermarket 
giving consumers lower prices and the convenience of onestop 
shopping 
department stores modernday department stores generally serve 
the moderatetoupper end of the market offering several 
categories of merchandise with an emphasis on apparel and home 
furnishings they appeal to the consumer through their increasingly 
upscale image and ambiance and by offering more services than other 
retailers they also offer onestop shopping 
general merchandisers operations such as sears roebuck and 
co like department stores offer a broad range of merchandise 
they emphasize their own labels although national brands are 
making their way into the selection their apparel lines tend to be 
at the lowertomoderate end of the market 
mass merchandisers stores such as those operated by woolworth 
also offer a range of merchandise generally at the lower end of 
the scale they offer the convenience of onestop shopping and 
lower prices

according to a university study the evidence is 
quite strong airline deregulation has led to improvements in 
highway safety 
no the study doesnt refer to highways of the air as the air 
lanes sometimes are called the reference is to what most people 
think of when they read the word highway that is a road on 
the surface of the earth 
the improvements say two scholars are significant 1700 lives 
saved 665000 fewer accidents a reduction of 66000 in the number 
of injuries and a 19 billion saving over what would have been 
lost without deregulation 
the authors two clemson university economists say deregulation 
of the airlines since 1978 has not only changed air travel patterns 
but the pattern of highway travel as well 
most importantly it has spurred travelers to use safer sky 
routes rather than more dangerous surface transportation say 
richard b mckenzie and john t warner in their study for the 
center for the study of american business 
the two professors concede air deregulation also might have 
reduced air safety and slowed the longrun decline in air deaths 
but they say it is almost incontrovertible that the shift to air 
did indeed make highways safer 
their conclusions are based primarily on two broad observations 
1 after 1978 there was a marked structural decrease in the 
growth of ground travel that was unrelated to changes in a range of 
factors that normally affect driving such as cost income 
population and permissible road speed 
between 1979 and 1985 the time in which the statistical 
improvements were compiled annual passengercar travel appears to 
have droped an average of 39 percent below what might have been 
expected 
this and other evidence they say convinces us that 
deregulation played a major role in lowering the growth in 
automotive travel 
2 relating the reduced surface miles to the rate and cost of 
accidents per mile you come up with the statistics cited earlier 
if they seem overly large the authors suggest you cut them in 
half what remains is still substantial 
the authors observe that the calculations were more involved and 
scientific than these points might suggest for example air 
deregulation induced many people to fly rather than drive but it 
might have caused more driving too 
deregulation they explain seems to have induced additional 
airmiles to be flown by travelers who otherwise wouldnt have 
taken as many trips and this added air travel might have meant 
more ground travel to get to airports 
secondly greater efficiency in the airline industry due to 
deregulation may have marginally increased national income and 
therefore may have led to a greater demand for ground travel as 
well as air travel 
such considerations give you an idea of how involved the study 
became but there were other things to measure as well for 
example deregulation reduced air service to small rural airports 
forcing travelers to drive instead of fly 
moreover the measurements were made more complex by the fact 
that aircraft generally are flown in a more direct path to their 
goal than automobiles are driven to theirs 
while the authors agree that other scholars might quibble with 
the specifics such as the number of dollars saved they stand firm 
behind their general conclusion that air deregulation has reduced 
groundtravel accidents 
from this conclusion they distill a warning reregulation of 
the airline industry could drive some air travelers back to the 
nations roads and could increase groundtravel accidents 
injuries deaths and economic losses

brazil strapped with the third worlds 
largest foreign debt has subdued its nationalistic rhetoric and is 
preparing to resume negotiations for financial help from the 
international monetary fund 
geraldo moura the finance ministrys press spokesman said 
tuesday that an imf mission was expected to arrive monday in 
brasilia the capital to start negotiating an 18month standby 
loan of 700 million 
the talks end a threeyear chill in relations between brazil and 
the imf which was widely seen here as the epitome of foreign 
intransigence and meddling in this countrys internal affairs 
before the end of july the agreement will be signed and 
relations between brazil and the imf will have been formally 
reestablished moura said 
he said the 700 million would help brazil which owes 121 
billion to foreign creditors to close this years balance of 
payments 
brazil stopped negotiating with the fund in 1985 critics said 
the imfs proposed cure for the economy was recessionary and 
nationalists protested that the agencys monitoring of brazils 
economic performance was an affront to the countrys sovereignty 
thenfinance minister dilson funaro said this country would 
never again submit an econmic plan for the funds approval brazil 
would set its own goals he said and the imf could take them or 
leave them 
but brazils independent stance made foreign bankers balk at 
lending this country more money and when the government in early 
1987 suspended interest payments on about 70 billion owed to 
private banks debt rescheduling talks came to a near standstill 
but late last year brazil started to pay back some of the 
interest due and in january finance minister mailson da nobrega 
said the government would negotiate with the imf an accord that 
will be of interest to the country 
in march brazil and its private creditors reached a preliminary 
agreement to reschedule over 20 years most of what this country 
owes through 1993 moura said only some legal details still had to 
be worked out and that the accord should be signed in june or july 
according to moura the outcome of the new negotiations with the 
imf will depend on an agreement on an acceptable size for the 
government spending deficit 
the government has said that this year the deficit will be cut 
to 4 percent of the gross national product and to 2 percent in 
1989 the deficit now stands at about 6 percent of the gnp 
estimated roughly at 300 billion 
moura denied reports that the imf was pressuring the government 
to slash its deficit to zero thats something brazil will never 
be able to accomplish he said 
what the imf wants is to see a downward trend in the deficit 
and this we are doing through the recent austerity measures he 
added 
in april president jose sarney announced deficitcutting 
measures that included a twomonth wage freeze for government 
workers a limit on the number of jobs public employees can hold 
tax increases financial incentives for early retirement or 
voluntary resignation and an end to federal wheat subsidies 
the most important benefit of the agreement with the imf moura 
said will be the reopening of credit lines from the paris 
club as the group of western government lenders is called he 
said these credit lines would help finance brazilian imports of 
foreign machinery and other equipment needed to modernize our 
industrial park 
he said the imf accord has nothing to do with the debt 
renegotiation agreement worked out with private creditor banks 
the fact that both should be signed at about the same time is 
coincidental although it is obvious that an agreement with the imf 
will make private creditors breathe easier moura said 
the agreement with the private creditor banks includes a 58 
billion loan to help pay part of the interest due in 1987 1988 and 
1989 the rescheduling over 20 years with an eightyear grace 
period of almost 64 billion in interest and principal due through 
1993 and spreads the extra interest banks charge high risk 
clients of 08125 percent down from the 166 percent brazil now 
pays 
meanwhile brazil which has not paid any of the principal it 
owes since 1982 has knocked off almost 400 million from its debt 
in debtforequity swaps held in auctions at the rio and sao paulo 
stock exchanges in march and april 
through these swaps creditor banks can exchange at a discount 
part of what brazil owes them in investments in brazilian firms

swedens biggest private fortune was 
built on a better milk carton according to a new survey of wealth 
in a country that discourages high incomes 
the survey published wednesday by affarsvarlden business 
world showed the four wealthiest families have left sweden and 
relocated their companies abroad to avoid a tax system designed to 
equalize personal income 
however the magazine said its list of multimillionaires has 
grown from 26 to 163 since its first survey six years ago 
thirtyone families were listed as having assets worth more than 
one billion kronor three families would qualify as billionaires in 
dollars a dollar is worth just under six krona 
the wealthiest family is headed by hans and gad rausing the 
sons of ruben rousing who began producing milk cartons in 1952 and 
in 1963 gave the world a flattopped carton that can be packed and 
shipped like bricks 
tetra pak the company at the base of the family fortune has 
its head office in switzerland the rousing brothers said the 
magazine are worth up to 30 billion kronor or 5 billion 
second on the list is the family of ingvar kamprad who founded 
ikea a chain store selling cheap doityourself furniture and 
accessories 
peter wallenberg head of swedens best known industrial family 
ranked 64th on the list one distant relative was raoul wallenberg 
the diplomat who saved 100000 hungarian jews from nazi 
extermination camps during world war ii he was arrested by the 
soviet army during final days of the war and disappeared 
king carl xvi gustaf just squeezed onto the list in 158th place 
with estimated assets of about 100 million kronor or 166 million 
swedens newest billionaire is per arwidsson 35 who took a 
small loan from a bank eight years ago and parlayed it into a 
fortune on the stock market the magazine said he was 31st on the 
list 
senior editor bjorn franzon said the list was difficult to 
compile fairly we tried to evaluate the market value of the 
family holdings in listed companies he told the associated press 
the situation is a little tricky we are talking about family 
equity because we dont care if the owner has transferred some or 
all of his shares to one son or five sons for tax purposes 
said franzon 
most swedes pay about half their wages in taxes and the 
marginal tax rate on top income brackets goes up to 75 percent 
inheritance tax can amount to 100 percent and even more of an 
estate 
franzon said the magazines first survey of the superrich was 
in 1982 when the social democrats who ran sweden for 50 years 
were returned to power after six years of nonsocialist government 
the quantum leap in the length of the list was only partly due 
to the governments economic policy he said 
that policy encourages business profits while heavily taxing 
private income employee benefits and taxfinanced government 
welfare programs give swedish workers one of the worlds highest 
standards of living 
the growing number of millionaires could be attributed to a real 
estate and stock market boom despite the crash last october and 
by inflation which pushed up the nominal value of the companies 
franzon said 
he acknowledged his earlier list was not as accurate as it 
should have been 
im a little ashamed to say that our journalism also is 
better we have better resources and a better understanding of 
the companies he said 
we have 40 or 50 people on the list this time who should have 
been on before but it wasnt possible to find them the editor 
added 
antonia axsonjohnson 45 is the only woman listed as head of 
a wealthy family with assets of up to 24 billion kronor or 400 
million she spells her name in a disappearing form of swedish 
abreviation but the company she inherited is known as 
axelsonjohnson ab a trading and investment firm which last month 
swedens largest department store chain to its holdings 
franzon said the list is still incomplete and the magazine has 
more to learn my guess is that an accurate list should have many 
more real estate people he said 
affarsvarlden a weekly first published in 1901 has a 
circulation of 25000

japan retreated wednesday in two trade disputes 
agreeing to arbitration over its restrictions on farm imports and 
accepting a finding it violated world trading rules with its 
pricing policies for computer chip exports 
dropping its longstanding resistance on the farm issue japan 
said it would submit to arbitration on a us complaint about its 
import quotas on beef oranges and orange juice 
an international panel under the genevabased general agreement 
on tariffs and trade will study and rule on the complaint 
the renewed us demand for a probe followed three weeks of 
unsuccessful settlement talks with japanese officials according to 
us delegate fred montgomery 
the restrictions are causing substantial harm to us 
exports with up to 1 billion in lost trade possibly at stake he 
said 
japanese delegate yoshio hatano accepted the probe at a regular 
meeting of the gatt council and said his country also will allow 
consideration of a separate australian complaint over the beef 
quotas 
in tokyo and washington officials of both nations said they 
still hope to resolve the beef and citrus issue in twoway 
negotations in spite of the gatt proceedings 
the gatt council also approved a panel report ruling that japan 
violated gatt rules in the way it implemented part of a 1986 
usjapanese semiconductor trade pact 
the report found in favor of a european economic community 
complaint which effectively charged that japan illegally tried to 
rig the cost of certain types of computer chips in third markets 
through an international price monitoring system 
hatano pledged japan will take appropriate measures as soon as 
possible to comply with the gatt ruling but did not elaborate 
the council of the 96nation trade pact and agency traditionally 
makes decisions by consensus so japan had the power to block 
action on the farm or computer chips matters if it had chosen to 
delegates from hong kong and singapore both southeast asian 
semiconductor producers welcomed the reports adoption and urged 
japan to take action 
washington pressured tokyo into the pact after us 
semiconductor makers complained japanese companies sold computer 
chips below cost in the united states 
last month japan blocked formation of a panel on beef and 
citrus imports at a special usrequested council session 
prompting us trade representative clayton yeutter to threaten 
retaliation 
australian envoy alan oxley said his country once was japans 
main beef supplier has seen its share of imports drop from 74 
percent in 1976 to 41 percent last year while the us share rose 
to 39 percent from 13 percent 
in another development the european economic community blocked 
a us complaint against eec subsidies to promote processors and 
producers of oilseeds and similar animal feed 
washington had sought a panel to investigate its charge that the 
12nation blocs policies are illegally cutting into longstanding 
us soybean exports to western europe which have been dutyfree 
under gatt since 1962

eastern airlines said wednesday it has canceled its 
contract with orion air inc to provide strikereplacement pilots 
but pledged to remain flying in the event of labor troubles 
eastern preparing for tough negotiations with the machinists 
union on its expiring labor pact had contracted with orion in case 
its own pilots refused to cross picket lines eastern spokeswoman 
karen ceremsak said 
but us district judge barrington parker in washington ruled in 
march that the deal with orion violated the existing contract 
between eastern and its pilots union replacements cannot be 
trained until a strike begins the judge said 
orion based in raleigh nc is one of the largest us 
operators of aircraft for the small package industry miamibased 
eastern the nations sixthlargest airline is a subsidiary of 
giant texas air corp 
the transport workers union filed a similar suit in april 
accusing eastern of using its planes to train orion flight 
attendants to break a strike 
ms ceremsak refused to attribute the cancellation of the orion 
contract to easterns legal setbacks however 
the contract was terminated for sound business reasons said 
ms ceremsak beyond that i cant elaborate 
the decision to end the contract does not mean that financially 
troubled eastern will shut down if the machinists walk out the 
spokeswoman said 
we do have plans to operate in case of a strike she said 
but our first priority is still reaching a settlement with the 
machinists 
jb stokes a spokesman for the pilots union at eastern said 
the federal court decisions against eastern left the carrier with 
no choice 
this is just the inevitable recognition that you have to obey 
court orders said stokes the judge said you cannot train 
replacement pilots in any capacity until such time as there is a 
strike 
the cancellation will cost eastern about 55 million under a 
provision of the orion contract stokes said 
ms ceremsak refused to comment on any provisions of the 
contract or its cancellation

grain futures prices closed mostly higher 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade while soybeans posted 
modest losses 
activity in both soybeans and corn which showed only the 
slightest improvement was primarily influenced by forecasts for 
favorable planting and growing weather analysts said 
we saw the effects of a fairly normal seasonal forecast with 
some showers possibly into the weekend then generally good 
conditions for planting the rest of the corn said walter spilka 
an analyst in new york with smith barney harris upham amp co 
longerrange forecasts indicated conditions also would favor the 
beginning of soybean planting next week spilka said 
wheat and oat prices rebounded after four straight days of 
losses as traders hunted for bargains spilka said 
but with the winter wheat crop nearing maturity wheat prices 
are expected to continue their seasonal decline he said 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 301 a bushel corn was unchanged 
to cent higher with may at 204 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 
3 cents higher with may at 160 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents

the chairman of takeover target cadbury schweppes 
plc on wednesday called on the government to block foreign raids of 
britains confectionery companies which have been dubbed the candy 
bar wars 
cadbury chairman sir adrian cadbury told shareholders at the 
companys annual meeting that the british confectionery industry 
has been in turmoil since usbased general cinema corp announced 
last week it planned to increase its 177 percent stake in cadbury 
possibly through a tender offer 
in the same week swissbased nestle sa launched a hostile 39 
billion bid for british confectioner rowntree plc 
nestle said wednesday it increased to 67 percent its holding in 
rowntree which makes the kit kat candy bar but switzerlands 
jacobs suchard sa nestles rival in the battle for rowntree said 
its stake in the british candy maker has been boosted to 235 
percent 
the raids on cadbury and rowntree both major players in the 
world confection market have sparked an uproar in britain 
cadbury said the government should not allow the stock market to 
decide the fate of the companies 
there are a number of public interest issues involved which 
it is for the government rather than the market to take into 
account he said 
he stressed that the two swiss companies were protected from 
hostile bids in their own country while they were free to try to 
acquire british companies 
both cadbury and rowntree represent generations of patient 
british investment and they are appreciating assets so where the 
returns from them are to flow in the future is an issue of national 
significance he added 
rowntree has not directly appealed to the government for 
intervention but is discussing the matter with one or two 
people said a company spokesman who asked not to be identified

downsized steel company concentrating on flatrolled products two 
aerospace and defense operating groups and a streamlined energy 
products division 
the plan approved by ltvs board of directors will be 
submitted to creditors for consideration hay said us bankruptcy 
judge burton lifland who had given the company a may 20 deadline 
for the proposal must also agree on the proposal 
it has been our commitment from the beginning to emerge from 
chapter 11 as quickly as possible with a strong reorganized 
company that will be competitive in each of the industries we 
serve hay said 
ltv sought protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of 
federal bankruptcy laws in july 1986 one of the largest filings in 
corporate history liabilities total about 6 billion and include a 
2 billion claim by the governmentrun pension benefit guaranty 
corp ltvs largest creditor 
the reorganization hinges on three ltv steel pension plans 
terminated by the pbgc in early 1987 the agency took over the 
plans but then turned them back to ltv arguing that the company 
should fund them 
the dispute is now in a new york court but hay said the company 
is confident it will prevail 
it is our contention that ltv steel did not have the ability 
to fund these pension plans when they were terminated and it does 
not have the ability now he said 
the cost associated with them was one of the major factors 
that put us into chapter 11 hay said and the reduction of 
costs resulting from their termination is crucial to the companys 
successful reorganization 
hay said he expected the company which employs 48115 workers 
worldwide to emerge from chapter 11 proceedings some time next 
year 
the thing that delayed our ability to come out as soon as we 
had hoped to was the issue with the pension benefit guaranty corp 
and that has pretty much slowed everything down he said 
sources told the dallas times herald the reorganization plan is 
likely to be revised during court negotiations and that it could 
offer creditors no more than 30 cents on the dollar mainly as an 
equity stake in the company 
hay said several years of weakness in ltvs steel and energy 
businesses along with operating and liquidity problems that 
developed in mid1986 caused the company to seek bankruptcy 
protection 
but he said the companys steel operations were more efficient 
than two years ago aerospace and defense sectors were restructured 
to sharpen the focus of on our principal lines of business and 
energy operations were scaled down 
bill deatherage an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in 
new york predicted ltv will succeed 
if you have a company with a substantial amount of revenues 
related to aircraft with fewer and fewer new military programs 
coming on line then these guys will have to redirect their future 
somewhere he said

a dozen companies that represent more than 80 
percent of the nations computer and communications sales joined 
wednesday to endorse a set of standards that will some day allow 
effortless communication between computers of different designs 
the companies committed themselves to following open systems 
interconnect standards because of strong pressure from customers 
who are tired of computers that cant easily talk to each other 
the federal government the nations biggest computer customer 
has warned computer makers that starting two years from now it will 
not buy any equipment that does not follow the open systems 
interconnect standard except by special waiver 
many big computer makers have been cautious about embracing 
standards fearing they will lose their loyal customers once it 
becomes easy to mix and match computers from different suppliers 
wednesdays new conference in new york was a demonstration that 
the companies feel they have more to lose by rejecting standards 
than by embracing them 
this is an epochal event and its all customerdriven thats 
whats so extraordinary said jonathan fram an analyst for bear 
stearns amp co 
the 12 companies will demonstrate products that follow the open 
systems interconnect standard at a trade show in june in baltimore 
showcased will be products for electronic mail and file 
transfer all major computer makers already offer ways to do those 
jobs but at the show they will demonstrate how they can do them in 
compatible ways 
osi has left the drawing boards said lincoln faurer 
president and chief executive of the mclean vabased corporation 
for open systems which brought the companies together 
the dozen companies represented were international business 
machines corp american telephone amp telegraph co control data 
corp data general corp digital equipment corp hewlettpackard 
co honeywell bull inc sun microsystems inc unisys corp wang 
laboratories inc xerox corp ncr corp and telenet 
communications corp part of us sprint communications co the 
joint venture of gte corp and united telecommunications inc 
standards save money said murray weidenbaum a former chairman 
of president reagans council of economic advisers who was invited 
to speak at the news conference 
general motors corp cut the frequency of downtime in half and 
the length of downtime episodes to 5 minutes from 15 minutes when 
it put a standardsbased manufacturing system into its truck and 
bus plant in pontiac mich said weidenbaum who is at washington 
university in st louis 
the defense department expects to save 15 to 80 percent off the 
cost of its antiquated 800 millionayear communications system 
when it builds a new one that is based on open systems interconnect 
standards said michael corrigan a defense department computer

the securities and exchange commission has 
accused endotronics inc of reporting millions of dollars of phony 
sales between 1985 and 1987 in violation of security laws 
in charges filed tuesday in federal court in minneapolis the 
sec also accuses the coon rapidsbased biotechnology company of 
filing false reports with the government and covering up that the 
companys founders micheal and eugene gruenberg were secretly 
financing the sale of its instruments to foreign customers 
in a simultaneous filing endotronics while neither admitting 
nor denying the charges agreed to a permanent injunction barring 
it from such actions in the future the sec said 
we merely have agreed to manage the business professionally 
and in accordance with sec rules and the law monis schuster 
general counsel for endotronics said wednesday we have clean 
hands she said adding that the allegations stem from the 
companys previous management 
the injunction if approved by us district judge paul 
magnuson would close the book on the secs investigation of 
endotronics said mary keefe chief of enforcement in the secs 
chicago office which conducted the investigation 
she said the justice department must decide if criminal charges 
will be filed 
richard sakowicz endotronics current president said wednesday 
the sec filing called a consent decree does not call for any fine 
against the company it is significant because it marks the end of 
the sec and fbi investigation which current management has 
cooperated with sakowicz said 
the sec and the fbi have been investigating endotronics which 
makes machines for use in genetic engineering for more than a year 
the company filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 
of the bankruptcy code last year after the investigations were 
disclosed the disclosure came during a highly publicized effort by 
the company to get the 1987 legislature to free 24 million in 
taconite production tax funds for economic development on the iron 
range the company said it wanted the money for research which it 
said could lead to a plant in hibbing 
endotronics has since emerged from bankruptcy under new 
management 
the sec in its first formal charges against endotronics 
alleges that founders micheal and eugene gruenberg supplied at 
least 59 million of their own money to pay for machines that 
supposedly had been sold to customers 
the gruenbergs and other company officials have been sued by a 
group of shareholders who allege the officials faked sales to 
inflate the companys stock price and defraud investors 
endotronics stock peaked at 3550 in august 1986 before falling 
to less than 1 last year 
the stock closed at 162 wednesday on the overthecounter 
market down 25 cents a share 
the sec said at least 34 million of the companys sales in 
japan were false because the customers had no firm obligation to 
pay for them 
eugene gruenberg former chairman and cofounder of endotronics 
declined to comment he and his son micheal former president of 
the company resigned last year

a breakdown in talks between the united states and japan over 
japanese restrictions on imports of beef and oranges helped push 
live cattle futures prices lower wednesday 
analysts said the agriculture departments downward revision of 
its march cattle slaughter estimate would likely become a negative 
factor in thursdays trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
on other exchanges wednesday grain futures advanced while 
soybeans retreated precious metals were higher energy futures 
were lower and stockindex futures fell 
us trade representative clayton yeutter announced in 
washington that the united states with japans approval had asked 
an international trade panel to settle the beefandoranges 
dispute it was the second collapse in the negotiations since late 
march when a fouryear agreement on japanese beef and citrus 
import quotas expired 
the cattle market came under pressure during the day as it 
appeared there would not be an agreement reached between japan and 
the united states said charlie richardson a livestock analyst 
in denver with lindwaldock amp co 
despite the market activity richardson said beef trade with the 
japanese accounts for a very small share of the us cattle market 
meanwhile the usda said wednesday afternoon it had 
overestimated the number of cattle slaughtered in march by 44000 
head and revised that number accordingly 
richardson said the revision was nothing but bearish on the 
cattle futures 
the correction should help clear up industry concerns over 
discrepancies between usda daily estimated slaughter totals and the 
weekly actual figures 
feeder cattle futures finished mixed while pork futures advanced 
on ideas that hog slaughters have passed a seasonal peak 
richardson said 
live cattle settled 53 cent lower to 03 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in june at 7160 cents a pound feeder cattle

pound hogs were 17 cent to 95 cent higher with june at 5045 
cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 22 cent lower to 23 cent 
higher with may at 5117 cents a pound 
grain futures settled mostly higher on the chicago board of 
trade while soybeans posted modest losses 
activity in both soybeans and corn which showed only the 
slightest improvement was primarily influenced by forecasts for 
favorable planting and growing weather analysts said 
longerrange forecasts indicated conditions also would favor 
soybean planting when it begins in earnest next week 
wheat and oat prices rebounded after four straight days of 
losses as traders hunted for bargains 
wheat settled 1 cent to 3 cents higher with may at 301 a 
bushel corn was unchanged to cent higher with may at 205 a

exchange in new york in reaction to the dollars weakness against 
the japanese yen analysts said 
for the second day in a row gold futures did not follow crude 
oil futures which finished slightly lower inflationsensitive 
precious metal prices often follow oil prices closely

ounce silver was 19 cents to 29 cents higher with may at 6327 
a troy ounce

arnold c greenberg resigned 
wednesday as chairman and chief executive officer of coleco 
industries inc according to an announcement from the troubled toy 
maker 
the companys board of directors named morton e handel to 
succeed greenberg as chairman and chief executive and promote 
handel to the board coleco said in a statement 
j brian clarke will continue as president and chief operating 
officer while greenberg will remain as a consultant and a director 
of coleco the statement said 
it is necessary to intensify and accelerate cost cutting 
actions already begun and to further contract the size of the 
company greenberg said in the statement 
he also said financially directed leadership is desirable 
during this period and i believe morton handel working together 
withclarke can accomplish these critical objectives 
coleco which once rode high on the success of its cabbage patch 
kids dolls and other toys was hit by declining sales in recent 
years along with other major toy manufacturers 
the toymaker posed losses of 1054 million in 1987 and 1112 
million in 1986 
on tuesday coleco laid off about 330 employees at manufacturing 
and distribution facilities mainly at colecos three manufacturing 
plants in the albany ny area 
the company also laid off about 145 members or 35 percent of 
its corporate staff 
coleco attempted in march to cut its 335 million debt by more 
than one half by exchanging four separate issues of debt securities 
for a combination of new debt and common stock the company said 
that move was the nexttolast step before a possible filing for 
federal bankruptcy protection from creditors 
but reception to the plan has been cool and coleco last week 
for the second time extended the deadline for holders of debentures 
to agree to the proposal the new deadline is friday may 13

the house moved to erase alaska oil provisions 
of the trade bill wednesday and sent the plan to the senate in what 
sponsors called a compromise gesture designed to head off a 
threatened presidential veto 
by this action we are offering to meet the president half way 
by taking care of one of the two items to which he has expressed 
disapproval in this legislation house speaker jim wright 
dtexas 
the house approved the measure 253159 
it now goes to the senate which could take it up as early as 
next week although it is not clear when it will do so 
the technicalcorrections resolution amends the 1000page trade 
bill passed last week the resolution itself would not go to the 
presidents desk but merely instruct a clerk to delete the alaska 
provisions before the trade bill is sent to the white house 
republicans complained that reopening the trade bill after it 
already had been passed was a violation of house rules 
youve come the wrong half and youve done it the wrong way 
said rep william frenzel rminn when its over its over 
president reagan has been expressing concern about a provision 
of the trade bill that would require companies with 100 or more 
employees to give 60day notice of plant closings and largescale 
layoffs 
democrats said they wanted to compromise but ruled out deleting 
the plantclosings provision they said it was needed by 
bluecollar workers whose lives are disrupted when they find 
themselves out of work without warning 
maybe they should consult their astrologer to find out when 
they are going to be out of work said rep barney frank dmass 
more recently the president has been critical of the alaska oil 
provisions 
one of the alaska provisions would clear the way for export of 
50000 barrels of crude daily to canada but first require shipment 
of the oil in an american vessel to a us west coast port 
it is a favorite feature of politically influential maritime 
unions and a similar provision appears in the uscanada free 
trade agreement signed by reagan and prime minister brian mulroney 
in january 
the other provision would permit export of 70000 barrels daily 
of petroleum products from the refinery at valdez alaska and any 
new refineries that are constructed in the state 
republicans have been complaining that it violates accepted 
procedures to reach back and alter the bill after floor action is 
complete but wright said bills have gotten similar handling at 
least five times in the last three years and that it falls within 
proper bounds 
now we again call upon president reagan to demonstrate 
reciprocal good faith and reconsider his oftrepeated threat to 
veto the trade bill because of the socially responsible provision 
regarding worker notification he said 
wright acknowledged that dropping the alaska provisions was 
partly aimed at picking up two votes in the senate for a possible 
veto override 
the measure cleared the senate 6336 last week short of the 
twothirds margin needed to override a veto both of alaskas 
republican senators ted stevens and frank murkowski opposed the 
bill 
critics of administration trade policy said the alaskans would 
have supported the bill if the export curbs had been deleted 
stevens however said he could not guarantee that he would vote 
for the measure even if the restrictions were stripped from it

american motors corp agreed 
wednesday to pay 115 million to a fort pierce woman left a 
quadriplegic after a 1984 rollover accident involving a jeep 
in return for the settlement elizabeth walker 34 agreed not 
to pursue her claim for punitive damages 
the settlement included 95 million awarded by a jury in fort 
pierce on april 1 1986 plus interest the same jury awarded ms 
walker 10 million in punitive damages but that amount was reduced 
to 1 by the state court of appeals 
however the appellate jury recommended that the florida supreme 
court review the punitive award said joe reiter one of ms 
walkers lawyers reiter said he had intended to seek the original 
10 million in punitive damages before the supreme court 
ms walker who now is a nursing home patient was riding in a 
jeep cj7 on may 4 1984 when it was struck by a car she was 
thrown from the jeep which then rolled onto her and suffered a 
broken neck 
the driver of the car donald robinson earlier had agreed to a 
600000 settlement with ms walker 
reiter said experts convinced the jury that the jeeps center of 
gravity was too high making it susceptible to rollover accidents

replace a threeyear pact covering 66000 uaw workers in 15 states 
which expires in september 
the proposed national labor pact which includes a 1000 a 
worker signing bonus will be presented friday to the uaws 
140member national chrysler council for approval it will be 
submitted to the rankandfile for a ratification vote sometime 
next week 
anthony st john chryslers chief bargainer called the 
tentative agreement affordable and equitable and said the 
signing bonus was in recognition of the uaws contribution to 
chryslers productivity and profits during the past few years 
uaw president owen bieber told a news conference that the 1000 
signing bonus when added to a 500 bonus chrysler workers received 
in march would equal the amount workers would have received in 
profitsharing payments if the profitsharing formula in the new 
contract had been in effect last year 
negotiators adapted to chrysler an industrypattern contract 
established last fall at ford motor co and general motors corp 
the pattern contract protects jobs by requiring companies to 
keep on the payroll workers whose jobs are eliminated for any 
reason except slow sales until funding for the program runs out 
it also requires hiring of one worker for every two who leave the 
company 
chrysler will fund its program with 230 million 
the pattern also provides lump sum payments of 3 percent in the 
next two years and includes the profitsharing formula that has 
paid thousands of dollars to ford workers over the past few years 
the pattern also forbids plant closings over the life of the 
contract except for those closings announced before negotiations 
began 
unlike the gm or ford contract the chrysler contract includes 
the companys commitment that executives will receive neither cash 
nor stock bonuses in years when the profitsharing formula produces 
no payout for workers 
st john said that did not prevent executives from exercising 
stock options granted in previous years 
the contract also includes the union leaderships commitment to 
encourage its local unions to consider accepting socalled modern 
operating agreements japanesestyle agreements in which workers 
are organized into teams 
the new contract will expire sept 14 1990 meaning chrysler 
will negotiate its next new contract at the same time as ford and 
gm for the first time in a decade 
chrysler and the uaw agreed to early talks in march in an effort 
to ease growing labormanagement friction 
problems stemmed partly from chryslers january announcement 
that it would close a 5500worker former american motors corp 
assembly plant a sudden reversal of promises that the plant would 
run five more years and chryslers aborted attempt to sell its 
28000worker acustar inc parts subsidiary 
chrysler backed down from the acustar sale but the early 
negotiations were threatened by outrage among the rank and file 
over the april 19 disclosure of 1987 chrysler executive wages 
including chairman lee iacoccas 179 million 
that was followed by confirmation a few days later of the 
companys plans to shift kcar production to mexico from the united 
states in july 
uproar over the those developments plus chryslers attempts to 
restrict when workers could retire with full benefits almost 
prompted the uaw to break off negotiations until august but 
following a brief uaw boycott of the talks the company backed off 
on those issues 
the two sides negotiated through the weekend to settle separate 
but related contracts covering about 7000 former amc workers in 
wisconsin clearing the way for settlement of the national chrysler 
contract 
the wisconsin issues had to be settled before the national 
contract in part because the national pact will cover workers left 
on the job after the kenosha plant closes
