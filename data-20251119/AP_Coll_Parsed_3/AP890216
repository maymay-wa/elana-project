cambodian guerrilla leaders met 
thursday with senior officials in the phnom penh government and 
charged the officials with merely engaging in a public relations 
exercise in entering peace talks 
the cambodian officials and the three factions of the resistance 
coalition held a 45minute session apart from their larger meeting 
with other southeast asian countries 
the cambodian officials maintained the same rigid attitude 
which is not conducive to a comprehensive settlement of the 
kampuchean cambodian problem the coalition said in a statement 
the plan proposed by the other side is tantamount to asking the 
resistance to capitulate to a regime installed by foreign 
forces the statement said adding that the government was only 
engaging in a public relations exercise 
the meeting is aimed at ending the war that began after 
sovietarmed vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 vietnamese 
forces since have battled the guerrillas backed by china and the 
association of southeast asian nations 
the guerrilla leaders said a solution was possible only on the 
basis of a plan proposed by resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk phnom penh rejected that plan even before the talks began 
resistance spokesman thiounn prasith read the statement aloud at 
a news conference after a 10minute monologue in which he railed 
against vietnam and the illegal cambodian regime it was 
manipulating 
he denounced vietnam for not allowing international supervision 
of its troop withdrawal and claimed that about 20000 vietnamese 
soldiers recently have disguised themselves in cambodian uniforms 
vietnam in january said it will end its 10year military 
incursion in cambodia by the end of september 
phnom penhs representative hor nam hong appeared at the same 
news conference insisting his side fervently desires a settlement 
the organizer of the talks indonesian foreign minister ali 
alatas said that at the plenary session the officials discussed 
the vietnamese withdrawal an end to foreign military aid to the 
guerrillas and a mechanism for supervision and control of any 
agreement 
the session brought together vietnam its ally laos the phnom 
penh government the resistance and the members of asean thailand 
indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and brunei 
a first round of talks held in july achieved no breakthroughs 
but resulted in a consensus that vietnams withdrawal must be linked 
to measures preventing the return to power of the khmer rouge which 
killed hundreds of thousands of people in cambodia before vietnam 
toppled it 
the communist khmer rouge is allied in the guerrilla coalition 
with the forces of sihanouk and son sann 
sihanouk widely seen as the central figure in any future 
cambodian government is boycotting the talks because phnom penh 
rejected his peace plan 
the plan included calls for dissolution of the phnom penh 
government before a general election introduction of an 
international peacekeeping force to guarantee any settlement and 
specifics from vietnam on its pledge to withdraw its troops from 
cambodia

near the site where the dead sea scrolls were 
found archaeologists have dug up a 2000yearold flask filled with 
an oil that might have been used to anoint the ancient israelite 
kings 
joseph patrich of hebrew university unveiled the flask wednesday 
and said the oil which has a honeylike consistency may be the 
only surviving sample of the balsam oil used as an aromatic body 
cream or perfume 
after conducting extensive laboratory analysis and checking 
literary sources there is a good possibility that what we have here 
is the fragrant balsam oil that was famous throughout the roman 
empire he said 
the oil matches a discription of a perfume mentioned by the roman 
historian pliny known as persimmon oil it was distilled from a 
bushlike plant now believed to be extinct 
the ancient perfume was very expensive a sort of chanel no 5 
of its day and was coveted throughout the roman empire 
the persimmon plant which was different from the modern tree of 
the same name grew only in the dead sea oasis of en gedi and around 
jericho the ancient israelites guarded the secret formula for 
making the oil going so far as to post warnings against anyone 
revealing the process 
when the roman legions approached the israelites tried to 
destroy the orchard of plants plinys writings indicate the romans 
took over production archaeologists say 
hebrew university chemist zeev aizenshtat who spent three months 
analyzing the substance said whatever fragrance the oil had 
evaporated in the desert cave where summer temperatures hover over 
104 degrees 
he said he was unable to make an absolute identification because 
there were no surviving samples of the ancient plant to make a 
comparison 
this oil is very different from other ancient oils in that it 
did not deteriorate aizenshtat said this may be the oldest oil 
that contains such organic matter and whose properties have not been 
greatly altered by chemical reactions over time 
the clay juglet stands 5 inches high and contains about 1 to 3 
ounces of the reddish oil which is wellpreserved and dates to the 
1st century bc it was wrapped in palm leaves and carefully 
concealed 
it was found last year by the expedition which includes an 
american team of volunteers from the institute of judaicchristian 
research in arlington texas 
the flask was buried in a 3footdeep pit in the honeycomb of 
caves at qumran 50 miles southeast of jerusalem and the site where 
the dead sea scrolls were discovered in 1947 
the scrolls ancient holy writings including the book of isaiah 
were hidden by the essene sect in the 1st century ad to avoid 
plundering by the advancing romans 
the expedition will resume digging soon as part of a 6yearold 
project to explore the thousands of caves in qumran overlooking the 
dead sea 
menachem boorstein a scholar at the mercaz harav yeshiva in 
jerusalem said the oil was one of 11 holy fragrances burned as 
incense on the altar of ancient jewish temple it is mentioned in 
exodus and in the collection of jewish law and commentary called the 
talmud 
boorstein said the talmud describes the oil as highly inflammable 
and tells the story of a woman killing her daughter by convincing 
her she should light a candle after rubbing her body with the oil to 
make its perfume effect stronger 
the balsam oil described by some ancient rabbis as more valuable 
than gold was used to annoint the kings of israel after king 
solomon in the 10th century bce 
during the ceremony it would be poured across the kings head 
in the form of an x boorstein said

a woman who was told she could either lose 
100 pounds or pay a 500 fine as part of her sentence in a marijuana 
conviction failed to drop the weight and must now put up the dough 
a judge said 
tina usinger 29 was convicted last year of possession of 
marijuana with intent to distribute judge michael fisher told her 
hed knock 5 off the 500 fine for every pound she lost before she 
next returned to court 
the unusual sentence had been recommended by her former probation 
agent who reasoned that with a better selfimage ms usinger would 
be less likely to turn to criminal activity 
if she lost 100 pounds she wouldnt have to pay a fine 
but on tuesday ms usinger weighed 265 pounds the same as she 
did when fisher first fined her 
at the sentencing fisher stayed a twoyear prison term for ms 
usinger he said he was satisfied that she had met other conditions 
of probation including 100 hours of community service work and 
participation in a drug program 
the weight reduction incentive fisher said was an option not a 
condition of probation if shed rather pay the fine thats her 
choice he said

the anger over salman rushdie and his novel the 
satanic verses is quick to flare and shared by many in londons 
moslem community from the sweetmeats shopkeeper to the bangladeshi 
banker 
but while they spare no insult for the author they accuse of 
blasphemy many in the citys narrow east end streets dont seek 
vengeance and reject ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis order to execute 
him 
the imams and mosque council in britain issued an appeal to all 
imams moslem clergymen to respect british law 
an information office representing prince reza pahlavi son of 
the late shah of iran said the iranian governments reaction 
exemplifies the brutal and arbitrary intolerance that is rampant 
in khomeinis islamic republic 
the statement however said the prince was sympathetic to 
objections to the book 
in conversations with immigrants in the east ends brick lane 
shops some cheered the death call but many said the author who 
has canceled a us tour and dropped from sight should live 
to kill him is not going to solve the problem said naim 
sheikh the owner of a shop selling leather goods who called for a 
law that would prevent such books from being written again 
there must be some way that governments can approve a 
resolution that in future no writer should have a right to write 
against any prophet mohammed jesus or moses he said 
moslems revere mohammed as the prophet who brought allahs 
revelations to mankind in the koran the holy book of islam 
but do i personally agree with the ayatollah it doesnt 
matter said sheikh one of the many moslem bangladeshis living in 
the brick lane area 
you cant stop the ayatollah you cant stop the people who 
will do the job anyone who kills rushdie will become a hero in 
the islamic world 
like sheikh most moslems acknowledged they havent read the 
book most learned about it at one of the five mosques located in a 
onesquaremile area of this district from leaflets or from 
television reports 
he insulted our prophet our religion from tv we know this 
said a shopkeeper selling sticky sweets who refused to give his name 
even though they havent read the book they are sure it insults 
their prophet and are quick to say so when the novel is mentioned 
our older people read it they say its wrong so we believe 
them nassim khan a pakistani moslem said as he ate lunch at a 
modest tandoori restaurant theyve been studying for years and 
years and they should know 
maqbool alikassam waiting for his takeout tea boomed from 
across the room anyone who denies the religion of islam shall be 
killed 
alikassam a taxi cab radio controller who calls himself a 
follower of the ayatollah said he believes rushdie deliberately 
meant to insult islam 
dozens of drivers from his company stayed at the office until 
early wednesday morning he said arguing about the book and the 
execution order some said he didnt mean anything about islam 
others wanted him killed 
many moslems believe rushdie 41 insults mohammed by portraying 
him as a character called mahound a prophet of a city called 
jahilia mahound was a medieval corruption of the word mohammed 
they are especially angered by one sequence in which prostitutes 
are given the names of some of mohammeds nine wives and by the 
books implication that mohammed not allah may have been the real 
author of the koran 
rushdie was born into a moslem family in bombay india and 
educated in cambridge he lives in london his novel has sold more 
than 100000 copies since it was published in britain in september 
to critical acclaim 
previously mohammed has been criticized but not in this naked 
way said abul khair a top officer at the sonali bank 
bangladeshs state bank on brick lane it is intolerable for 
moslems 
but he doesnt agree with the ayatollah we dont want 
violence islam is a peaceful religion he said 
restaurant manager asaad ramjaun a mauritian immigrant said of 
rushdie i think hes the devil himself 
we understand this is a free society but i think this is 
freedom of abuse he said but since this is a free society he 
shouldnt be killed he should be given a chance

authorities badly underestimated the health 
problems the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster would cause with 
reported cancer cases doubling in a region near the stricken plant 
that was not evacuated moscow news reported 
the article wednesday in the weekly newspaper said calves are 
born routinely without heads and limbs in the radiationcontaminated 
area of the soviet ukraine 
it said more than half the children of the narodichsky region 
an agriculturally rich area within 30 miles of the plant have 
thyroid gland illnesses which can be caused by exposure to 
radiation 
the newspapers correspondent vladimir kolinko said one woman 
who cares for pigs at a tainted farm asked my daughter recently 
got married what kind of grandson will i have 
in all 31 people died in the immediate aftermath of the 
explosion and fire at the plant on april 26 1986 
the disaster sent a cloud of radiation around the world 
moscow news reported that elevated levels of radioactive 
cesium137 were detected among many residents of the narodichsky 
region which was not evacuated after the accident 
it said health officials of the republic insist there is no 
health danger for people outside a 19mile zone around the atomic 
power station 
since the accident soviet officials stressed time and again that 
radiation levels were safe in all but the immediate area surrounding 
the plant they generally discounted warnings from some western 
doctors that cases of cancer and other diseases would soar 
the moscow news article however was the second this month in 
the soviet press to suggest health problems from the accident were 
mounting 
the official tass news agency reported feb 9 that cancer and 
other diseases are on the rise in byelorussia the republic 
neighboring the ukraine that also was contaminated by chernobyl 
tass said authorities had just determined that onefifth of 
byelorussia is contaminated 
moscow news said lip mouth and other cancers doubled among 
narodichsky region residents since the accident 
kolinko said residents had a right to be outraged 
he wrote that if the government is serious about its pledges 
residents would have the right to demand to demand and not ask 
for full compensation not to mention the right to full 
information about peoples health and the condition of the land 
at the petrovsky animal farm the newspaper said veterinarian 
peter kudin reported that during the five years before chernobyl 
three cases of birth defects occurred among pigs and there were no 
abnormal calves 
in the year after the disaster 37 pigs and 27 calves had birth 
defects he said in the first nine months of 1988 41 pigs and 35 
calves were born with abnormalities the calves frequently 
without heads limbs eyes or ribs the pigs goggleeyed or with 
deformed skulls 
the animals had been feeding on fields where wind had blown 
radioactive particles the newspaper said 
it said that uncontaminated meat and dairy products are brought 
in for residents but some people ignore doctors warnings and drink 
milk from local cows and pick fruit and vegetables from their garden 
plots

the owner and editor of the popular and 
awardwinning newspaper abc color began planning its first edition 
in nearly five years as soon as he heard gen alfredo stroessner had 
been ousted 
were going to come out with the same kinds of stories that 
prompted them to shut us down before corruption narcotics 
trafficking and the violation of human rights said aldo 
zuccolillo 
warming to the subject the 59yearold journalist added we 
want to become permanent reminders to gen rodriguez of the promises 
he made when he assumed power 
gen andres rodriguez toppled stroessner on feb 3 and almost 
immediately gave zuccolillo permission to resume publishing abc 
color as he promised to respect freedom of the press and human 
rights 
the newspaper best known for its investigative stories was once 
the most widely read daily in this south american capital of 900000 
people 
i am certain that gen rodriguez will not ask me nor anyone to 
refrain from publishing an article because he doesnt like it 
said zuccolillo who founded abc color in 1967 
zuccolillo frequently clashed with stroessner and his aides 
enduring threats arrests and finally closure of the 
80000circulation paper by plainclothes police in march 1984 the 
stated reason the paper was provoking class hatred among 
paraguayans 
in preceding years seven abc color journalists were arrested 
and one expelled zuccolillo himself was jailed twice the first 
time for 11 days the second for a week 
he says hes sure that wont happen again now well no longer 
have the overnight bags that we kept behind the doors in the 
newsroom in case the police came and took us directly to jail 
the new issue to hit the street in about a month will differ 
little from editions in the past that won citations from among 
other the interamerican press society three years ago zuccolillo 
was awarded the prestigious maria moors cabot prize from columbia 
universitys journalism school 
were going to investigate everything we have the staff and 
the sources of information zuccolillo said now youre going to 
begin to see news sources appear that in other times would hide 
because they were scared to death 
in the days following the coup zuccolillo saw a constant stream 
of foreign reporters who tried to get a better handle on paraguayan 
politics from a veteran observer 
i think gen rodriguez has no other option than to fulfill his 
promises said zuccolillo the paraguayan people are totally fed 
up with stroessner and streossnerism 
zuccolillo said hard work and skill not luck had kept 
stroessner in power for nearly 35 years 
stroessner had a great machiavellian political talent to 
achieve his objectives zuccolillo said he was a planner he 
was very intelligent he had a great power of synthesis and an 
extraordinary memory but he also was immoral unscrupulous 
bloodthirsty and a corrupter 
zuccolillo who broke with paraguayan tradition by forbidding his 
journalists to accept government payoffs plans to trace just how 
corrupt his former nemesis was 
the first clues are going to come from outside from 
switzerland he said i already have a couple of swiss 
journalists who are willing to help me and im going to send a 
couple of reporters from here when i get some money together 
investigative reports published by abc color in the past alleged 
that by overcharging gasoline sold by the private oil company 
refineria paraguaya sa stroessner bilked the country of about 
800 million over five years in the 1970s 
stroessner might barely have a 10000 bungalow in paraguay 
but he has well over a billion dollars overseas claimed 
zuccolillo stroessner was exiled to brazil where he is said to own 
a home 
zuccolillo dismisses the reservations some have that the 
rodriguez government may become the equivalent of stroessnerism 
without stroessner 
you cant have stroessnerism without stroessner if you have a 
free press he said a free press is the antidote of the people 
against totalitarianism

a member of the board that regulates the 
savings and loan industry has not sold his stock in a family 
business despite a sworn pledge to the senate and a legal 
requirement that he do so 
the associated press learned that roger martin continues to hold 
a 29 percent share in pope scientific inc a menomonee falls wis 
company that makes laboratory glassware martin has valued his share 
of the company at 100000 to 250000 
martin a member of the federal home loan bank board and other 
employees of the agency blame a paperwork jam and confusing rules 
for his failure to sell his stock or be relieved of his promise 
the bank board oversees the operation of more than 3000 savings 
and loan institutions regulating their transactions and auditing 
their records 
im still waiting for an opinion from the ethics people 
martin said wednesday 
basically i didnt want to get rid of it because you cant get 
rid of it martin said of his stake in the company it is a 
very very small company and its all family held 
martins wife ann holds a 51 percent interest in the company 
and is its president her stake in the company is valued at more 
than 250000 according to martins financial disclosure forms 
martin had been chairman of the company from 1983 until he became a 
member of the bank board 
although the company does occasional work for the government its 
business would have little or no occasion for contact with the bank 
board 
but martin was advised to divest himself of the holding because 
his stake in the company was so large that under bank board rules 
pope scientific would be considered his alter ego according to 
a letter from harry w quillian the boards general counsel and 
ethics officer 
this relationship would therefore have a substantial effect 
on popes ability to do business quillian wrote in a letter 
attached to martins 1987 financial disclosure form mr martin 
has indicated that he will transfer his interest in pope to his wife 
or other relative to avoid any conflict or appearance of conflict 
from his ownership interest in pope 
in sworn testimony during his confirmation hearings before the 
senate banking committee in 1987 martin was asked whether he 
pledged to abide by the ethics finding 
martin responded yes 
banking committee spokesman kevin gottlieb said he knew nothing 
about martins holding in pope scientific or his promise to dispose 
of it but a blanket pledge such as the one martin gave the 
committee is more than ceremonial 
generically the committee understands all standard statements 
required by people who testify to be very serious gottlieb said 
the committee wouldnt ask for it unless they thought it was 
serious and they expect to be told the truth 
under federal ethics laws the property should have been disposed 
of within 90 days of martins confirmation by the senate in august 
1987 with notice given to both the office of government ethics and 
the senate banking committee 
martin said wednesday that he had sold off his other holdings as 
promised when he became a member of the board but did not dispose of 
his pope scientific stock because he was waiting for an opinion from 
the staff 
i got rid of everything else i liquidated everything i 
owned at a substantial cost he said 
both quillian and dan kurtenbach another agency ethics officer 
were in the room with martin when he was interviewed by telephone 
and both said the initial opinion that martin should sell the stock 
was wrong 
there was never any question of impropriety or any conflict of 
interest quillian said it was an extremely technical question 
of the status of the company under the boards regulations 
we think that in the first instance the interpretation went too 
far we bent over backward as did mr martin and on reflection we 
believe that we were too technical and too strict 
nevertheless neither the ethics office nor the banking committee 
has been informed of martins intention to keep his share of the 
company 
kurtenbach said his office was to blame for failure to notify the 
ethics office and the banking committee 
i think that was a part where we fell down he said it was 
just an administrative screwup 
the government ethics office the watchdog agency for the 
executive branch also has not received a copy of martins annual 
financial disclosure report although one should have been handed 
over no later than last september according to tom zorn who is 
assigned to monitor the bank boards ethics compliance 
martins form along with those of the other two members of the 
board m danny wall and lawrence white are on file at the agency 
but have not been forwarded to the government ethics office 
kurtenbach said this was because the agency was behind in its 
paperwork 
zorn said in his discussions with the bank board there were 
loose ends to be tied up with martins finances one of which 
was the pope scientific stock 
the bank board staff was most concerned about martins stock in 
mgic investment corp and his position as senior vice president of 
mortgage guaranty insurance corp martin sold the stock resigned 
from mgic and promised to take no part in board actions on matters 
that may come up dealing with mgic or the mortgage insurance 
industry

the four top candidates for the justice 
departments chief civil rights job all would sharply change the 
controversial policies that william bradford reynolds followed for 
the last eight years 
a leading candidate is evan kemp jr a disabledrights advocate 
who publicly battled reynolds over a proposal to reduce 
antidiscrimination protection for handicapped people 
kemp a member of the equal employment opportunity commission is 
being considered for the post of assistant attorney general in 
charge of the justice departments civil rights division said 
administration sources 
confined to a wheelchair kemp has been an advocate for 
handicapped americans and once successfully sued the securities and 
exchange commission after being told his disability would bar his 
promotion to supervisor 
also under consideration are daniel rinzel minority chief 
counsel to the senates permanent investigations subcommittee and 
martin gerry former head of the office of civil rights for the 
department of health education and welfare who has served as 
counsel to the wednesday group of moderate house republicans 
a former career justice department employee rinzel once headed 
the criminal section of the civil rights division and set records 
for the number of cases brought that performance won him a 
promotion under reynolds to deputy assistant attorney general 
another candidate is james p turner longtime career deputy 
assistant attorney general in the division who early in the civil 
rights movement prosecuted white supremacists and other rights 
violators in the deep south sources said 
everyone on the list would turn it around one of the 
candidates who knows the others said on condition of anonymity 
david runkel an aide to attorney general dick thornburgh said 
were looking for someone whose views reflect thornburghs and the 
presidents views on the importance of the civil rights division 
were looking for somebody who can work with civil rights 
organizations said runkel 
the major civil rights organizations tangled regularly with 
reynolds throughout the reagan administration 
reynolds helped formulate and direct the reagan administrations 
policy of challenging affirmative action hiring quotas he also 
moved to overturn courtordered busing programs and to restrict 
federal guarantees for womens rights and the rights of the mentally 
ill and disabled 
without committing himself on specific issues president bush has 
said he wants civil rights policy to be sharply different from that 
followed under ronald reagan 
thornburgh reflected the new administrations stance by meeting 
with civil rights leaders notably jesse jackson 
after meeting with the attorney general last month jackson 
praised thornburgh and said the lights have been turned back on 
in the justice department 
runkel noted thornburghs interest in the civil rights area 
that goes back to the 1960s 
he knows many of the civil rights leaders first hand runkel 
said he is personally committed to making sure the laws are 
enforced 
while thornburgh is still reviewing other applications kemp is 
certainly a leading candidate said one source who spoke 
wednesday on condition of anonymity 
kemp confirmed in a telephone interview that he met with 
thornburgh this week and was told a decision would be made in a 
couple of weeks 
the appointment which will be made by bush with thornburghs 
recommendation is subject to senate confirmation 
kemp said he had been told earlier by white house counsel c 
boyden gray that he was a leading candidate for the position and 
nothing that thornburgh said during their meeting dispelled that 
impression 
i just thought it was a good interview kemp said 
without directly criticizing reynolds kemp said the gops 
failure to attract black voters was due in part to the reagan 
administrations civil rights record 
i think its very important for the republican party to have a 
civil rights record they can run on and attract votes from groups 
covered by the civil rights laws 
ive seen estimates as low as 9 percent of the black voters 
voted for bush in 1988 kemp said i dont think thats good for 
black people to be taken for granted by the democratic party or for 
this country 
kemp who is confined to a wheelchair because of a paralyzing 
illness and subsequent injury headed the disability rights center 
when he battled reynolds in 1982 
at issue was a proposal by a reagan administration task force on 
deregulation to weaken rules prohibiting companies and institutions 
that receive federal funds from discriminating against handicapped 
employees 
it was very important to the disability rights movement that we 
retain the rules and regulations and brad was very critical of me 
kemp said recalling the dispute 
at one point kemp demanded reynolds resignation from the 
justice department the proposal to change 1977 regulations 
enforcing the antidiscrimination law was withdrawn by the 
administration

members of a senate communications panel held 
stock in the industry and acted on issues that could have affected 
their holdings a practice that is forbidden in the executive branch 
but legal for lawmakers 
critics complain about the double standard on 
conflictofinterest rules but others say it would be impossible to 
apply the same standards to the executive and legislative branches 
the associated press selected the communications subcommittee of 
the senate commerce science and transportation committee to show 
examples of stock holdings and congressional action financial 
information for the 11 senators came from their disclosure forms for 
1987 the most recent year available 
sen ernest f hollings dsc the committees chairman and 
member of the subcommittee had larger holdings in 
telecommunications than any other senator on the communications 
panel 
on aug 21 1987 he bought about 100000 worth of stock in 
mccaw cellular communications inc the day the company went public 
in december hollings helped postpone the federal communications 
commissions plans to hold lotteries for licensing cellular 
telephones in rural areas according to sen brock adams dwash 
as committee chairman hollings had to approve a jan 27 1988 
communications subcommittee hearing on the fccs proposed lottery 
idea john e mccaw jr executive vice president of mccaw 
testified in opposition to portions of the fccs plan 
hollings said he didnt know he owned the stock because his 
broker bought it for him 
as soon as it was brought to my attention that i owned it i 
told him to get rid of it which he did hollings said through a 
spokesman he said he first found out about his holdings in mccaw in 
february 1988 but it is unclear whether he made a profit or a loss 
on the stock some of the stock was sold in november 1987 
in 1987 hollings also sold between 100000 and 250000 in 
stock and 2000 and 10000 in options in general electric corp 
which in 1986 purchased the national broadcasting co 
a communications subcommittee member sen ted stevens ralaska 
said he had no qualms about his longtime interest in northern 
television in anchorage alaska which owns two television stations 
and two radio stations in his home state the holding is worth less 
than 5000 
its not a substantial holding stevens said his votes 
include one against a bill extending the fairness doctrine which 
required stations to air opposing views 
marla romash an aide to sen albert gore jr dtenn said the 
senator is sensitive to conflict of interest issues but hasnt felt 
the 1540 in tandy corp stock owned by his wife tipper to be an 
issue tandy which manufactures electronic goods including 
telephones is the parent company of radio shack 
gore voted for legislation to require all telephones to be 
equipped with devices so they are compatible with hearing aids 
sen wendell ford dky dismissed the notion there could be a 
conflict between his duties on the panel and the less than 5000 
worth of bellsouth corp stock his wife inherited the amount of 
stock doesnt amount to a grain of sand on the beach phil norman 
fords spokesman said 
one member of the full committee sen nancy kassebaum rkan 
said she avoided voting a couple of times on issues that dealt 
with communications because her family had interests in radio 
stations mrs kassebaum sold wren broadcasting inc in topeka 
kan for more than 250000 in january 1987 
some other senators have their holdings in blind trusts 
including sen pete wilson rcalif a member of the communications 
subcommittee as a way of dealing with potential conflicts 
the basic federal conflict law makes it a crime for executive 
branch employees to take government action in which their immediate 
families have a financial interest unless a waiver is obtained the 
top penalty is two years in prison and a 10000 fine 
but no law or rule prevents members of congress from holding 
assets that might conflict with their official duties so lawmakers 
can routinely craft or vote on legislation that could affect their 
financial interests 
one argument for not applying the conflict law to them is that 
their assets are publicly disclosed so voters can decide for 
themselves if senators or representatives are acting for personal 
enrichment

the government is limiting the navys authority 
to award computer contracts after six companies complained the 
service was unfairly partial to international business machines corp 
the general services administration which oversees government 
buying said wednesday that for a minimum of 60 days the navy will 
have to submit for review any computer purchase in excess of 25 
million 
previously gsa let the navy award computer contracts of up to 
10 million 
this action clearly shows the administrators intent to 
increase gsas oversight over navy computer buys and to fully 
cooperate with our committees investigation into alleged favoritism 
toward ibms systems said rep john conyers jr dmich 
chairman of the house committee on government operations 
the panel which has been investigating the way computer 
contracts are awarded last week asked the government to restrict 
the navys authority 
conyers cited government statistics indicating that ibm currently 
holds almost 55 percent of the navys largescale computer base 
compared with the companys 37 percent share governmentwide 
the committee had received a complaint last november from six ibm 
competitors that they have been frozen out of much of the navys 
multibilliondollar computer market 
the companies complained in a letter to former defense secretary 
frank carlucci that navy procurement officials had tailored the bid 
specifications so that only ibm could win although many of the 
companies offer clones or duplicates of ibm systems at lower 
prices 
the fivepage letter was signed by executives of the amdahl 
corp memorex telex corp pacificorp capital inc vion corp ncr 
compten and storage technology corp 
a navy spokesman said wednesday the service would have no comment 
until it reviewed the gsa decision 
the house committee also has asked the general accounting office 
the investigative arm of congress to investigate complaints that 
federal agencies are restricting their computer procurements to 
favor ibm 
the gao was asked last week to supply to the committee within 60 
days a broad evaluation of the extent that federal agencies restrict 
their procurements to ibm codecompatible systems 
with expenditures of about 174 billion last year on computer 
communications and data processing equipment and services the 
government is the industrys largest single purchaser

the wealthy should pay more to resolve the 
savings and loan crisis says consumer activist ralph nader in 
claiming the administrations rescue plan puts the burden on the 
poor and middle class 
the people of this country are demanding that the government 
sock it to the rich and powerful who caused the savings and loan 
crime and who will benefit from its resolution he said at a news 
conference wednesday 
last week the president proposed spending 200 billion over the 
next 30 years about half of it from general tax revenues to sell 
or close insolvent institutions 
nader in a 23page report to us taxpayers on the savings and 
loan crisis said spending general tax revenue on sampls would 
squeeze vital government programs such as education and housing 
but he also acknowledged that imposing a major share of the 
cleanup cost on healthy sampls could drive some institutions toward 
insolvency 
as an alternative nader offered four tax increase proposals 
each of which would raise about 10 billion a year enough to pay 
the interest on government borrowing to resolve the problem they 
are 
boosting the marginal income tax rate for the nations 
wealthiest taxpayers childless couples with taxable income higher 
than 149250 a year for instance from 28 percent to 33 percent 
levying a 05 percent tax on stock sales which totaled 23 
trillion in 1987 nader argued this would dampen speculation and 
encourage longterm investing 
raising corporate taxes estimated at 107 billion this year by 
10 percent 
a combination of higher deposit insurance premiums and new 
excise taxes on mutual funds junk bonds leveraged buyout deals and 
mortgages for luxury homes 
nader said any increase in deposit insurance premiums paid by 
banks and sampls should be accompanied by measures restricting 
institutions from passing on the higher cost to their smallest 
customers 
under the bush plan to bail out the crooked and speculative 
savings and loan institutions the people who are working every day 
and paying their taxes are paying the bill he said under our 
plan the corporations the banks and very upper income people 
would pay the bill 
jonathan brown director of the nader group bankwatch advocated 
restructuring the 12 regional federal home loan banks owned by the 
sampl industry but created by congress in the 1930s to borrow money 
from wall street investors at low government rates and pass on the 
money to sampls 
brown said the boards of the regional banks should be appointed 
by the department of housing and urban development rather than 
elected by sampls he said sampls should be required to lend part of the 
money advanced by the regional banks for low income housing and 
neighborhood redevelopment 
this is a cashgenerating machine which has been appropriated 
for private purposes and is not pursuing its public housing 
mandate brown said 
the consumer bankers association a trade group representing 
about 900 banks and sampls rejected the proposal as massive social 
engineering which will be so burdensome as to prevent the sampl 
industry from ever recovering the bankers said bushs plan 
rescues depositors not sampl owners

american telephone amp telegraph co plans to 
drop its rates for basic interstate longdistance service by an 
average 16 percent on april 1 for a total annual savings to 
customers of 533 million 
a consumer advocate complained however that for the cuts such 
heavyuse periods as nights and weekends were insignificant 
the rate cut which is subject to approval by the federal 
communications commission would be the eighth price reduction since 
atampt shed its local operating companies in 1984 since that time 
atampt longdistance rates have dropped more than 39 percent the 
company said wednesday 
the proposed rate reduction reflects lower costs for connecting 
to local telephone networks those costs will drop april 1 when the 
charge residential and small business customers pay to maintain 
local phone network the socalled subscriber line charge rises 
30 cents per month to 350 
with customers paying more of the costs to maintain the local 
network longdistance companies have had to pay less the fcc has 
required atampt the largest longdistance company and the only one 
subject to federal rate regulation to pass along these savings to 
customers by lowering rates 
but while most longdistance rates would go down under the new 
proposal prices for basic longdistance calls under 292 miles would 
increase an average of 47 percent a little less than a penny a 
minute such calls account for about onethird of atampts interstate 
traffic 
also daytime price cuts would be larger than evening price cuts 
and nightweekend prices would not change 
dave thompson a spokesman for the rival mci communications 
corp said the company had not had a chance to study atampts 
proposal thoroughly but as usual we plan to remain competitive 
with atampt 
janis langley a spokeswoman at another competitor us sprint 
said in the past we have followed suit and i anticipate that we 
will do that in this issue also those reductions affect us in a 
slightly different way but we will pass on whatever is appropriate 
to our customers 
gene kimmelman legislative director for the consumer federation 
of america complained that atampt was not cutting prices 
signigicantly in the heavily used night and weekend longdistance 
time periods 
its unfair that consumers have to pay 30 cents more on their 
local bill without receiving any rate reduction for the 
longdistance service they use most kimmelman said in an 
interview 
he said the price cut plan bodes ill for customers if atampt is 
given more flexibility to set prices as has been proposed by fcc 
chairman dennis r patrick 
if this is a sign of what atampt does when given pricing 
flexibility it means that less regulation will deny consumers the 
price reductions for evening night and weekend services theyve 
experienced in the last three or four years kimmelman said 
under atampts proposal 
basic longdistance service prices would drop an average 16 
percent day prices would decrease 38 percent while evening prices 
would decrease 04 percent 
rates for atampt wats calls would drop an average 39 percent 
pro wats rates would drop an average 38 percent 
atampt megacom wats rates wouild drop 11 percent and atampt 
megacom 800 prices would be 52 percent lower 
basic atampt 800 service would drop 09 percent in price while 
800 readyline service would decrease 33 percent beginning july 1 
atampt 800 service will be billed according to distance and there 
will be additional price reductions of 19 percent for 800 service 
and 2 percent for 800 readyline 
software defined network service prices will decline an average 
61 percent

the government is softening its zero 
tolerance policy of seizing boats where drugs are found saying 
small amounts will no longer be sufficient reason to seize 
commercial fishing vessels while in operation 
interim guidelines written to conform with a congressional 
mandate that was attached to last novembers antidrug package were 
expected to be announced today by coast guard adm paul yost and 
customs service commissioner william von raab government officials 
said wednesday 
under the policy that began last march federal agents were free 
to seize vessels within 12 miles of the us coastline if any amount 
of illegal drugs was found on board 
recreational boat owners were furious complaining that they 
could face the loss of millions of dollars worth of property if a 
crew member or guest possessed a trace of marijuana without the boat 
owners knowledge and commercial fishermen said they could lose 
their livelihoods even if they were eventually found innocent and 
their vessels were returned 
late last year congress narrowly approved modifications that 
would in the words of rep don young ralaska prevent innocent 
owners of fishing vessels from being persecuted by wellmeaning but 
overexcited enforcement agents 
congress instructed the executive branch to issue new regulations 
within 60 days and then hold a 30day public comment period the 
bush administration already is a month late and customs service 
officials said they do not expect formal regulations to be proposed 
for at least several weeks 
but yost and von raab in a joint announcement are issuing 
interim rules for commercial fishing boats said officials from 
their agencies speaking on condition of anonymity 
under the new rules seizures of commercial fishing vessels in 
operation or en route to or from fishery operations will be 
prohibited if the drugs found are in personal use quantities 
that is generally described as less than one gram of cocaine or 
heroin and less than one ounce of marijuana 
instead of being immediately seized and escorted to port to await 
forfeiture proceedings by the customs service fishing vessel 
operators will be given a summons and ordered to appear before the 
agency at the completion of the fishing trip customs officials then 
will decide whether the vessel should be forfeited or if a penalty 
should be imposed 
the joint customscoast guard announcement also outlines 
expedited administrative procedures for the forfeiture process 
setting a maximum 20day period for a final decision 
the announcement will not however detail other congressionally 
mandated changes in the zero tolerance policy including a provision 
to protect innocent owners by ordering a vessels release if owners 
can prove drug offenses occurred without their knowledge or consent

the cia is denying a report that americans 
found bugging devices in the old american embassy in moscow while 
investigating allegations that marine guards let the kgb into the 
facility 
bill baker a spokesman for the central intelligence agency also 
denied allegations that it withheld information on the discovery of 
the listening devices from the state department which administers 
the embassy 
both allegations were made by author ronald kessler in his book 
moscow station which expands on earlier reports that the kgb 
had gained access to the embassy and the highly protected code rooms 
by sexually compromising us marine guards 
kessler wrote that the national security agency the us 
communications intelligence organization discovered in 1987 that 
the soviets had put listening devices in the communications programs 
units or code rooms at us diplomatic missions in moscow and 
leningrad 
the cia rarely comments on espionage matters but cia spokesman 
baker read a statement wednesday that the intelligence community 
conducted a review of the evidence and that review did not 
substantiate that the cpu area of the embassy was successfully 
penetrated by the soviets 
baker also denied an allegation by kessler that the cia and the 
nsa kept the discovery secret from the state department 
that is just not so said baker the state department took 
part in a damage assessment based on allegations that marine 
guards had allowed the kgb into secure sections of the embassy at 
night 
baker declined to discuss previous reports that us intelligence 
had discovered bugging devices which transmitted information about 
what was being written on typewriters in embassy offices other than 
the communications room 
kessler said in a telephone interview from his home in potomac 
md that the cia denial was part of a continuing coverup 
i think that the intelligence agencies will justify lying in 
order to protect what they think is the national interest he 
said in this case they think it is the national interest to say 
that they found nothing in order not to let the soviets know what 
the united states knows and whether we can detect it 
because of kgb penetrations said kessler cia covert activities 
in moscow have been totally closed down 
this wiped them out said kessler a former newspaper 
reporter he said that intelligence sources whom he declined to 
identify by name told him that as many as 25 soviets were executed 
in the mid1980s on charges of spying ten of them were in fact cia 
agents kessler said 
possible kgb penetration of the embassy has been a matter of 
public discussion for two years 
one marine guard at the us embassy in moscow told american 
investigators in 1987 that he had allowed soviet agents into secure 
parts of the building at night but he later recanted the confession 
kessler argues in his book that the marine cpl arnold bracey 
was telling the truth the first time kessler said the kgb had 
gotten into the embassy several years earlier apparently by 
sexually compromising marine guards using soviet women 
the cia was denying that soviet listening devices had been found 
said kessler in part out of embarrassment they would claim that 
they didnt want the soviets to find out what they learned about the 
bugs 
he noted that us intelligence officials still decline to show 
pictures of bugging devices reported to have been found in a new 
american embassy in moscow although the plans to occupy the 
facility have been suspended because of the bugging 
in the book kessler wrote 
in august 1987 the nsa made a startling discovery the power 
line to the cpu in moscow had been replaced the discovery meant the 
kgb could have diverted signals from cipher machines within the cpu 
to the outside 
next the nsa found that eightby14inch circuit boards along 
with chips the size of quarters had been replaced in the printers 
the new components appered to be diverting uncoded signals from the 
red uncoded side of the communications circuits to the power 
line bypassing electronic filters that were supposed to trap any 
signals inside in september 1987 nsa found similar sinister 
devices in the cpu from leningrad

former transportation secretary jim burnley 
says an ethics official let him rule in a case involving eastern air 
lines even though he was negotiating at the time for jobs with law 
firms linked to the company 
the issue surfaced wednesday when the air line pilots association 
asked the department to reject burnleys decision in december not to 
investigate eastern air lines operations the union claimed a 
conflict of interest 
the department said it is considering the request from the 
pilots union 
burnley on wednesday called the pilots accusations both 
malicious and without foundation 
burnley made his response in a statement released by the 
washington law firm of shaw pittman potts amp trowbridge which he is 
joining march 1 in the statement burnley said he rejected the 
pilots request last year to investigate eastern only after the 
departments chief ethical officer assured me in writing that i 
was not disqualified from participating in the matter 
a dec 13 transportation department memorandum from ethics 
officer rosalind a knapp to burnley regarding the airline pilots 
request says you are not disqualified from particiapting in this 
matter 
i made each decision based on my best judgment of the merits of 
each matter as set out in the record before me burnley said 
he said no one at shaw pittman or any other firm he was 
considering communicated with him about the pilots petition and no 
one at the firms represented any of the parties in the 
proceedings 
documents show that burnley last nov 22 disqualified himself 
from matters involving shaw pittman and the firm of patton boggs amp 
blow whose partner thomas hale boggs jr sits on easterns board 
the washington post on tuesday quoted shaw pittman partner 
stephen potts as saying the firm gave burnley a list of cases it was 
handling for eastern and continental both owned by texas air but 
potts said the firm was not handling the matter involving the pilots 
transportation department spokesman hal paris said the department 
would consider the pilots petition to overturn burnleys action 
but paris said he did not know when a decision would be made 
a department statement said the petition for reconsideration 
would be considered in the normal course it noted that the law 
firm burnley is joining had requested and was being provided 
documents related to the matter 
the pilots asked the department to reconsider burnleys refusal 
to conduct a continuing fitness investigation of eastern to see 
that the airline remains financially viable 
burnley in rejecting the original petition accused the union of 
trying to put pressure on eastern by raising new safety concerns 
the pilots petition for reconsideration said that burnley 
overrode normal agency procedures in rejecting the petition himself 
rather than letting it be handled by an assistant secretary 
the filing said burnleys actions strongly suggest a lack of 
complete independence or impartiality and an eye cocked towards 
subsequent private employment 
it accused burnley of violating the departments ethics rules 
which prohibit officials from engaging in actions that would benefit 
or would appear to benefit their own financial interests or those of 
prospective employers 
the original pilots union petition accused eastern and texas air 
of threatening easterns financial viability by downsizing 
including the planned sale of easterns lucrative shuttle operations 
to new york real estate tycoon donald trump that sale has received 
transportation department approval but has not yet been approved by 
the federal aviation administration

the dan quayle family is now sleeping under the 
roof of the official vice presidential residence but they wont be 
fully settled until the mansion is remodeled 
the remodeling is designed to make the threestory victorian 
house convenient for a family with three children and an arthritic 
dog said quayles press secretary david beckwith 
the changes include reconfiguring the childrens bedrooms on the 
third floor and adding a bathroom family room and laundry room on 
that floor 
while mrs quayle says she intends to do the childrens laundry 
herself there is a staff of stewards to cook and serve food at the 
house on the sprawling grounds of the naval observatory in northwest 
washington 
work on the residence has not started yet because private 
efforts spearheaded by friends of the quayles are being worked out 
to raise money for the refurbishing beckwith said he didnt know 
how much it would cost 
but in the week since they moved in the quayles have broken in 
the new place with a slumber party and video night for the kids 
each of the children tucker 14 benjamin 12 and corinne 10 
had a friend stay over last saturday night 
quayle admitted to his press secretary that he had been somewhat 
lax in his mission when he accompanied tucker to the video store 
with instructions to supervise selection of the evenings 
entertainment

a leading soviet economist says his government 
will fulfill its pledge to nearly double health care spending 
despite revelations that the state budget is running a severe 
deficit 
we intend to reduce the deficit but not at the cost of 
reducing social investment said abel aganbegyan one of the 
foremost proponents of the reforms being pushed by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
aganbegyan secretary of the economics section of the soviet 
academy of sciences said in a speech wednesday that the kremlin 
will meet a promise by soviet health minister evgeny chazov to boost 
health care spending chazovs plan is to increase that spending 
from 100 billion rubles 166 billion at current exchange rates to 
190 billion rubles or 314 billion for the fiveyear plan 
beginning in january 1990 
state investment in health care fell during the 25 years before 
the reforms began in 1985 said aganbegyan and the reductions 
caused such negative trends as a drop in the average male life 
expectancy from 71 to 68 years under the soviet socialist system 
virtually all health care is provided through state institutions 
murrary feshbach a leading us expert on soviet health and 
economic issues called the chazov goal a noble one that is 
needed to reverse deteriorating health conditions in the soviet 
union 
feshbach a professor at georgetown university used statistical 
evidence in the 1970s to uncover the declining male life expectancy 
and other health problems that are now being discussed more openly 
in the soviet press 
as part of that openness soviet finance minister boris i gostev 
revealed last october that the government which had claimed a 
balanced budget since world war ii was running a 58 billion 
deficit 
last month another economist active in the reform campaign 
leonid abalkin said that the annual deficit was actually about 165 
billion or 11 percent of the gross national output a figure that 
is similar to the us measure of gross national product but 
excludes personal services by contrast the us federal deficit is 
about 4 percent of gnp 
aganbegyan estimated the soviet deficit at 182 billion and said 
that 60 billion was financed through bank loans and the remaining 
122 billion through assets held by soviet savings institutions 
aganbegyan painted a largely optimistic picture of the soviet 
economy in a speech at the johns hopkins university school of 
advanced international studies he claimed that consumer production 
has grown 10 to 15 percent since gorbachev came to power nearly four 
years ago 
of course this is a modest beginning he said soviet 
consumer production accounts for only 30 percent of total 
production compared to 40 percent or more in western nations

the white house and agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter are bickering over who will be president bushs no 
2 official at the agriculture department sources say 
according to the sources who demanded anonymity as a condition 
of speaking yeutter wants jack parnell california state 
agricultural commissioner or sam hollis a memphis tenn cotton 
warehouseman to be his deputy secretary 
but the sources said wednesday that former kentucky governor 
louie nunn 68 has recently become a top contender although no 
final decision has been made they said nunn who was governor in 
196771 is well known in the south and would have substantial 
support in congress 
this makes sense to the politicos one source said after 
what the south did to support bush it deserves a payoff at usda 
yeutter said through a spokeswoman that the reports of bickering 
over the deputys job were completely false and offered no 
further comment when queried by the associated press 
a white house official who declined to be identified also 
denied there was a dispute 
nunn contacted by telephone at his farm in barren county ky 
said yeutter interviewed him several weeks ago for the deputy 
secretarys job 
beyond that i dont have any information and any comment 
would have to come from washington he said 
nunn was mentioned early as a possible choice for secretary of 
agriculture bush settled instead on yeutter a 58yearold 
nebraskan who was ronald reagans us trade representative for 3 
years 
one source said that yeutter may have worked an informal deal 
with bush to remain in the cabinet for only two years on condition 
that yeutter has a deputy trained and ready to step in when it comes 
time to leave 
the possibility of a brief hitch at usda surfaced when yeutters 
appointment was announced but was discounted by bush staff people at 
the time 
according to the source bush was willing to accept yeutters bid 
for an abbreviated tenure at usda because the president felt 
yeutters help on trade matters in the coming months and on pending 
farm legislation was essential the current 5year farm law expires 
in 1990 
yeutter was reluctant to remain in government after reagan left 
office was ready to leave town quickly for the private sector and 
had been interviewed for several job possibilities until bushs 
appeal that he remain 
at least until now hollis and parnell have traded places as the 
lead contender for the deputy secretarys job according to one of 
the sources 
one of hollis supporters for the job is sen bob dole rkan 
who says a major new farm bill should not be high on yeutters list 
of things to do in the next couple of years 
parnell who has been director of the california department of 
food and agriculture since june 1 1987 has a 4500acre ranch and 
other business interests 
california the leading farm state was the home of richard e 
lyng yeutters predecessor and has been using clout from a number 
of powerful farm and commodity organizations to maintain white house 
interest in parnell 
parnells office in sacramento said he was away from the capital 
and could not be reached a deputy bob fox said parnell was in 
mexico city with the governor to open a new trade office 
there has been lots of speculation about parnell being headed 
for washington but nothing further fox said 
the latest we have is that theres no official notification of 
parnell and no official decision he said

president bushs proposal to chop nearly 2 
billion in farm subsidies may imperil farm lenders and end up 
costing the government more than it saves says the chairman of the 
house agriculture committee 
is it worth it to maybe trigger this potential crisis for the 
sake of reducing for the budget beyond what would be our obligation 
in relation to all the other departments says rep kika de la 
garza dtexas 
de la garza complains bushs budget for fiscal 1990 would cut 
farm supports by about 10 percent compared with cuts to other 
agencies of 3 percent or 4 percent 
a 19 billion cut in farm programs would directly affect 
farmers cash flow and make it harder for them to repay their loans 
de la garza said that would jeopardize the health of the farm 
credit system the farmers home administration and small 
independent farm banks

eye doctors should warn their contact lens 
patients that improper use of homemade salt solutions can lead to 
damaged vision and even blindness the government says 
the food and drug administration in a warning issued wednesday 
said the solutions are not sterile and can become contaminated with 
microorganisms that can cause serious and painful eye infections 
homemade salt solutions prepared by dissolving salt tablets or 
capsules in water can be used safely in heat disinfection of 
contact lenses or just before heat disinfection because the high 
temperature kills any germs that might be in the solution 
the fda said that if homemade salt solutions are used the 
solution should be prepared fresh daily and discarded after use and 
the solution bottle should be sterilized in boiling water for 10 
minutes at least once a week

americans are increasingly going to nursing homes 
to die as hospitals discharge terminally ill patients to keep them 
from running up big bills thus helping reduce the nations medicare 
costs according to two reports today 
one study based on nationwide death statistics suggests that 
the trend results largely from new medicare rules that pay hospitals 
flat fees for taking care of the elderly this approach gives them a 
financial incentive to keep patients hospital stays as short as 
possible 
what has to be said is that hospitals are in a bind because 
they are being pressured by cost cutting said dr mark a sager 
who directed the study nursing homes are in a bind because nobody 
wants to pay for nursing home care patients are in a bind because 
they are in a system that does not want to provide continuity of 
care and health care financing is fragmented 
his research showed that the number of elderly americans dying in 
nursing homes rose sharply during the 1980s while fewer died in 
hospitals 
sager a physician at dean medical center in madison wis said 
that sending dying people to nursing homes rather than keeping them 
in hospitals may be very appropriate and less costly 
the issue is whether nursing homes can adequately take care of 
a sicker population today than they were seeing a few years ago 
he said 
medicares new system began in october 1983 paying hospitals 
flat fees in advance hospitals get the same amount for each person 
with a specific disease regardless of whether a patient stays in 
the hospital for a day or a month 
another report provides evidence that the strategy is saving 
money 
that study directed by dr louise b russell of rutgers 
university estimated the savings to medicare from the new payment 
system and compared medicares projections of rising costs with what 
actually happened 
in 1980 the hospital insurance trust fund the federal 
governments branch that pays medicare hospital bills predicted 
that it would be spending about 55 billion by 1990 instead it 
appears the actual expense by then will be 43 billion in 1980 
dollars 
the savings will amount to 12 billion in 1980 dollars or 18 
billion in 1990 dollars the researchers said this means the new 
payment program will be responsible for a 3 percent reduction in the 
nations total health care bill which is expected to be 650 
billion in 1990 
both studies were published in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
sagers study found that in 1981 65 percent of all deaths among 
people older than 65 occurred in hospitals by 1985 this had fallen 
to 61 percent at the same time the percentage of deaths in nursing 
homes rose from 19 percent to 215 percent 
sager said that although he is concerned about whether nursing 
homes can adequately care for their increased burden of dying 
patients there is no sign that quicker hospital discharges have 
shortened peoples lives 
his study which used mortality data from all 50 states compiled 
by the national center for health statistics found that the changes 
were most pronounced in the midwest south and west 
he attributed that in part to the heavy concentration of health 
maintenance organizations in some states in these regions 
hmos save money by reducing rates of hospitalization said 
sager hospitals in highhmo states may have already experienced 
significant cost cutting before the medicare program began they 
were much more threatened by the prospective payment system 
sagers work showed that between 1983 and 1984 35 states showed 
significant declines in hospital deaths and 33 had increases in 
nursing homes deaths 
in new york new jersey massachusetts and maryland states that 
did not participate at first in the new payment system there was 
no change in where people died

an outofbounds skier who was 
buried in an avalanche that killed two companions said he had given 
up hope and placed his ski pass around his neck to be identified 
when his body was found 
id given up todd richards 23 of chelmsford mass said 
in a telephone interview wednesday one day after his rescue near 
the telluride ski area so i prayed a little i didnt expect 
anybody to come looking for me 
he spoke from a hospital in montrose which lies between grand 
junction and telluride on the western slope of the rockies he is 
recovering from frostbite hypothermia and bruises sustained in the 
avalanche 
richards was found by a dozen local skiers who had been coming 
down legally nearby and heard his screams for help authorities said 
his two companions anthony vaughn shelly 25 of wellington new 
zealand and paul wolford 23 of milwaukee were killed in the 
avalanche 
richards said he had resigned himself to dying and had put his 
laminated employee ski pass which he had been using to dig around 
his neck so it would be easy to identify me 
the three young men were spending the winter in telluride where 
richards and shelly worked for the telluride ski resort inc and 
wolford was employed at a local restaurant shelly was leaving 
this weekend to go home richards said 
richards said he and shelly were friends he said they met 
wolford on tuesday morning at telluride mountain and decided to go 
skiing out of bounds toward a narrow steep powderfilled chute 
if you go backcountry youre on your own richards said 
we knew that thats why i didnt expect anybody to come looking 
for me 
about 1130 am tuesday the party stopped at the top of the 
chute wolford was putting on a ski that had come off and richards 
took off his gloves to take a picture of the spectacular mountains 
i saw it coming 300 or 400 feet above me richards said i 
turned and yelled at my friend and when i turned back it was in my 
face 
it hit me like a mack truck it picked me up right out of my 
skis it took me down about 2000 vertical feet including over a 
cliff that had to be at least 150 feet high but it was taking me 
out as much as down id have to guess 70 mph 
san miguel county sheriff bill masters said it appeared shelly 
and wolford died of suffocation and multiple broken bones he added 
that richards may be cited for illegally skiing out of bounds 
richards said he expects to be charged for rescue payments but is 
obviously grateful to the people who pulled me out 
a ski instructor who tends bar at night richards said he isnt 
sure he will stay in telluride 
part of my job as a ski instructor is to calm people down about 
their fears he said im not sure i could do that right now i 
might have to go back east

impoverished migrant workers crammed into 
wooden shacks on one of americas most beautiful college campuses 
are at the center of a dispute over whos legally responsible for 
their misery 
on one side of the wrangle is prestigious stanford university on 
the other is webb ranch which leases 300 acres from the school and 
pays the migrants wages below the poverty line to pick berries and 
vegetables 
webb charges 75 cents out of every hour worked for rent so the 
more hours worked the higher the rent said reuben serna a 
spokesman for united stanford workersthe union representing 1200 
maintenance workers at the school 
the shacks are a halfmile from the center of campus and have no 
heat toilets or running water during harvest time they are 
crowded with up to eight people who pay up to 1600 a month for the 
space serna said 
the migrants have asked the united stanford workers to represent 
them earlier this week the union sent university president donald 
kennedy and the ranch a letter demanding recognition as sole 
bargaining agent for the farm workers 
union attorney jim eggleston claims that stanford as the lands 
owner is the workers true employer under state law and is legally 
responsible for the shameful activity thats going on here 
there are more illegalities more exploitation of workers more 
breaches of workers rights in this one plot of ground right here 
than weve seen in a long long time he said wednesday 
kennedy declined to comment on the issue but stanford attorney 
priscilla wheeler said the university isnt responsible for the 
employment policies of its lessees or contractors 
we would of course be concerned if any lessee violated the 
law wheeler said in a statement so far as we know webb ranch 
has not done so if there are issues of mistreatment we hope they 
are brought up with the state 
wheeler acknowledged that the migrants sometimes work on campus 
as contract workers but said there is no basis for the unions 
claim that the university is a joint employer with webb 
if kennedy and webb refuse to accept the bargaining demand by 
friday the union plans to file a petition with the state 
agriculture labor relations board that could lead to a vote by the 
migrants on representation eggleston said 
union officials said webb receives 850 an hour for the contract 
workers but pays them only 425 and pockets the rest 
ranch manager stanley webb was not available for comment his 
office said other ranch officials declined to comment 
whatever doubt remains about the migrants legal employer no one 
denies that their poor living conditions make a striking contrast to 
the campus 30 miles south of san francisco which covers thousands 
of acres and boasts elegant spanishstyle buildings and eucalyptus 
trees 
i think this is a step backward in history said art pulaski 
of the san mateo county central labor council its somewhat 
reminiscent of the company towns where the employers control people 
not only at work but at home after work stanford university is 
acting like a third world employer here 
tibuecio cabrera 67 and his 58yearold wife cointa mendoza 
are among up to 90 migrants including as many as 20 children who 
live in four wooden sheds with four rooms each only a few speak any 
english or read 
cabrera and his wife have shivered through the winter with the 
warmth of only a small electric heater and some blankets they have 
a hot plate to make tortillas but there is no running water in 
their 7by8foot room light comes from a bare bulb dangling from a 
wire tacked to a wall 
cabreras last monthly pay receipt shows he worked 194 hours and 
earned 82450 but he took home 51486 after deductions for social 
security unemployment tax a 50 personal advance rent and 
utilities 
like the others cabrera received no health care no holidays and 
no vacation he said he had to use all his savings to pay for a 
stomach ailment and got no help from webb or stanford 
the camp has only one portable toilet and three indoor toilets 
with no partitions between them for both men and women there is a 
communal kitchen with immovable metal seats for eight refrigerators 
are padlocked between meals 
i sometimes get angry but i have to comfort myself cabrera 
said what else can i do 
eggleston said the migrants have long been afraid to speak out 
because they were illegal aliens from mexico but were emboldened by 
their protection under the federal amnesty program to ask his union 
for representation

a memorial to president kennedy on the sixth floor 
of the former texas schoolbook depository from which lee harvey 
oswald allegedly fired the shots that killed him will open on 
presidents day organizers say 
the exhibit titled the sixth floor john f kennedy and the 
memory of a nation does not dwell on the 1963 assassination in its 
photos films and other items but on the slain presidents legacy 
its creators said wednesday 
this exhibit is an attempt to deal with it positively in that 
it is educational it is objective i think it is extremely 
sensitive and i think it is dignified said conover hunt the 
exhibits project director 
the 9000squarefoot exhibit which opens to the public monday 
includes 350 photographs 30 original artifacts a 30minute audio 
tour and six films it was built at a cost of 13 million and 
organized by the dallas county historical foundation 
an estimated 500000 visitors a year will view the exhibit which 
covers kennedys political career his assassination on nov 22 
1963 and the investigations that followed ms hunt said 
reporters were given a preview wednesday of the exhibit which is 
housed in what is now the dallas county administration building 
replicas of schoolbook boxes are stacked near the southeast 
corner window from which oswald allegedly fired the fatal shots the 
area is sealed off but visitors will be able to look through a 
glass partition and adjacent windows to dealey plaza and the kennedy 
motorcade route 
the exhibit has extraordinarily famous photographs taken by 
some of americas most talented photographers through the years 
ms hunt said we looked at thousands of visuals to select the 350 
that are in this exhibit 
allen mondell of dallas who with his wife cynthia produced and 
directed the films said one segment has the formidable task of 
chronicling 1000 days of the kennedy presidency in five minutes 
we did not want museum visitors through these films to feel 
that they were in a morbid place that concerned death mondell 
said but we wanted to convey hope for the future the kennedy 
legacy 
all visitors will undergo a security check using a metal 
detector and xray machine before entering the groundfloor 
visitors center which was built at a cost of 22 million 
vandalism is a major concern in museums ms hunt said 
thousands of tourists have come to the building previously but 
could not go to the sixth floor because it was closed 
county officials have been developing plans to convert the sixth 
floor into an exhibit area since 1981 but the project was stalled 
by financial problems 
melody miller a washington spokeswoman for sen edward kennedy 
dmass said the kennedy family would not comment on the exhibit 
they prefer to focus on presidents kennedys life not his 
death they will remember him on may 29 his birthday she said

president daniel ortega dismissed 
claims that his promise to hold free elections is insincere telling 
the nation he can now promote democracy because the sandinistas are 
strong and backed by the people 
in a televised speech wednesday night ortega also hinted that he 
might run for reelection 
at the end of a regional summit tuesday in el salvador he 
promised to hold presidential legislative and municipal elections 
by next february and to allow the opposition help organize them 
the summit agreement signed by five central american presidents 
also calls for disbanding of the contra guerrillas most of whom are 
encamped in neighboring honduras 
well see who is strong who the people will vote for ortega 
said whoever is afraid of this early elections is not 
interested in peace or in the strengthening of democracy in 
nicaragua 
the balloting had been scheduled for november 1990 
in washington on wednesday the state department signaled its 
skepticism about free elections in nicaragua by saying it had no 
plans to lift a fouryear ban on diplomatic contacts with the 
leftist sandinista government 
rebel leaders said they felt abandoned by the united states 
which had supported their sevenyear fight to oust the sandinistas 
the accords left the contras isolated diplomatically with about 
11000 fighters and several thousand relatives in neighboring 
honduras 
despite vows to fight on they ran out of ammunition and moved 
into the border camps after congress suspended military aid a year 
ago on march 23 they signed a preliminary ceasefire accord with 
the sandinistas 
asked by reportres what would happen if the contras refused to 
lay down their arms and relocate ortega said 
the contras are creating a problem for honduras you cant 
force them to return to nicaragua but they will have to choose 
between coming here staying some of them in honduras or 
leaving for the united states or whatever other countries are 
willing to take them in 
one opposition leader said the sandinistas must be watched 
carefully in the elections or theyll try to cheat 
president ortega only talked with the central american 
presidents but he still needs to talk with the nicaraguan people 
said gilberto cuadra president of the opposition superior council 
of private enterprise 
the sandinistas popularity has been hurt by the state of the 
economy inflation is at a 20000 percent annual rate food and 
consumer goods are in short supply and at least 30000 public 
employees have just been laid off 
the government says the war is mostly to blame for the state of 
the economy not their management of it 
opposition leaders said wednesday that elections as early as next 
february do not allow enough time for political parties to organize 
a campaign 
in his nationwide address ortega went over the points contained 
in a communique he issued jointly with the presidents of el 
salvador honduras guatemala and costa rica at their summit 
he stressed his willingness to promote greater democracy and 
submit elections to international observers saying this shows our 
political strength which is rooted in the nicaraguan people the 
working people the peasants and every patriotic nicaraguan 
speaking to journalists afterward he was asked if he would be 
the sandinista presidential candidate 
we have to consider that reelection is no crime even former 
president reagan complained that it was undemocratic that he 
could not run for office again he said 
ortega was asked how he interpreted the fact that president bush 
had not publicly established his policy toward nicaragua and the 
rest of central america that fact in itself shows a different 
policy 
earlier ortega said he told the central american presidents 
nicaragua would not be promoting the political and economic 
actions it has been promoting since the start of the year if us 
policy had been maintained along the lines of president reagan 
government representatives have been meeting with labor business 
and opposition parties seeking a commitment to support the 
governments economic plan one highlighted by tough austerity 
measures to curb hyperinflation and increase productivity

a house subcommittee chairman says the florida 
republican party was given 18 months of free use of office space in 
a building the government inherited from an insolvent savings and 
loan institution 
rep james florio dnj requested an investigation wednesday 
and also asked for a formal explanation from m danny wall chairman 
of he federal home loan bank board that regulates sampls 
at a time when the american taxpayer is being called upon to 
provide billions of dollars to bail out savings and loans it is a 
scandal that officials treat assets as personal accounts for use 
by friends and cronies florio said in a letter tuesday to wall 
according to a congressional source the republican party of 
duvall county paid no rent from mid1987 until it vacated the 
jacksonville building last month for 1200 square feet of office 
space 
the building is owned by the federal asset disposition 
association an agency established by the home loan bank board to 
dispose of property the government acquires in closing down or 
merging insolvent sampls said the source speaking on the condition 
of anonymity 
florio chairman of the energy and commerce subcommittee on 
commerce consumer protection and competitiveness specifically 
asked the general accounting if the jacksonville arrangement 
violated federal laws prohibiting the government from making 
political contributions or giving away federal property 
gerald carmen fadas president was out of town wednesday night 
and unreachable his wife said but the washington post quoted 
carmen as saying earlier that he had not learned of the jacksonville 
arrangement until december and had ordered the gop to vacate the 
premises within a week 
the congressional source said the subcommittee has documentation 
that fada officials in washington had been aware for six months of 
the partys rentfree use of the office space 
meanwhile the bank board system through which the government 
regulates and insures sampls and sells home mortgages has donated a 
total of 21600 to a think tank named in honor of sen jake garn 
rutah who cowrote a 1982 law deregulating the industry the post 
said 
a report issued by the garn institute of finance which was 
started in 1986 and is affiliated with the university of utah 
showed a 6000 contribution from the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp the home loan bank board agency that insures sampl 
despositors the post said 
in addition the report listed contributions totaling 5100 from 
district federal home loan banks in cincinnati dallas new york and 
atlanta and 106000 from the federal home loan mortgage corp 
freddie mac the bank board agency that buys and sells home 
mortgages 
wall was quoted by the post as saying he was unaware of the 
contributions to the garn institute but he dismissed their 
relevancy saying whats the point 
before becoming the bank boards chairman wall was a top aide to 
garn his wife is the senators personal secretary

human rights activist andrei d sakharov says he is 
pulling out of the race for a territorial seat in the new national 
legislature because he believes he should represent the soviet 
academy of sciences 
the prestigious academys governing body last month rejected 
sakharovs candidacy a move that critics of the new electoral 
system said showed entrenched communist party bureaucrats advantage 
in the nominating process 
i feel that i am inseparably linked with the academy of which 
i have been a member 35 years sakharov said in a letter published 
wednesday in the moscow news 
the 67yearold physicist who won the 1975 nobel peace prize 
has been nominated to represent a moscow district in the new 
2250seat congress of peoples deputies 
but hundreds of his colleagues at the academy want him to 
represent them 
i have come to the conclusion that i should be a candidate 
namely of the academy in the new elections or not be one at all 
sakharov wrote in the letter to the weekly newspaper 
therefore i am taking the decision not to run anywhere except 
the academy of sciences of the ussr withdrawing my consent to 
run from all territorial and nationalterritorial districts which 
fielded my candidacy 
the new congress announced in december by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev will meet annually and choose the soviet 
president and members of a new smaller and more active sitting 
parliament or supreme soviet 
a third of the deputies are to be chosen from among candidates 
nominated not on the traditional basis of geographic districts but 
from the party unions professional organizations and other 
officially recognized groups 
candidates may not espouse views contrary to the constitution 
which enshrines the communist party as the leading force in society 
and there has been considerable controversy over how some of the 
candidates have been chosen 
the territorial deputies will be chosen by voters on march 26 
deputies from public organizations will be elected at meetings of 
those groups in the weeks preceding the territorial balloting 
on feb 2 more than 1000 academy of sciences workers rallied to 
protest the organizations rejection of the candidacies of sakharov 
and several other prominent intellectuals 
they said the academy leadership had failed to listen to the 
popular will 
in a letter accompanying sakharovs wednesday in moscow news 
space scientist roald sagdeyev said he supported his colleagues 
decision to pull out of the race and hoped the academy leadership 
would reverse its decision and find a way to nominate sakharov 
sagdeyev also was passed over as an academy nominee 
sakharov who is currently visiting canada was freed from 
internal exile in gorky in december 1986

children born with purple birthmarks known as 
portwine stains can be treated with lasers that erase their 
blemishes without leaving scars a report today shows 
a review of the treatment found that it removed the birthmarks in 
94 percent of cases leaving normallooking skin 
the birthmarks are usually harmless and occur in about three of 
every 1000 people often on the face 
we hope to get rid of these lesions before children go to 
school where they have had severe psychological problems from 
teasing and bullying said dr oon tian tan who has worked with 
the laser at the boston university school of medicine 
doctors have used similar lasers for several years to lighten the 
birth marks in adults but they could not be used in children 
because they left scars 
the latest laser can be finetuned so that it destroys just the 
abnormal blood vessels that cause the portwine stains surrounding 
normal tissue is unharmed 
in a report in the new england journal of medicine tan described 
her experience with the laser in 35 children who ranged in age from 
3 months to 14 years in 33 of them the birthmarks disappeared 
completely 
the latest approach uses a device called a flashlamppulsed 
tunable dye laser it was developed at massachusetts general 
hospital and produced by candela laser corp of wayland mass the 
us food and drug administration approved it for routine use in 
november 1986 
when we completely cleared the patient of portwine stain we 
got normal skin that is indistinguishable from adjacent skin with 
normal pigmentation normal texture and normal hair growth tan 
said in an interview the only structure that was destroyed was 
the abnormal blood vessels 
two of tans initial patients had small isolated depressed 
scars when their skin was accidentally injured soon after the laser 
treatment 
dr jerome garden who has also extensively used the laser in 
children and adults agreed that the treatment rarely causes scars 
but he questioned whether it produces such uniformly complete 
removal of birthmarks as tan found 
i just dont feel that the amount of lightening she is getting 
is the same as other people are seeing me included said garden 
of northwestern university 
nonetheless garden said that although his results have been less 
impressive than tans the important issue is that until this 
time any laser that was used in children especially infants would 
have a very real risk of scarring this has diminished that risk 
unbelievably to the point that none of my patients have scarred 
portwine stain is an abnormality resulting from overgrowth of 
enlarged blood vessels in the skin 
lasers produce intense beams of light their effects on the body 
vary depending on their color or wavelength when used by skin 
specialists the new tunable dye laser produces yellow light it 
passes harmlessly through normal skin but is absorbed by anything 
that is red 
when aimed at portwine stains the laser selectively burns the 
enlarged blood vessels

president kennedys moderate response 
during the cuban missile crisis was perceived instead as a virtual 
declaration of war by the soviets and premier nikita khruschev 
backed down from the brink for unexpected reasons scholars now say 
newly declassified documents indicate that luck as well as 
skill played a great role in resolving the worlds last major 
nuclear crisis 27 years ago soviet and american experts at harvard 
university said wednesday 
kennedy and khrushchev made key decisions based on serious 
misperceptions and faulty intelligence which however may have 
helped to resolve the crisis as well as to start it said graham t 
allison dean of harvards john f kennedy school of government 
looking at it in retrospect with all the new information i 
still give high marks to president kennedy and also perhaps 
surprisingly to khrushchev for the degree of control they tried to 
exercise said allison author of essence of decision one of 
the authoritative books on the crisis 
but nonetheless it is now clear that there was a great 
component of good fortune it was a combination of extraordinary 
skill extraordinary courage and equally extraordinary good luck 
that permitted us to avoid catastrophe he said 
harvard researcher james t blight said the documents examined 
during two recent international conferences demonstrate that the 
soviets knew about us covert operations to destabilize the cuban 
regime 
the soviets had put the missiles in cuba mainly because they 
believed a fullscale marine invasion was likely said blight 
coauthor of a new book on the brink americans and soviets 
reexamine the cuban missile crisis 
kennedy and his advisers believed that setting up a naval 
blockade was a relatively mild response to the missiles that 
would help defuse the crisis by rendering an invasion unnecessary 
they had no idea that the way that blockade would be perceived 
in moscow was as a prelude to an invasion and a virtual declaration 
of war blight said 
indeed the documents reveal that an enraged nikita khrushchev 
ordered soviet ships to steam through the us blockade but the 
order was reversed by anastas mikoyan the first deputy soviet 
premier just hours before a military confrontation would have 
occurred 
it remains unclear whether mikoyan circumvented the decision on 
his own or obtained khrushchevs permission to change it 
allison said it now appears that khrushchev gave in partly 
because he had received an urgent message from castro dictated from 
a bunker saying an american military attack was imminent 
a soviet general dmitri a volkogonov also advised that an 
attack was coming which turned out not to be true said allison 
author of essence of decision a classic 1971 study of the 
crisis 
the crisis flared on oct 15 1962 when a highflying american 
u2 spy plane photographed the installation of nucleartipped soviet 
ss4 and ss5 missiles in cuba kennedy deliberated secretly with 
his aides for a week before announcing a naval quarantine of cuba 
and a demand that the soviets withdraw the missiles 
the world sat glued to television sets and radios as soviet ships 
steamed toward the blockade and what seemed to be an inevitable 
military confrontation but the soviet ships stopped short and the 
soviets and americans came to peaceful terms 
the historical reexamination organized by the kennedy school 
included a reunion of former kennedy advisers on hawks cay fla in 
march 1987 a conference of soviet and american experts and 
officials at harvard in october 1987 and a second conference that 
included cuban officials last month in moscow 
among the other revelations it has produced 
us intelligence estimates of soviet and cuban troop strength 
were way off according to cuban politburo member jorge risquet 
270000 troops were ready to go to war including 42000 soviet 
soldiers four times the us estimate at the time 
cuban leader fidel castro may have asked the soviets to launch a 
preemptive nuclear attack sergei khrushchev son of the former 
soviet leader reportedly described castros request in private 
conversations at the moscow conference but has since denied he said 
such a thing 
soviet and cuban leaders believed a us invasion was imminent 
before the missiles were installed us officials including former 
secretary of defense robert s mcnamara and former national security 
adviser mcgeorge bundy have said the united states had no such 
plans although a recently declassified memo indicates there were 
contingency plans set 
in the analyses at the time and ever since we thought the only 
real reason for their putting missiles in cuba was to put the 
american homeland at risk and change the strategic balance and the 
defense of cuba was regarded as a kind of hokedup piece of 
propaganda said blight

martha c shields told her children when 
they were young never to touch the old steamer trunk in the 
basement before she died however she asked them to take care of 
what was inside of it 
expecting to find her will when they opened the trunk wednesday 
her son and daughter were shocked to discover the blanketwrapped 
skeleton of an infant a bible a small chest and the remnants of a 
babys white dress police said 
the 67yearold elkridge woman may well have taken the secret of 
the trunks contents to her grave when she died monday police said 
a police search of the house turned up no sign of a will or 
anything to explain the infants remains state police detective 
michael e davey said 
mrs shields children robert 29 and joyce 31 told 
investigators they could remember no family discussions about an 
infant brother or sister who may have died at birth or shortly 
thereafter nor did they recall their mother ever being pregnant 
while they were growing up davey said 
davey said the infant was fullterm and may have been stillborn 
or died soon after birth possibly as long as 30 years ago 
the remains were sent to the state medical examiners office 
both children still live in the house they declined to comment 
to the baltimore sun on wednesday 
mrs shields and her husband robert had lived in elkridge a 
small town about eight miles south of baltimore for about 20 years 
her husband died of lung cancer while the children were young 
neighbors described mrs shields as sometimes belligerent with 
children who came on her property but so generous to squirrels that 
they would come to her door for food 
she kept a wellstocked bird feeder and often asked her neighbor 
to buy nuts for her to feed the squirrels said peg russell who 
lives next door 
neighbors said she spent much of each day listening to a police 
scanner and seldom left the house they said she had been in poor 
health for several months before her death 
people who had an opportunity to get to know her really liked 
her ms russell said

scientists said today they had discovered the 
threedimensional structure of a crucial protein made by the aids 
virus defining a target for potential new aids drugs 
the discovery will aid attempts to design drugs that block the 
action of the protein crippling the ability of the virus to spread 
its infection researchers said 
while such a drug would not cure acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome it might keep the disease under control said researcher 
manuel navia 
he and eight other scientists from the merck sharp and dohme 
research laboratories in rahway nj and west point penn 
report their discovery of the proteins structure in todays issue 
of the british journal nature 
the accomplishment the first time a threedimensional structure 
has been reported for any aids virus protein is pretty 
dramatic commented aids researcher jay levy of the university of 
california at san francisco 
william haseltine of the danafarber cancer institute in boston 
called the finding an important and critical step along the 
pathway to rational antiaids drug development 
the protein is an enzyme which is a class of substances that 
permit or speed up chemical reactions the aids enzyme comes into 
play as the virus makes more copies of itself 
after the virus infects a cell it orders the cells 
proteinmaking machinery to make proteins for producing new viruses 
the proteins are manufactured in a string like cars on a train 
and they will not function unless separated the newly analyzed 
enzyme is reponsible for cutting the proteins apart 
if the enzyme fails to do its job the newly produced viruses 
cannot infect other cells navia said so a drug that blocks the 
enzyme should stop the spread of infection he said 
haseltine said such a drug should also keep an infected person 
from being infectious to others 
researchers would have to make sure that the drug would not block 
similar enzymes elsewhere in a persons body levy said 
the structure of the aids enzyme looks like a tangled string in 
the general shape of an angelfish it is formed by the joining of 
two identical structures

raymond buckey one of two remaining 
defendants in the mcmartin preschool child molestation trial 
expressed concern about threats and criticized news coverage of his 
case after being freed on 15 million bail 
buckey 30 refused to talk to a crowd of reporters wednesday as 
he left a downtown jail with his attorney danny davis they climbed 
into a mercedesbenz and drove to a chinese restaurant where buckey 
was interviewed by television station kabc 
buckey who spent more than five years in jail said he was 
worried about threats against him his attorneys and his family 
i still realize there are people out there that as far as im 
concerned have gone off the deep end he said 
he further derided news coverage saying reporters had flocked to 
the trials prosecution phase but few journalists have been 
attending while the defense is presenting its case 
its discouraging to think that they wont come to hear what we 
have to say but theyll come and make a mob scene at my getting out 
on bail he said 
buckey said he has been in jail so long that i dont remember 
emotional feelings that everybody out there takes for granted ive 
been isolated in a nightmare 
he and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 61 face 65 child 
molestation and conspiracy counts stemming from alleged sexual 
attacks at the familyrun preschool she has been free on bail since 
1987 
superior court judge william pounders on friday ordered buckey 
freed although his release was delayed by paperwork involving the 
real estate that had been pledged for bail 
pounders said he wanted buckeys long pretrial incarceration to 
end as soon as possible but he also set several conditions for 
buckey 
the defendant was ordered to have no contact with the alleged 
victims in the case to stay away from the seaside area southwest of 
downtown where the school had operated and to turn over his 
passport and remain under 24hour security protection 
buckey also was prohibited from coming in contact with anyone 
younger than 14 and from drinking alcohol 
family friends as well as davis and cocounsel dean gits 
arranged for buckeys bail by pledging title to real estate 
properties worth twice the required bail of 15 million 
the case drew national attention when it broke in 1984 with 
allegations of nursery school children being raped sodomized then 
terrorized into silence by satanic rites and animal mutilations by 
teachers

navajo chairman peter macdonald ignored 
shouted demands for a vote and halted a tribal council meeting on 
whether he should go on leave in the wake of corruption allegations 
the meeting wednesday included more than eight hours of 
discussion on whether temporary replacements should be named for 
macdonald and vice chairman johnny thompson but macdonald ordered 
the meeting recessed until today 
as macdonald walked out of the meeting room some council members 
yelled we want to vote 
afterward about 50 council members went behind closed doors to 
discuss the situation 
a spokesman for the group councilman duane chilli yazzie 
said macdonald supporters and opponents would try to reach a 
compromise today 
we need to get peter macdonald to step aside yazzie said 
thompson has not been implicated in any wrongdoing 
the tribe on tuesday began its annual winter meeting which 
usually lasts five to seven days consideration of macdonalds 
future was added to the agenda after us senate hearings this month 
on indian issues including corruption in tribal governmnents 
witnesses have testified before the senate select committee on 
indian affairs that macdonald 60 who won his fourth fouryear term 
in november 1986 after four years out of office has taken kickbacks 
and demanded trips and other favors as a part of awarding contracts 
byron bud brown a phoenix real estate agent who helped 
arrange a 334 million navajo ranch purchase in july 1987 hours 
after phoenix oilman tom tracy paid 262 million for the ranch has 
been granted immunity from prosecution he alleged macdonald was 
among those who shared tracys 72 million profit 
the account was corroborated before the committee by mcdonalds 
son peter macdonald jr also testifying under immunity 
macdonald has refused to answer a subpoena from the panel which 
has denied him immunity from prosecution and has refused to discuss 
the allegations with nonindians but he has told navajos that the 
committee pilloried him because of his belief in indian rights and 
said the probe was a racist attempt to undermine tribal sovereignty 
at a press briefing wednesday in phoenix sens dennis deconcini 
dariz and john mccain rariz denied the probe was racially 
motivated 
deconcini turned aside questions of whether macdonald would be 
indicted but said material had been turned over to government 
prosecutors for evaluation 
an estimated 170000 of the nations 200000 navajos live on the 
25000squaremile reservation which covers much of northeastern

the federal government will act soon to 
reduce long lines of immigrants at a processing center in south 
texas the governments top immigration official in the area said 
one possibility is detention 
somethings got to be done to stop people from abusing the 
asylum process said omer g sewell director for the immigration 
and naturalization services harlingen district where more than 
100000 central american immigrants are expected to pass through 
this year 
more than 1000 central americans primarily from nicaragua and 
el salvador formed a halfmilelong line wednesday to apply for 
political asylum at the new ins processing location at the agencys 
remote rural detention center southeast of harlingen 
it was their first chance to file for political amnesty since the 
ins processing center in harlingen was closed friday because of 
alleged health and fire code violations 
sewell and other ins officials contend that many seeking asylum 
are here only to better themselves economically and use the asylum 
process and lengthy appeals to get into the united states political 
asylum is granted only to those fleeing persecution for political or 
other reasons 
im waiting for more direction from washington and i think 
theres going to be some action taken to relieve this problem 
sewell said while taking a look at the line of immigrants outside 
the minimumsecurity 347acre port isabel service processing center 
he declined to reveal what that action might be 
sewell said tuesday that detention for the asylumseekers while 
their cases are under review is one alternative being considered 
mario ortiz the ins regional public affairs director repeated 
wednesday that a detention camp remains a possibility 
the ins detention center is in eastern cameron county near the 
unincorporated community of bayview just south of the laguna 
atascosa national wildlife refuge and 15 miles northeast of 
brownsville 
us district judge filemon vela of brownsville has said he would 
rule by monday on whether the ins can resume a policy of requiring 
asylumseekers to stay in southern texas while their cases are 
reviewed 
the judge on jan 9 issued a temporary restraining order forcing 
the ins to allow them to travel to their us destinations after 
checking in with the agencys harlingen district 
but vela has said he probably would allow the ins to resume the 
notravel policy for all asylumseekers after the restraining order 
expires monday 
the ins originally began the travel restriction to relieve huge 
backlogs of thousands of asylum cases in cities such as miami and 
los angeles

attorneys for the beatles and michael 
jackson have sued to stop a video distributor from selling 
videocassettes featuring the fab four 
the federal lawsuit alleges that video wholesalers inc of 
neptune illegally distributed and sold several beatles 
videocassettes including the beatles at shea stadium the 
beatles in tokyo beatles concert in washington dc and the 
beatles in the magical mystery tour 
jackson owns the copyright to most beatles songs 
after the lawsuit was filed wednesday attorneys for video 
wholesalers agreed to halt sale of the videotapes until the matter 
is resolved in a hearing march 3 before us district judge garrett 
e brown 
this case is of great importance because it is the first time 
that michael jackson and the beatles have come together to police 
the valuable beatles material in which they each have substantial 
interests said their attorney leonard m marks this lawsuit 
sends bootleggers and pirates of beatles materials the clear message 
that they will be sued for damages and stopped in their tracks 
david saka a director for video wholesalers denied that his 
company is doing anything illegal 
we have complete rights for what we are doing saka said 
we sell prerecorded videocassettes that are made by other people 
and made legally they have not litigated against the manufacturers 
weve looked into it and everything is in order 
saka said the sale of the videotapes is not restricted by 
copyright laws 
lyle hough sakas attorney said the agreement to temporarily 
stop sales of the videotape is in no way an admission of guilt 
the complaint filed by jackson and three beatlesowned concerns 
apple corps ltd apple films ltd and subafilms alleges that video 
wholesalers illegally made and sold the videocassettes without 
authorization 
it charges that the company violated federal copyright laws 
attorneys for jackson and the beatles are seeking to bar the firm 
permanently from selling the videocassettes they said they also 
will ask for financial damages

rock and bottle throwing by bystanders may 
have contributed indirectly to a drug suspects death a prosecutor 
said after eight police officers were cleared of wrongdoing in the 
case 
its only common sense to think that if he received treatment 
sooner the outcome might have been different assistant state 
attorney john skye said wednesday 
skyes office announced that an investigation had determined that 
the death of edgar allen price 40 was accidental and that there 
was no criminal wrongdoing or negligence on the part of eight 
officers involved in a violent scuffle on feb 1 
authorities said it took all eight officers to subdue the 
6foot3 300pound price following a drug purchase by undercover 
agents in college hill a predominantly black housing development 
the arrest triggered two days of sporadic street violence in the 
neighborhood 
price an exconvict from houston was hogtied and placed face 
down in the back seat of a police cruiser after rock and bottle 
throwing erupted authorities said police drove price to a school 
parking lot a couple of blocks away so paramedics could tend him out 
of the path of flying debris 
the medical examiners office said the restraint following the 
exertion of the struggle was partly responsible for prices death 
by being placed in a limited space with the head face down into 
the back seat and being handcuffed and restrained the 
necessary conditions for producing an asphyxial death existed dr 
charles diggs associate hillsborough medical examiner said in a 
report released friday 
police chief austin c mclane defended his officers saying they 
properly restrained price with handcuffs and leg ropes mclane said 
he was not surprised that no charges were filed 
a police department internal review of the officers actions has 
not been completed and is not expected for a couple of weeks

consumer reports called two popular models of 
latex condoms grossly defective provoking an angry reply from 
the manufacturer which accused the magazine of flawed testing and a 
misunderstanding of the product 
consumers union publisher of consumer reports said wednesday 
its testing of 16000 condoms showed that six other models were less 
reliable than desired the tests involved filling some condoms with 
water and then checking for leaks and inflating others with air 
until they burst 
all passed government standards in the leakage test but two 
models lifestyles extra strength with nonoxynol9 and lifestyles 
nuda plus had a projected failure rate of 10 percent in the 
inflation test poor enough for the magazine to rate them defective 
the government does not use that test 
ansell inc the dothan alamaker of lifestyles condoms 
objected to the methods used in the consumer union study which was 
published in the magazines march issue 
were mad said spokesman lou capozzi we think its a bad 
study 
in a statement the new yorkbased company said the magazine 
reported on products that were voluntarily recalled tested too few 
samples of each product and otherwise used flawed testing procedures 
clearly consumer reports does not understand condoms it 
said 
ansell voluntarily recalled 6 million lifestyles extra strength 
with nonoxynol9 condoms last year consumer reports noted it said 
most of those it tested were from the recalled lots and it had no 
data on subsequent lots 
it said there was no recall of the lifestyles nuda plus line 
ansell president john silverman said we are shocked that 
consumer reports would report negative test results on a product 
they knew ansell had voluntarily recalled six months ago 
consumer reports knew their information was out of date they 
knew their research was flawed and they published it anyway we 
fully expect them to withdraw this erroneous report and redo the 
study he added 
six other models had a projected failure rate of 4 percent in the 
inflation test which the magazine called higher than wed prefer 
to see they were sheik nonlubricated plain end ramses sensitol 
lubricated pleaser ribbed lubricated now called saxon ribbed 
lubricated ramses nuform mentor and lifestyles nuda 
samples of 32 other models were ranked in the mostdurable 
category the magazine reported they broke very rarely and thus 
were more likely to prevent pregnancy and the spread of disease it 
said 
the federal food and drug administration tests condoms for water 
leakage but does not use the inflation test while it does not rate 
condoms and did not endorse the consumer union study basically 
we have no disagreements or problems with the study said fda 
spokesman david duarte 
the 32 models in the studys strongest category had a projected 
failure rate of 15 percent toprated for strength were gold circle 
coin and lifestyles extra strength lubricated both were thicker 
than others 
skin condoms made from sheep intestine rather than latex are 
stronger than many rubber condoms consumer reports said however 
it said evidence was not conclusive that skin condoms block passage 
of some viruses and said its medical consultants advised using 
latex condoms to prevent disease 
the magazine included general advice for the use of latex 
condoms warning for example that oilbased lubricants such as 
vaseline and crisco break down the rubber and should not be used 
it recommended waterbased lubricants such as ky lubricating jelly 
and today personal lubricant

an astronomer who contends adm robert e peary 
faked his claim that he reached the north pole in 1909 conceded 
today that he misread a key piece of evidence 
dennis rawlins however said he still believes a preponderance 
of evidence indicates that peary never reached the pole and knew it 
the baltimore astronomer said an investigative team commissioned 
by the national geographic society was right in saying he had 
misinterpreted a page of handwritten calculations by peary but said 
its interpretation also was off 
early this month navigation foundation president thomas d 
davies whose organization the society hired to look into the peary 
controversy announced that a worksheet rawlins thought held compass 
calculations actually showed time readings 
rawlins who argued in a 1970 article and a 1973 book that peary 
had been off course went further last october he said the 
worksheet he had found among pearys papers at the national archives 
contained navigational notes proving the explorer was 121 miles away 
from the pole when peary gave up his quest 
in his book peary at the north pole fact or fiction 
rawlins said peary never got closer than 100 miles to his goal the 
astronomer said today he still believes peary was about that far off 
the mark 
the disputed document was in an envelope that pearys wife jo 
had labeled as her husbands observations at the time in 1909 when 
he claimed to have been at the pole 
davies a retired navy rear admiral said this month that three 
experts had examined the document and determined the calculations 
were made not in 1909 but three years earlier when peary was about 
to set off on his 1906 try for the pole 
rawlins said today that davies interpretation of the time 
readings was incorrect and that they are the readings peary made on 
march 3 1900 in greenland just before he set out to round the 
arctic islands tip 
its a part of his greatest legitimate trip rawlins said 
the astronomer said peary had reportedly told his wife the sheet was 
his most precious possession and that it is likely peary was most 
proud of his greenland trip because it was never questioned 
there are other pieces of evidence that indicate peary did not 
reach the pole rawlins said he pointed out that the explorer did 
not bring back such normal records as readings of longitude and 
compass variations 
davies said in an interview published today in the washington 
post that rawlins could be right and that his groups interpretation 
was tentative 
we havent seen his numbers yet but well want to look at 
them davies said

shouting oppose bushs visit 
several hundred radical students attacked a us cultural center 
with firebombs and steel pipes today and at least six policemen were 
hurt officials said 
it was the third time the us center in downtown kwangju had 
been attacked by radicals in less than a month 
witnesses said 200 to 300 students stormed the centers compound 
and briefly occupied its courtyard smashing windows and tossing 
firebombs before being driven away by police firing tear gas 
the us embassy in seoul reported fire damage to some furniture 
and fixtures in the centers main building which houses a public 
library and distributes information about the united states 
embassy officials said about 20 students scaled a wall around the 
compound and forced their way into the building but no staff 
members inside were hurt 
drive out yankees and oppose bushs visit witnesses 
quoted the protesters as shouting 
kwangju an opposition stronghold is 180 miles southwest of 
seoul where president bush is to stop over on feb 27 on his way 
back to washington after attending japanese emperor hirohitos 
funeral and visiting china 
the attack came despite a warning by the government that any 
violence in antigovernment protests would be strongly opposed 
after about 15000 militant farmers rioted in seoul on monday 
burning cars and buildings president roh taewoo chided police for 
not taking a strong stand on violence saying i have endured 
enough 
the kwangju cultural center is a favored attack site for radical 
students radicals have attacked the center 28 times since 1980 
six times last year 
on wednesday gerald mcloughlin director of the kwangju cultural 
center was quoted as telling local reporters that the united states 
may move the center to an outlying area of kwangju to protect its 
facility and staff 
several weeks ago the united states said it was considering 
closing the center because of the repeated attacks and concern for 
the safety of its staff 
a spokesman for the students all from kwangjus chonnam 
university demanded in a telephone interview with the associated 
press that bush cancel the korea trip he said the visit is designed 
to bolster eroding support for the roh government 
the united states must stop meddling in our affairs and close 
its cultural center here he said 
on wednesday groups of 100 to 200 radical students set fire to 
two police substations and fought running street battles with riot 
police in kwangju to oppose rohs visit to the city 
antigovernment and antius sentiment is relatively high in 
kwangju because of the bloody military suppression of a 
prodemocracy civil uprising there in 1980 by official count about 
200 people were killed in the uprising but dissident groups claim 
the toll was much higher 
many opposition and dissident figures claim the united states 
shared responsibility for the bloodbath in kwangju by condoning the 
governments plan to quell the uprising the united states has 
denied the charge 
in leaflets scattered around the kwangju cultural center 
students also demanded the fall of rohs government and an end to 
annual ussouth korean joint military exercises 
dissidents have claimed the exercises named team spirit are 
blocking dialogue with communist north korea

a respected alderman withdrew from the democratic 
mayoral primary in a move that could tighten the already narrowing 
race between mayor eugene sawyer and states attorney richard m 
daley 
i would say right now this is a dead heat sawyer said 
shortly after alderman lawrence bloom announced his withdrawal 
wednesday 
bloom a south side alderman who campaigned on the theme of 
racial unity said it had become clear he lacked the money to 
finance a competitive campaign for the feb 28 primary he said he 
would campaign for sawyer 
daley said he wasnt surprised by blooms withdrawal or his 
endorsement of sawyer who was elected acting mayor by the city 
council in december 1987 shortly after harold washington the citys 
first black mayor died 
daley the son of the late mayor richard j daley said he 
expects to get half of the votes that would have gone to bloom 
however polls have indicated that most of blooms supporters 
considered sawyer their second choice 
a daily southtown economistwbbmtv poll taken last week showed 
daley supported by 43 percent of those surveyed sawyer by 33 
percent and bloom by 11 percent twelve percent expressed no 
preference 
the 10 percentage points between daley and sawyer marks a 
narrowing of daleys 14point edge a month earlier 
the poll which has a margin of error of 4 percentage points 
shows a virtual dead heat if a rumored writein campaign on the 
republican ticket for former alderman edward vrdolyak were to 
materialize 
the survey indicates vrdolyak would draw enough votes away from 
daley to give the states attorney a 1 percentage point lead over 
sawyer 39 percent to 38 percent a lead rendered meaningless by the 
polls margin of error 
sawyer spokesman larry horist said the mayor can expect to get 
the vast majority of the bloom vote particularly with bloom and his 
staff joining the sawyer campaign 
bloom is a very respected alderman said horist hes going 
to have an influence with both the undecided voters and those who 
might be leaning to daley but who might be soft 
daleys staff contends otherwise 
marj halperin a spokeswoman for the county prosecutor said she 
doubts blooms endorsement will mean much because he has been 
sympathetic toward sawyer all along 
nonetheless she said daley sees the race getting tighter in the 
remaining week and a half 
blooms withdrawal came a day after financial campaign statements 
were filed showing he had raised 228000 compared with about 3 
million for each of the two other major candidates 
the alderman had said throughout the campaign that he was in the 
race to stay though he hedged by reserving the right to change his 
mind 
the winner of the primary will take on the gop candidate and 
alderman timothy evans a thirdparty candidate in the april 4 
general election to complete the last two years of washingtons 
second term

a watchdog group that criticized the use of 
timeout boxes to punish unruly specialeducation students says a 
decision to end their use is a step in the right direction but more 
needs to be done 
michelle hallbolden a spokeswoman for the champaign illbased 
protection and advocacy inc said officials of pontiacs elementary 
school district still plan to use such discipline by isolating 
pupils in small rooms 
id like to see the school district look at other alternatives 
besides timeout she said 
school superintendent wayne krula said wednesday that use of the 
boxes to contain unruly students for brief periods has been 
regrettably discontinued 
the booths have played a very important and necessary role 
but they will no longer be used because of misinterpretations and 
reactions he said 
the boxes which were in place at three schools were constructed 
for timeouts because of limited classroom space school officials 
said 
without the boxes the district will have to use small rooms at 
central school and pontiac junior high school krula said when 
students with behavioral disorders at washington and lincoln schools 
need to calm down they will be tranported to schools with timeout 
space he said 
the boxes which measure 3 feet by 3 feet and stand about 7 feet 
tall have been used in the district in this central illinois town 
of 11000 people for the past two years 
the practice drew attention last month when a 12yearold boy 
broke out of the wooden box made by a janitor at washington 
elementary school 
his parents complained about his confinement to protection and 
advocacy which fights for the rights of the mentally ill and 
disabled 
some parents threatened legal action and the daily leader 
newspaper here editorialized against the boxes saying they should 
not be used under any circumstances 
school district officials have defended the boxes as a 
timehonored way in which to handle youngsters without corporal 
punishment 
the state board of education sent an official to pontiac to 
review the boxes and a report is expected this week on their 
appropriateness as a disciplinary measure 
john rapp the districts specialeducation supervisor said last 
week the punishment was limited to three pupils ages 10 to 12 who 
were seen as a threat to teachers or other children and were 
classified as behavior disorder cases by a psychologist 
timeouts are used only for students with behavioral disorders who 
have shown consistently uncontrollable aggressive behavior such 
as swearing or hitting teachers he said 
students were put into the boxes only after a series of other 
disciplinary steps brought no results rapp said the box was used 
only as a last resort for up to 15 minutes and with a teacher or 
teachers aide present at all times he said

big dreams fueled big lottery sales 
throughout new jersey as players took their chances on a 17 million 
jackpot in todays drawing the largest in state history 
id quit work said one woman buying a ticket at the 
middlesex food mart in the northern new jersey borough of middlesex 
id just relax said another 
id squander it all in one day said a third 
the lure of the record jackpot didnt create lines at most 
lottery outlets but shop owners said business was brisk 
lottery spokeswoman sharon southard said lottery sales usually 
average about 25 million to 3 million for each pick6 drawing 
and there were only 13 million in sales last week when the jackpot 
was at 6 million 
but when the jackpot reached 12 million monday there were 95 
million in lottery tickets sold 
the estimated jackpot for today is the result of six consecutive 
pick6 drawings without a top prize winner 
the jackpot also was fueled by a big change in the odds made last 
month when lottery officials increased the choice of numbers from 42 
to 46 previously the odds of hitting the jackpot were about one in 
52 million but with the added numbers the odds of picking all six 
numbers are one in 93 million 
i guess everybodys dreaming about what they could do with 17 
million said tony salvo a federal express driver from trenton 
whos been hearing about the lottery at every stop 
i try not to think about it too much because it can consume 
you he added 
but michael korolenko a produce truck driver has spent plenty 
of time thinking about the lottery korolenko 31 said hes been 
buying tickets at each store as he makes his rounds 
korolenko is hoping the lottery tickets will give him an 
opportunity to buy another kind of ticket 
sure thats the way out he said the ticket out of new

the author of the satanic verses canceled a 
planned promotional tour of the united states after iran put a 26 
million price on his head 
the current climate is not appropriate for a promotional tour 
of the us said a statement issued wednesday by the books 
publisher viking penguin inc 
viking penguin had scheduled an 11city us tour for salman 
rushdie including readings at four universities the tour was to 
begin friday to coincide with the official us publication of the 
book on feb 11 the book has been available in stores in this 
country for several weeks 
but rushdie who lives in london was reported to have gone into 
hiding with his wife american novelist marianne wiggins following 
the iranian threat 
police said seven bomb threats have been made in the past two 
months to the publishers manhattan offices 
the book banned in iran india pakistan bangladesh egypt and 
south africa was described as a dirty conspiracy against islam 
by the iranian government six people died earlier this week in 
protests against the book in pakistan 
ayatollah khomeini called for rushdies death and iran on 
wednesday offered 26 million to any iranian and 1 million to any 
foreigner who killed the author a moslem born in bombay india 
paul slovak a viking penguin spokesman said recent events in 
pakistan and india combined with our understanding of threats 
made against the author and those associated with the books 
publication led the publisher to cancel the tour 
we reiterate that no offense was intended in the creation or 
publication of this work the publishers statement publisher said 
it is also our unalterable position that freedom of speech 
freedom to publish and freedom to read must be guaranteed 
internationally it added 
rushdie received support tuesday from the authors guild which 
issued a statement saying it supports the right of all authors 
everywhere to write without fear of constraint from any quarters

rushdie and his publishers the statement said 
dawud assad president of the council of masajid of the united 
states called the book garbage and said he welcomed the 
cancellation of the us book tour 
but assad said it was wrong to sentence the author to death 
islam is a religion of peace and tolerance he said who 
knows what is really in the heart of salman rushdie 
muslim leaders in los angeles and detroit reacted similarly 
im shocked by rushdies insensitivity but i think calls for 
his murder are absurd absolutely absurd said khaled abou el fadl 
of the los angelesbased muslim political action committee i am 
not even in favor of banning the book i personally think the whole 
thing was blown out of proportion

a jury awarded rock hudsons lover 145 
million 35 million more than he sought in a case that appears 
to increase the legal responsibility of aids sufferers to tell 
sexual companions of their plight 
in what one expert called a landmark decision the jury declared 
wednesday that hudson engaged in outrageous conduct before his 
death by withholding his aids diagnosis from marc christian so he 
could continue their sexual affair 
the settlement could go still higher jurors were scheduled to 
return today to hear evidence and consider punitive damages against 
mark miller hudsons secretary who was found to have conspired to 
keep the late actors aids diagnosis a secret 
hudsons estate and miller were codefendants in the sevenweek 
trial in los angeles superior court where jurors listened to 
oftenlurid testimony about the late stars sex life before deciding 
in favor of christian 35 
im very pleased very pleased that they the jurors answered 
the way they did on all the questions christian said adding that 
the verdict shows people have a duty to disclose if they have aids 
to their lovers 
aside from hudsons fame the case was unusual because christian 
apparently was not infected by the aids virus in spite of his 
exposure it is believed to be the first case of its type in which 
damages were awarded to a plaintiff who had not developed physical 
symptoms of aids 
christian claimed he was entitled to compensation for the 
emotional distress of fearing he would get aids a fatal illness 
that attacks the bodys immune system 
margaret davis an attorney and author of lovers doctors amp the 
law said the hudson case is absolutely a landmark that will 
likely encourage other lawsuits by people who are deceived by 
promises in the dark 
the jury is telling america that you have to make full and 
complete disclosure if you are aware that you have the disease 
she said youre going to think twice about it if you know you can 
face big dollar damages or time in jail 
a spokesman for the san francisco aids foundation expressed 
ambivalence about the verdict 
we find it a troubling case because it places the entire burden 
of safe sex on one individual and not the two said the spokesman 
steven petrow it underscores for us again the need for everyone 
who engages in sexual activity to take responsibility for themselves 
as well as for their partners 
attorneys in the hudson case who are under a gag order would 
not comment on any aspect of the verdict including how the judgment 
will be apportioned or if the defendants will appeal as expected 
appeals courts have often reduced huge awards in civil cases 
attorneys for the estate attempted to portray christian as a 
gigolo whose relationship with hudson had ended when the actor 
learned he had the disease they said repeated medical tests showed 
that christian had not been infected by the aids virus 
christians attorney pointed to sentimental love letters from 
hudson to buttress the claim that theirs was a serious affair of the 
heart 
i love you my baby said one of the missives 
although he shared hudsons bed for two years the aspiring 
musician said he didnt learn the actor had aids until it was 
announced to the world shortly before hudson died in october 1985 at 
age 58 
i thought i was a dead man christian testified of his 
reaction to the news 
hudson the handsome hollywood leading man paired on screen and 
television with doris day elizabeth taylor and linda evans kept 
his homosexuality a closely guarded secret until his battle with 
aids became public knowledge 
in a complicated verdict questionnaire the jury answered yes 
to the question did rock hudson engage in outrageous conduct 
jurors gave the same response regarding miller 
christian smiled happily as the verdict was read miller 
hudsons secretary and best friend didnt react visibly to the 
verdict he alone is subject to possible punitive damages for his 
actions in helping hudson keep his secret 
miller said he abided by hudsons wishes because he was a friend 
but also because he thought the affair between the two lovers had 
ended 
the jury thought otherwise to the question after mark miller 
knew that rock hudson had aids did mark miller know that plaintiff 
and rock hudson were having sexual relations of a type that put 
plaintiff at risk of acquiring aids the panel answered yes 
asked whether miller kept the actors secret to induce 
plaintiff to have highrisk sexual relations with rock hudson 
jurors also answered yes 
the 12 jurors answers to the 37 questions were not always 
unanimous but in civil trials only a majority of nine is needed to 
reach a verdict on each question they were unanimous on 23 
decisions all favoring christian 
miller was a chief beneficiary of hudsons estate the value of 
which was not disclosed in the actors will when it was filed in 
november 1985

a foiled scheme to steal 14 million from 
automated teller machines has sparked concerns about the 
vulnerability of the systems particularly when an insider is 
involved officials said 
secret service agents raided an apartment here 12 days ago and 
broke up what the government described as a ring created by a 
28yearold computer programmer designed to obtain cash from 
thousands of bank of america accounts 
there has never been an attempt like this in the history of 
shared atms said dale d browning president of plus systems 
inc the nations largest automatic teller machine network and one 
of the aborted schemes targets we can certainly learn a lot from 
it 
i think the potential there should be very scary for the 
networks said shirley norton a bank of america spokeswoman 
atm use has grown dramatically over the past 10 years as a means 
for bank customers to access their accounts 24 hours a day there 
are more than 72000 atms nationwide and plus systems alone links 
25000 of the machines 
atm crimes have been considered minor usually involving people 
being robbed after taking money out of the machines or small thefts 
by employees but a study by the bank administration institute an 
industry research organization found that losses in 1986 nationwide 
were 40 million 
according to industry officials the sophistication of the 
criminals has increased as the number of atms has grown 
nearly 350000 was stolen from security pacific national bank in 
los angeles in october when a special card was used to steal cash 
from 300 customer accounts that theft is the largest reported atm 
crime 
but that figure seems small compared to the 7 million to 14 
million that could have been stolen in the latest scheme said 
assistant us attorney carolyn j kubota 
mark allan koenig who had been a temporary contract employee for 
gte information services a subsidiary of gte corp is accused of 
divising a plan to make 7400 counterfeit atm cards in his 
programming job he had access to secret atm codes at dozens of 
banks his wife sister brother and another person also were 
arrested 
the foiled bank of america attempt has prompted plus systems to 
plan new steps to ensure that contractors comply with procedures to 
protect secret account information browning said 
if the security standards are implemented and enforced there 
should not be any security breach he said we are now 
evaluating ways in which we can verify the enforcement of our 
regulations

president ranasinghe premadasas party 
retained its majority in parliament the government announced today 
in an election marred by ethnic violence that left more than 1000 
people dead 
the presidents united national party captured 125 of the 225 
parliamentary seats government officials announced but it was 
thwarted in its efforts to win complete control of the body with a 
twothirds majority the governing party had held 139 of the 168 
seats in the outgoing parliament 
the ballotcounting from wednesdays election took place under a 
21hour nationwide curfew civilian movement was banned earlier 
today in an effort to prevent more killings by sinhalese extremists 
and tamil guerrillas 
shortly before the curfew began this morning sinhalese militants 
shot and killed five soldiers and wounded four policemen in attacks 
on army and police posts in southern and central sri lanka police 
said 
at least 56 people were killed in ethnic violence on election 
day police said about 1000 others were slain during the fiveweek 
campaign 
premadasas party won 110 seats in direct popular balloting and 
15 more under a formula calculated on the nationwide percentage the 
officials said 
however the opposition led by the sri lanka freedom party of 
former prime minister sirmavo bandaranaike prevented the party of 
the 64yearold president from winning the twothirds majority it 
wanted 
such a victory would have assured the president of sufficient 
power to amend the constitution and push through measures aimed at 
stopping the ethnic unrest in this indian ocean island 
the sri lanka freedom party had eight and the rest were shared by 
smaller parties and unattached members in the outgoing parliament 
officials said the president planned an ambitious antipoverty 
program for his 16 million people and to bring an end to the ethnic 
violence which has claimed more than 10000 lives since 1983 
mrs bandaranaikes party captured 67 seats and tamil candidates 
got 23 according to the official returns 
the tamil winners included 12 members of the eelam students 
revolutionary organization formerly one of the underground rebel 
groups fighting for an independent homeland 
an alliance of three leftist parties won three seats and smaller 
parties and independents took the rest 
as the results were being announced over staterun television and 
radio troops and policemen fanned out across the nation to enforce 
the curfew setting up road blocks in the capital 
hundreds of colombo residents crowded groceries and pharmacies to 
stock up on essential goods after curfew hours were announced on 
television this morning the curfew was to remain in force until at 
least 6 am friday 
the united national party held 139 of the 168 seats in the 
outgoing parliament the sri lanka freedom party had eight and the 
rest were shared by smaller parties and unattached members 
the violence of recent years was sparked by a campaign by 
minority tamils for an independent homeland at least 8500 people 
have been killed in the separatist war and another 1500 killed in 
a sinhalese backlash 
militants among the sinhalese accuse the government of granting 
too many concessions to the tamils under a 1987 peace accord aimed 
at ending the bloody separatist war the peace pact failed after the 
most powerful of the tamil radical groups the liberation tigers of 
tamil eelam rejected it 
tamils make up 18 percent of the people the sinhalese account 
for about 75 percent militant tamils claim they are discriminated 
by the sinhalese in government jobs the army and education

leaders of the countrys 
largest antiapartheid groups today renounced winnie mandela and 
accused her young bodyguards of waging a reign of terror in the 
black community 
a group of influential activists accused mrs mandela wife of 
jailed african national congress leader nelson mandela of 
violating human rights in the name of the struggle against 
apartheid 
it was the first public denunciation of mrs mandela by the 
senior leadership of the antiapartheid movement 
mrs mandela and a group of young supporters known as the 
mandela united soccer club are under investigation in the death of 
a teenage black activist who disappeared after allegedly being 
beaten at mrs mandelas home in the soweto township 
police and community leaders say the activist stompie seipei 
14 led a childrens army of 1500 black children in the 
tumahole township of the orange free state and became a legend in 
the racial unrest of 198487 
he was jailed under emergency rules at age 10 the youngest of 
the thousands detained and held for 11 months 
two other slayings one of a mandela united member and the other 
of a prominent antiapartheid physician also are being investigated 
by police as part of the case 
the police investigation is the latest in a series of 
controversies in recent years that have dogged mrs mandela 
many black activists used to call her mother of the nation 
but mrs mandelas erratic behavior and reluctance to coordinate her 
actions with black leaders have alienated many supporters 
mrs mandela has abused the trust and confidence which she has 
enjoyed over the years said murphy morobe a spokesman for the 
banned united democratic front the countrys largest antiapartheid 
group 
numerous efforts have been made to reconcile the conflict 
between mrs mandela and the black community he said on 
every occasion mrs mandela has refused to cooperate and has chosen 
to disregard the sentiments of the community 
morobe emphasized that antiapartheid leaders reaffirm our 
unqualified support for our leader nelson mandela and call for his 
immediate release 
mandela the countrys best known black leader has been 
imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage 
and plotting to overthrow the whiteled government 
joining morobe at the news conference were other leaders of the 
united democratic front prominent antiapartheid lawyers and 
officials of the militant congress of south african trade unions 
the largest black labor federation 
morobe noted that mrs mandela has faced severe hardships such 
as being separated from her husband for 27 years raising her two 
daughters alone living under a series harsh police restictions and 
spending 18 months in solitary confinement without charge 
we pay tribute to her contribution said morobe adding that 
it had been a painful decision for black leaders to speak out 
against mrs mandela 
but he said her actions repeatedly violated the principles of the 
antiapartheid movement 
he specifically cited mandela united a group of youths who seldom 
play soccer but have served as mrs mandelas bodyguards since she 
formed the team in 1986 
we are outraged by the reign of terror that the team has been 
associated with morobe said not only is mrs mandela 
associated with the team in fact the team is her own creation 
morobe conceded that the government will use the criticism 
against mrs mandela as a propaganda point 
morobe said black leaders did not seek to create a division in 
the black community and called on people to distance themselves from 
mrs mandela in a dignified manner 
mrs mandela could not immediately be reached for comment a 
woman at mrs mandelas soweto office said she was not available 
mandelas lawyer ismail ayob said he did not think mandela was 
aware of todays denunciation of his wife 
mrs mandela returned to johannesburg on wednesday after an 
80minute meeting at a prison farm near cape town with her husband 
after her return police stopped the van carrying her back to soweto 
and impounded the vehicle on the highway 
while mrs mandela her daughter and granddaughter hitched a ride 
with a journalist police took into custody a young man accompanying 
her but they later released him 
police capt ruben bloomberg said the van had been seized for 
investigation into the slaying of stompie whose decomposed body was 
identified in a police morgue wednesday through fingerprints 
we are outraged at mrs mandelas complicity in the recent 
abductions and assault of stompie morobe said had stompie and 
his three colleagues not been abducted by mrs mandelas football 
team he would have been alive today 
mrs mandela had no comment about her meeting with her husband or 
the controversy that has surrounded her since three youths told a 
community meeting in soweto that they had been abducted and taken to 
her home where they were beaten they said stompie was with them 
but had been beaten more severely and was taken away after a couple 
of days 
the three youths according to their attorney said mrs mandela 
was involved in the events 
she has denied being at home at the time but has defended the 
abduction saying the three men and the teenager were taken from a 
methodist church residence last month to protect them from sexual 
abuse 
the church has denied the charge

a man was convicted of removing nearly 150 trees 
on national parkland to improve his view of the potomac river as the 
jury rejected his claim that hired treecutters ignored his 
instructions 
the federal jury deliberated less than three hours wednesday 
before finding isaac fogel a montgomery county water bed 
manufacturer guilty of felony conversion of government property to 
his personal use and a misdemeanor charge of illegally removing 
trees 
the tree cutters hacked down scores of oaks locusts and maples 
as well as several rarer ironwood and persimmon trees along the campo 
canal and potomac adjacent to fogels property in february 1985 
us district judge joseph c howard set sentencing for april 17 
fogel 45 faces up to 11 years in prison and 350000 in fines he 
remained free on bond pending sentencing 
assistant us attorney david p king contended that fogel had 
the trees chopped to improve his view of the potomac and to increase 
the value of his 11 million home which he put up for sale but 
never sold 
gary m ralph who operates suburban tree service in college 
park testified that fogel said he wanted all these trees cut down 
to the canal and that he wanted a good view of the river 
but fogel countered that ralph had suggested removing trees on 
the slope that included the park land he said he insisted that he 
only wanted trees cut down to his property line

cambodian guerrilla leaders today 
accused the cambodian government of entering peace talks with the 
same rigid attitude they say has blocked settlement of the 
10yearold conflict 
senior officials of the phnom penh government and the three 
factions of the resistance coalition held a 45minute session apart 
from their larger meeting with other southeast asian countries 
the meeting is aimed at ending the war that began after 
sovietarmed vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 vietnamese 
forces since have battled the guerrillas backed by china and the 
association of southeast asian nations 
the resistance coalition issued a statement alleging the phnom 
penh government is engaged only in a public relations exercise and 
that during the private session it maintained the same rigid 
attitude which is not conducive to a comprehensive settlement of the 
kampuchean cambodian problem 
the plan proposed by the other side is tantamount to asking the 
resistance to capitulate to a regime installed by foreign 
forces the statement said 
it said a solution was possible only on the basis of a plan 
proposed by resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk phnom penh 
rejected that plan even before the talks began 
resistance spokesman thiounn prasith read the statement aloud at 
a news conference after a 10minute monologue in which he railed 
against vietnam and the illegal cambodian regime it was 
manipulating 
he denounced vietnam for not allowing international supervision 
of its troop withdrawal and claimed that about 20000 vietnamese 
soldiers recently have disguised themselves in cambodian uniforms 
vietnam in january said it will end its 10year military 
incursion in cambodia by the end of september 
phnom penhs representative hor nam hong appeared at the same 
news conference insisting his side fervently desires a settlement 
the organizer of the talks indonesian foreign minister ali 
alatas said that at the plenary session the officials discussed 
the vietnamese withdrawal an end to foreign military aid to the 
guerrillas and a mechanism for supervision and control of any 
agreement 
the session brought together vietnam its ally laos the phnom 
penh government the resistance and the members of asean thailand 
indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and brunei 
a first round of talks held in july achieved no breakthroughs 
but resulted in a consensus that vietnams withdrawal must be linked 
to measures preventing the return to power of the khmer rouge which 
killed hundreds of thousands of people in cambodia before vietnam 
toppled it 
the communist khmer rouge is allied in the guerrilla coalition 
with the forces of sihanouk and son sann 
sihanouk widely seen as the central figure in any future 
cambodian government is boycotting the talks because phnom penh 
rejected his peace plan 
the plan included calls for dissolution of the phnom penh 
government before a general election introduction of an 
international peacekeeping force to guarantee any settlement and 
specifics from vietnam on its pledge to withdraw its troops from 
cambodia

president bush and former president reagan 
have made highly unusual endorsements in a state house race in an 
effort to defeat a former ku klux klan leader who is running as a 
republican 
in radio spots that began running today reagan said i cant 
help but tell you of the high regard i have for one candidate in the 
race for your next representative john treen 
treen faces fellow republican david duke in saturdays runoff for 
a seat in the state house of representatives representing a 
district in the new orleans suburbs duke was imperial wizard of the 
knights of the ku klux klan until he left the group in 1980 
leslie goodman a spokeswoman for the republican national 
committee described the endorsements by bush and reagan as 
unprecedented for a state legislative race the national party is 
helping pay the costs and is also assigning three campaign 
professionals to help treen she said 
david duke will embrace any political party he can get to 
espouse his politics of hatred violence and bigotry goodman said 
wednesday if hes trying to say that being a racist and a bigot 
is the same as being a conservative republican i beg to differ with 
him his background has nothing to do with mainstream american 
values its a disgrace 
letters signed by bush saying that treen has a strong sense of 
compassion for others and an abiding faith in the future of 
america are being mailed to voters this week goodman said while 
neither bush nor reagan mention duke in their endorsements the 
national partys interest stems solely from dukes background she 
said 
treen also running as a republican finished a distant second to 
duke in the sevenway jan 21 primary under louisianas open 
primary system the top two votegetters in a primary regardless of 
party face each other in the runoff if no one candidate gets half 
the primary votes 
duke said he is amazed that bush and reagan are involved in the 
local election that involves only about 23000 registered voters 
the outside interference in this race is absolutely 
ridiculous duke said its like the establishment is closing 
the ranks to prevent an independent from coming through 
treen who was state campaign chairman for bushs 1980 
unsuccessful presidential bid said the endorsements show that at 
the highest levels of government there is a genuine concern about 
someone that harbors such a foreign ideology 
duke claims he no longer agrees with the klan philosophy he 
heads a group called the national association for the advancement of 
white people which he says is not racist but a group seeking human 
rights for everybody

the federal reserve board rejected a request by 
continental bank corp in chicago to purchase a small arizona bank 
because it said continenal had not fulfilled its duties under a law 
designed to prevent redlining 
the fed said it found important deficiencies in the banks 
performance under the community reinvestment act which requires 
banks to meet local credit needs including those of low and 
moderateincome neighborhoods 
continentals petition to acquire grand canyon state bank in 
scottsdale ariz was rejected on a 42 vote wednesday with govs 
h robert heller and john laware opposed gov edward w kelley jr 
did not vote 
the bank made no significant effort to ascertain the credit 
needs of its communities or to advertise its products to the 
community the 10page majority decision said finally given 
continentals size as well as the opportunities available in the 
chicago area the banks participation in community development 
and redevelopment efforts was unsatisfactory 
the decision also said the bank made substantially inaccurate 
statements for a number of years about its compliance with the 
community reinvestment act 
it noted that the bank has since developed a plan that should 
make substantial contribution to correcting the past 
deficiencies in its compliance with the law 
but it added the board does not believe that commitments by 
themselves can serve as a substitute for the established record of 
cra performance required by the statute 
the board also voiced concern about the banks plan to expand 
while still financed in part by and subject to the control of 
federal deposit insurance corp in the wake of a 1984 federal 
bailout

a 4yearold palestinian girl died today of head 
injuries suffered in a mysterious explosion and three palestinians 
were wounded by army gunfire during protests in the occupied gaza 
strip arab news reports said 
a military source confirmed the girls death the army said it 
was checking the other reported casualties since the palestinian 
uprising in the occupied lands began 14 months ago 380 palestinians 
and 15 israelis have been killed 
two aides to finance minister shimon peres the leader of the 
leftleaning labor party met wednesday night with plo supporter 
faisal husseini to lay the groundwork for future peace talks 
it was the second meeting this week between israeli legislators 
and husseini one of the most prominent palestinian figures in the 
occupied territories 
the meetings were criticized by prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc which accused labor of violating a coalition 
agreement that bars israel from holding talks with the palestine 
liberation organization 
likud legislator reuven rivlin said on israel radio the meetings 
were tantamount to holding talks with plo chief yasser arafat the 
talks were directly with someone who thinks he represents 
arafat rivlin said 
avraham burg a parliament member and aide to peres who attended 
wednesdays meeting said the talks were needed to break through 
psychological barriers between israelis and palestinians we 
cannot consider every palestinian to be a terrorist and not speak to 
him burg said on the radio 
they the talks are a basis so that one day israelis will come 
and say okay so the next stage is a political dialogue he said 
the death of 4yearold iktimal abdullah of tayasir village in 
the occupied west bank came three days after she was injured when a 
device she found near her home exploded arab reports said her 
10yearold brother naim also was wounded in the blast 
the army launched an investigation into the blast in tayasir and 
into two other palestinian deaths linked to explosions of 
unidentified devices on the west bank the air force also has been 
asked to look into the blasts 
palestinian activists have charged that israeli soldiers have 
thrown explosive devices out of jeeps to lure unsuspecting children 
but the army has denied the reports the armys deputy chief of 
staff maj gen ehud barak says the blasts generally have resulted 
from children playing with undetonated shells near firing ranges or 
with flares that fell from training jets 
the two earlier blasts killed a 15yearold near the village of 
kabatiya on monday and an 8yearold in the village of tamoun on 
feb 4 
the army said the kabatiya incidents occurred after the teenager 
wandered onto an army training ground 
an army spokeswoman said the military planned to take measures to 
prevent such accidents in the future but she did not elaborate 
in the gaza strip today teenagers staged several stonethrowing 
protests arab reports said the reports said three youths aged 12 
14 and 17 were shot in the legs by soldiers

two jetliners came within 15 seconds of 
colliding after one of the planes was rerouted because of an 
electrical blackout at john wayne airport a newspaper reported 
today 
the federal aviation administration was investigating the near 
collision monday night involving a british airways jumbo jet and an 
american airlines jetliner over westminster the orange county 
register reported 
airtraffic controllers in the los angeles terminal radar 
facility at the time of the incident said the planes flew within 1 
miles horizontally and 200 feet vertically of each other faa 
regulations mandate that planes be kept at least three miles apart 
horizontally and 1000 feet vertically 
controllers whose identities were withheld because of a pending 
investigation told the newspaper that a controller in los angeles 
spotted the potential collision just after 7 pm and quickly warned 
the british airways jet to turn 
controllers said the planes which were flying at about 300 mph 
would have collided in about 15 seconds 
there is an investigation for a possible controller 
operational error said barbara abels an faa spokeswoman in los 
angeles 
the planes were at an altitude of 9000 feet ms abels said but 
she said she did not know how close the aircraft came neither pilot 
filed a near collision report with the faa she said adding that

moslem fundamentalist leaders in iran said today 
that suicide squads were preparing to carry out the death 
sentence imposed on novelist salman rushdie and his publishers by 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the declaration on tehran radio followed other reports that death 
squads from islamic countries were en route to britain in search of 
the writer whose novel the satanic verses has outraged many 
moslem fundamentalists 
britain which reopened its embassy in tehran in december for the 
first time in eight years condemned the threats and announced it 
had frozen plans to build up further our embassy 
united news of india and the british broadcasting corp said 
telephone callers threatened to bomb british planes to india unless 
rushdie appeared in public two airlines british airways and air 
europe said they were taking the threat seriously 
the indian news agency said a man claiming to speak for the 
previously unheard of iranian guards telephoned its bombay office 
today with the threats 
pakistans government demanded the united states and britain ban 
the book and that all copies of it be destroyed six people died in 
pakistan during a weekend riot over the book 
an iranian cleric on wednesday offered up to 26 million for 
rushdies murder and the author canceled a us promotional tour 
that was scheduled to begin friday 
a leading islamic theologian in egypt said today khomeini erred 
in sending death squads after rushdie without first giving him a 
chance to repent sheik mohammed hossameldin said the book should 
be banned and burned but executing its author would be virtually 
impossible under the tenets of islam 
british news media said the indianborn rushdie was hiding with 
his wife american novelist marianne wiggins under police guard 
press association the domestic british news agency said rushdies 
first wife clarissa luard also had been given police protection 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus said religious figures in the 
northwestern iranian city of urumiyeh declared in a statement 
we have already put on our death shrouds and pledge to carry 
out the imams khomeinis death sentence against salman rushdie 
and his publishers in the united states and europe 
irans lone diplomat in britain mohammed basti was summoned to 
the foreign office in london to discuss the situation and emerged 
defiant telling reporters khomeinis decree or verdict had been 
delivered after careful consideration 
it has nothing to do particularly with your country the 
charge daffaires said 
the foreign office called khomeinis statement totally 
unacceptable 
we recognize that moslems and others may have strong views 
about the contents of mr rushdies book it said in a statement 
however no one has the right to incite people to violence on 
british soil or against british citizens 
rushdie 41 was born into a moslem family in india but is a 
british citizen since the satanic verses was published in 
britain in september it has sold more than 100000 copies here and 
received critical acclaim 
pakistans foreign ministry said today protests were being filed 
in washington and london seeking a ban on the novel 
pakistani fundamentalist leaders called for nationwide protests 
friday to condemn the book and denounce the deaths and injuries in 
sundays protests by moslem fundamentalists demanding the satanic 
verses be pulled from us shelves 
the book has been banned in countries with large moslem 
populations including india and south africa as well as most 
islamic nations including pakistan bangladesh and egypt 
no official ban has been announced in iran where the population 
is overwhelmingly shiite moslem but most foreign publications have 
been banned in that country for years 
in new york a statement issued on behalf of author and publisher 
said the current climate is not appropriate for a promotional tour 
in the united states the statement said we reiterate that no 
offense was intended in the creation or publication of this work 
the french publishing house christian bourgois said it was 
delaying publication of the novel to avoid risk to the company its 
clients and readers 
one of italys leading publishing companies arnoldo mondadori 
editore spa announced today it will go ahead with next weeks 
planned release of the satanic verses 
irans official islamic republic news agency reported wednesday 
that a senior moslem clergyman in iran hojatoleslam hassan saneie 
had offered 26 million to any iranian who kills rushdie and 1 
million to a foreigner who kills the author 
tehran radio said today that mohammad hashemian the religious 
leader in the southeastern city of kerman pledged another 26 
million reward 
a major character in the novel is named mahound a medieval 
corruption of the name of the prophet mohammed moslems have 
complained the book represents the prophets wives as prostitutes 
and suggests that he wrote the koran rather than receiving it from 
god 
the title refers to verses mohammed removed from the koran 
islams holy book believing they had been inspired by the devil

living in lowlying areas and for motorists the weather service 
said 
in neighboring tennessee the weather service canceled a flash 
flood watch after only light rainfall was reported overnight and in 
west virginia minor flooding was reported and several rivers were 
expected to crest at or near flood stage

one of two sea lions snared by wildlife agents in 
an attempt to protect a wild fish run died overnight before wildlife 
agents could return it to the ocean an official said today 
we lost one of the animals said hal alabaster a spokesman 
for the national marine fisheries service he did not have immediate 
details on why the sea lion died 
wildlife agents agents trapped the sea lions in a floating cage 
wednesday and had planned to release the mammals today on the 
southewest washington coast they were to have been transported by 
truck 
for five years sea lions have been hanging out at the ballard 
locks a few miles north of downtown seattle wolfing down the 
steelhead and salmon that use a fish ladder to get from puget sound 
to lake washington and the spawning streams beyond 
the sea lions death will not halt the effort to remove the 
marine mammals alabaster said adding that trapping would continue 
today 
so far protective nets tape recordings of killer whales 
firecrackers and foultasting chemicals have failed to stop the 
steelhead and salmon suppers enjoyed by the voracious california sea 
lions 
some local fishing advocates have suggested the 20 or so beasts 
be shot but they are protected by federal law 
according to federal agents one of the two sea lions captured 
wednesday known as blue eye because of a cataract has been a 
problem at the locks for three years it was not immediately clear 
which sea lion had died 
the plan was to tranquilize the sea lions attach radio 
transmitters to them and transport them by truck on a trip of five 
hours or more to the coast for release today off the long beach 
peninsula 250 miles southwest of seattle 
bob delong a marine mammal biologist with the national marine 
fisheries service admitted that scientists have no idea whether 
operation goodbye will work he conceded that blue eye certainly 
knows the way back 
hes come back at least three years in a row from california 
and mexico and if he wants to come back hell return delong 
said adding that he could probably make the trip in two days if he 
hurried 
wildlife officials said they eventually hope to capture at least 
a half dozen animals and haul them to the peninsula then see if 
they return 
if they dont the rest of the problem animals that can be caught 
will be moved delong said 
wednesdays operation was observed by ben deeble of greenpeace 
which has protested some of the antisea lion actions in the past 
but gave qualified support to the removal effort 
deeble said a primary concern was the drugging of the sea lions 
which he said could kill the animals 
deeble said longterm solutions to the problem of the hungry sea 
lions would include modifying the approach the fish have to make to 
the fish ladder and increasing the number of fish in the watershed 
however that could be difficult at the rate the steelhead are being 
killed by the sea lions 
steelhead are rainbow trout which return to their native rivers 
and streams in western washington after a few years in the pacific 
ocean 
the male sea lions which summer in california and mexico waters 
and winter off the coasts of oregon washington and british 
columbia have increased dramatically in numbers since the passage 
of the marine mammal protection act in the mid1970s

a businessman was sentenced to 27 years in 
federal prison today for masterminding the smuggling of a record 
7300 pounds of colombian cocaine into the united states in 
hollowedout lumber last spring 
us district judge george c carr rejected tearful pleas by 
michael tsalickis 61 to impose a lighter sentence the judge said 
he thought evidence in the trial had been clear 
tsalickis jailed since his arrest last may faced from 10 years 
to life for his conviction in october on two counts of smuggling and 
two counts of drug trafficking during a monthlong trial the 
government claimed he was working with a ruthless colombian drug 
organization known as the cali cartel 
prosecutors had urged the maximum sentence telling carr that 
their calculations showed the cocaine haul translated into 57 
million doses but the judges sentence was within federal 
sentencing guidelines which called for a prison term of 24 to 30 
years 
this is the largest seizure in the history of the us in which 
there has been an arrest assistant us attorney walter furr told 
carr your sentence must punish deter others and promote respect 
for the law 
tsalickis who lived in colombia for 35 years and ran an 
importexport business read from a statement breaking down and 
crying as he did so 
if i did harm society in the eyes of the court then i am truly 
sorry he said his attorney frank wilkles said an appeal would 
be filed 
during tsalickis trial in tampa federal court us prosecutors 
told jurors that tsalickis orchestrated the smuggling operation in 
which cocaine was hidden inside bundles of cedar lumber shipped from 
brazil 
tsalickis and two colombian associates freddy perezrivera 28 
and pedro narvaez 35 were arrested may 3 the two colombians were 
convicted of conspiracy to smuggle the cocaine in a separate trial 
federal and local drug agents acting on a tip had watched the 
trio as they organized the unloading of the lumber in st 
petersburg separated the lumber containing the cocaine from the 
rest of the wood and had it transported by truck to a tarpon 
springs warehouse owned by tsalickis

the security council today authorized an 
independence plan and un peacekeeping force for namibia setting 
in motion the end of 74 years of south african rule over the 
continents last colony 
the 15 council members unanimously adopted a resolution 
implementing an independence plan for namibia 
april 1 was set as the date to begin the oneyear plan for 
namibias transition to an independent black majorityruled nation 
todays resolution also approved a report by secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar on implementing the plan which calls for 
sending 4650 un peacekeepers 500 police and 1000 civilian 
election monitors to namibia 
the uns namibian independence mission will be called the un 
transition assistance group perez de cuellar has estimated the 
project will cost 416 million in its first year 
the general assembly is expected to authorize funds for a 70man 
team of un military observers who will monitor the withdrawal of 
50000 cuban troops from angola as neighboring namibia becomes 
independent 
the stage was set for the cuban pullout and the namibian 
independence process in december when south africa cuba and angola 
signed accords at un headquarters pledging their cooperation with 
a southwest african pace plan 
cuba has stationed troops in angola at that countrys request 
since 1975 to defend angolas marxist government from attacks by 
south african troops and the usbacked rebels of unita the 
national union for the total liberation of angola south africa has 
ruled namibia also known as southwest africa since it captured 
the territory from germany during world war i 
the uns predecessor the league of nations gave south africa 
a mandate to govern namibia in 1920 but since world war ii the 
world court general assembly and security council all have ruled 
that pretorias mandate is void 
south africa refused to relinquish control of namibia without the 
withdrawal of the cuban troops saying their presence just over 
namibias northern border could intimidate voters during the 
independence 
under the southwest africa peace accords half of the 50000 
cuban soldiers will have withdrawn by nov 1 when namibia is 
scheduled to begin a week of elections for a constituent assembly 
that constituent assembly will draft a constitution and organize a 
black majorityruled government in namibia with independence 
envisaged in april 1990 
all cuban troops are to be out of angola by july 1991 
beginning april 1 the south african military is to reduce its 
forces in namibia to 1500 troops confined to barracks under un 
supervision and cut back the size of namibias police force 
un peacekeepers will also monitor camps in which the guerrillas 
of the southwest africa peoples organization swapo will stay 
swapo a marxistinfluenced independence movement led by sam 
nujoma is expected to win a majority of the seats in namibias 
constituent assembly but if it fails to hold twothirds of the 
seats it will have to form a coalition with some of the other 
parties in namibia 
a coalition would probably result in a multiparty state 
observers say but if swapo wins twothirds of the seats in the 
contituent assembly it will probably declare a oneparty state

emperor hirohitos state funeral may be the biggest 
in modern times a foreign ministry official said thursday 
japan expects representatives of 154 countries to attend the feb 
24 rites led by president bush and including 54 other heads of 
state and many more royals vice presidents prime ministers and 
foreign ministers according to a senior official who spoke on 
condition he not be identified 
the funeral is budgeted at 74 million including 254 million 
to be spent on the funeral site where there will be a sanctuary and 
two huge tents to shelter 10000 dignitaries 19 million for 
security and 21 million to build a mausoleum 
the japanese press called it the most expensive state funeral in 
history 
soon after hirohito died of cancer at the age of 87 on jan 7 
the government notified all 165 countries with which japan has 
relations that they were welcome to send delegations to the funeral 
bush quickly accepted but some countries debated vigorously 
whether to send highlevel representatives because of hirohitos 
role as leader in world war ii 
the netherlands for instance is sending its foreign minister 
but not a member of the royal family because of bitter memories of 
japans harsh treatment of the dutch east indies 
the overall high level of the delegates is gratifying to japan 
the foreign ministry official said the number of guests and their 
high rank is beyond our expectations he said 
the number of official foreign mourners is expected to be at 
least 600 he said acknowledging difficult problems with protocol 
and logistics 
some ambassadors complained they will have to group up and arrive 
at the funeral in buses he said prime minister noboru takeshitas 
cabinet still was wrestling with the protocol issue of how to seat 
the guests 
by tradition those with longer tenure should have more prominent 
seats that would leave bush in office less than a month in the 
back of the crowd 
we are studying all the precedents of past funerals and i hope 
our government will come to a fast conclusion he said 
asked how bush would be treated he laughed nervously and said 
the matter is not so simple he did not comment further 
the 154 countries to be represented include 145 that are actually 
sending delegates from abroad he said nine are to be represented 
by ambassadors accredited to tokyo 
other recent state funerals 
the 1963 funeral of president john f kennedy drew 
representatives from more than 100 countries 
the 1980 funeral for yugoslav president josip tito drew 127 
foreign delegations 
the 1981 funeral of egyptian president anwar sadat drew 
representatives from more than 80 countries the united states sent 
former presidents jimmy carter gerald r ford and richard m nixon 
the 1984 funeral of soviet leader yuri andropov drew more than 
100 foreign delegations

dozens of chinas most famous writers and thinkers 
called for an amnesty for political prisoners in an open letter sent 
thursday to the government and ruling communist party 
an amnesty would be beneficial to the atmosphere of reform 
and in accordance with the increasing respect for human rights which 
is a pervasive trend in the world today said the letter copies 
of which were given to journalists by several of the signers 
it was addressed to the standing committee of the national 
peoples congress chinas legislature and the party central 
committee 
the 33 signers ranged from bing xin 87 one of chinas most 
famous precommunist woman writers to 26yearold author lao mu 
who helped draft and distribute the letter 
i think it is the first time since 1949 that intellectuals of 
all generations writers from the 1930s and current writers all 
have joined in such an action said bei dao a 40yearold poet 
and short story writer who got the idea to draft the letter 
i think intellectuals are waking up he said i dont have 
any special interest in politics like most writers im interested 
in my work but i have a conscience 
there are no reliable figures for the number of political 
prisoners in china the londonbased human rights group amnesty 
international estimates there are thousands of prisoners of 
conscience including political dissidents clergy and members of 
minority groups such as tibetans opposed to chinese rule 
china acknowledges jailing counterrevolutionaries but has 
never given a number 
chinas most famous dissident astrophysicist fang lizhi made a 
similar call for an amnesty in a letter to chinese leader deng 
xiaoping last month the new letter expressed deep concern for 
fangs proposal 
like fang the petitioners singled out wei jingsheng one of the 
leaders of a brief political thaw called the democracy wall 
movement wei was arrested in 1979 and sentenced to 15 years in 
prison after calling for democracy as a fifth modernization to 
go along with dengs program of updating industry agriculture 
science and national defense 
we hear wei has gone mad in prison said bei we have no 
proof theres no way to contact him 
several dozen other democracy wall activists also were arrested 
and many remain jailed 
of course we hope the government will respond and give amnesty 
to wei and the others bei said but realistically i dont 
know for such a large group of prominent intellectuals to express 
their view i think it must have influence eventually 
su shaozhi a leading marxist theorist who was dismissed in 1987 
as director of chinas marxismleninism institute because of his 
liberalism said the government probably wont pay attention 
but su said he didnt think anyone would be punished because of 
the letter the signers are very famous they will have to think 
how to treat us he said 
the letter comes during a period of unusual outspokenness by 
chinese intellectuals who know well the governments pattern of 
allowing brief periods of free discussion and then cracking down 
small groups of liberal intellectuals have begun meeting to 
discuss such dangerous topics as democracy and multiparty rule 
ren wanding another democracy wall activist who was jailed from 
197983 has declared 1989 a memorial year for his jailed colleagues

housing construction posted its biggest gain in 
nearly a year during january the government reported thursday but 
analysts said the surge was due more to unusually mild weather than 
an upturn in the market 
construction of new homes and apartments was up 8 percent in 
january to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 169 million units 
after inching up just 01 percent during december the commerce 
department reported 
it was the biggest monthly increase since an 86 percent rise in 
february 1988 and placed housing activity at its highest level since 
the march 1987 annual rate of 172 million units 
at the white house presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
called the figures good news for the housing industry and a good 
sign that people are confident in the economy 
analysts said the increase was mainly the result of unseasonably 
warm dry weather throughout much of the country which allowed more 
housing starts than in a typical january small increases can be 
amplified as the figures are annualized and seasonally adjusted 
we dont believe this is representative of the underlying trend 
in the market david seiders chief economist for the national 
association of home builders said of januarys surge we dont 
expect it to hold this way were betting on a slowdown as we go 
through the year 
housing construction dropped 82 percent in 1988 to its lowest 
level in six years and is expected to decline again this year as 
mortgage rates continue to rise and the general economic expansion 
slows 
nevertheless analysts say the housing market still is relatively 
healthy and that januarys numbers may suggest some new strength 
its really pretty surprising to see this much strength in the 
housing market when interest rates have been rising and when the 
affordability of housing is getting harder for people to meet 
said economist martin regalia of the national council of savings 
institutions 
underneath it all were seeing a surprisingly strong housing 
market given the financial conditions he said 
singlefamily homes were built in january at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 12 million units the highest since 
september 1987 when the rate was 123 million januarys figure was 
up 71 percent from december 
seiders said part of the strength in the singlefamily market was 
due to the use of adjustablerate mortgages that allow families to 
start out making lower monthly payments than otherwise possible 
interest rates on fixedrate mortgages averaged 1056 percent 
last week up from 984 percent a year earlier according to a 
survey by the federal home loan mortgage corp on oneyear 
adjustable rate mortgages lenders were asking an average initial 
rate of 861 percent up from 761 percent a year earlier 
apartment construction a volatile category was up 101 percent 
last month to 490000 units after a 37 percent gain in december 
the apartment sector has been weakened by high vacancy rates and 
changes under the 1986 tax law that reduced incentives for investing 
in rental projects 
overall januarys gains in new construction were concentrated in 
the northeast where housing starts shot up 518 percent to an 
annual rate of 296000 units 
analysts again said mild weather was behind the upturn in a 
region where the housing market has been weak in recent months after 
an earlier boom during which prices soared 
the northeast overall is still a market that is not as strong 
as it was a couple years ago regalia said its going through a 
normal cycle and its going to be ebbing somewhat in the coming 
months but i dont see that as crashing 
construction rose 44 percent in the west in january to a rate 
of 449000 units and 3 percent in the south to 616000 units 
housing starts were down 38 percent in the midwest to a rate of 
332000 units 
housing permits a good barometer of future housing activity 
were down 27 percent last month to a rate of 152 million units 
after rising 33 percent in december 
housing construction reached its postrecession peak in 1986 
when 181 million units were built then began sliding last year 
the level was 149 million units

defense secretarydesignate john towers 
personal indiscretions proved troublesome for the state department 
during arms talks in geneva the nations arms control chief said 
kenneth l adelman said wednesday in a washington times column 
and in a los angeles times interview published today that towers 
actions which he declined to specify raised questions about his 
judgment and integrity 
the fbi file on tower contains allegations that tower slept with 
women on the arms control delegation staff and that his behavior was 
disruptive to delegation business said the los angeles times 
citing unidentified informed sources 
adelman director of the state departments arms control and 
disarmament agency from 1983 to 1987 is the highest ranking former 
or current us official to raise doubts about towers fitness 
from january 1985 to april 1986 tower headed the departments 
delegation that discussed mutual cuts in longrange nuclear missiles 
with the soviets 
towers private behavior didnt directly affect his conduct of 
official business at the geneva talks but adelman said it should be 
a factor in the senate confirmation deliberations because a 
defense secretary has no private life 
in the military chain of command just below the president he 
must be of sound and clear mind by day and by night he said 
adelman said in his column in the washington times that he was 
impressed with towers performance as a strategic arms negotiator 
yet his lack of discretion proved troublesome then as before and 
since

britains transportation secretary today urged 
aviation officials to consider banning electronic devices from 
airplane luggage or at least requiring such items be carried onto 
jets rather than checked as luggage 
paul channon made his comments after investigators in lockerbie 
scotland said the bomb that blew up pan am flight 103 was hidden in 
a radiocassette player and loaded on with luggage probably in 
frankfurt 
this is further evidence of the extent of this serious 
problem channon told the 33member council of the international 
civil aviation administration 
channon said items such as radios and computers cannot be 
easily opened they provide enough space to conceal explosives and 
the electrical components of explosive devices may not be 
distinguished under xray from those of the equipment itself we 
need to ask ourselves whether these devices should be allowed to be 
carried on aircraft 
channon said one option would be to ban electronic devices from 
checked baggage 
should we at least no longer allow them in checked baggage and 
require them to be presented at the checkin perhaps for conveyance 
in the least vulnerable part of the aircraft he suggested 
the council has been considering whether steps should be taken to 
limit the carrying of radios computers and other electronical 
equipment it also is considering whether to direct its staff to 
study ways in which aircraft design could take security 
considerations into account 
i think that some fairly simple and inexpensive modifications 
could make it harder for terrorists to hide a bomb on board and 
easier for security staff to search cabins toilets and galleys 
channon said citing better locking systems on aircraft doors as an 
example 
us and british transportation officials have called for swift 
efforts to combat terrorism in the skies through tougher screening 
of passengers and luggage and better bombdetection devices 
people around the world are calling for leadership and decisive 
action to eliminate the gruesome common threat of terrorism in the 
skies us transportation secretary samuel k skinner told the 
aviation meeting on its opening day wednesday 
britain and the united states had asked that the council convene 
the twoday meeting because of the dec 21 bombing of flight 103 
which killed all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground in 
scotland 
chief superintendent john orr who is heading the investigation 
into the bombing today refused to describe the size of the recorder 
and said it was not certain the bomb was put aboard in frankfurt 
where the flight originated 
but answering reporters questions he said the balance of 
probabilities pointed to frankfurt rather than london where the 
new yorkbound flight changed jets and took on new passengers 
although the 160member un agency meeting in canada has no 
power to enforce its resolutions the presence of more than a dozen 
transport ministers has underscored their concern about the problem 
skinner reminded the council that 867 people have died in 21 
explosions aboard civilian airliners in the last decade 
members have discussed a twotier system in which more stringent 
security systems could be placed in areas of highest risk 
the us aviation system has instituted more stringent security 
measures in recent weeks but american officials say concerted 
international action is needed

text of a statement thursday 
from black antiapartheid leaders on winnie mandela wife of african 
national congress leader nelson mandela 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
todays press conference is called after the culminating of 
community meetings in soweto and throughout the country the present 
controversy surrounding mrs mandelas football club has been 
the subject of intense discussion within the ranks of the mass 
democratic movement numerous attempts have been made to resolve 
this matter but without much success 
we have now reached the state where we have no option but to 
speak publicly on what is a very sensitive and painful matter 
the mandela family has always occupied a very special position in 
the hearts of our people mrs mandela has been painfully separated 
from her husband for most of her married life first while nelson 
mandela worked in the underground of the anc and thereafter his 
imprisonment following the rivonia trial 
during this period she has had to rear her children 
singlehandedly in the face of lengthy house arrests detentions and 
her cruel banishment to brandfort we pay tribute to her 
contribution 
in recent years mrs mandelas actions have increasingly led her 
into conflict with various sections of the oppressed people and with 
the mass democratic movement as a whole the recent conflict in the 
community has centered largely around the conduct of her socalled 
football club which has been widely condemned by the community in 
particular we are outraged by the reign of terror that the team has 
been associated with not only is mrs mandela associated with the 
team in fact the team is her own creation 
we are of the view that mrs mandela has abused the trust and 
confidence which she has enjoyed over the years she has not been a 
member of any of the democratic structures of the udf united 
democratic front and cosatu congress of south african trade 
unions and she has often acted without consulting the democratic 
movement often her practices have violated the spirit and ethos of 
the democratic movement 
numerous efforts have been made to reconcile the conflict between 
mrs mandela and the community the last of these efforts was the 
formation of a crisis committee comprising of some of our most able 
and respected members on every occasion mrs mandela has refused to 
cooperate and has chosen to disregard the sentiments of the 
community 
the democratic movement has uncompromisingly fought against 
violations of human rights from whatever quarters we are not 
prepared to remain silent where those who are violating human rights 
claim to be doing so in the name of the struggle against apartheid 
we are outraged at mrs mandelas complicity in the recent 
abductions and assault of stompie seipei had stompie and his 
three colleagues not been abducted by mrs mandelas football 
team he would have been alive today 
the mass democratic movement hereby distances itself from mrs 
mandela and her actions 
we call on our people in particular the soweto community to 
exercise this distancing in a dignified manner 
we take the opportunity to reaffirm our unqualified support for 
our leader nelson mandela and call for his immediate release 
the actions associated with this football team and even with 
members of his family should never be used to undermine the esteem 
in which we still hold comrade nelson

an explosion of unknown origin that killed at least 13 people 
officials said 
the blast wednesday also left 21 people hospitalized six of them 
seriously hurt 
more than 300 rescue workers worked by hand to search the debris 
of the 18th century building known as the house of heads

worked throughout the night 
the explosion also damaged nearby buildings in the center of this 
mediterranean port city including a section of the city hall 
mayor francois trucy said the explosion appeared to have occurred

a gas leak prior to the explosion a dentist in the building dr 
daniel cohen said he had smelled a burning odor like a big short 
circuit just before the disaster

leftist guerrillas attacked an 
armyguarded cotton cooperative and two civil defense posts in the 
central region today killing at least nine soldiers the military 
said 
the attack came while the rebels and political parties negotiated 
where and when to discuss a rebel proposal to delay this years 
presidential elections 
the rebels attacked the entre rios cooperative with mortar and 
rifle fire before dawn according to a preliminary report from the 
armed forces in the capital it said six soldiers were killed and 
seven wounded in the attack 20 miles southeast of san salvador 
the report made no mention of guerrilla casualties broadcast 
reports from radio correspondents said eight soldiers were killed 
the rebels attacked the cooperative as part of their strategy of 
economic sabotage in waging their nineyear war against the 
usbacked government 
they also attacked civil defense posts in jerusalen and ostuma in 
the province of la paz early today the military report said it 
reported three soldiers were killed and three wounded in those 
attacks 
the fighting flared despite an announcement wednesday by 13 
political parties who said they were willing to meet with a rebel 
delegation next week in mexico guatemala or costa rica they 
suggested the meeting take place monday 
rebels proposed last month that the presidential election 
scheduled for march 19 be postponed until september giving the 
opposition more time to prepare in a dramatic change of policy the 
guerrillas said they would participate in the election and respect 
the outcome if voting was put off and if their conditions regarding 
security and fraud were met 
however the government and military have virtually ruled out any 
postponement the rightist republican nationalist alliance or 
arena is favored to win the march election and it too is against 
postponement

the international committee of the red cross has 
suspended temporarily an airlift of relief supplies to southern 
sudan while pursuing negotiations with antigovernment rebels a 
spokesman said thursday 
relief flights were stopped tuesday after the sudan peoples 
liberation army demanded changes in the red cross notification 
procedure for its flights to the cities of wau aweil akon and 
yirol said red cross spokesman juerg bischoff 
to ensure safe passage the red cross notifies both the khartoum 
government and the rebels of all relief flights bischoff said he 
expects the airlift begun dec 4 to resume in a matter of days 
he said the negotiations concern technical issues 
about 40 delegates of the allswiss humanitarian agency have 
remained in the area to distribute food and medicine to the needy 
bischoff said 
tens of thousands of people are known to need emergency aid in 
southern sudan the rebels who gained control of the region have 
allowed un and red cross relief planes to land in the areas 
cities where peasant farmers have fled to escape the guerrilla war 
hundreds of thousands of sudanese are believed to face the risk 
of starvation unless food is delivered throughout the country 
before the rains start in may to about 4 million people displaced 
by rebellion drought and famine 
the government of sudan which has battled the rebels since 1983 
has invited un relief officials to khartoum on march 89 to plan a 
massive antifamine campaign 
the united states and other western nations are pressuring the 
prime minister sadek mahdi to improve the distribution of food and 
other aid to all sections of his country 
his government has often cited the rebellion in the south as 
posing too great a danger for relief flights and convoys the 
government has allowed little aid to reach the south where an 
estimated 500000 people died of starvation last year

a 12milliongallon tank of molasses burst 
at a sugar factory spilling a cascade of sticky liquid that coated 
three workers and flattened a small building as if someone had 
stepped on a pop can 
one of the workers was swept 100 feet out of the building 
wednesday and waded through the syrupy flood to help his coworkers 
from the rubble scotts bluff county sheriffs deputies said no one 
was seriously hurt 
at this point were just going to try to contain it theres 
nothing hazardous about the material its just sticky said john 
sagaser manager of the western sugar co plant where the accident 
occurred about 20 miles east of the wyoming border 
the factorys onestory modular officelaboratory was demolished 
when it was buried by a wave of molasses sheriffs deputy bob 
delara said it looked as if someone had stepped on a pop can just 
squashed it down 
city crews built a dike to keep the molasses from entering a 
storm sewer the wave apparently crested at 10 feet leaving marks 
that high on walls and piles of dirt nearby 
we saw this stuff all gushing out and saw the cars by the 
road said witness julie wooden of scottsbluff we saw people 
digging themselves out it looked like a flood 
the three workers caught in the goop russell dilley 69 vernon 
dyer 45 of gering and gloria thompson 45 were treated at 
regional west medical center in scotts bluff for cuts and scrapes 
sheriffs deputy jack medearis said the workers told him they 
heard a rumble and knew the building they were in was starting to 
collapse 
medearis said dyer who was washed out of the building told him 
he kept trying to scramble to his knees as he tried to get back to 
the others 
he said he was submerged but then was able to see daylight 
medearis said 
the molasses damaged four vehicles near the building two of them 
apparently rolled over by the wave 
i just heard a big old boom then i saw a wall of molasses that 
carried those cars about 25 or 30 yards it just picked them up and 
slid them said witness paul hansen 
medearis said the molasses was valued at 520000 today sagaser 
estimated the total damage at 1 million the cause of the collapse 
was being investigated 
sagaser said the molasses is a byproduct of its sugar refining 
operations and is sold as a supplement for cattle feed 
we just finished filling the tank a day or two ago he said 
the collapse of the tank should not hurt operations at any 
western sugar plants he added 
a molasses tank that burst jan 15 1919 in boston killed 21 
people and injured another 150 the steel tank containing 23 
million gallons of the sticky goo broke open unleashing 30foot

after complaints from boatmen and an order from 
congress the government on thursday relaxed its policy of 
immediately seizing fishing boats on which a small amount of illegal 
drugs is found 
the interim modification would apply only to commercial fishing 
vessels but more changes in the yearold zero tolerance program 
to combat drug smuggling may be made before formal guidelines are 
issued said ed callahan a senior special agent with the customs 
service 
he said officials were discussing whether to extend less strict 
procedures to other vessels such as recreational craft and yachts 
and other private boats 
under policies that went into effect last march federal agents 
were free to seize vessels within 12 miles of the us coastline if 
any amount of illegal drugs was found on board showing zero 
tolerance 
under the newly revized rules customs service or coast guard 
personnel would merely issue a summons to a commercial fishing 
vessel if a personaluse amount of drugs was found while the ship 
was engaged in fishing or en route to or from a fishing trip 
personaluse amounts generally are defined as no more than one 
gram of heroin or cocaine or one ounce of marijuana 
when large amounts are found vessels could still be immediately 
forfeited to the government callahan said 
some fishing vessels could be allowed to complete their fishing 
expeditions even if they lasted several days and then surrender to 
customs authorities who would determine whether the vessels should 
be seized or a fine imposed 
the interim guidelines which went into effect thursday prior to 
adoption of formal regulations expected in several weeks also 
require customs to act within 20 days on petitions to return 
vessels officials acknowledge that it has sometimes taken up to 
several weeks for return of vessels where seizure was determine to 
be unwarranted 
the new guidelines followed meetings of customs commissioner 
william von raab with fisheries representatives von raab signed an 
agreement with the north carolina and the east coast fisheries 
associations in december calling for officials and the industry to 
work together to see that vessels belonging to association members 
are not used to transport illegal drugs into the united states 
late last year congress narrowly approved antidrug law 
modifications that instructed the executive branch to issue new 
regulations that would not be so harsh in instances where a ships 
captain or owner may have no knowledge of a crewmembers possession 
of a small quantity of an illegal substance

the absence of four words in a legal 
settlement could cost hughes aircraft co up to 270 million in its 
18year patent infringement lawsuit against the federal government 
a newspaper reported today 
us claims judge william turner ruled that the omission of the 
words except the united states in a 1987 outofcourt settlement 
between hughes and ford motor co freed the government from 
liability regarding 13 government satellites built by a ford 
subsidiary the los angeles times reported 
turners ruling issued last september was published recently in 
the patent law journal us patent quarterly 
hughes had sued both the government and ford aerospace a unit of 
ford motor co for patent infringement of a device used to control 
orbiting satellites 
however hughes and ford settled out of court for 75 million in 
september 1987 and the settlement absolved ford customers from 
liability because the united states was a ford customer and the 
phrase except the united states was omitted from the settlement 
it cannot be held liable for the 13 satellites ford aerospace built 
for it turner ruled 
hughes an aerospace firm and subsidiary of general motors corp 
claims the government used the orbiting control device on 108 
satellites without paying required royalties it is seeking 316 
billion in damages according to court documents 
government attorneys say hughes has overblown its claims and that 
it doesnt possess a valid patent 
hughes is seeking a 15 percent royalty of the cost of the 
government satellites in addition to other compensation the 
royalties and delay compensation on those 13 satellites represent 
270 million worth of claims against the government according to a 
secret court filing hughes made oct 7 the newspaper reported 
but under the justice departments method of valuing the 
satellites the 13 spacecraft might be worth only 50 million 
hughes officials refused to comment today because the matter 
concerned litigation said mike murphy a spokesman at the companys 
corporate headquarters john walker managing partner at latham amp 
watkins the law firm representing hughes in the case said his firm 
made no such error

police questioned ellen in a hospital 
emergency room and within minutes local radio stations were 
broadcasting a description of the gunman she said threatened to kill 
her if she didnt open a safe 
a black man about 5foot10 with a goatee had demanded money 
from ellen a nursing home receptionist who didnt want her last 
name used for fear her assailant might be able to identify her 
he wore a tan jacket a blue polo shirt and red puma tennis 
shoes he also had a tooth with a gold crown listeners of topekas 
five radio stations were told ellen said the man hit her on the 
back of the head before fleeing without taking any cash 
interrupting programming to broadcast suspects descriptions and 
other information on armed robberies is part of a program called 
radio cop begun by the police department feb 1 listeners are asked 
to call police if they see a suspect or can provide other tips 
most crime prevention programs are reactive this is 
proactive said sgt richard johnson who developed radio cop 
which stands for call our police 
as of thursday descriptions of five armed robberies had been 
broadcast at an average of eight minutes after the crime was 
reported no suspects have been arrested as a result of the 
broadcasts johnson said but police were pursuing one tip 
police suspect that a man charged in a convenience store holdup 
two days after the nursing home incident is ellens assailant the 
district attorneys office said thursday charges were pending 
because the man was arrested at the store his description was not 
aired again 
johnson said the broadcasts will make listeners more aware of 
suspicious activity and may deter criminals from committing 
robberies because theyll know 50000 radio listeners will hear 
about it 
creating an awareness is the most important part of it 
johnson said 
in january before radio cop began topeka had 28 armed 
robberies more than double the number during the same period of 
1987 police will monitor robbery rates for the next few months to 
evaluate the programs success 
radio cop is receiving praise from many sectors of the community 
including radio executives 
i think it will be an asset not only to the police department 
but to our station as well said cynthia bervert news director 
for ktpk a country music station it will help keep us on top of 
whats going on in topeka 
one radio station balked at participating in the program fearful 
that it could be held liable if it disseminated incorrect 
information but disclaimers that tell listeners to call police if 
they see a suspect and to not get involved personally were 
strengthened and the station joined the program by the time it 
began 
johnson said he has received inquiries about radio cop from as 
far away as south carolina and new york 
we always tell people to report things but we never tell them 
what to report johnson said this program does that

the number of foreign visitors to the united 
states rose 14 percent last year with much of the increased traffic 
coming from europe and japan the government reported thursday 
the us travel and tourism administration estimated that visits 
to the united states for business and pleasure reached a record 337 
million in 1988 
tourism is expected to continue to grow in the next two years 
but at a slower rate the agency projects 358 million foreign 
visitors in 1989 up 6 percent from last year and 372 million in 
1990 up 4 percent from this year 
the biggest share of foreign visits to the united states comes 
from canada some 137 million canadians visited last year up 10 
percent from 1987 
visits by europeans increased 24 percent last year to 58 
million with the increase paced by a 34 percent jump in visits from 
britian visits from japan also were up 24 percent to 26 million 
the tourism administration said factors contributing to the 
increases last year included more aggressive marketing of us 
destinations the cheaper us dollar in relation to foreign 
currencies and healthy economic conditions abroad 
the biggest growth markets for 1989 again are expected to be 
britain and japan the japanese government is encouraging citizens 
to travel abroad as a means of reducing the countrys world trade 
surplus 
the tourism administration expects visits from japan to increase 
22 percent in 1989 to 32 million and visits from britian to 
increase 13 percent to 21 million 
spending by foreign visitors to the united states was up 26 
percent to 244 billion in 1988 but still was exceeded by the 
amount spent by americans traveling abroad leaving an 81 billion 
deficit that deficit was down 18 percent from the previous year 
us receipts from foreign visitors are expected to rise 11 
percent this year to 271 billion 
although we are still in a deficit situation travel and 
tourism is our largest service sector export and the deficit is 
growing smaller evey year said don wynegar director of the 
tourism administrations office of research 
the administration responsible for increasing tourism as an 
export in international trade has developed a marketing program to 
attract a bigger share of the growing numbers of japanese tourists 
now that the japanese government has developed a program to 
send more citizens abroad as a means of reducing its worldwide trade 
surplus the us must respond quickly to attract its fair share of 
the market said max ollendorff the agencys director of market 
development 
the program focuses on improving group tours developing new 
tours and improving attractions in the cities where most japanese 
visitors arrive most japanese prefer group tours and many enjoy 
parks mountain regions and the american west the administration

conservation groups asked the bush 
administration thursday to declare the african elephant an 
endangered species saying the giant animals could face extinction 
because of ivory poaching 
the asian elephant is already classed as an endangered species 
under us law the african kind is considered only as threatened 
upgrading its status would in effect cut off us imports of ivory 
said craig van note who heads monitor an association of 32 groups 
we think the president will be personally interested hes an 
outdoorsman van note said we know secretary of state james 
a baker has taken a personal interest 
a formal 39page petition was prepared for presentation to the 
new secretary of the interior manuel j lujan jr 
the coalition said there were 13 million elephants in africa in 
1981 but are fewer than 500000 now 
experts have predicted that the african elephant may become 
virtually extinct in as little as 10 years unless ivory poaching is 
stopped the humane society of the united states said in a 
statement 
africas remaining elephants cannot wait the petition said 
one major conservation group that did not join in the peititon 
was the world wildlife fund 
curtis bohlen its senior vice president said african countries 
would find it offensive if the united states banned all imports 
we dont think its the best way to solve the problem he 
said in a telephone interview we only import 10 percent of the 
ivory 
a much larger proportion is imported into japan and stays there 
he added but he said japans imports have dropped and its 
government is taking drastic new measures to import only legal ivory 
bohlen said he favored a trial period for a us law that went 
into effect last october which provides for a halt of ivory imports 
from any country not trying to control the illegal slaughter of 
elephants he said world trade has dropped to 80 tons a year from an 
an average of 400 to 600 tons

the internal revenue service announced thursday 
that it is sending workers to 143 cities in 80 countries to help 
americans abroad prepare their 1988 tax returns 
at the same time the irs said it is intensifying efforts to 
reduce the number of us citizens living abroad who dont even 
bother to file a return the agency estimates 3 million live in 
foreign countries including retirees and dependents with no income 
but only 900000 filed returns last year 
we feel there is a big tax gap there donald houck assistant 
commissioner for international operations told reporters 
later this year houck said the irs expects to have in operation 
a computer program that will match the names of americans applying 
for passports against the master list of those filing returns those 
who receive passports but dont file will have to explain why 
the irs provided mail telephone or onthespot assistance to 
about onethird of those americans abroad who filed returns last 
year an estimated 5000 volunteers trained by the irs helped 30000 
us taxpayers stationed at foreign military installations 
houck said that because of budgetary restraints the irs had to 
postpone opening a tollfree telephone assistance line for americans 
abroad the line will be opened starting in canada and europe in 
1991 he said 
many americans working in a foreign country may avoid tax on up 
to 70000 earned each year if they spend enough time abroad but 
they still are required to file a return houck cautioned that the 
exclusion is not available to employees of the us government or to 
members of the military 
independent contractors who supply services to the us 
government may be eligible for the exclusion if they meet certain 
requirements but the exclusion is not available to workers who are 
paid from nonappropriated funds such as employees of service clubs 
or military post exchanges 
the irs estimates there are as many as 40000 such employees the 
agency has assessed additional taxes averaging 4000 against more 
than 600 who erroneously claimed the foreignearnings exclusion 
houck said these audits have the potential for 30 million in 
deficiencies 
schedules for the visit of irs employees to foreign countries are 
posted in us embassies and consulates and for military personnel

of an effort given the emphasis on volunteerism in this country 
said james e duffy president of communications for capital 
citiesabc inc

the lack of basic skills among young people and the major problems 
that they face today teen pregnancy dropping out of school 
substance abuse unemployment and delinquency duffy told a news 
conference 
he noted that raising basic skills is a key entry point to 
creating solutions to these problems it is not a panacea but it is 
an important and a fundamental approach 
other organizations joining with abc and pbs in the unsung 
americans campaign include

former michigan gov george romney chairman of volunteer said

most effective and least costly way of solving problems there is no 
substitute for the caring volunteer who is capable and willing to 
help another individual with a problem to help themselves 
he added that experience has shown that the most effective way 
of saving a teenager headed down the wrong road toward crime or 
drug abuse is to introduce in their life a caring adult role 
model it is not just an answer it is the only answer

antiapartheid leaders gave an 
unprecedented rebuke to winnie mandela on thursday saying she has 
betrayed the trust of the black community and kept bodyguards who 
waged a reign of terror in soweto 
the influential activists accused mrs mandela wife of jailed 
african national congress leader nelson mandela and once called the 
mother of the nation of violating human rights in the 
name of the struggle against apartheid 
the strongly worded statement was the first public repudiation of 
mrs mandela by the senior leadership of the antiapartheid 
movement they accused her of complicity in the abduction and 
assault of a 14yearold black activist stompie seipei whose 
decomposed body was found dumped in soweto last month 
mrs mandela in the few public statements she has made denied 
she was at home when the teenager and four men were abducted to her 
house on dec 29 by members of a socalled soccer team known as 
mandela united who act as her unofficial bodyguards but she has 
defended the abduction saying the four were taken to protect them 
from sexual abuse at a methodist church residence where they were 
staying in soweto 
the church has denied the charge and the antiapartheid leaders 
made their denunciation of mrs mandela at the central methodist 
church in johannesburg 
tom sebina a spokesman for the african national congress said 
from the organizations lusaka zambia headquarters that anc 
leaders were concerned at reports linking mrs mandela with the 
boys death 
asked if mrs mandela was present when stompie was abducted 
sebina said everybody at home believes so 
the anc has called on mrs mandela to disband the soccer team 
leaders of the banned united democratic front the nations 
largest opposition coalition joined prominent antiapartheid 
lawyers and officials of the congress of south african trade unions 
the largest black labor federation in reaffirming their allegiance 
to mandela while distancing themselves from his wife 
mandelas lawyer ismail ayob said he did not believe his client 
had been informed of the statement 
mandela 70 has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the whiterun 
government 
we are outraged at mrs mandelas complicity in the recent 
abductions and assault of stompie the antiapartheid leaders 
said had stompie and his three colleagues not been abducted by 
mrs mandelas football team he would have been alive today 
police this week identified stompies body in a soweto morgue and 
opened a murder investigation when stab wounds were found in his 
neck 
police also are investigating the murders of a mandela united 
member found hacked to death in soweto this week and a prominent 
antiapartheid physician who reportedly saw stompie after he had 
been beaten 
majgen jaap joubert who is heading the investigations said 
police also are looking for two young soweto men who have been 
missing since november after last being seen in the company of 
members of the soccer team 
the investigations are the latest in a series of controversies 
involving mrs mandela 54 in the three years since the government 
removed all restrictions on her activities and ended the ban on 
quoting her many black activists used to call her mother of the 
nation but her erratic behavior and reluctance to consult with 
black leaders have alienated many supporters 
mrs mandela has abused the trust and confidence which she has 
enjoyed over the years said murphy morobe of the united 
democratic front 
numerous efforts have been made to reconcile the conflict 
between mrs mandela and the black community he said on 
every occasion mrs mandela has refused to cooperate and has chosen 
to disregard the sentiments of the community 
morobe noted that mrs mandela has faced severe hardships such 
as being separated from her husband for 27 years raising her two 
daughters alone living under harsh police restrictions and 
spending 18 months in solitary confinement without charge 
he said it had been painful for black leaders to speak out 
against mrs mandela and conceded the government would use the 
criticism as a propaganda point 
but he said her actions repeatedly violated the spirit and 
ethos of the antiapartheid movement which seeks to end south 
africas system of legalized race discrimination 
we are outraged by the reign of terror that the team has been 
associated with morobe said not only is mrs mandela 
associated with the team in fact the team is her own creation 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu said in cape town he has a 
high regard for mrs mandela and hoped that something could be 
done to reconcile her with the soweto community although the 
allegations about abduction and assault have not been proven in 
court tutu said enough has surfaced to make it evident that 
there is enough truth to make it uncomfortable 
mrs mandela issued no response to the denunciation would not 
take phone calls and refused to talk to journalists who went to her 
soweto office

according to results announced thursday 
the people have exercised their vote in the face of great 
adversity the people have totally rejected the path of violence 
the president said shortly after the results of wednesdays vote 
were announced 
despite death threats and assassinations by sinhalese extremists 
and tamil separatists trying to halt the elections about 63 percent 
of sri lankas 93 million eligible voters cast ballots 
this is the spirit that will restore democracy premadasa 
said in a nationally televised speech the time for national 
reconstruction has begun the agenda is clear we must restore law 
and order 
his party won 125 seats in the 225member parliament the chief 
opposition group former prime minister sirimavo bandaranaikes sri 
lanka freedom party captured 67 seats tamils won 23 seats and the 
rest went to small parties and independents 
premadasa who won presidential elections two months ago failed 
to secure the twothirds majority needed to amend the constitution 
and key laws that could hamstring legislation needed to implement 
his ambitious antipoverty program which he considers vital for 
ending sectarian violence that has killed at least 10000 people in 
the past six years 
premadasa mrs bandaranaike and the majority of their followers 
are sinhalese the largest ethnic group on this indian ocean island 
comprising 75 percent of the countrys 16 million people the 
sinhalese dominate the government military and economic 
infrastructure tamils a minority of 18 percent claim they are 
discriminated against and the most radical members of their 
community have been waging a separatist war since 1983

organization of students a former underground militia that was 
involved in the guerrilla war 
soldiers and police enforced a strict curfew imposed thursday 
morning after sinhalese extremists shot and killed five sri lankan 
soldiers and wounded four policemen in attacks on army and police 
posts in southern and central sri lanka 
police blamed the attacks on the peoples liberation front 
composed of militant sinhalese who believe the government has made 
too many concessions to tamils 
the police blamed 47 of the 56 electionday killings on the 
front they said security forces killed seven sinhalese extremists 
who tried to attack polling places and they blamed the other two 
deaths on tamil guerrillas

antiabortion activists who unsuccessfully 
fought to block an abortion on a comatose woman continue to press 
their case hoping they can win the war even though they lost the 
battle 
they persisted this week in asking the full us supreme court 
for a stay even though nancy kleins pregnancy was terminated after 
justice thurgood marshall refused to intervene 
the activists hope eventually to argue the merits of the case 
before the justices so that something like the klein case cannot 
happen again said one of the attorneys in the case a lawrence 
washburn 
i hurt in my gut because of the loss of that infant said 
washburn 
it was not the first time washburn has become involved in a 
headlinemaking righttolife case in 1983 he tried also without 
success to intervene in a parental decision in the case of a 
severely deformed long island infant known as baby jane doe 
he vowed that the setback in the klein case will not stop him 
and like many abortion opponents he is hopeful that the supreme 
court will reverse its 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
mrs klein a 32yearold freelance fashion designer from upper 
brookville fell into a coma after suffering brain damage in a car 
accident dec 13 her husband martin was told by doctors that she 
would have a better chance of survival if the fetus she was carrying 
was aborted 
when klein went to court seeking guardianship of his wife so he 
could authorize an abortion washburn represented syosset lawyer 
john j broderick in an opposing petition for guardianship of the 
fetus another abortion opponent john short of farmingdale and 
attorney mary spaulding took a different legal tack seeking 
guardianship of mrs klein 
broderick short and their lawyers were able to delay the 
abortion three times with appeals 
at each step the new york courts rejected their petitions until 
a lastditch plea to the us supreme court for an emergency stay 
was refused the abortion was performed saturday on mrs klein who 
was 18 weeks pregnant 
along the way the antiabortion activists and their attorneys 
weathered severe criticism including abusive anonymous messages 
left on shorts answering machine 
at one point during the legal struggle klein said our family 
is beaten down were torn up these strangers have come off the 
street and are intruding in our lives we dont know what to do 
about it 
the appellate division of state supreme court agreed saying 
these absolute strangers to the klein family whatever their 
motivation have no place in the midst of this family tragedy 
washburn and short said they sympathized with the klein family 
the couple also have a 3yearold child and respect their privacy 
but both said they could not condone abortion by being silent 
we have a much larger family the human family said short 
i dont care what they call me washburn said in an interview 
washburn a father of six and grandfather of 24 said he became 
involved in the antiabortion movement in 1970 when new york 
legalized abortion 
my sister who died of cancer in 1977 urged me to get in and 
try to protect the rights of those who cannot protect themselves 
said washburn ive been doing it ever since 
he gained wide recognition in 1983 in the case of baby jane doe 
the infants parents opted against surgery for her washburn 
convinced that the parents were refusing surgery because they wanted 
the child to die took them to court 
eventually the states highest court the court of appeals 
sided with the parents and dismissed washburns suit as 
distressing and offensive the parents agreed to the surgery 
months later and the child is still alive 
washburn has had some success in court in 1980 he helped 
persuade the supreme court to uphold the power of congress to 
withhold federal funds for abortion unless the life of the mother is 
threatened by the pregnancy 
short has his own long record of antiabortion activism in 1972 
he was fired as an accountant for nassau county after he refused to 
process medicaid claims for elective abortions at the county medical 
center 
in 1975 washburn represented short in a suit against the nassau 
county medical center the suit claimed the hospital allowed doctors 
to perform abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy and let the fetuses 
die which hospital officials denied 
as a result of the case a federal judge appointed short legal 
guardian of any live fetus at the medical center a guardianship he 
never has exercised 
i see myself as the godfather of the unwanted said short 
father of five 
whenever we see anyone being forced into a tragedy we have to 
stand up and be counted he said the most terrible tragedy is 
someone killing their own child

a woman who baked 106 valentines day 
cupcakes for her sons classmates said school officials turned away 
the treats because they feared the spread of aids but officials 
denied her claim 
edwina hatzenbuehler said she was first told by the kindergarten 
teacher of her son marks class at monroe elementary school that the 
cupcakes had to be declined for health reasons 
she said principal corrine law later told her the school had a 
policy against distribution of homemade food possibly because it 
could have been made in a dirty house and threatened spread of 
diseases such as aids 
everybody in that school knows me hatzenbuehler said 
wednesday it really just hurt my feelings i told her you cant 
spread aids by cupcakes 
law denied mentioning aids or dirty houses when explaining 
the policy to hatzenbuehler but said the policy resulted from 
general concerns about health 
storebought food is allowed because preparation is supervised by 
health agencies law said 
there is no scientific evidence that the aids virus can be 
transmitted through food said faith davis a senior communicable 
disease specialist for the aids unit of the riverside county health 
department it is spread most often through sexual contact needles 
or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood 
products and from pregnant women to their offspring 
law said the schools policy adopted last september was a 
decision by the school staff and parentteacher association besides 
health considerations parents showing up with homemade goodies were 
disrupting instruction law said 
distribution of storebought treats has been put under the 
coordination of room mothers the principal said hatzenbuehler is 
not a room mother 
we try very hard not to offend any parent but we have to 
act on what is best for the children said joan shurtliff 
assistant superintendent for the riverside unified school district

james bond an ornithologist whose name was 
adopted for the fictional british agent 007 in ian flemings novels 
has died he was 89 
he died tuesday at chestnut hill hospital where officials 
refused to release the cause of death 
bond former curator of ornithology at the academy of natural 
sciences was the leading authority on birds of the west indies for 
more than half a century and is best known scientifically for 
proving that birds of the caribbean originated in north america not 
south america 
in recognition of this discovery the geographic line dividing 
caribbean birds of north american ancestry from those of south 
american origins has been called bonds line 
bonds contribution to popular culture came after world war ii 
when fleming saw his book birds of the west indies fleming a 
bird watcher was writing a thriller at the time and adopted the 
name for the dashing character portrayed in movies by sean connery 
roger moore and other actors 
it struck me that this brief unromantic anglosaxon and yet 
very masculine name was just what i needed and so a second james 
bond was born fleming wrote years later to bonds wife mary 
fanning wickham bond 
in return i can only offer you or james bond unlimited use of 
the name ian fleming for any purposes you may think fit he wrote 
perhaps one day your husband will discover a particularly horrible 
species of bird which he would like to christen in an insulting 
fashion by calling it ian fleming 
fleming died in 1964 
the ornithologist bond a native of philadelphia earned a 
bachelors degree at cambridge university and made his first 
scientific expedition in 1925 when he traveled up the amazon river 
to collect bird skins and live animals for the academy 
he visited more than 100 caribbean islands collected all but six 
of the 300 bird species living there and wrote more than 100 
scientific papers and four books on caribbean birds 
among his scientific honors were the musgrave medal from the 
institute of jamaica in 1952 the brewster medal the highest honor 
of the american ornithologists union in 1954 and the leidy medal 
of the academy of natural sciences in 1975 
he is survived by his wife a stepdaughter and six 
stepgrandchildren 
a memorial service will be held saturday in chestnut hill

oliver norths lawyers said today a plan worked 
out between attorney general dick thornburgh and prosecutors would 
impose intolerable burdens in the irancontra case but the 
independent counsel prosecuting north denied the assertion 
norths attorneys brendan sullivan and barry simon filed a 
motion seeking rejection of the plan to protect classified material 
detailed wednesday by independent counsel lawrence walsh 
under that plan drawn up to reflect a court order issued tuesday 
by us district judge gerhard a gesell the independent counsel 
said he will if necessary seek an affidavit from the attorney 
general to prevent the disclosure by north of classified information 
that could harm national security 
the defense motion was filed a few hours after chief justice 
william h rehnquist lifted an order that had delayed the start of 
the trial thornburgh said he is satisfied with arrangements for 
handling state secrets that north wants to make public 
the courts oral ruling and its subsequent written order were 
clearly intended to exclude the ag attorney general entirely from 
the trial process sullivan and simon said in their motion 
they said that each time the court rules admissible an item of 
information falling within nine categories specified by the judges 
order the trial will come to a halt while walsh sends word to 
thornburgh 
norths lawyers said walshs plan contemplates that thornburgh 
would be permitted to intervene in the trial through bits and 
pieces of affidavit an approach that the judge rejected tuesday 
walshs plan would cripple norths right to crossexamine 
prosecution witnesses and to present his case and would impose 
intolerable burdens on the court the witnesses and the jurors 
they contended 
gesell did not comment on walshs plan 
walsh said in a response that the independent counsel does not 
contemplate the trifling bits and pieces activity by the attorney 
general which north anticipates adding 
the daytoday conduct of this case will be by the independent 
counsel and only the independent counsel 
meantime he called a closed hearing this afternoon to discuss 
disclosures of the reagan administrations offer of inducements to 
third countries to funnel support to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
during a time when congress had banned aid to them 
at the hearing gesell was to consider the proposed text of what 
the government is willing to admit at norths trial about the quid 
pro quo arrangements which defense lawyers say are at the heart 
of the case 
on monday sullivan asserted that thenpresident reagan 
personally participated in a plan to offer favors to third countries 
willing to support the contras and that reagan and other top 
administration officials then agreed to cover up the arrangements 
the government is willing to make limited disclosures about the 
matter but norths lawyers want to delve into it in greater detail 
at his trial 
rehnquist in a brief order this morning lifted a stay he had 
granted the government on sunday the justice department says 
adequate safeguards to prevent disclosure of national security 
secrets at the trial are in place and there no longer is a need to 
hold up the proceedings 
thornburgh on wednesday accepted an order from gesell barring the 
attorney general from filing affidavits continuously during the 
trial objecting to individual pieces of classified material that 
north wants to introduce in his defense 
walsh made it easier for thornburgh to accept gesells order 
walsh devised a plan saying that he will if necessary seek an 
affidavit from the attorney general to prevent the disclosure during 
the trial of classified information that could harm national 
security 
walshs statement added that he is prepared to discharge his 
responsibility under gesells order 
thornburgh said walshs promise provides the government with 
the substance of what we have been seeking for the past week 
as he left work thornburgh told reporters he was satisfied 
because the independent counsel has agreed to be my 
representative on all secrecy matters in the trial 
late wednesday acting solicitor general william c bryson filed 
papers asking that the stay issued by rehnquist be lifted 
in light of the district courts order and the report of the 
independent counsel the attorney general believes that the concerns 
that gave rise to the relief from this court have been satisfied 
the department said in its brief 
north is accused of shredding evidence and lying to congress to 
cover up the reagan administrations attempts to help the nicaraguan 
contra rebels during a period in which congress had banned direct 
us aid

letters from howard hughes to a onetime key aide 
and other items linked to the late billionaire will go on the 
auction block this weekend in what is billed as the first sale of 
its kind 
most of the memorabilia to be sold belonged to the late rc 
kuldell who tended to the business of hughes tool co in houston 
during the late 1930s while his young and flamboyant boss was in 
hollywood making movies and headlines 
while howard was out playing kuldell was in houston making 
money hand over fist for him said ray simpson owner of the 
company handling the sale about 65 items will be auctioned at 
simpsons auction house sunday 
besides the kuldell items the sale will include a shotgun that 
the hughes an industrialist aviation pioneer and film producer is 
said to have carried with him on a recordbreaking roundtheworld 
airplane flight in 1938 a hat and scarf he purportedly once wore 
several rare posters of movies he made and three schoolbooks he used 
as a child 
hughes led a muchpublicized life as a young man but he later 
became obsessively reclusive he died in 1976 at age 70 while on a 
chartered flight from acapulco to houston for medical treatment 
simpson said a letter from hughes signed simply howard sold 
for 1000 at an auction in new york three years ago but there has 
not been a public sale that consisted exclusively of hughes 
memorabilia 
notarized letters will support the authenticity of hughes link 
to all the items most which are owned by houston entrepreneur bob 
kuldell rcs son simpson said the elder kuldell died in 1973 
i thought other people could use these things more than i could 
right now bob kuldell said in explaining why he decided to sell 
rc kuldell was hired by hughes father howard hughes sr and 
went to work for hughes tool now baker hughes tool co in 1920 he 
continued to work there after the elder hughes died in 1924 and 
18yearold howard jr became his boss 
dad had a very good rapport with howard the younger kuldell 
said he loved him like a son 
rc kuldell retired from hughes tool in 1939 at age 52 after a 
corporate power struggle with a hughes adviser his son said but 
kuldell kept in touch with hughes until his death in 1973 his son 
said 
one of the items to be auctioned is a solid gold custommade 
pocket watch hughes gave to kuldell with both mens initials 
inscribed on the back kuldells son said he treasured that watch 
more than anything 
ordinarily such a watch would sell for at least 10000 but it 
is expected to fetch a higher price because of the history behind 
it simpson said in all the items could bring as much as 100000 
he said 
simpson said that after word got out about the auction several 
other people called wanting to sell their hughes memorabilia 
one consigner is selling three schoolbooks that belonged to 
hughes found in an attic of a home 40 years ago 
folded up in one of the books is a drawing of a boy in a car that 
has an airplane propeller on the end and in one composition book 
an 8yearold hughes writes about his 1913 christmas 
i hung my stocking and tried to make mother hang hers up but 
she would not do it i went to bed but could not go to sleep for a 
long time i got up the next day and went downstairs i thought 
there was too much for me i had a nice christmas 
simpson expects about 500 people to attend the auction

that farmers produce but dont sell said j michael gould a us 
department of agriculture scientist who helped develop the process 
at a laboratory in peoria 
the treated fiber is dried and ground and used to replace some of 
the conventional flour in breads cakes and doughnuts the material 
could increase the fiber content of baked goods by up to 30 percent 
without altering the taste or adding calories gould said 
we found we could make a white bread that looks feels and 
tastes like any other white bread but which has as much dietary 
fiber as whole wheat bread he said 
soluble fibers such as those found in oat bran and most fruits 
have been linked with lower blood cholesterol levels according to 
kay behall a usda nutritionist in beltsville md 
the fiber in corncobs and in most brans is insoluble but 
insoluble fiber is known to reduce likelihood and severity of 
constipation diverticulitis and irritable bowel syndromes such as 
colitis she said 
gould said the process involves the use of hydrogen peroxide to 
soften fibrous plant material and make it more palatable otherwise 
consumers complain that the fiber creates a gritty texture he said 
mount pulaski products which paid a 50000 fee for the 
technology expects to buy corncobs and other plant material from 
farmers near its headquarters in mount pulaski in central illinois 
the company already processes corncobs into a material used in 
polishing agents and other industrial products

reading from notes at the beginning of his meeting with the 
press bush said we support the afghan efforts to fashion a 
stable broadly based government responsive to the needs of the 
afghan people 
he said the us commitment to the afghan people will remain 
and will remain firm both through our bilateral humanitarian 
program and through the united nations efforts to remove the mines 
and resettle the refugees and help reconstruct the wartorn economy 
so we would call upon the soviet union to refrain from other 
forms of interference in afghan affairs bush said the soviet 
union has nothing to fear from the establishment of an independent 
nonaligned afghanistan and they do bear a certain special 
responsibility for healing the wounds of this war 
he said he hoped moscow would generously support international 
efforts to rebuild afghanistan 
there are widespread fears that a struggle for control by 
competing guerrilla groups could throw afghanistan into a civil war 
the time for recrimination is over he said the time for 
bloodbaths is over and i would like to see the various factions get 
together and come up with recommendations that would lead to a 
peaceful afghanistan with no more bloodbaths

president bush said today that americans have 
to be wary of nicaraguan president daniel ortegas promise to 
provide fair and free elections in exchange for the breakup of the 
contra rebel fighting force 
however bush said he did see some positive elements in an 
agreement worked out by ortega and the leaders of four other central 
american nations 
noting that the central american leaders gave themselves 90 days 
to work out the details of the peace pact bush said the united 
states has time to analyze the situation and make strategy decisions 
the president hailed elements of the agreement that committed the 
sandinista government to instituting freedom of worship freedom of 
speech and fair elections but he said there are some troublesome 
elements 
whats troubling me is that claims like this have been made 
at one time only to see those claims repudiated promises made and 
promises broken bush said so i think we have to be wary 
lets be sure that we not leave the resistance standing alone leave 
them twisting down there without fulfillment of the methods of 
democracy on the part of the sandinistas 
the president commented in an oval office interview with a small 
group of reporters 
bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater had voiced skepticism 
about the peace plan earlier 
fitzwater joined state department officials in noting that us 
officials will soon be discussing the situation with the leaders of 
central american democracies 
asked whether the administration would seek a renewal of 
humanitarian aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels which expires 
march 31 the spokesman said only that no decisions have been made 
at this point 
he acknowledged however that the decision on whether such aid 
should continue would ultimately rest with congress he did say that 
there certainly is a fundamental continuing commitment to the 
contras 
meanwhile the revised peace plan signed by five central american 
leaders is producing signs of a new conservativeliberal split in 
congress over what to do about the contras 
the two key elements of the agreement reached tuesday after a 
twoday summit in san salvador el salvador call for early 
demobilization of the contra rebels and fair national elections in 
nicaragua no later than february 1990 
the state department said wednesday it is withholding comment on 
the plan until it consults with the central american countries other 
than nicaragua costa rica guatemala honduras and el salvador 
but two key members of congress who have long been on opposite 
sides of the contra debate offered sharply differing assessments 
wednesday of the communique which calls for a contra demobilization 
plan to be formulated within 90 days 
rep mickey edwards rokla a contra backer argued against the 
sequence outlined in the agreement saying the elections in 
nicaragua should be held before the contras disband 
if they lay down their arms now there wont be elections 
said edwards who has been a republican floor leader during previous 
contra aid debates 
he said it was important to keep the contras together and armed 
until there is democracy 
but rep david bonier dmich the chief deputy majority whip 
expressed hope that the bush administration will look favorably upon 
the plan 
alluding to the sandinista promise of free elections and other 
liberalizing measures bonier said i think this is what the 
contra forces in essence have been asking i think it presents a 
unique opportunity for them to take advantage of it 
bonier said us and west european economic and political 
pressure has proved effective in inducing the sandinistas to 
undertake democratic reforms but every time we have applied 
military pressure there has been a constricting of freedoms 
edwards and bonier were interviewed on pbss mcneillehrer 
newshour 
vice president dan quayle meanwhile questioned whether there 
was an enforcement mechanism which would ensure that the 
sandinistas make a good faith effort to carry out their democratic 
promises 
if ortega reneges quayle said in a radio interview were 
going to have to regroup and come up with a new strategy to move 
nicaragua in the direction of pluralism 
contra leader adolfo calero appeared to have mixed feelings about 
the agreement alternately praising and condemning it while talking 
with reporters in el salvador 
the noncommittal stance of state department spokesman charles 
redman was attributable in part to a number of unanswered 
questions about the meaning of the communique and the motives of the 
four presidents friendly to the united states in signing it us 
officials said 
one official insisting on anonymity said the communique appears 
to mean that we are two steps closer to the final killing of the 
contras 
about 11000 rebels are clustered in camps on the honduran side 
of the border with nicaragua where they are sustained by the us 
humanitarian aid program 
congressional critics of the contras are likely to insist as 
their price for additional s infamous book has had appalling consequences 
in some 
islamic countries 
it is a decree it is a verdict after careful consideration 
he said of the death sentence it has nothing to do with any 
particular country 
on wednesday protesters stoned the british embassy in tehran 
britain reopened the embassy in december after an eightyear 
closure and intended to appoint an ambassador and have more than 12 
diplomats the foreign office said 
in new delhi an anonymous caller to the united news of india 
threatened to bomb british flights unless rushdie emerged from 
hiding 
at londons heathrow airport british airways immediately 
tightened security with bagbybag searches of luggage of passengers 
on its thursday evening flights to the indian subcontinent and the 
far east 
air europe another britishowned airline with flights to india 
said it was taking the threat seriously 
amid a growing international furor the pakistan government 
called in the british and american ambassadors and demanded that all 
copies of the book be destroyed 
pakistan india and several other countries banned the book 
prime minister benazir bhutto reached agreement with her rightwing 
opposition in january on a parliamentary resolution upholding the 
ban 
tehran radio said religious figures in the northwestern iran city 
of urumiyeh said in a statement we have already put on our death 
shrouds and pledge to carry out the imams khomeinis death 
sentence against salman rushdie and his publishers in the united 
states and europe 
the broadcast followed reports that other death squads were 
headed to britain from islamic countries in search of rushdie a 
41yearold moslem 
rushdie dropped out of sight soon after khomeini announced the 
death sentence on tuesday on him and viking his publishers in 
britain and the united states 
the 26 million bounty offered by iran was matched by mohammad 
hashemian religious leader in the southwestern city of kerman who 
offered the cash reward to any group or individual who carries out 
the death sentence on rushdie and his publishers that brought the 
total bounty to 56 million 
noniranians would be paid 1 million if they got to rushdie 
first 
in washington state department spokesman charles e redman said 
the united states was appalled by the death threats against salman 
rushdie by the ayatollah khomeini as well as a subsequent offer of 
a reward for his murder 
such threats are completely irresponsible and are incompatible 
with basic standards of international conduct he said adding 
that he did not see how this in any way could improve the 
prospects for usiranian relations 
in the netherlands where he is on a nato tour secretary of 
state james a baker iii called the death threats regrettable 
sheik mohammed hossameldin a leading islamic theologian in 
cairo said khomeini erred in sending death squads after rushdie 
because executing him would be virtually impossible under the 
tenets of islam 
hossameldin said in an interview that nobody has been executed 
in islams 1350year history as an apostate which he interpreted 
as the crime that khomeini invoked in issuing his sentence against 
rushdie khomeini said only that the indianborn author deserved to 
die for insulting islam 
in other developments 
the french government said it was shocked at the death 
threat and dutch foreign minister hans van den broek canceled a trip 
to tehran 
italian publishers arnoldo mondadori editore spa said they 
would go head with a contract to release the italian edition of 
the satanic verses but rushdies french publishers christian 
bourgois suspended publication plans 
the british arts council backing earlier protests by british 
writers denounced the threats against rushdie and his publishers as 
contrary to the tolerance and understanding that are the hallmark 
of a free society

supporters of a new dialogue between liberal 
israelis and palestinians said thursday it could lead to 
negotiations with the plo but some rightwing opponents view those 
involved as traitors 
the controversy has created new tensions in the uneasy governing 
coalition of prime minister yitzhak shamirs conservative likud bloc 
and the more dovish labor party 
two private meetings were held this week by three prominent 
palestinans who support the palestine liberation organization and 
leading labor party members close to finance minister shimon peres 
the party leader 
liberal parliament members and other israelis opposed to the 
government policy of refusing to talk with the plo also have flown 
to europe to participate in academic forums debates and conferences 
with plo officials 
at least four conferences are scheduled in the coming weeks such 
forums skirt an israeli law making contact with the plo punishable 
by up to three years in jail 
peres hinted that he may join the informal discussions later 
despite opposition within his party 
avraham burg a labor dove who attended one of the meetings 
would not reveal what was discussed but said one aim of the dialogue 
was to create an awareness that israel could not ignore the 
palestinians 
we both suffered from an ongoing process of demonization of 
the enemy he said i want the israelis to realize that 
something is going on and that we have no excuse any more to 
say there is nobody to talk to 
galia golan a hebrew university professor who attended a 
conference with plo officials in the netherlands last week found it 
very encouraging and said they have come to the conclusion 
they must negotiate and must limit their demands theyve come a 
long way 
faisal husseini a palestinian who heads the arab studies center 
in jerusalem and is close to yasser arafat said he joined the talks 
to explain plo positions so they would seem less threatening to 
israelis 
it is time to go and talk to these people and let them see the 
monster face to face and see he is not a monster he said 
tuesday adding that he wants the meetings to involve other than 
leftist israelis 
palestinians are accepting the idea of meeting with israelis 
more close to the center he said 
husseini 48 is the scion of a prominent jerusalem family his 
father was a military commander and his grandfather mayor of the 
city 
also involved in the talks with israeli politicials were ziad abu 
ziad a journalist and philosphy professor sari nusseibah 
rightwing members of the knesset israels parliament attacked 
the dialogue with palestinians and eliezer waldman of the tehiya 
party said israeli participants should be tried for working with 
the enemies of israel 
yossi ahimeir spokesman for the prime minister said we dont 
consider these meetings as important on the contrary it will not 
come to anything 
of the israelis involved he said these people are not in 
charge of making policy for the state 
some contacts with palestinian supporters of the plo have been 
made by defense officials and senior army officers as part of an 
initiative by defense minister yitzhak rabin a labor party hawk 
rabin raised the possibility thursday of negotiating for an 
undefined political entity with elected palestinians from jordan 
and the occupied west bank and gaza strip where an uprising began 
more than 14 months ago 
he promised really free elections to choose political 
representation to conduct negotiations with us on a political 
process that would not immediately reach a permanent solution we 
cant resolve that problem at once 
speaking on israels arabic television program rabin indicated 
flexibility about withdrawing the army from voting areas on election 
days and providing guarantees that no one would interefere with 
voting he promised to force a cabinet vote if palestinians accepted 
his proposal even with reservations 
many palestinians suspect however that israel is trying to 
create an unacceptable local alternative to arafats leadership 
the israelis in their rejection of talking to the plo are 
trying to find someone else to talk to said haidar abdul shafi 
head of the red crescent society in the gaza strip they are 
trying to dismember the palestinians in the territories from those 
outside 
rabins intitiative appears to have been the genesis of the 
unofficial talks between husseini and labor party doves husseini 
met with defense ministry official shmuel goren while still in jail 
last month 
husseini had been in jail without trial during most of the 
palestinian uprising suspected of involvement in underground 
activities

a smalltown doctor who made house 
calls for more than a halfcentury and was a model for one of the 
bestloved works of illustrator norman rockwell retired on his 83rd 
birthday thursday 
donald e campbell said he knew it was time to quit because he 
had begun forgetting peoples names he made his last house call 
wednesday his last day of work 
theres nothing more disgusting than when your memory starts to 
go he said makes you feel like a horses patootie 
campbell was the only doctor in this picturesque western 
massachusetts community rockwells hometown he said he has 
arranged for a few physicians in neighboring communities to take 
over his patient load 
the doctor did his own laboratory work and developed his own 
xrays between examinations in his cluttered office on west main 
street on thursday the telephone in the office rang off the hook 
with patients begging him to stay on 
he practiced obstetrics pediatrics gynecology dermatology 
orthopedics and gerontology and worked even after supper on most 
days seeing 13 patients on monday 
campbell was medical examiner until this week but planned to 
keep on the town board of health he also planned he said to 
devote his time to his four daughters and to continue to lend an ear 
to patients who stop him on the street in this town of 2000 people 
his wife anna died last month 
rockwell a patient of campbells until his death a decade ago 
used the doctor as a model for several illustrations including 
before the shot in which a physician prepares a shot for a 
barebottomed youngster as the boy suspiciously examines his framed 
medical degrees 
campbell said he owned the original but reluctantly sold it for 
10000 several years ago to raise money for the financially 
troubled edgecomb nursing amp convalescent home which he had founded 
in 1968 rockwell sold it for him to a new york state doctor whom 
campbell declined to identify 
a charcoal sketch of the painting was on display at the norman 
rockwell museum down the street from the doctor until last month 
the whereabouts of the original is unknown the museum said 
campbell said the only memento he has of the artist he described as 
shy genial happy and a noncomplainer was a head study 
rockwell once made of him 
campbell said he charged 2 for an office visit and 3 for a home 
visit when he hung out his shingle in 1939 after graduating from 
middlesex medical school now brandeis university he often took his 
fee in vegetables venison or cord wood 
it was no way to get rich he acknowledged unless you mean 
rich in spirit

by the year 2020 the worlds moslem population 
could double to 19 billion and its share of humanity jump from 18 
percent to 25 percent two population experts said thursday 
of all the worlds religions they said islam is the fastest 
growing 
writers john r weeks who directs the international population 
center at san diego state university in california and saad 
gadalla its technical director said that about 42 babies are born 
to every 1000 people in moslem countries each year 
that compares with fewer than 34 in other third world countries 
and only 13 in the western industrial world 
the study the demography of islamic nations was distributed 
in washington by the population reference bureau a private group 
weeks said in a telephone interview that the moslem growth is due 
first of all to low incomes which he said were largely a result of 
decades of colonial rule in the islamic world 
when the economic situation goes up the fertility rate goes 
down he said when the status of women goes up fertility goes 
down too 
the study pointed to islamic countries particularly tunisia 
where both the economy and the status of women have improved in 
recent years it also noted the disadvantages of women in moslem 
countries including the prevalence of teenage marriages and low 
levels of education 
the authors estimated that 980 million of the worlds 52 billion 
people are moslems by 2020 they estimated moslems will total 19 
billion people out of roughly 86 billion people 
indonesia has the worlds largest moslem population 156136000 
the authors said of all moslem nations they said indonesia has 
likely made the greatest headway in slowing its population growth 
the immediate explanation for the drop in fertility was the 
rapid increase in contraceptive use among married couples of 
reproductive age the study said 
pakistan has the second largest moslem population 104243000 
followed by bangladesh 93050000 and india with 89034000

a short walk from stanford universitys 
golf course impoverished migrant farm workers living on university 
land are crammed into wretched wooden shacks without heat toilets 
or running water 
there are more illegalities more exploitation of workers more 
breaches of workers rights in this one plot of ground right here 
than weve seen in a long long time said jim eggleston attorney 
for a university union that the migrants want to represent them 
but who is legally responsible for the migrants plight 
is it the university which owns the land or is it webb ranch 
which has leased 300 acres and pays the migrants for picking berries 
and vegetables that sell to restaurants and markets 30 miles north 
in san francisco 
the migrants have asked the united stanford workers the union 
for 1200 university maintenance workers to represent them the 
union sent a letter this week to stanford president donald kennedy 
and webb ranch demanding recognition as the bargaining agent for the 
farm workers 
if kennedy and webb dont recognize the union by friday the 
union plans to file a petition with the state agriculture labor 
relations board that could lead to a vote by the farm workers on 
union representation 
eggleston contends stanford as land owner is the true employer 
of the farm workers under state law and is legally responsible for 
the shameful activity thats going on here 
stanford attorney priscilla wheeler disagreed 
stanford is not responsible for the employment policies of its 
lessees or contractors she said in a statement we would of 
course be concerned if any lessee violated the law so far as we 
know webb ranch has not done so if there are issues of 
mistreatment we hope they are brought up with the state 
stanley webb manager of the ranch leased by his family since 
1922 was not available for comment thursday his office said other 
ranch officials would not comment 
the migrants shacks are just a halfmile from the center of what 
is considered one of the most beautiful college campuses in the 
nation tuition and room and board next school year will total 
19164 
up to 90 migrants including 20 children live in the encampment 
among them are tibuecio cabrera 67 and his wife cointa mendoza 
58 
cabreras last monthly pay receipt shows he worked 194 hours and 
earned 82450 or 425 an hour he took home 51486 after 
deductions for social security unemployment tax a 50 personal 
advance rent of 14550 and utilities 
i sometimes get angry but i have to comfort myself cabrera 
said what else can i do 
cabrera and his wife have a small electric heater and some 
blankets to keep warm they have a hot plate but there is no sink 
or water in the room clothing hangs from a cord and a bare bulb 
dangles from a wire tacked to the wall near several pictures of 
jesus and the pope 
like the other workers cabrera receives no health care no 
holidays and no vacation he said he had to use all his savings to 
pay for treatment of a stomach ailment 
the camp has only one portable toilet and three indoor toilets 
there is a communal kitchen and refrigerators are padlocked between 
meals 
only a few of the migrants speak or read english 
webb charges 75 cents for every hour worked for rent so the more 
hours worked the higher the rent the migrants are charged for the 
tools they use 
the migrants long afraid to speak out because they were illegal 
aliens from mexico asked the stanford union to represent them after 
receiving protection under the federal amnesty program for 
agricultural workers eggleston said wednesday 
other labor groups also are supporting the migrants

authorities for the first time allowed an 
official newspaper to publish evidence that implicates the soviet 
union in the massacre of thousands of polish officers during world 
war ii 
the bodies of more than 4000 polish army officers deported to 
the soviet union were uncovered by hitlers army in the spring of 
1943 official soviet and polish histories have long maintained the 
officers were murdered by the nazis in 1941 but many poles and 
western historians blame the soviets 
the katyn massacre named for the katyn forest where the bodies 
were found is one of the most sensitive issues in polishsoviet 
relations for many poles it symbolizes a list of historical 
grievances against the soviet union 
a confidential report made by the polish red cross in june 1943 
that appeared wednesday in the weekly odrodzenie rebirth said 
judging by the papers found with the corpses the murder took 
place in the months of march and april 1940 
because the site 12 miles west of smolensk in western russia 
was at that time in possession of the soviets the report implied 
soviet responsibility for the crime 
in an introduction to the red cross document in ordrodzenie 
historian jarema maciszewski wrote as it is known determining 
the date of the katyn murder is at the same time equal to pointing 
at the perpetrators 
the polish officers were deported by the soviets to camps in the 
western part of the soviet union after the red army invaded poland 
in september 1939 hitlers army invaded the soviet union in june 
1941 
each of the officers primarily reservists representing the cream 
of the polish intelligentsia was executed with a bullet to the base 
of the skull 
the report published wednesday was written by kazimierz 
skarzynski general secretary of the polish red cross during the 
war and it was found in british archives maciszewski wrote 
for propaganda reasons the german occupiers of poland had 
permitted a polish red cross team to make a fiveweek study of the 
graves secreted among the team were representatives of the polish 
underground according to historian jan zawodny 
the conclusions of the investigation have long been known in the 
west but the odrodzenie article said this was the first time the 
report has been published in poland 
maciszewski is chairman of the polish side of an official 
sovietpolish commission appointed in 1987 to investigate the katyn 
massacre and blank spots in history including the 1920 war between 
poland and the soviet union and the murder of most of the top 
members of the polish communist party on josef stalins orders in 
the late 1930s 
the commission has yet to publish its conclusions and polish 
officials have said the soviet side is responsible for the delay 
the government tuesday said that the stand of the polish 
historians on the panel may soon be made public separately from 
those of the soviet side 
many poles had hoped soviet president mikhail s gorbachev would 
mention the katyn massacre during a sixday visit to poland last 
july while gorbachev spoke of painful episodes between the two 
countries in a speech to the polish parliament he made no specific 
mention of katyn

the european parliament on thursday 
called for a strict ban on mining in antarctica and denounced a 
proposal to divide the continents mineral resources among 
industrial countries 
parliamentarians from the 12nation european economic community 
also condemned the wellington convention and urged member states not 
to ratify it 
the convention if ratified would divide the continents mineral 
resources among the industrial nations 
the parliament said if antarcticas oil and mineral resources are 
exploited it could have disastrous effects on its ecosystem and 
consequently on the wellbeing of mankind 
the european body said the antarctic should be set aside as a 
nature preserve where all wild animals would be protected and the 
natural state would remain intact

martha c shields told her son and daughter when 
they were growing up to stay away from the old brown trunk in the 
basement when she died this week they found the skeletal remains 
of an infant inside 
state medical examiners thursday set about determining the age 
sex and cause of death of the infant who may have been dead 30 
years there is no evidence so far to suggest that any crime was 
committed police said 
investigators at the scene assisted by the state crime 
laboratory and the medical examiners office speculate that the 
baby was a fullterm baby and was probably a couple of weeks old 
said state police spokesman sgt joseph ireton 
mrs shields a 67yearold widow died of natural causes monday 
in her home in suburban elkridge the skeleton was found in a 
steamer trunk wednesday afternoon by mrs shields grown daughter 
and son who were going through the womans effects searching for a 
will said trooper mike davey 
it was a brown steamer trunk pushed against the wall in the 
basement davey said it had things piled on it and things piled 
around it the skeleton was found wrapped in two blankets he 
said and an old bible and remnants of a white dress also were found 
joyce shields 31 and her brother robert 29 told 
investigators that when they were young their mother told them 
never to go near the trunk davey said 
but not long before she died she told them to take care of what 
was in the trunk the officer said adding it was their 
interpretation that it was the will that was in the trunk 
mrs shields children who declined to comment publicly told 
investigators there had been no family discussion about a child who 
died at birth or shortly afterward davey said nor did they recall 
their mother ever being pregnant while they were growing up 
a search of the home by state police failed to turn up anything 
to explain the infants remains he said and a check of state 
records found no mention of any child born to mrs shields from 1950 
on other than joyce and robert 
the family had lived in the house in elkridge for about 20 years 
before that they lived in baltimore davey said as near as they 
the two children can recall when they moved the trunk went with 
them he said

theme restaurants that sprinkle sawdust on the 
floor for a dash of wild west authenticity won the first round 
thursday in a shootout with the state health department which calls 
the practice unsanitary 
this is regulation gone wild said rep stan barnes as he 
voted for a bill overturning the department of health services 
sawdust ban 
restaurants with names like the big apple and the satisfied frog 
are pushing a bill to overturn the department and allow sawdust as 
long as it is changed daily and sprinkled with a nontoxic fire 
retardant the house environment committee approved the measure 
thursday in an 84 vote and sent it to the health committee 
the feud began in earnest a year ago when state and county health 
departments cracked the whip on an estimated 25 to 40 restaurants in 
the state that sprinkled sawdust on the floor 
the bill johnsons big apple chain has used sawdust since 1956 
and has served 30 million customers said don kalfas general 
manager of the chain and president of the state restaurant 
association 
if there were a health hazard direct or indirect with 
customers during those years and with those numbers wed have heard 
some feedback he told committee members 
one of those voting against overturning the ban rep herb 
guenther said he enjoyed dining at the big apple but i dont see 
why this issue should be before this body im just not prepared to 
usurp the authority given dhs on minor issues 
dr steven englender who heads the health departments division 
of disease prevention services said sawdust in a dining area is 
kicked up by foot traffic and settles on silverware food and 
kitchen tables 
california and pennsylvania are the only other states to allows 
sawdust he said adding that county and local health departments in 
arizona agree that sawdust may harbor insects and vermin 
as for the requirement that sawdust be changed daily englender 
said with inspections averaging two times a year enforcement 
obviously would be difficult compliance would be next to 
impossible

the bush administration has delayed until 
midmarch a decision on letting a major us defense contractor work 
with japan to develop and produce a new version of the f16 fighter 
congressional sources said thursday 
plans to transfer to japan 7 billion in advanced american 
aircraft technology have generated opposition on capitol hill to the 
deal involving the proposed fsx fighter which japan wants to 
upgrade its air capabilities by the late 1990s 
under the pending agreement st louisbased general dynamics 
would join forces with japans mitsubishi heavy industries to 
codevelop and coproduce the fighter 
a congressional source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
that after considerable jockeying among agencies the defense 
department and commerce department were asked to study the 
strategic commercial and technological aspects of the project and 
do a combined report by march 10 
the review was ordered at a national security council meeting 
tuesday night that had been called on less than 24 hours notice 
according to the source 
the state department and the pentagon which had taken the lead 
in negotiating the fsx agreement contended that a final decision 
should be made this month the commerce department however had 
sought a delay of 60 to 90 days 
other agencies including the us trade representative and the 
labor and treasury departments also had been leaning toward 
commerces position in favor of a thorough review 
during a white house press briefing thursday presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said only that with regard to the fsx 
the interagency process is still under way i would not expect it 
to come up in japan 
president bush will go to japan next week to attend the funeral 
of emperor hirohito 
proponents of the fsx deal say it is the best that could be 
negotiated in view of japanese refusal to buy wholly 
americanbuilt planes and it fosters beneficial technology 
transfer in both directions with japan while generating income and 
jobs for us industry 
but critics contend the agreement amounts to a technological 
giveaway that will enable the japanese to compete more effectively 
against this country in the global aviation market they argue that 
tokyo should purchase americanmade fighters to help offset the 50 
billion us trade deficit with japan 
on capitol hill a group of 21 senators last week introduced a 
resolution declaring they have strong reservations about the 
deal and urging a 60day delay to allow time for a thorough review 
general dynamics this countrys no 2 defense contractor has 
said that under the deal it and other us companies will receive 
35 percent to 45 percent of the 12 billion being spent on 
development of the fsx as well as a comparable share of the 5 
billion production program

president bush called budget negotiations a 
twoway street on thursday and denied he was trying to shift to 
congress the responsibility for proposing unpopular cuts 
i dont think that is the informed opinion of the key leaders 
in congress today bush said 
he also denied any major policy rift with federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan over interest rates though he added 
maybe well get into a fight down the road 
in an interview with a small group of reporters bush said he was 
pleased so far with congressional reaction to his 116 trillion 
spending plan for fiscal year 1990 
i said ahead of time i didnt expect everybody would jump up 
and down and say this is the greatest thing since sliced bread 
bush said 
the republicans have generally been enthusiatic he said 
the democrats though not endorsing it quite as much have seen 
some positive direction some positive objectives in the budget 
some democratic critics have complained that the bush budget 
while advocating expanded social programs is vague on details of 
what must be cut to pay for the new initiatives 
these critics have said the situation allows bush to get credit 
for new programs to aid education the homeless and environmental 
cleanup while sticking congress with the job of finding cuts in 
other areas to pay for them 
after saying that wasnt the view of key leaders bush added that 
if some people do hold that opinion then we will redouble our 
efforts to be sure they understand theres no validity to that 
yes theres a lot more detail that has to be hammered out and 
we will work with them to satisfy their interests and find out what 
they want its a two way street he said 
bush also said he was pleased with the reaction so far to his 
plan to rescue the nations ailing savings and loans even though he 
said that few are thoroughly enamored with it 
as for interest rates greenspans federal reserve has neen 
nudging up shortterm rates in recent months in an effort to 
minimize inflation risks greenspan has indicated he would rather 
err on the side of tighter credit than encourage a rekindling of 
inflation 
but bush said thursday i dont see the inflationary pressures 
as so bad or enough to warrant substantially higher interest 
rates i dont see that 
still he said he and greenspan arent far apart and asserted 
that politicians bankers and business journalists delight in trying 
to drive a wedge between the president and the charman of the 
fed regardless of who is in power 
i want to avoid that you know maybe well get into a 
fight down the road but i dont think its at hand 
bush said the best thing to do about interest rates is to get a 
budget agreement he said a budget plan such as the one he 
unveiled last week would if adopted help to drive down rates 
the bush administration has projected that shortterm rates now 
at over 8 percent will ease to around 7 percent this year and fall 
to 55 percent by 1990 many private economists have labeled these 
projections too optimistic 
the interest rates will be lower if we can promptly get a 
budget agreement bush said

the security council gave unanimous 
approval thursday to an independence plan designed to free namibia 
from 74 years of south african rule and it dispatched the first 
un peacekeepers to the region 
a warm round of applause and handshaking after the vote was a 
departure from the usual decorum of the council chamber 
this decision sets in motion the process of transition of 
namibia toward independence through free and fair elections under 
the supervision and control of the united nations said ambassador 
jai pratap rana of nepal council president for february 
the decision also marks the last major step toward 
decolonization we look forward to welcoming namibia as a fellow 
member of this family of nations before long 
april 1 was set as the date to begin the oneyear plan for 
namibias transition to a nation ruled by its black majority the 
resolution adopted by the 15member council implements an 
independence plan for the territory also known as southwest 
africa that has been ready since 1978 
approved along with the resolution was a recent report by 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on implementation that 
calls for sending 4650 un peacekeepers 500 police supervisors 
and at least 1000 civilian election monitors to namibia 
which countries will provide personnel for the peacekeeping force 
has not yet been decided but china has offered to send up to 20 
election monitors as its first participation in such an effort an 
asian diplomat said 
the namibian independence mission will be called the un 
transition assistance group or untag 
martti ahtisaari secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellars 
special representative for namibia said steven fanning head of the 
untags police unit was expected in namibia on friday for talks 
with gen dolf gouws the territorial police commissioner 
namibias police will continue to be responsible for civil order 
supervised by the un police 
gen dewan prem chand the untag military commander is to arrive 
early next week with civilian civilian administrators ahtisaari 
added 
perez de cuellar has estimated untag will cost 416 million in 
its first year that would make it the most expensive un 
peacekeeping mission since the belgian congo operation of 196064 
which cost more than 400 million and involved 19828 soldiers at 
its peak 
also thursday the general assembly approved funds for a 70man 
team of un military observers to monitor the withdrawal of 50000 
cuban troops from neighboring angola as namibia becomes independent 
that group the un angola verification mission was budgeted at 
92 million for this year and 194 million over the 31 months of 
the cuban withdrawal 
dante caputo the argentine foreign minister and assembly 
president said the general assembly probably would meet next week 
to approve funds for untag 
south africa captured southwest africa from germany in 1915 
during world war i and was given a league of nations mandate in 
1920 the general assembly abrogated the mandate in 1966 but south 
africa had refused to leave 
the stage was set in december when south africa cuba and angola 
signed accords at un headquarters pledging them to a peace plan 
for southwest africa combining namibian independence with the cuban 
withdrawal from angola 
cuban troops have helped angolas marxist government defend 
against usbacked rebels and incursions by south african troops 
pursuing guerrillas of the southwest africa peoples organization 
under the peace accords half the 50000 cuban soldiers will have 
withdrawn by nov 1 when namibia is scheduled to hold elections for 
a constituent assembly independence is envisaged in april 1990

sporadic exchanges of artillery and 
machinegun fire thursday threatened to undermine a ceasefire that 
halted 22 hours of fighting between the army and christian 
militiamen for control of the christian heartland 
police said 66 people were killed and 200 wounded in the 
fighting which pitted the divided armys christian units against 
the lebanese forces the main christian militia in the nearly 
14yearold civil war against the moslems 
the army command and the lebanese forces said in separate 
announcements that an agreement was reached for both sides to pull 
back at all confrontation points to facilitate movement of people 
and civilian traffic 
but neither side said whether the withdrawals actually took place 
fighters on both sides took advantage of the ceasefire starting 
wednesday evening to fortify frontline positions northeast of the 
capitals christian sector with sandbags and earthmounds raising 
fears that a new round of hostilities was imminent 
police said regular troops and lebanese forces militiamen dueled 
intermittently with howitzers and machine guns in beiruts christian 
ein rummaneh district and the northern suburbs of tabarja adma and 
antelias 
the thud of exploding shells echoed across the capital which has 
been split into moslem and christian sectors since the outbreak of 
the civil war in 1975 
a military source said army commander gen michel aoun accepted 
the ceasefire on condition that the lebanese forces pull out from 
east beirut streets and from government facilities they control 
the fighting has irrevocably shattered the unity of the christian 
camp it has involved mostly maronite catholics the 850000strong 
group that has dominated power since lebanons independence from 
france in 1943 
also thursday a us embassy official denied christian radio 
reports that ambassador john mccarthy has decided to evacuate the 
embassys estimated 20 american staffers to cyprus 
there are no plans for us to leave the official said on 
condition of anonymity 
he said a couple of shells crashed about 200 yards from the us 
embassy compound in the aukur suburb of east beirut but that none 
of the american employees was hurt 
window glass of the compound housing the diplomatic and consular 
missions was totally shattered and both sections remained closed 
for the second straight day he said 
the police spokesman said aouns 20000 troops have captured all 
militia positions in lebanons central mountain range but failed to 
block militia supply lines 
aouns troops now control about 75 percent of the christian 
enclave covering 310 square miles north and northeast of beirut the 
spokesman said 
but lebanese forces militiamen led by samir geagea still control 
the main urban centers along the enclaves 25mile mediterranean 
coastline he added the enclave is home for 1 million christians 
aoun who heads the christian cabinet in lebanons dual 
government has been staying at his command headquarters in yarze 
east of beirut since the fighting broke out 
the 53year old general who seeks to become lebanons next 
president was named head of a caretaker military cabinet by 
outgoing president amin gemayel sept 22 after parliament failed to 
elect his successor 
in another development an american woman was shot in the head 
and killed while driving her car in north lebanon one of her 
friends said 
gail pascoe harfoush 38 a native of washington dc was 
killed wednesday afternoon as she drove her mercedesbenz from 
tripoli to the village of burj akkar 25 miles away said her 
friend marilyn rashka

some moose are spending lots of 
time on the town these days 
with the thief river frozen over the animals use it as a highway 
to steal into this northwestern minnesota town where they wander 
down residential streets dine on hedges and apple trees and often 
get their pictures taken 
everybody seems to enjoy them other than they like to get them 
out of their yards said police officer tim miller 
usually they go back home to the woods after police herd them to 
the edge of town by slowly driving alongside maybe yelling honking 
or sounding the siren 
but these days three persistent moose just arent taking hints 
so officers have taken to firing exploding shells to frighten them 
we chase them out and they just come back said miller who 
has chased off the cow and her calves three times in a week 
one reason the moose come to town observers say is that its a 
lot easier to move around than in the woods where the snow these 
days is moosebellydeep

this hollywood is none too happy with 
efforts by tinseltown on the pacific coast to take control of the 
city name 
city commissioners in florida saw stars not the movie variety 
when they learned the name could become the exclusive property of 
hollywood calif 
it seems the chamber of commerce of hollywood calif actually 
a district of los angeles filed last month for a trademark on the 
name 
we dont believe we should have to get their permission to use 
our own citys name mayor mara giulianti said we are a duly 
incorporated city and they arent even a city 
if granted the trademark would apply throughout the united 
states for any commercial use of the name hollywood although an 
exception would be made for the area within the city limits of 
hollywood fla 
thats not good enough city manager irv rosenbaum said 
we market tourism nationally he said were the eighth 
largest city in the state we should be able to use our name 
wherever 
at least seven other hollywoods in alabama louisiana 
maryland missouri new mexico south carolina and west virginia 
would face the same problem giulianti said 
in 1987 the same chamber of commerce lost a battle for exclusive 
rights to the name when the us patent and trademark office decided 
the name did not belong exclusively to hollywood calif 
the california group changed its application to allow hollywood 
fla to use the name commercially within the citys limits but the 
californians want control over the name for the rest of the country 
hollywood fla plans to fight the trademark application

president bush said thursday he wants rebel 
forces in nicaragua to continue receiving humanitarian aid and 
declared we have to be wary about promises by leftist president 
daniel ortega to hold fair elections 
in his first comments on an agreement by five central american 
countries to disarm the nicaraguan guerrillas bush acknowledged the 
united states had been caught off guard by the pact signed tuesday 
and said there are some positive elements to it and there are 
some troublesome elements to it 
bush on another foreign policy matter said he hoped that 
afghanistan with the departure of soviet troops could fashion a 
stable broadly based government without bloodshed among competing 
guerrilla groups 
the time for bloodbaths is over and i would like to see the 
various factions get together and come up with recommendations that 
would lead to a peaceful afghanistan with no more bloodbaths bush 
said 
he refused to endorse a soviet proposal for an immediate 
ceasefire in afghanistan and an embargo on arms shipments to the 
country expressing concern that moscow may have stockpiled weapons 
there for the marxist government 
it would not be fair to have a tremendous amount of lethal 
supplies left behind and then cut off support for the resistance and 
thus leave an unacceptable imbalance bush said 
he made his remarks in a wideranging questionandanswer session 
with eight reporters who were invited into the oval office sitting 
in a wing chair in front of a slowburning fire bush also made 
these points 
he would strongly oppose any attempt to outlaw all 
semiautomatic weapons if that would mean outlawing all pistols and 
rifles that could be fired continuously by repeatedly pulling the 
trigger the weapons are popular among drug gangs and one was used 
in the massacre of five children in a stockton calif schoolyard 
last month 
a lifetime member of the national rifle association the nations 
biggest gun lobby bush said im not about to suggest that a 
semiautomated hunting rifle be banned 
he considers budget negotiations a twoway street with 
congress and said he was not trying to shift to lawmakers the 
responsibility for proposing unpopular cuts bush said he was 
pleased so far with congressional reaction to his 116 trillion 
spending plan for fiscal 1990 
he wants to avoid a dispute with federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan over interest rates because we arent far apart the 
fed has nudged up shortterm interest rates in recent months as a 
precaution against inflation bush said he did not think 
inflationary pressures in the economy warrant substantially higher 
interest rates 
he is concerned about the slow pace of personnel appointments 
for his administration but said i dont think its hurting the 
government he blamed delays on tougher rules governing the 
disclosure of assets 
he said he hopes his campaign for high ethical standards in 
government has not created something that just carries things too 
far 
he expressed sympathy for louis sullivan his nominee as 
secretary of health and human services who gave up accumulated 
sabbatical pay to join the government bush also said secretary of 
state james a baker iii had made the right decision to sell 
stocks in a new york bank holding company that holds thirdworld 
loans 
bush said we are far closer to west germany than public 
perceptions might be after chancellor helmut kohl said a decision 
could be put off until 1991 on modernizing battlefield nuclear 
weapons in europe the united states and britain are urging nato to 
support the modernization

border outposts to check the flow of us and pakistani arms to 
afghan rebels 
but he declined to say whether the us supply of arms to the 
rebels violates the april 14 agreement signed in geneva that 
resulted in the soviet troop withdrawal

be unable to prevent kabul and other major afghan cities from being 
taken by moslem guerrilla forces now that the soviet forces are gone 
leaders of afghan guerrilla factions based in neighboring 
pakistan and iran are meeting here to try and reach a consensus on

makers of foam plastic containers widely used 
by fastfood restaurants have stopped using cfcs which contribute to 
destruction of the worlds ozone layer a trade group said thursday 
it said makers of the food and beverage containers no longer use 
fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs as an expanding 
agent during the manufacturing process 
when cfcs reach the stratosphere they break down the ozone layer 
that protects the earth from ultraviolet rays increased exposure to 
this solar radiation is known to cause skin cancer 
an international agreement has called for cutting the production 
of cfcs by 50 percent by the end of the century and some of the 
leading manufacturers have said they intend to phase out production 
of cfcs entirely although no timetable has been set 
cfcs are most widely used in refrigeration and airconditionining 
systems their use as an expanding agent in manufacturing food and 
beverage containers always has been small accounting for less than 
3 percent of all cfcs produced 
but david dull whose office at the environmental protection 
agency monitors cfc use said elimination of cfcs from food service 
containers is significant because it represents the first time an 
entire industry has stopped using the chemicl 
what were applauding is a process the beginning of a 
process dull said at a news conference held by the polystyrene 
packaging council and the foodservice amp packaging institute 
he said the phaseout of cfcs in the making of polystyrene food 
containers is proof that american industry can develop 
inexpensive technological alternatives to cfcs 
recently the polyurethane foam association also announced plans 
to phase out the use of cfcs in making foam cushioning he said 
joseph bow president of the foodservice amp packaging institute 
said the makers of the fastfood containers have replaced cfcs in 
the production of polystyrene with another chemical that poses a 
significantly lesser threat to the ozone layer because it breaks up 
at a much lower altitude 
we realize this replacement product too has some ozone 
depleting potential he said adding that the industry is 
searching for another agent that poses no such threat at all

the supreme court lifted its stay delaying the 
start of oliver norths trial thursday but norths lawyers 
complained he cannot get a fair trial under a deal struck by his 
prosecutor and the attorney general for handling testimony involving 
national secrets 
defendant north still faces two governments rather than a 
single prosecutor with full power to make all trial decisions 
said brendan sullivan the head of norths defense team in papers 
filed with us district judge gerhard a gesell 
the supreme court meanwhile lifted a stay that had been 
requested by attorney general dick thornburgh while he was still 
arguing with independent counsel lawrence walsh over whether rules 
on disclosing classified information were tight enough 
there was no word from gesell when he would summon jurors who 
are already selected to his court to begin the trial of the former 
marine lieutenant colonel and white house aide however a meeting 
was scheduled in gesells courtroom friday meaning the jury would 
not be empaneled until tuesday at the earliest after the 
washingtons birthday holiday observance 
the newest thornburghwalsh arrangement would impose 
intolerable burdens on the court the witnesses and the jurors 
sullivan said he asked gesell to tell the attorney general he can 
take action to dismiss the entire case or any of the 12 criminal 
charges but that he will not have the right or the opportunity to 
intervene in the trial 
sullivan recalled that gesell had said earlier in the week that 
thornburgh would have no right to intervene by bits and pieces 
to object to the introduction of classified material but sullivan 
said the new arrangement does give thornburgh that ability 
under the arrangement announced wednesday walsh agreed to ask 
thornburgh for an affidavit whenever walsh believed undisclosable 
secrets were about to be spilled in the trial the attorney general 
would stay out of the courtroom while the independent counsel 
carried the battle 
under the independent counsels proposed plan said sullivan 
the attorney general will have the right to step in whenever the 
going gets tough precisely what the court has forbidden him from 
doing 
in response walsh said norths lawyer is under a misconception 
of how the prosecutorial plan will work 
the daytoday conduct of this case will be by the independent 
counsel and only the independent counsel he said he likened his 
relationship with the justice department to that of a lawyer who 
checks with his client to find out whether some supervening policy 
requires a termination of the litigation 
sullivan said the new arrangement would guarantee frequent 
interruptions as challenges are made and resolved 
this procedure will recur constantly during the trial 
possibly even questionbyquestion for a critical witness he 
said defendant north cannot receive a fair trial if the attorney 
general is permitted to intervene in the trial through bits and 
pieces of affidavit as the independent counsels plan contemplates 
gesell and lawyers in the case held a closed hearing lasting 
more than two hours to discuss what the jury can be told about 
secret reagan administration efforts to get help from other 
countries for the contras fighting the leftist nicaraguan government 
lawyers would not say what happened at the hearing only that the 
same subject matter will be discussed at another closed session 
friday morning they said gesell had not issued any orders and shook 
their heads when asked when opening arguments might be held 
sullivan says the quid pro quo arrangements literally 
somethingforsomething are at the heart of the case the 
government is willing to make limited disclosures about the matter 
but norths lawyers want to explore the schemes in greater detail at 
his trial 
in nearly three weeks the north trial has not progressed beyond 
picking a jury of nine women and three men the jurors who have not 
yet been sworn have been excused while a highstakes legal drama 
over national security matters has been played out in gesells 
courtroom the us court of appeals and the supreme court 
north is accused of shredding evidence and lying to congress to 
cover up the reagan administrations attempts to help the rebels 
during a period in which congress had banned direct us aid 
he faces 12 criminal charges

the justice department is planning to set up a 
tentcity detention center where it will hold central american 
refugees while their applications for political asylum are 
processed congressional officials said thursday 
rep lamar smith rtexas said in a statement the tent city on 
isolated brushland 15 miles from the usmexico border would meet 
basic human necessities adequate housing food and sanitary 
conditions 
but duke austin a spokesman for the immigration and 
naturalization service said no course of action has been set in 
stone and the issue is still under review by ins and attorney 
general dick thornburgh who has already said detention is an option 
justice department sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the idea of a tent city is one option under consideration but 
one source indicated it may not be the preferred option saying 
nobody wants tent cities 
more than 2000 refugees a week are entering the united states 
from central america and most of them do so by crossing the rio 
grande river near brownsville texas officials say 
the plans call for keeping the refugees in tents near the port 
isabel service processing center where ins is processing their 
asylum applications the congressional officials said 
but smith and two congressional aides who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the tents would have plywood floors and food would 
be provided by contractors no fences would surround the tents they 
said 
one congressional aide said the justice department policy will 
begin after us district judge filemon vela is expected to 
reinstate an ins policy that bars asylumseekers from traveling 
beyond the rio grande valley while their applications are pending 
vela is supposed to rule in the case tuesday and austin said the 
ins would discuss its plans for handling the refugees at the court 
hearing but not before 
before vela blocked the ins notravel policy jan 9 central 
americans who had crossed the rio grande illegally were forced to 
live in shanty town conditions camped out beneath plastic sheets 
in open fields or condemned buildings 
ins officials contend many people seeking asylum are here only to 
better themselves economically and use the asylum process and 
lengthy appeals to get into the united states political asylum is 
granted only to those fleeing persecution for political or other 
reasons

secretary of state james a baker iii told west 
european leaders thursday the time is not right to push for 
negotiations between israel and the arabs a senior us official 
said 
baker promised however to have american diplomats pursue 
prospects with the plo israel and arab states and report the 
results in three weeks the official said 
one has to till the ground carefully one has to proceed 
cautiously and understand that if you push the level of discussion 
too high too soon and create too much international attention you 
might preempt opportunities baker was quoted as telling the dutch 
foreign minster hans van den broek at the hague 
the us official briefing reporters on condition of anonymity 
said van den broek gave baker a brief account of findings by the 
french greek and spanish foreign ministers whom the 12nation 
european economic community appointed to explore middle east peace 
prospects 
they visited israel egypt jordan and syria earlier this month 
and also met with plo representatives the us official said they 
found areas of potential progress and also obstacles but he 
provided no details 
bakers cautious response indicated the bush administration was 
not eager to plunge into the middle eastern thicket despite its 
contacts with the palestine liberation organization 
his assurance that the plo would be sounded out also seemed to 
rule out a suspension of the 3monthold dialogue despite us 
irritation over a clash between palestinian guerrillas and israeli 
forces in southern lebanon 
five guerrillas were slain in what israel said was an attempted 
infiltration of israel and an act of terrorism the united states 
opened talks with the plo in december only after its leader yasser 
arafat made a public statement renouncing terrorism 
the us official said baker would report results of the us 
soundings on the middle east at the opening of arms control 
negotiations between nato and the warsaw pact in vienna on march 7 
all the western foreign ministers are expected to attend 
baker also met with manfred woerner secretarygeneral of the 
north atlantic treaty organization as he neared the end of an 
eightday trip to 15 allied countries 
he is exploring their views on foreign policy and defense before 
president bush decides how to deal with soviet arms reduction 
proposals that have raised hopes of disarmament by west europeans 
and unsettled their leaders 
us officials said baker was finding an ironic situation 
that president mikhail s gorbachevs proposals were largely 
inspired by the united states but the west european public was 
giving the soviet leader much of the credit 
although baker gave four news conferences on the first four days 
of the trip he has kept reporters at a distance since and sid 
little 
the secretary of state began the day in brussels meeting with 
prime minister wilfried martens and foreign minister leo tindemans 
of belgium and then with woerner at nato headquarters 
he visited luxembourg and the netherlands during the day and 
returned to brussels baker will fly back to washington on friday 
after a visit to france

four candidates to succeed william bradford 
reynolds as the justice departments civil rights chief would change 
his controversial policies according to one of those being 
considered for the job 
everyone on the list would turn it around said one of the 
candidates who knows the others and spoke on condition he not be 
identified 
without discussing specific issues president bush has said he 
wants to depart from the reagan administrations civil rights 
policies which included frontal attacks on existing affirmative 
action hiring quotas and school busing programs 
attorney general dick thornburgh also signaled a shift in 
policies by meeting with civil rights leaders including jesse 
jackson 
a top candidate for the job is evan kemp jr a disabledrights 
advocate who once called for reynolds resignation during a battle 
over proposed changes in regulations prohibiting discrimination 
against the handicapped according to administration sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
kemp who uses a wheelchair is a member of the equal employment 
opportunity commission he is considered the white houses choice to 
become assistant attorney general in charge of the justice 
departments civil rights division the sources said 
kemp said in an interview this week that white house counsel c 
boyden gray told him he was a top candidate for the job and his 
meeting tuesday with thornburgh did not dispel that impression 
also under consideration are daniel rinzel minority chief 
counsel for the senates permanent investigations subcommittee 
martin gerry former head of the office of civil rights in the 
department of health education and welfare and james p turner a 
career justice department official said the sources 
jackson emerging from his meeting last month with thornburgh 
praised the attorney generals commitment to civil rights and told 
reporters that the lights have been turned back on in the justice 
department 
david runkel an aide to the attorney general said were 
looking for someone whose views reflect thornburghs and the 
presidents views on the importance of the civil rights division 
were looking for somebody who can work with civil rights 
organizations runkel said noting thornburghs interest in the 
issue dating back to the 1960s 
reynolds clashed repeatedly with civil rights groups who accused 
him of trying to undercut the force of federal laws and court 
decisions affecting minority rights 
reynolds helped formulate and direct the reagan administrations 
challenges to minority hiring quotas he also spearheaded the 
efforts to overturn courtordered busing and restrict guarantees of 
the rights of women and the mentally ill 
without directly criticizing reynolds kemp said the republican 
partys failure to attract black voters last fall was due in part to 
the reagan administrations civil rights record 
i think its very important for the republican party to have a 
civil rights record they can run on and attract votes from groups 
covered by the civil rights laws 
while no decision is expected for at least another week kemp 
is certainly a leading candidate said one administation source 
the appointment will be made by bush on thornburghs 
recommendation and is subject to senate confirmation 
rinzel is a former career justice department lawyer who headed 
the criminal section of the civil rights division setting records 
for prosecutions he was promoted to a deputy assistant attorney 
general by reynolds 
turner the acting civil rights chief was a government civil 
rights lawyer in the 1960s when violence flared in such places as 
selma ala and jackson miss he prosecuted civil rights violators 
in the south during this period 
gerry has served as counsel to the wednesday group of house 
moderate republicans 
without commenting on specific individuals washington civil 
rights lawyer william taylor said at least some of the candidates 
who are being considered seem to have some experience and some have 
a record of favoring civil rights 
if one of those candidates is named it will be a refreshing 
change from the previous eight years said taylor who heads the 
enforcement committee of the leadership conference on civil rights

the first fullfledged opposition 
party in yugoslavia since the communist takeover after world war ii 
was established on thursday despite a police threat to ban the 
party if it stayed independent 
about 1000 people jammed into the downtown cankarjev dom 
convention hall in this slovenian capital to hear party leader 
france tomsic proclaim the founding of the socialist democratic 
union of slovenia 
he told the founding convention the party would strive for 
parliamentary democracy and free elections and intends to compete 
for parliamentary representation with the league of communists the 
only legal party here since 1946 prominent intellectuals from 
slovenia were among those attending 
the party published its program in wednesdays issue of the 
liberal mladina youth weekly saying it will strive for a peaceful 
transition from the countrys singleparty communist system to a 
system based on westernstyle parliamentary democracy 
his audience on thursday loudly applauded tomsics appeal for 
slovenia to seek closer ties with west europe and its social 
democratic parties 
this convention is important because after nearly 50 years an 
alternative independent political party is being formed in 
yugoslavia tomsic said 
he said earlier in an interview with the associated press as a 
political organization we will try to fill the vacuum created by the 
loss of trust in the communist party 
at the entrance party aides distributed party literature and 
application forms 
the party program called for parliamentary democracy an 
independent judiciary private initiative independent unions and 
legalization of strikes it said the slovenian republic and all of 
yugoslavia should link up with the west european political 
technological and cultural integration process 
it demanded abolition of military courts 
tomsic said slovenian recruits should be allowed to do their 
military service in slovenia and that slovene should become an 
official language in the army where only serbocroatian is now 
spoken 
tomsic told the ap earlier europes history has shown that 
social democracy had done much more for the people than the 
communists 
he said the party would be independent 
a short time later tomsic was summoned to police where he was 
told that both the party and the convention would be banned unless 
his group joined the socialist alliance a communistled mass 
organization comprising all social and political groups 
the convention went on as planned however 
asked if his group would join the umbrella organization tomsic 
said the statute of the socialist alliance of slovenia is 
scheduled to be changed in april and according to the proposed 
changes the communist party will not retain the leading role in it 
if that happens we will join the socialist alliance 
a recent survey conducted by mladina said that if free elections 
were conducted immediately in slovenia the social democrats would 
get 35 percent of the vote and the communist party only 9 percent 
the rest of the votes went to groups now exiting only in the 
imagination such as christian democrats greens and liberals 
yugoslavia with a population exceeding 22 million is a 
patchwork of six republics and two autonomous provinces josip broz 
tito led yugoslavia into the communist camp in november 1945 but 
this country broke from the soviet orbit in 1948 and has since been 
nonaligned 
last jan 11 the first autonomous political group in yugoslavia 
the slovenian democratic union was formed in ljubljana but it 
agreed to operate within the framework of the socialist alliance 
prominent intellectuals have called for the introduction of a 
multiparty democracy here saying it would be the only way out of 
yugoslavias deep economic and political crisis

president bush said thursday he will strongly 
oppose any attempt to outlaw semiautomatic guns despite 
increasing homicides and the use of such a weapon in a california 
rampage that left five children dead 
his declaration put him at odds with his wife barbara who told 
the associated press feb 3 she is afraid of guns and absolutely 
believes that assaultstyle weapons should be outlawed 
spurning pleas for tougher controls bush said no im not 
about to do that and i think the answer is the criminal do more 
with the criminal 
bush a lifetime member of the national rifle association the 
nations chief gun lobby said states have a lot of laws on these 
things let them enforce them its hard very hard to do but 
thats my position and im not going to change it 
bush made his comments in an oval office interview with eight 
reporters 
he drew a distinction between automatic weapons which fire 
continuously by holding the trigger down and semiautomatic weapons 
which fire each time the trigger is pulled without cocking 
talking about semiautomatics bush said if youre suggesting 
that every pistol that can do that fire each time the trigger is 
pulled or every rifle should be banned i would strongly oppose 
that 
i would strongly go after the criminals who use these guns 
he said but im not about to suggest that a semiautomated 
hunting rifle be banned absolutely not 
the president said he learned just earlier in the day that fully 
automatic weapons are banned from import into the united states 
bush said he was concerned enormously by the rash of 
homicides in the district of columbia thirteen people were killed 
or wounded by gunfire in the city on tuesday making valentines day 
the bloodiest day in washington in memory 
when you let a guy out of jail to commit a crime like this 
its outrageous two of these people were people that already had 
have help bush said turning to his staff for information 
it was not clear which cases bush was talking about although a 
gunman who killed three coworkers in suburban chevy chase md 
before killing himself had been a patient in a mental hospital for 
two years before being released in 1986 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
administration did not have any plans now for tighter gun controls 
dozens of states as well as congress are considering measures 
to outlaw the manufacture sale or possession of a variety of 
semiautomatic weapons 
los angeles police chief daryl f gates an adviser to bush 
during the presidential campaign on drug abuse and crime has 
endorsed legislation to limit the sale and import of assault weapons 
the los angeles city council has banned the sale of semiautomatic 
weapons but has delayed its order for a week in connection with a 
suit filed by colt industries inc challenging the law 
before the interview bushs position on guns was outlined during 
a white house briefing even as the districts homicide toll reached 
75 following a record 372 homicides in 1988 
everyone in the country including the president is outraged 
by the homicides whether it be in washington dc or california or 
anywhere else fitzwater said 
there are any number of appropriate solutions to this kind of 
problems the most obvious is for stepped up law enforcement but i 
know that everyone shares those concerns the press spokesman said 
it does pose a major challenge to the law enforcement community 
in this country and there are a lot of ways you can come at that but 
we dont have any comment on specific episodes fitzwater added 
it was a chinese ak47 assault rifle that a gunman used in a 
rampage last month in stockton calif in which five children were 
killed and 29 others were wounded 
the issue of assault weapons and ak47s and so forth is an 
important one that has emerged in these recent episodes and one that 
probably needs to be looked at in fact is being looked at by any 
number of state authorities as well as public interest groups who 
are involved in this the white house spokesman said 
fitzwater said bush has concerns about these items were 
simply saying that we dont have any proposals for changing gun 
control laws at this point but on the other hand it is worthwhile 
for a consideration of these new weapons and what do they mean for 
society and should there be any changes

bernhard was most recently in the headlines over the vienna 
production last fall of his play heldenplatz which caused a 
furor with its outspoken criticism of antisemitism president kurt 
waldheim and other politicians and institutions in austria 
the playwright was found dead in his house in the town of 
gmunden 80 miles west of vienna sunday morning three days after 
his 58th birthday the police spokesman told the associated press 
he declined to say why it had taken four days to announce the 
death but the austria press agency later reported it was bernhards 
wish to be buried before his death was announced 
bernhards halfbrother peter fabjan disclosed the playwrights 
last wish after a brief funeral today the news agency said 
barnhard had suffered for the past 40 years from a lung condition 
that austrian radio said required regular treatment with cortisone 
born on feb 9 1931 in the netherlands bernhard was the 
illegitimate child of a salzburg woman and a peasant father whom he 
never knew 
he grew up in vienna the austrian countryside and southern 
bavaria before being sent in his early teens to a home in salzburg 
leaving school early to become a grocers apprentice bernhard 
was hospitalized for months at a time with severe lung complaints 
from 1948 to 1951 in 1955 he entered salzburgs famed mozarteum to 
study acting and music and in 1957 published his first volume of 
poetry 
publication of several novels short stories and more poetry 
followed winning an increasing series of awards for the man whom 
prominent west german critic marcel reichranicki termed the most 
melancholy poet and most bitter prophet of german literature 
his plays often directed by the current controversial director 
of viennas burgtheater claus peymann were a continual subject of 
controversy in vienna and salzburg 
in 1976 for instance his play the famous opened in vienna 
after being rejected by the salzburg festival because of its 
criticism of prominent salzburg cultural figures 
peymanns production of heldenplatz at the burgtheater last 
fall also sparked a raging controversy over whether state money 
should be used to subsidize art so critical of austria 
many vienna critics however praised the play and its 
performance

a conservative episcopal group on thursday renewed 
efforts to muster resistance to female priests with a fullpage 
newspaper ad less than a week after the 450yearold church ordained 
its first woman bishop 
episcopalians do something trumpeted the advertisement in 
the boston herald a daily newspaper in the diocese that consecrated 
bishop barbara c harris 
sponsors said the ads will run elsewhere in the country this 
spring boston was as logical a place as any to begin said 
canon brien koehler of the fort worth texasbased evangelical and 
catholic mission which is behind the ad campaign 
koehler said it is unlikely the episcopal church will reverse its 
10year policy of allowing women into the priesthood he said a 
synod or council the mission is organizing to be held this june is 
intended to find a way to allow ourselves to live and breathe 
within the episcopal church whether the official channels of the 
episcopal church will tolerate that i think thats really a great 
question right now 
the ad asks readers to sign and return to the group a 
declaration of common faith and purpose 
koehler said mission members believe that biblical teachings 
portray the church as a family with the man or husband as the head 
those are strong bible images that we really think cant be 
overturned he said it really has nothing to do with equal 
rights 
it was the latest note of discord since harris was elected last 
september a position that gave her entry into an apostolic 
succession the church traces back to the time of jesus 
at harris consecration as suffragan or assistant bishop two 
men spoke against the ordination including one who termed it 
sacrilege but the congregation of about 8000 roared its approval 
when asked if it was their will that she be ordained 
the 58yearold black episcopal priest from philadelphia had been 
criticized for being a woman being divorced lacking formal 
seminary degrees and having served as publisher of the liberal 
episcopal publication the witness 
byron rushing an episcopalian and state representative who is a 
friend of harris said the advertisement wasnt a surprise 
this organization has been beating up on the episcopal church 
publishing co and beat up on barbara when she was executive 
director of that company he said 
officials of the 96000member episcopal diocese of massachusetts 
said they had no comment on the ad spokesman jim solheim also said 
harris was aware of the ad and had no comment 
at a news conference after her election was formally approved by 
episcopal bishops around the country harris acknowledged that some 
church members would have difficulty with her role but said she did 
not believe a schism would result 
diane spence director of development at the episcopal divinity 
school in cambridge said she also doubted schism will ensue she 
said the ad was a way for the opponents of ordaining women to fly 
their flag 
i think that were going to find a way to work together and 
keep the dialogue going she said

president bush said thursday he hopes the final 
pullout of soviet armed forces from afghanistan ensures no more 
bloodbaths there and said the kremlin bears a special 
responsibility for healing the wounds of the war 
while applauding the troop withdrawal as a new chapter in the 
history of afghanistan bush rejected a kremlin call for an 
immediate ceasefire and arms embargo 
answering questions from a group of reporters in the oval office 
he said he was afraid rebels opposing the sovietbacked kabul 
government would be left in a disadvantageous position if us 
assistance stopped 
just hours before bush talked to reporters the secondranking 
official at the soviet embassy in washington had reiterated the 
kremlins call for a ceasefire 
ministercounselor yevgeny kutovoy said that a comprehensive 
settlement of the strife in afghanistan depends for the most part on 
a broadly based government with the participation of all warring 
parties and without outside interference 
bush demanded the soviets stay out of afghan affairs 
the soviet union has nothing to fear from the establishment of 
an independent nonaligned afghanistan he said in a written 
statement at the same time the ussr bears a special 
responsibility for healing the wounds of this war and we call upon 
it to support generously international efforts to rebuild 
afghanistan 
bushs comments came a day after the final pullout of red army 
forces from afghanistan after a nineyear occupation 
bush said he could not endorse the ceasefire and arms embargo 
proposal because he was concerned soviet forces may have stockpiled 
weapons for the marxist government in kabul 
it would not be fair to have a tremendous amount of lethal 
supplies left behind and then cut off support for the resistance and 
thus leave an uacceptable imbalance he said 
state department spokesman charles redman said there has been 
massive stockpiling by the soviets in recent months supplies 
provided to the kabul regime include numerous fighter aircraft and 
helicopters dozens of medium tanks infantry fighting vehicles 
armored personnel carriers more than 200 howitzers and scores of 
other artillery pieces and hundreds of transport vehicles 
in the final days of the withdrawal they left behind even more 
military equipment including tanks apcs and multiple rocket 
launchers he said 
bush said the us commitment to the afghan people will remain 
firm both through our bilateral humanitarian program and through 
the united nations efforts to remove the mines and resettle the 
refugees and help reconstruct the wartorn economy 
there are widespread fears that a struggle for control by 
competing guerrilla groups could throw afghanistan into a civil war 
the time for recrimination is over bush said the time for 
bloodbaths is over and i would like to see the various factions get 
together and come up with recommendations that would lead to a 
peaceful afghanistan with no more bloodbaths 
during the soviet embassy news conference kutovoy said the 
question at stake at the present time is this either restoration of 
peace on the afghan soil or continuation of senseless bloodshed 
the issues of humanitarian and economic assistance to 
afghanistan are of evergrowing significance at this crucial 
stage he said 
but the soviet official also said when certain elements of the 
afghan opposition are trying to intensify pressure on the current 
afghan government resorting to barbaric methods and to all 
different kinds of diversions to the blockade of afghan cities 
they are trying to prevent the civilian population from getting food 
and consumer goods 
it is our first belief that all the states should do their best 
to preserve afghanistan as a sovereign neutral and nonaligned 
state he said

democratic aides on a house committee said in a 
report thursday that the education departments civil rights office 
is beset by mismanagement confusion and understaffing as a legacy 
of the reagan administration 
the investigation of office of civil rights enforcement 
activities by democratic staff at the education and labor 
committee concluded that since 1981 the office has been stymied 
by an administration which actively opposed the laws which were 
entrusted to it and took efforts to minimize the agencys potential 
impact 
the report said the administration had severely worsened this 
agencys enforcement record and said any enforcement that did 
occur came from the regional staff in spite of ocrs leadership 
in washington 
the departments office of civil rights is in charge of enforcing 
statutes barring discrimination on the basis of race gender 
handicap age and national origin in all federally funded education 
activities and programs 
the current director of the agency legree daniels is a holdover 
from the reagan administration in a letter published with the 
report she denounced it as replete with inaccuracies and 
misconceptions of ocrs role 
she accused the committee staff of misrepresenting her agencys 
investigative and enforcement procedures distorting statistical 
evidence and drawing unsubstantiated conclusions she defended the 
agencys emphasis on negotiations calling them an effective 
legally supportable practice that has averted the need for 
protracted enforcement proceedings in many cases 
democratic committee aides visited six of the 10 office of civil 
rights regional offices between january and march 1988 among their 
findings according to the report 
the agency initiated 9768 complaint investigations between 
fiscal 1981 and 1988 most of them related to handicap 
discrimination fifteen percent involved racial discrimination a 
percentage the report said was a violation of its mandate since 
the office was created as a result of the 1964 civil rights act 
the number of fulltime equivalent employees at the office of 
civil rights has dropped from 1099 in fiscal 1981 to 820 in fiscal 
1988 reagan administration budget requests for the agency declined 
from 51 million in 1982 to 41 million in 1989 
the supreme courts grove city decision prompted the agency to 
close in whole or in part 674 complaint investigations and 88 
compliance reviews the decision said only specific activities or 
programs receiving federal money were subject to federal oversight 
the administration forced the agency to process state 
highereducation desegregation cases under court oversight in 105 
days rather than the 195 days recommended by the federal court 
cases were withdrawn or narrowed to accomplish this 
there was a clear perception among the regional office staff 
that certain issues were off limits and could not be investigated 
most of the issues involved race discrimination 
letters of findings citing schools for civil rights violations 
must be approved by the washington office of 112 draft letters 
submitted from january 1987 to june 1988 only seven were approved 
while most were resolved with a notation violation corrected 
little followup monitoring was done to assure actual compliance by 
school districts and universities 
the committee staff recommended among other things that the 
agency conduct more broad compliance reviews of systemic 
discrimination issues particularly on race the report said the 
agencys staff should be restored as quickly as possible to the 1981 
level and said the agency should submit staff computer and 
equipment needs to congress in time for fiscal 1990 budget 
consideration

president bush will meet next week with israeli 
president chaim herzog in japan at the funeral of emperor hirohito 
american and israeli sources said thursday 
bush is also expected to meet in tokyo with jordans king hussein 
and egyptian president hosni mubarak french president francois 
mitterrand and other world leaders us officials say 
the meeting with herzog is expected to be one of ceremony rather 
than substance since herzogs role as head of state is largely 
cermonial us officials expect the meetings with the other mideast 
leaders will also be more in the nature of getacquainted talks than 
serious discussions due to a lack of time 
bush will be host to israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir at the 
white house in april for talks about the future of the middle east 
peace process a us official said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
in preparation for those talks israeli foreign minister moshe 
arens will meet in the second week of march with secretary of state 
james a baker iii said the us officials 
arens had sought an earlier meeting with baker while on a 
threeday visit to london this week but was told that bakers 
schedule during his swing through nato capitals was too hectic to 
accommodate him israeli sources said speaking on condition they 
not be named 
the bush administration has yet to formulate its position toward 
future arabisraeli peace talks and is still evaluating the latest 
developments in the region 
among these is the new us opening to the palestine liberation 
organization after a 13year ban on contacts with the group bush 
and baker have both expressed caution about the ties to the plo 
saying it is too soon to tell whether the group is a serious 
candidate for peace talks 
israel has been urging the new administration to cut off the 
talks saying the group has not changed its antiisrael agenda 
despite a pledge to give up terrorism 
both jordan and egypt are hoping the new administration will 
bring a fresh approach to the 40yearold arabisraeli conflict but 
baker appears reluctant to rush into the search for a solution which 
eluded his predecessor george shultz 
us officials say bush will not make any decisions until after 
he meets with the egyptian israeli and jordanian leaders mubarak 
is also expected in washington this spring

biologists trying to protect migrating fish said 
thursday the death of one of two captured sea lions wouldnt deter 
efforts to snare more of the fisheating mammals and return them to 
the ocean 
the 550pound animal had a weekold bullet wound in its neck and 
died after coming out from under anesthesia administered so wildlife 
agents could examine him and attach a radio transmitter 
the wound and an infestation of lung worms may have compromised 
his ability to withstand the anesthesia said bob delong a 
marine mammal biologist with the national marine fisheries service 
using anesthesia on the animal was one of the risks that went 
along with studying them he said 
delong said the wounded sea lion may have been shot by someone 
frustrated by the animals continued presence at the ballard locks 
which the migrating fish use from january until spring 
im afraid were going to see more and more shootings delong 
said 
about 20 sea lions which migrate from southern california and 
mexico have stopped at the locks to feast on salmon and steelhead 
trout migrating from the pacific ocean through puget sound to the 
fresh water lakes and rivers of western washington 
the other sea lion captured wednesday was taken 250 miles to the 
southwest washington coast where it was to be released thursday as 
agents tried to capture more sea lions 
the wounded sea lion had probably been shot near the locks which 
are in an urban area surrounded by docks and homes delong said 
delong said a 22caliber bullet wound was found lodged in the 
throat of the sea lion who was sick before he was trapped in the 
floating cage agents are using in the removal program called 
operation goodbye 
this is the fifth year officials have tried to keep a growing 
number of sea lions away from the locks protective nets tape 
recordings of killer whales firecrackers and foultasting chemicals 
have all proved ineffective 
delong said sea lions are protected from shooting by federal law 
and congress last year rejected an option to allow managers of the 
animals to use lethal methods to control them 
ben deeble of the environmental group greenpeace which has 
monitored the removal efforts and given tentative approval 
questioned whether it was necessary to anesthetize the animals 
he said he would support simply transporting the animals and 
marking them with paint rather than attaching radio transmitters in 
order to determine whether the removed sea lions return to the locks 
wildlife officials plan to capture at least a half dozen animals 
and haul them to the long beach peninsula then monitor their 
movement 
last year sea lions ate an estimated 1800 of the wild 
steelhead a seagoing rainbow trout favored by anglers and only 
about 850 of them made it back to their spawning gravel said bob 
byrne spokesman for the state department of wildlife 
this years run of steelhead was about 1650 at the fish ladder 
down from about 2600 last year officials said last month

house speaker jim wright on thursday called off 
until after president bushs trip to asia a planned floor vote on 
legislation that would require disclosure of foreign property 
ownership in this country 
wrights office said the white house indicated it hoped there 
would be no vote on the bill sponsored by rep john bryant dtexas 
until after bush returns from next weeks trip to japan china and 
korea 
the house had been set to vote next thursday on the bill which 
would require foreign owners of american property to provide 
information about their holdings to the government 
the measure began as part of the 1000page trade bill that 
became law last year but was dropped before that legislation 
received the presidents signature the administration and various 
business critics said it would stifle vitally needed foreign 
investment and hurt business in other ways 
bryant and other proponents say americans deserve to have more 
information about foreign ownership of property in the united states 
wrights office said the speaker telephoned bush on thursday 
afternoon from texas and offered to postpone the vote president 
bush expressed his appreciation the statement said 
it noted that the bill is similar to a measure passed twice by 
the house over the last two years most recently on oct 5 when it 
cleared on a 250170 bipartisan vote 
house minority leader robert h michel rill on wednesday was 
critical of the plan to vote on the measure next week saying in a 
letter to house rules committee chairman claude pepper dfla the 
first floor action on a highprofile bill in 1989 should not occur 
without committee consideration

the operator of the governments 
problemplagued nuclear weapons complex in south carolina said 
thursday it had discovered a break in an underground pipe that 
carries slightly radioactive waste water to a treatment plant 
ei du pont de nemours amp co said it temporarily reduced 
operations at the savannah river plant chemical separation facility 
while it replaced a 10foot section of the pipe and inspected other 
underground pipes of similar construction 
the company said the waste water that leaked from the broken pipe 
was high in acid content with minute amounts of radioactivity 
and posed no danger to workers or the environment 
joe odum chief supervisor with du ponts environment and energy 
department at savannah river said in a telephone interview that 
workers first detected a problem early this week when a liquid 
accumulation was noticed on the surface the leaking pipe is eight 
inches in diameter and is nine feet underground 
on wednesday it was determined that a small section of the pipe 
had broken off odum said adding that it was too early to estimate 
how long it would take to fix the problem 
the incident is the latest in a series of technical problems that 
have arisen at savannah river the site of three us energy 
department nuclear reactors that produce tritium a radioactive gas 
needed to make most nuclear weapons all three reactors are shut 
down because of safety and technical problems 
odum said the pipe leak had no direct affect on the 
tritiumproducing reactors 
the chemical separation plant at savannah river separates 
plutonium from used fuel rods from the reactors the plutonium is 
then shipped to the rocky flats plant at golden colo where it is 
shaped into triggers to be used on nuclear warheads 
once the plutonium is separated from the highlevel radioactive 
waste in the used fuel ods the liquid waste is taken to a tank farm 
at savannah river where some of the waste is evaporated the 
remaining water containing what du pont called minute amounts of 
radioactivity is then piped to an effluent treatment plant for 
further purification before it is discharged into streams 
the pipe that developed the leak was installed at savannah river 
during the 1950s and is made of terra cotta a thick hard 
potterylike material widely used in sewer lines at that time

a lithuanian political organization that claims 
more than 150000 members agreed to seek an independent path but 
stopped shy of calling for secession from the soviet union one of 
its leaders said thursday 
the action coincided with the anniversary of lithuanias original 
declaration of independence in 1918 hundreds of thousands of 
lithuanians turned out for two days of public celebrations which 
were greeted with police dogs and beatings just one year ago 
the vote late wednesday night by the national assembly of the 
grassroots group sajudis amounted to the strongest call yet out 
of the small baltic republic for control over its own affairs 
lithuania has been a part of the soviet union since it was annexed 
during world war ii 
small organizations in lithuania have demanded secession and 
speakers at public rallies have called for removal of the soviet 
army of occupation 
but sajudis membership has grown to 150000200000 in a 
population of 37 million in barely nine months it is backing 
candidates in virtually every electoral district of lithuania in the 
soviet unions first multiplecandidate elections for parliament 
the vote to strive for an independent path for lithuania 
passed the sajudis assembly by a vote of about 2048 with eight 
abstentions said alvydas medalinskas a spokesman for the group in 
a telephone interview from vilnius 
it means full political economic and legal sovereignty he 
said but we have many opinions on how to achieve this 
the declaration states sajudis will strive to create the 
conditions for free and democratic national selfdetermination 
according to a text released by a lithuanian emigre group in new 
york it also said lithuania should be a neutral state in a european 
demilitarized zone 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev rejected any possibility of 
lithuanian secession during a kremlin meeting with factory workers 
wednesday but his words were mild 
those who demand lithuania secede from the ussr are either 
people driven by personal or career ambitions or simply 
extremists he told km ashmonas of the shipyard in klaipeda 
lithuania according to thursdays newspaper reports 
they do not accept socialism at all and to expect that they 
would protect our value interests of workers and farmers is 
useless let us be calm but let us give them a calm rebuke 
perestroika has to help us sort out and solve many problems 
lithuanians gathered in cities and towns across the republic for 
independence celebrations marked by songs flowers a catholic mass 
at a cathedral and ceremonies at the national cemetery where heroes 
of the war of independence are buried 
a monument to freedom which had been removed after the soviet 
annexation was rededicated with a flourish of doves 
just one year ago celebrations of the anniversay ended when 
police beat hundreds of demonstrators with rubber truncheons this 
year the anniversary had government approval 
valdas analauskas a lithuanian activist and journalist 
estimated the crowds in kaunas at 100000 and in vilnius at 200000 
although medalinskas said celebrants at the vilnius rally numbered 
closer to 80000 
the head of the lithuanian communist party even put in a surprise 
appearance at the kaunas rally thursday morning analauskas said in 
a telephone interview algirdas brazauskas the party first 
secretary offered a short speech calling for unity 
medalinskas said sajudis action was similar to nearby estonias 
declaration of sovereignty but noted it was merely the vote of 
a grassroots organization and not a governmental action like the 
estonian constitutional amendments passed in november 
estonias parliament gave itself the right to overturn soviet 
laws moscow promptly declared that unconstitutional but has done 
nothing to halt estonia from selectively exercising its newly 
declared authority 
the revival of lithuanian nationalism has not been greeted 
unanimously in the republic where 20 percent of the population is 
russian or of other natinality on sunday thousands of mostly 
russian residents of lithuania gathered in central vilnius to 
demonstrate against a new law defining lithuanian as a state 
language 
the crowd was estimated at 20000 to 30000 by medalinskas and 
100000 by the communist party newspaper pravda 
the new yorkbased lithuanian information center said eight 
americans involved in emigre groups were denied visas to attend the 
celebrations the center quoted government sources as saying 
lithuanian party leader brazauskas approved the visas but they were 
rejected in moscow

israeli troops shot and killed a palestinian in 
a stonethrowing clash in the west bank thursday and wounded eight 
others arab doctors said a 4yearold arab girl died of head 
injuries suffered in a mysterious explosion 
in the west bank city of nablus doctors at ittihad hospital said 
25yearold issam el bulbul died of a chest wound suffered in a 
stonethrowing clash with soldiers the army had no immediate 
comment 
arab reports said troops opened fire while pursuing palestinians 
who hurled rocks at an army patrol in nablus old city 
the death raised to 381 the number of palestinians killed in the 
14month rebellion against israeli rule fifteen israelis also have 
died 
palestinian doctors at east jerusalems mukassad hospital said 
iktimal abdullah of tayasir village in the west bank died of 
injuries suffered three days ago when a device she found near her 
home exploded her 10yearold brother naim was wounded 
a military source confirmed the death 
the army started an investigation wednesday into that blast and 
into other unexplained explosions in the west bank that killed two 
other palestinians and wounded eight 
the air force also has been asked to look into the explosions 
after palestinians reported seeing helicopters in the area of one 
incident 
in other cases palestinians accused israeli soldiers in jeeps of 
throwing out explosive devices that lured unsuspecting children the 
army denied it 
the army deputy chief of staff maj gen ehud barak has said 
previous explosions resulted from children playing with undetonated 
shells near firing ranges or flares that fell from training jets 
the west bank and gaza strip were captured by israel from jordan 
and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
defense minister yitzhak rabin on thursday raised the possibility 
of talks involving palestinians from the occupied territories and 
jordan 
he said on israel televisions arabiclanguage program that 
palestinian negotiators should be chosen in free elections and 
indicated he would be flexible about conditions such as army 
withdrawal from voting areas on election days and guarantees that no 
one would interfere with the balloting 
there may be different proposals palestinian committees no 
army on election day in the areas where elections are held there 
may be different ways to guarantee really free elections rabin 
said 
he said talks would be on a political process that would not 
immediately reach a permanent solution we cant resolve that 
problem at once

chancellor helmut kohl on thursday said 
west germans must not forget the nazi era and must prevent any 
possible resurgence of political extremism 
kohl also rejected opposition criticism that a west german 
history museum to be built in bonn would gloss over the nazi period 
because that era occurred before the federal republics founding in 
1949 
we envision our history in its entirety with all of its good 
as well as with its horrible sides kohl said during a 
parliamentary debate 
he proposed that ground be broken this year for the house of the 
federal republic of germanys history a project expected to cost 
49 million 
kohl later made a speech in bonn at the opening of an art 
exhibition marking west germanys 40th birthday anniversary in that 
speech he stressed that west germans must never forget the nazi era 
and any tendencies toward radical political extremism from the right 
as well as the left must be opposed 
we will not and must now allow the responsibility for this dark 
chapter of our history the nazi era to be blotted out kohl said 
this experience of german history should make it clear that we 
must always oppose extremism and the unleashing of irrational 
forces he said 
much of kohls speech focused on west germanys strengths 
especially the countrys successful rebuilding effort after the 1945 
defeat of nazi germany 
no one could have expected that in a very short time life would 
emerge from destruction hope from despair and a brandnew culture 
from unimaginable chaos kohl said 
kohls strong remarks seemed at least partially directed at 
opposition politicians who have charged the new bonn history museum 
expected to open in the mid1990s would ignore the 193345 nazi 
period 
kohl said the museum would not present an officious pavedover 
picture but a thorough and responsible portrayal of the nation and 
the events that have influenced it 
in addition to the bonn project intended to present the past 40 
years of history the federal government has embarked on a larger 
undertaking in berlin to present the entire history of germany and 
its peoples 
west germany plans 120 different celebrations and festivals this 
year to mark the countrys 40th birthday

about 170 black detainees at a 
prison outside johannesburg halted a 24day hunger strike thursday 
and proclaimed victory and antiapartheid leaders said many 
detainees would be freed 
in port elizabeth however civil rights workers said 105 
detainees at st albans prison continued their fast 
the hunger strikers at johannesburgs diepkloof prison some of 
whom had not eaten since jan 23 ended their fast at 7 am an 
important victory has been won they said in a statement 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu after meeting in cape town with 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said the government had pledged 
to free within two weeks a substantial number of the estimated 
1000 detainees held without charge nationwide 
tutu and other activist clergymen emerged from the meeting to 
urge a suspension of the hunger strike tutu said a decision on 
whether to resume the protest would depend on how many detainees are 
freed 
the burden is now on the shoulders of mr vlok tutu said 
our goal is to get all the detainees released and then we will 
carry on to change the total structure of apartheid 
vlok issued no statement but his office described the talks as 
a victory for negotiation the state radio said vlok gave 
permission to the rev frank chikane generalsecretary of the south 
african council of churches to visit the hunger strikers and 
discuss the developments 
the church leaders said vlok promised to give urgent personal 
attention to the cases of individual detainees and told the 
delegation the death of any hunger striker would be too ghastly to 
contemplate 
a very significant move has happened said tutu it has 
given hope to our people that nonviolent action can in fact 
sometimes achieve goals they have set for themselves 
tutu later received a standing ovation from about 1500 people at 
a church service in support of the detainees 
never before has minister vlok and the government been shaking 
in their boots like they are today said activist cheryl carolus 
who was at the service 
as people left the service at the methodist metropolitan church 
in cape town they found a police water cannon truck several vans 
constables armed with shotguns and a colonel warning them with a 
loudspeaker that they had two minutes to disperse or police would 
take action 
an angry tutu spoke with the police colonel saying im going 
to see mr vlok and tell him that your attitude is very 
unreasonable 
kathleen satchwell a lawyer representing several hunger 
strikers said in johannesbrug that the government indicated a 
majority of the roughly 1000 people detained nationwide would be 
freed soon 
she said it was not clear how many of those released would be 
among the estimated 300 detainees at several prisons participating 
in the hunger strike 
oliver tambo president of the african national congress 
guerrilla movement said in harare zimbabwe that the latest 
developments proved the strike was a jolly good idea 
the diepkloof detainees said their decision was based on concern 
for the health of some hunger strikers and on vloks pledge to 
review their cases 
there have been broken promises in the past we hope that this 
is not the case now their statement said we have succeeded in 
our principal objection to highlight the desperate plight of 
detainees 
ms satchwell said there was no specific assurance from the 
government about who would be freed but she said officials had told 
her releases would begin immediately 
another lawyer azhar cachalia said detainees who had been 
fasting since the start of the strike would need several weeks to 
regain enough strength to go free 
he said the government had given no indication it was considering 
ending its policy of detention without trial but was seeking a way 
to free a substantial number of detainees without losing face 
an estimated 30000 people most of them black activists have 
been detained for varying periods since a national state of 
emergency was declared in 1986 
among the clergymen who met with vlok was the rev allan boesak 
who had fasted since monday he said he was suspending his fast for 
two weeks because of the prospect of widespread releases 
the detainees had threatened to starve themselves to death unless 
they were freed or put on trial more than 20 had been hospitalized 
and fears for their health were growing 
vlok had said the government cannot be blackmailed by a 
hunger strike but he met with civil rights lawyers clergy and 
relatives of the strikers to discuss the crisis

the nation suffered the worst pollution of the 
decade last summer with high ozone levels and 28 new cities were 
added to the list of urban areas where air quality violated federal 
standards according to preliminary findings made public thursday 
the findings by the enviromental protection agency were expected 
to be the focus of sharp questioning at a congressional hearing 
later this month on the effectiveness of federal air pollution laws 
rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of a house subcommittee on 
health and environment said the latest epa data released by his 
office is expected to give a strong boost to efforts in 
congress to tighten pollution control requirements 
according to the epa findings twothirds of the agencys 323 
monitoring sites reported higher ozone pollution levels last summer 
than in any other summer this decade 
the findings showed that where a comparison could be made the 
average ozone pollution last summer was 5 percent greater than in 
l983 which has been widely regarded as the worst year this decade 
for ozone pollution average pollution last year was 14 percent 
higher when compared to l987 the epa said 
during l988 there were 26 more metropolitan areas and two largely 
rural areas added to the list of cities that had pollution exceeding 
federal standards established by law these areas had a combined 
population of nearly 15 million people 
the information collected by the epa from state and local air 
pollution control agencies covered the period from april through 
october 1988 including one of the hottest summers which officials 
said contributed to the high levels of ozone pollution 
waxman said the latest data shows that serious air pollution and 
urban smog now afflicts almost every american city he said more 
than 100 million americans live in cities with higher levels of 
ozone and carbon monoxide pollution than is considered safe by the 
epa 
carbon monoxide pollution comes from car bus and truck exhausts 
while ozone pollution is the result of these pollutants as well as 
industrial emissions 
in a letter accompanying the epa air quality statistics donald 
clay the agencys acting assistant administrator for air and 
radiation said that the data was preliminary and had not yet gone 
through the normal validation procedures

13member board chaired by the remaining bank board chairman the 
other 12 board members would include four government officials two 
presidential appointees three members elected by public 
shareholders and three directors elected by the other 10 directors 
meanwhile a chicagobased think tank the mid america institute 
for public policy research said the bank board had given it a 
148000 grant to conduct an independent study of regulators

a close friend of president francois mitterrand and 
four other people were charged thursday in an insider trading 
scandal judicial sources said 
rogerpatrice pelat confirmed he was charged with receiving 
insider information that allowed him to buy shares of the us 
company triangle industries inc shortly before the stateowned 
aluminum maker pechiney sa offered a higher price in a successful 
takeover 
i am a bit surprised but it seems that this is the normal 
procedure pelat a retired businessman told reporters after 
meeting with investigating magistrate edith boizette 
three men were charged with insider trading paris stockbrokers 
pierrealain marsan and ricardo zavala and an officer in a paris 
investment company robert reiplinger the judicial sources said on 
condition of anonymity 
the sources said pelat and a friend isabelle pierco were 
charged with receiving the information and profiting from it the 
charge carries the same maximum penalty as insider trading two 
years in prison and a fine of up to four times the amount illicitly 
gained in the deal 
pelat 70 bought 10000 shares of triangle stock for himself 
his wife and his two sons on nov 16 half for 10 a share and half 
for 1075 a share 
at that time pechineys takeover offer of 56 per share had been 
negotiated and submitted to senior french government officials for 
approval the bid was made public on nov 21 sending triangles 
stock price soaring 
pelat sold his and his familys shares during the following week 
getting more than four times the price he had just paid for a total 
profit of about 350000 
in a televised interview sunday mitterrand said he knew pelat as 
a man of courage and integrity from their years together in the 
french resistance and before that in a german prisoner of war camp 
in 1940 
we were a small group who remained very close it is rare that 
prisoners of war in such circumstances of misery and solitude show 
as much strength of soul character and friendship as pelat did 
mitterrand said 
but he said if pelat were found guilty of an offense then in 
my role as president i would not be able to maintain the same kind 
of friendship i have had with him for so long 
on wednesday pelat resigned from the board of directors of air 
france a spokeswoman for the stateowned airline confirmed thursday 
pelat has said he was tipped to buy triangle stock by a friend 
max theret a businessman with longstanding ties to the socialist 
party theret who bought 32300 triangle shares the day before 
pelats purchase said he came up with the idea from his own stock 
research and denied getting inside information 
theret has not been charged he has been hospitalized in recent 
weeks with a heart ailment and french law requires that an 
investigating magistrate notify a suspect facetoface of criminal 
charges

the lawyer for rock hudsons lover asked a 
jury thursday to double its 145 million award as a message to the 
world that those with aids have a duty to warn their sexual partners 
if you bring in a verdict like the one you brought in 
yesterday you know the world is going to know about it said 
attorney harold rhoden arguing in the second phase of the 
precedentsetting civil trial 
jurors began deliberating the issue of punitive and exemplary 
damages after receiving legal instructions from superior court judge 
bruce geernaert the panel met for 2 hours before retiring and was 
to resume friday morning 
rhoden called the jurors decision wednesday in favor of marc 
christian magnificent and predicted that further damages would 
produce headlines reading rock hudson jury does it again the 
jury award was believed to be the first to a plaintiff who had not 
developed any signs of aids infection 
rhoden urged jurors to assess another 145 million in exemplary 
and punitive damages against hudsons secretary and confidant mark 
miller who the jury found helped the actor conceal the sexually 
transmitted fatal disease from his lover 
miller was held liable for actual damages wednesday along with 
the hudson estate arguments for additional damages focused only on 
miller because the law bars awarding punitive or exemplary damages 
from the estate of a dead person 
there are countless millions of people involved people who may 
benefit by your verdict if it makes an example of mark miller 
rhoden said 
he said that those with aids would no longer keep it secret from 
their sex partners if they knew it could result in a huge damage 
award 
the message has been sent countered millers lawyer andrew 
banks its echoed around the world now please exercise caution 
christian sued on grounds that he suffered emotional distress and 
enhanced fear that he might contract aids he consistently has 
tested negative for presence of the aids virus but his lawyer says 
that is no guarantee that he will not develop aids in the future 
banks asked jurors not to vent any anger they feel toward hudson 
on miller 
hes not the person who had sex with marc christian the 
lawyer said if youre angry at rock hudson i ask you to set all 
the feelings about rock hudson aside and consider mark miller there 
is no need to hit mark miller again the purpose is not to be 
mean spirited or evil 
jurors found wednesday that both hudson and miller were guilty of 
outrageous conduct for withholding the movie stars aids 
diagnosis from the young man who shared his bed for two years 
the jurors heard seven weeks of often explicit testimony about 
the late stars sex life and their award exceeded the amount 
christian had sought in compensatory damages by 35 million 
miller testified that his assets total less than 100000 and 
his lawyer said the award wednesday has wiped him out rhoden 
disputed that but geernaert toldf jurors to disregard both 
attorneys comments concerning millers net worth 
rhoden has said that miller stands to inherit millions from the 
hudson will it also has been suggested that he may be insured for a 
portion of the verdict 
christian 35 an aspiring musician testified that he became 
hudsons livein lover in 1983 and didnt learn that the actor had 
aids until it was announced to the world in july 1985 hudson died 
oct 5 1985 at age 58

damage to the pristine antarctic 
environment from an argentine ship that ran aground and leaked oil 
appears to be less than initially feared a us scientist reported 
thursday 
there were not thousands of birds killed what we saw was the 
death of a few birds and there may be more said ted delaca chief 
of the division of polar programs of the washingtonbased national 
science foundation 
some said this was an ecocatastrophe of biblical proportions 
that clearly is not true others said it was nothing thats not 
true either the truth is somewhere in between 
many krill a small shrimplike crustacean that is the main food 
for whalebone whales washed up on islands after the bahia paraiso 
ran aground on jan 28 and began leaking fuel oil 
the argentine navy oceanographic vessel had been chartered for a 
tourist excursion 
the accident took place near the us polar research station 
palmer on the antarctic peninsula 600 miles below the tip of south 
america delaca was on the scene and helped organize the transfer of 
tourists from ship to land by motorized rubber boats 
the partially submerged ship was carrying an estimated 800 tons 
of diesel oil butane compressed gas and other fuel which 
immediately began to leak how much leaked and how much will be 
recovered was not known delaca said 
he said some penguins and cormorants died after ingesting oil or 
getting it on themselves and thousands of limpets a small marine 
animal also died 
however navy experts from argentina and chile and scientists 
aboard the foundation vessel polar duke quickly recovered floating 
fuel canisters patched the bahia paraisos hull stopped the leak 
and contained the spill and now are cleaning it up 
for the most part the stuff that went into the water seems to 
have dispersed and gone away delaca a bearded 45yearold 
marine microbiologist said in an interview 
the concern now is what possible longterm effects the spill may 
have on animal and plant life and on research such as that conducted 
at palmer since 1970 
the antarctic is a hostile unforgiving environment delaca 
said the organisms that live there are specially adapted the 
margins for survival are narrow anything that takes away an 
edge that compromises their fitness could mean the difference 
between life and death 
he said ingesting oil may affect the penguins capacity to store 
oxygen and thus their ability to dive deep for food oil on the 
feathers of skuas a large predator bird related to the seagull 
could affect their ability to float or stay warm 
lack of limpets and krill near a nesting may affect breeding 
patterns and the ability of young creatures to survive he said 
he said researchers also will wonder now whether the results they 
obtain are valid or a reflection of the oil spill 
this is the first significant spill in antarctica delaca 
said it was a pristine environment and experimental results were 
taken as accurate indicators of the antarctic environment this 
spill could call into question future results 
a team of scientists from the united states argentina and chile 
will arrive at palmer station next month to collect data before 
winter sets in 
when next spring comes is when the story will be told about 
the damage caused by the spill delaca said 
the environment will recover no question about that the 
question is is what comes back what was there before

five former city officials have been 
convicted of illegally guaranteeing themselves jobs as part of a 
settlement of a federal voting rights lawsuit a prosecutor said 
thursday 
craig dearmond the vermilion county states attorney who 
prosecuted the nonjury criminal case in december announced the 
decision which circuit judge paul komada issued in writing earlier 
this week 
the charges resulted from an agreement in 1987 to do away with 
citys system of electing commissioners at large which blacks 
challenged as discriminatory while instituting a ward system of 
electing aldermen the settlement also kept the four commissioners 
on the municipal payroll for three years as executives 
the former commissioners wilbur scharlau ernie cox jerome 
brown and raymond randall were convicted along with city attorney 
wendell wright of charges including official misconduct and conflict 
of interest 
you cant commit state crimes while settling a federal 
votingrights case said dearmond our quarrel was with the 
guarantee of jobs to themselves thats selfdealing illegal 
generally im disappointed i think it is the intention of the 
defendants to appeal said defense attorney everett laury 
wright randall and cox have resigned their city jobs scharlau 
and brown remained on the payroll 
dearmond said the men could face a maximum sentence of five years 
in prison a sentencing hearing is scheduled for april 7 
when the men were indicted in july 1987 defense attorney matt 
lydon contended they had negotiated in good faith to reach a voting 
rights settlement that would assure a smooth transition in the city 
government he also noted that us district judge harold baker of 
danville had approved the settlement 
the bottom line was regardless of their motivation 
everything was done in a federal court case and presented to the 
court to determine whether it was proper laury said thursday 
baker set the indictments aside in august 1987 but the 7th us 
circuit court of appeals reinstated them last april saying baker 
probably did not mean to approve the manner of negotiation just 
the substance of the settlement 
the rev roosevelt davis one of the black residents who filed 
the suit has said that the plaintiffs did not want the former 
commissioners guaranteed city jobs for three years however he said 
that was necessary in order to gain the settlement 
before the settlement no black had been elected to the city 
council in the 60 years the mayorcommissioner system was in place 
about 16 percent of danvilles 39000 residents are black after the 
mayoraldermanic form of government began 14 people including two 
blacks were elected to the city council from seven wards

the 33nation council of the un aviation agency 
thursday ordered an urgent study of whether new measures are needed 
to meet the security threat posed by terrorist sabotage 
at a meeting requested by the united states and britain the 
international aviation organization council condemned all acts of 
unlawful interference against international civil aviation 
including the dec 21 bombing of pan am flight 103 that killed all 
259 people aboard and 11 on the ground in scotland 
the us and british transportation secretaries told reporters 
they considered the twoday meeting of the icao advisory body 
successful and were satisfied there would be a quick review of 
security requirements 
samual k skinner of the united states said the international 
airline traveler can be assured that additional steps are now being 
taken as a result of this meeting to make international air travel 
an even safer mode of transportation 
among issues to be addressed in the review are detecting sabotage 
devices especially explosives and screening of checked luggage 
passengers and carryon bags 
security problems created by portable radios computers and other 
recommendations for any changes in international standards could 
be ready bu late spring or early summer for consideration by the 
icao membership of 160 nations 
paul channon the british transportation secretary suggested a 
rule requiring passengers with electronic devices to carry them onto 
the plane rather than checking them 
to ban radios altogether would be a very drastic step but it 
might have to be considered he said 
allan mcartor head of the us federal aviation administration 
said new guidance was issued in washington after thursdays 
announcement in scotland 
the guidance is more a sense of vigilance than anything else 
he told reporters 
although passengers can expect electronic devices to be checked 
more rigorously an outright ban on carrying them is unlikely 
mcartor said 
channon said the costs of increased security might eventually be 
reflected in increased ticket prices but were not talking about 
large sums of money 
the organizations staff also will be considering whether new 
steps are needed to increase the matching of passengers and their 
bags to consider the security problem of cargo mail and courier 
services using passenger aircraft and to control access to airports 
it also will be discussing the possibility of taking security 
considerations into account in the design of aircraft channon said 
however that any design changes would be minor

psychiatrists could not have predicted that a 
former mental patient would suddenly become homicidal the head of 
marylands hospital for the criminally insane said thursday 
i dont think anyone had the capacity a week ago to predict his 
actions said steven siebert 
but wednesday afternoon emanuel tsegaye a former patient at the 
clifton t perkins hospital center walked onto the seventh floor of 
the chevy chase federal savings bank in bethesda md where he 
worked shot four coworkers and then turned the gun on himself 
according to montgomery county police 
fatally wounded were cynthia mitchell 28 of landover tanya 
walker 23 of fort washington and mahasty aghakhan 29 of silver 
spring the lone survivor of the shooting spree edward johnson 22 
was listed in critical condition at suburban hospital in bethesda 
with a gunshot wound to the face 
police spokesman george ludington said investigators were probing 
reports that tsegaye was a disgruntled employee in the banks 
visa credit card department but said the motive for the shooting has 
not been determined 
as recently as feb 6 the therapist who had been seeing tsegaye 
biweekly since he was released from the hospital more than two years 
ago said the 33yearold debt collector was functioning well in the 
community 
nevertheless siebert said no mistakes were made in the decision 
to release tsegaye from perkins in the fall of 1986 
i have not found anything which would make me question the 
release decision which was made two years ago he said explaining 
that tsegaye was never violent to others during his twoyear stay at 
the facility 
tsegaye was sent to perkins in april 1984 after he approached a 
policeman with a knife pleading with the officer to kill him and a 
county circuit judge ruled that tsegaye was not criminally 
responsible for his action said siebert 
tsegayes release came after he was evaluated by a treatment 
team an outside mental health professional reviewed the decision 
and the judge who originally sent him to the institution was 
notified 
tsegaye had been seen regularly by a psychiatrist and a social 
worker since his release and had stayed in several halfway houses 
before moving into an apartment in silver spring according to 
siebert 
however tsegaye had suffered some setbacks siebert said 
tsegaye was admitted to washington adventist hospital for a week 
for treatment of depression last spring hospital officials said 
and in july the community forensic aftercare office notified the 
montgomery county states attorneys office that tsegaye was not 
keeping his clinic appointments at hamilton house a residential 
halfway house in baltimore where he was scheduled for counseling 
however hospital officials said tsegaye had resumed his 
couseling and just last week his therapist reported tsegaye was 
complying with the terms of his conditional release 
tsegaye had been briefly hospitalized for mental problems five 
times before siebert said dating back to the late 1970s when he 
reported hearing voices while still in his native ethiopia 
tsegaye had been diagnosed primarily with depression but st 
elizabeths hospital in washington where he stayed for three days in 
july 1983 diagnosed him as suffering schizoaffective disorder 
at perkins tsegaye was diagnosed as suffering from bipolar 
syndrome or manic depression which was characterized by bouts of 
extreme depression said siebert 
one person in 20 suffers from some type of bilopar syndrome 
siebert said and 99 percent never perform a violent act according 
to siebert 
siebert and janet klein brown an attorney assigned to perkins by 
the states attorneys office insisted tsegaye also had never 
demonstrated violent tendencies 
he was in for a suicidal gesture not violent behavior said 
siebert during tsegayes two years at perkins he was involved in 
scuffles just three times and he was never the instigator siebert 
said 
if we have an inkling that a person is going to be a risk to a 
coworker or employer we would never recommend that person for 
release siebert said 
i do not have a good explanation for the criminal behavior 
yesterday said siebert adding there also was no way to know if 
tsegayes actions were related to his prior mental problems 
ms brown said the bank wasnt notified of tsegayes history 
because he wasnt considered a danger and state law doesnt require 
notification 
authorities arent sure how tesgaye with a background of mental 
illness was able to obtain a gun 
perkins has begun an intensive review into the incident with the 
help of outside consultants siebert said

miners across peru staged a daylong strike 
thursday to protest the slaying of labor leader saul cantoral and 
said he was killed by a guerrilla group linked to the governemnt 
also thursday police said maoist shining path guerrillas killed 
one policeman and wounded two in an attack a day earlier on a police 
post near chincha 100 miles south of lima 
other maoist rebels shot and killed a former governing party 
economic development worker in huancayo 140 miles east of lima 
police said 
the national mining society an organization of mine owners said 
it could not confirm how many of the nations estimated 70000 
miners stayed off the job thursday 
cantoral secretarygeneral of the leftistled miners federation 
and one of perus most powerful labor leaders was shot to death 
late monday a female companion was run down by a car and killed in 
a lima slum 
government officials blamed the killings on political extremists 
and said an investigation was under way to determine if the 
attackers were from the shining path the antirebel group rodrigo 
franco command or an ultraright death squad not previously known 
the miners federation accused the rodrigo franco command of 
carrying out the attack and it linked the group to the governing 
centerleft aprista party 
the government has denied any connection with the franco band 
which emerged a year ago vowing to kill leftist guerrillas and their 
supporters 
cantoral 42 became the focus of controversy last year when he 
led miners in two crippling national strikes the walkouts caused 
losses of 400 million onethird of the annual exports from perus 
most important industry 
the strikes failed to force mine owners to accept a federation 
demand that labor contracts of mine unions be negotiated jointly 
rather than on the current unionbyunion basis 
the mine owners charged repeatedly that the strikes were being 
manipulated by the shining path which officials said has begun to 
infiltrate labor unions 
the federation in january decided to strike again over labor 
contracts federation spokesman leonardo ramirez said thursday the 
strike is tentatively set for sometime in march

a military judge on 
thursday dropped one of three charges against a navy captain accused 
of abandoning scores of vietnamese refugees who later resorted to 
cannibalism to survive at sea 
the judge ruled prosecutors failed to present evidence that capt 
alexander balian former skipper of the uss dubuque refused to 
assist a man who tried to swim to the warship when it crossed paths 
with the refugee boat on june 9 
balian faces another charge of wrongfully failing to render 
assistance to a second vietnamese who also tried to swim to the 
dubuque and a third charge of dereliction of duty for failing to 
render adequate assistance to the other refugees 
if convicted balian could be sentenced to two years and three 
months in jail forfeiture of all benefits and dismissal from the 
service 
the military judge capt james freyer ordered the first charge 
dropped on a motion of defense lawyer dan donato as soon as the 
prosecution rested its case on the fifth day of balians 
courtmartial 
the dubuque was en route to the persian gulf when it encountered 
the refugee boat 230 miles north of the philippine island of 
palawan the boat crammed with 83 vietnamese had been at sea since 
leaving vietnam on may 22 
united nations officials in manila said nearly 20 other refugees 
died of starvation before the encounter with the dubuque and only 52 
survived when the boat people were rescued by filipino fishermen 
on june 27 
the survivors told officials that after provisions given by the 
dubuque crew ran out they survived by eating the flesh of five 
refugees including three who were slain 
balian 48 of los angeles was relieved of his command in 
august courtmartial charges were filed in december 
in addition to dropping the first charge the judge also 
instructed the six navy captains who sit as the jury to ignore one 
of 11 allegations to back up the dereliction charge which is 
punishable with three months in prison 
the allegation was that balian had failed to provide the refugees 
with medical supplies witnesses who testified earlier said the 
refugees replied to repeated questions that no one among them was 
sick 
the other allegations backing the dereliction charge include 
failure to adequately inspect the refugee vessel for its 
seaworthiness 
on wednesday a witness testified he saw four vietnamese jump 
from their boat and swim toward the dubuque three of them swam back 
when they saw two rubber boats from the dubuque approaching their 
craft with food supplies 
the prosecution says at least two vietnamese drowned 
but the witness ensign allen esperum testified balian gave 
orders to check the floating body of the vietnamese to make sure 
he is not faking it he added he observed no movement in the 
body and it was left at sea

six months after a fiery air show 
crash at a us base killed 70 people the us air force said 
thursday it had canceled all its air shows in west germany this year 
air force spokesman capt kevin krejcarek said the decision by 
commanding gen william kirk applies to all flyovers and aerial 
demonstrations for the general public at air force installations in 
west germany 
on aug 28 three italian stunt jets collided in flight over the 
ramstein air base and one of the flaming planes plowed into a crowd 
of spectators in addition to the 70 killed hundreds of people were 
injured 
that crash and a series of nato training flight crashes in west 
germany last year that killed more than 100 people caused a public 
outcry and demands for a stop to lowlevel military flights 
throughout the country 
in a telephone interview with the associated press krejcarek 
said the order also applies to open houses for the public 
events regularly staged in the past by the air force to permit 
germans to familiarize themselves with the us military in europe 
however krejcarek said some air installations still may stage 
displays of aircraft for members of the military and invited 
guests only 
the us militarys unofficial stars and stripes newspaper 
reported thursday that the leftist social democrats and greens 
parties in the ramstein area had stepped up their campaign against 
air shows by circulating petitions and writing letters to newspapers 
and us officials 
the newspaper quoted ramstein mayor julius divivier as saying 
kirks move was a wise and good decision ramstein is about 65 
miles southwest of frankfurt

the republican party rolled out its big guns 
thursday president bush and former president reagan to keep a 
former ku klux klan leader from being elected to the legislature as 
a member of the gop 
letters touting bushs endorsement of exklansman david dukes 
opponent in the state house race were circulated throughout the 
district while radio commercials featuring reagans familiar voice 
were broadcast throughout the day 
i cant help but tell you of the high regard i have for one 
candidate in the race for the 81st district john treen reagan 
said in the radio spot for the conservative house builder and 
longtime republican 
duke 38 countered with a paid halfhour broadcast on a new 
orleans television in which he declared that neither bush nor reagan 
knows anything about the issues in the local race 
george bush hasnt walked in the irishitalian parade as i have 
down metairie road george bush hasnt eaten at the lakefront in 
bucktown duke said 
i know the people of the district not george bush or ronald 
reagan i respect both of those men but all i can respond is 
read my lips george bush no new taxes and david duke basically 
has the same kind of program that george bush has advanced 
treen 63 and duke a former grand wizard of the ku klux klan 
are in a runoff saturday to represent the nearly allwhite district 
in metairie a new orleans suburb duke who sought the 1988 
democratic presidential nomination but registered republican in the 
fall led a field of seven candidates with 33 percent of the vote in 
the jan 21 primary treen had 19 percent 
under louisianas open primary system the top two votegetters 
in a primary regardless of party face each other in the runoff if 
no candidate gets half the primary votes the seat opened when 
metairies representative was elected to a judgeship 
the presidentiallevel endorsements for a state house seat may 
have unprecedented 
this is the first time for sure that ronald reagan has ever 
done it to my knowledge for a state legislative race said state 
republican party chairman william nungesser 
bush and reagan didnt mention duke in their endorsements but 
state and national republican officials made it clear that a duke 
victory would harm the party 
its as if attila the hun joined our party said nungesser 
all of the sudden attila the hun is a republican candidate i 
dont believe hes changed one bit 
he is not a republican and should not pass himself off to be a 
republican said leslie goodman spokeswoman for the republican 
national committee in washington we can tolerate a lot in this 
party but the one thing we cannot tolerate is intolerance 
it has to be political favors being called in duke said 
after treen received the presidential endorsements im really 
tired of this the outside interference in this race is absolutely 
ridiculous its like the establishment is closing the ranks to 
prevent an independent from coming through 
duke has been campaigning door to door this week as publicity 
heated up in the race 
treen said he received the endorsement from reagan after a mutual 
friend whom he would not identify asked the former president to get 
involved 
treen was state campaign chairman for bushs 1980 presidential 
bid his brother dave was louisiana governor from 1980 to 1984 
the commercials were paid for by treens campaign neither treen 
nor nungesser would say how much they cost 
duke has disavowed the klan which he said he left in 1980 after 
being accused of selling secret membership rolls he heads a group 
called the national association for the advancement of white people 
which he says is not racist but a group seeking human rights for 
everybody 
he is opposed to welfare and affirmative action and supports 
louisianas 75000 homestead tax exemption

a federal judge thursday refused to 
overturn an 815 million award against the gd searle amp co in the 
case of a woman who said her infertility was caused by a searle 
birth control device 
searle asked for a new trial claiming juror misconduct errors 
of evidence and excessive punitive damages 
a us district court jury last september ordered searle to pay 
815 million to esther kociemba of elk river the verdict 
supported her claim that a searle copper7 intrauterine birth 
control device had triggered a pelvic infection that left her 
infertile 
searle clearly believes that a new trial was warranted based on 
the evidence of jury misconduct the company said in a statement 
after judge robert renner issued his ruling 
searle based in skokie ill said it would appeal renners 
decision to the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
in denying searles motions for a new trial renner said the 
court does not condone improper actions of the jurors however he 
added after reviewing the record and hearing the testimony of the 
individual jurors the court concludes that the defendant was not 
denied a fair trial 
the judge said he did not find the verdict excessive 
the jury verdict was the first award of punitive damages against 
searle for a copper7related illness and it was the largest award 
about 500 lawsuits have been filed over the copper7 the most 
widely used iud in the united states before it was withdrawn from 
the us market in january 1986

khomeinis orders to kill salman rushdie the author of the 
satanic verses and religious students in iran threatened suicide 
attacks on him 
the bounty for killing the writer was doubled to 52 million 
and britains airlines including british airways tightened 
security following bomb threats against some flights 
the death threats against rushdie whose book has been denounced 
across the moslem world as blasphemous were called appalling by 
the us state department a leading islamic theologian who opposes 
the book said in egypt that khomeini erred by not giving rushdie a 
chance to repent 
rushdie who was born a moslem in bombay india but no longer 
practices islam is a naturalized briton whose novel has sparked 
violent protests from islamic fundamentalists he has canceled a 
promotional tour for the book in the united states and remains in 
hiding with his american wife marianne wiggins published reports 
said they were under police guard in britain 
moslems say the allegorical novel offends their faith by 
satirizing the prophet mohammed as fallible implying that islam is 
not the only true religion portraying mohammeds wives as 
prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the koran rather than 
receiving it from god 
the british foreign office summoned irans lone diplomat in 
britain told him khomeinis threat was totally unacceptable 
demanded special protection for its tehran embassy and froze plans 
to expand diplomatic relations with the islamic state 
we recognize that moslems and others may have strong views 
about the contents of mr rushdies book british foreign 
secretary sir geoffrey howe said after his office summoned iranian 
charge daffaires mohammed basti 
however nobody has the right to incite people to violence on 
british soil or against british citizens ayatollah khomeinis 
statement is totally unacceptable 
howe stopped short of threatening to break diplomatic relations 
but in an address to a foreign press association luncheon he said 
a stable and serious relationship will not be possible while 
iran fails to respect international standards of behavior 
basti emerged from the foreign office in defiant mood saying 
rushies infamous book has had appalling consequences in some 
islamic countries 
it is a decree it is a verdict after careful consideration 
he said of the death sentence it has nothing to do with any 
particular country 
on wednesday protesters stoned the british embassy in tehran 
britain reopened the embassy in december after an eightyear 
closure and intended to appoint an ambassador and have more than 12 
diplomats the foreign office said 
in new delhi an anonymous caller to the united news of india 
threatened to bomb british flights unless rushdie emerged from 
hiding 
at londons heathrow airport british airways immediately 
tightened security with bagbybag searches of luggage of passengers 
on its thursday evening flights to the indian subcontinent and the 
far east 
air europe another britishowned airline with flights to india 
said it was taking the threat seriously 
amid a growing international furor the pakistan government 
called in the british and american ambassadors and demanded that all 
copies of the book be destroyed 
pakistan india and several other countries banned the book 
prime minister benazir bhutto reached agreement with her rightwing 
opposition in january on a parliamentary resolution upholding the 
ban 
tehran radio said religious figures in the northwestern iran city 
of urumiyeh said in a statement we have already put on our death 
shrouds and pledge to carry out the imams khomeinis death 
sentence against salman rushdie and his publishers in the united 
states and europe 
the broadcast followed reports that other death squads were 
headed to britain from islamic countries in search of rushdie a 
41yearold moslem 
rushdie dropped out of sight soon after khomeini announced the 
death sentence on tuesday on him and viking his publishers in 
britain and the united states 
the 26 million bounty offered by iran was matched by mohammad 
hashemian religious leader in the southwestern city of kerman who 
offered the cash reward to any group or individual who carries out 
the death sentence on rushdie and his publishers that brought the 
total bounty to 52 million 
noniranians would be paid 1 million if they got to rushdie 
first 
in washington state department spokesman charles e redman said 
the united states was appalled by the death threats against salman 
rushdie by the ayatollah khomeini as well as a subsequent offer of 
a reward for his murder 
such threats are completely irresponsible and are incompatible 
with basic standards of international conduct he said adding 
that he did not see how this in any way could improve the 
prospects for usiranian relations 
in the netherlands where he is on a nato tour secretary of 
state james a baker iii called the death threats regrettable 
sheik mohammed hossameldin a leading islamic theologian in 
cairo said khomeini erred in sending death squads after rushdie 
because executing him would be virtually impossible under the 
tenets of islam 
hossameldin said in an interview that nobody has been executed 
in islams 1350year history as an apostate which he interpreted 
as the crime that khomeini invoked in issuing his sentence against 
rushdie khomeini said only that the indianborn author deserved to 
die for insulting islam 
in other developments 
the french government said it was shocked at the death 
threat and dutch foreign minister hans van den broek canceled a trip 
to tehran 
italian publishers arnoldo mondadori editore spa said they 
would go head with a contract to release the italian edition of 
the satanic verses but rushdies french publishers christian 
bourgois suspended publication plans 
the british arts council backing earlier protests by british 
writers denounced the threats against rushdie and his publishers as 
contrary to the tolerance and understanding that are the hallmark 
of a free society

a japanese balloonist was drifting more slowly than 
planned early friday because of a shifting jet stream that could 
whisk him toward alaska instead of his planned destination of 
california a spokesman said 
three days after he set off to become the first solo balloonist 
to cross the pacific ocean fumio niwa floated east near torishima 
island about 1250 miles southeast of tokyo at 930 am said 
spokesman naoto higashi 
niwa was floating in his orangeandblue helium balloon over the 
pacific ocean at about 35 mph at the south edge of a jet stream 
slower than he had hoped higashi said 
another spokesman hiroaki tanaka said the jet stream can carry 
him at about 125 mph but niwa decided not to enter it fully because 
it was angling toward alaska 
originally niwa had planned to rise immediately to 26400 feet 
and enter the jet stream which he calculated would have blown him 
the 5000mile distance to san diego in four days 
niwa rose to 23100 feet on friday from 15100 feet on thursday 
night tanaka said 
despite delays due to slight changes in the angle of the jet 
stream higashi said niwa still expected to reach his target by 
about feb 20 niwa has supplies for 10 days 
the 38yearold balloonist lifted off from yokohama southwest of 
tokyo early wednesday in a spherical plastic gondola six feet wide 
that he had designed himself 
the capsule is pressurized but has no navigational or heating 
equipment niwa relies on amateur radio reports based on radio 
beacon signals to pinpoint his location 
the temperature inside the gondola friday morning was 23 degrees 
and it was minus 13 outside said tanaka batterypowered electric 
coils in niwas flight suit keep him warm 
niwa quit his job with a computer firm three months ago to 
prepare for the flight he said he planned to sleep during the day 
and stay awake at night 
in 1981 four men reached the united states from japan by balloon 
for the first time but no one has traveled the distance alone 
niwa who has 1000 hours of ballooning experience estimated the 
flight would cost about 540000 which he hopes to regain through a 
book and lectures about his experience

contra rebels will not lay down their 
weapons until nicaraguas leftist sandinista government institutes 
the democratic reforms it pledged at the central american summit a 
rebel leader said thursday 
wilfredo montalvan a director of the contra organization known 
as the nicaraguan resistance told a news conference in san jose the 
rebels will wait four months to see if the sandinistas carry out the 
election reforms they promised 
otherwise he said they will renew their war against the 
sandinistas and we will seek military aid to do it and we will 
ask for it anywhere we can montalvan said the united states 
supported the contras with weapons and training for six years until 
february 1988 when congress banned the aid 
in nicaragua sandinista officials said the contras killed five 
people in attacks this week including a sandinista army lieutenant 
the government said the lieutenant a woman and two boys were 
killed in a machinegun attack wednesday on a home in el guasimon 
120 miles northeast of the capital managua 
rebels also killed a protestant minister during attacks in 
northeast nicaragua on wednesday night sandinista officials said 
at the end of a twoday regional summit in el salvador on 
tuesday president daniel ortega announced that nicaragua will hold 
early elections permit the opposition to campaign and allow 
observers from the united nations to watch the polling 
the presidents of honduras el salvador guatemala and costa rica 
announced they would devise a plan within 90 days to dismantle the 
rebel force especially contra supply and training camps in honduras 
along the nicaraguan border 
at the summit it was clear from comments by sandinista aides 
that ortega expects the contras will be disbanded before the 
sandinistas have to undertake any of their promised reforms ortega 
said the reforms would begin several months before the february 1990 
elections 
montalvan said he was satisfied with ortegas announcement 
advancing the election date by 10 months to february 1990 but he 
said the nicaraguan resistance will be watching to see what concrete 
reforms the sandinistas undertake before disarming 
we will not surrender a single rifle unless there is total 
democracy in nicaragua he said we are willing to surrender our 
weapons but only in exchange for democracy we are lovers of peace 
and if we are in rebellion its because they have denied us freedom 
and human rights 
montalvan said the sandinistas should undertake the election 
reforms immediately in order to generate confidence in the peace 
process under a plan devised by costa rican president oscar arias 
in 1987 for which he was awarded that years nobel peace prize 
the plan and accompanying peace accords the five presidents 
signed in guatemala at the time sought a negotiated end to 
nicaraguas contra war a nineyear leftist guerrilla war in el 
salvador and a decadesold leftist insurrection in guatemala 
after a flurry of talks between rebels and government 
representatives in the three countries only the contras and 
sandinistas achieved a frail ceasefire last april there has been 
no agreement on peace mostly because of the sandinistas insistence 
that the rebels surrender before political reforms are undertaken

new allegations of troublesome 
indiscretions by defense secretarydesignate john tower arose 
thursday and the senate armed services committee chairman raised 
the possibility that the senate may hold a rare closed session to 
grapple with questions about towers personal life 
former arms control chief kenneth l adelman said towers 
personal conduct when he served as a us negotiator in geneva 
created problems for the state department he said towers actions 
which he declined to specify raised questions about his judgment 
and integrity 
meantime the latest fbi report into towers background has not 
uncovered any evidence linking him to the pentagon weaponsbuying 
scandal or illegal campaign contributions the washington post 
reported in its friday editions 
but the newspaper quoting unnamed sources said the report 
contains new details about towers personal life the volume of 
information about his drinking habits and relations with women is so 
great he probably wouldnt be hired as an fbi agent the newspaper 
said 
the report will be sent to the armed services committee on 
monday the newspaper said 
from january 1985 to april 1986 tower headed the departments 
delegation that discussed mutual cuts in longrange nuclear missiles 
with the soviets 
towers private behavior didnt directly affect his conduct of 
official business at the geneva talks adelman said sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the armed services panel has said an 
investigation of towers actions in geneva found no security 
breaches 
but adelman said towers conduct should be a factor in the senate 
confirmation deliberations because a defense secretary has no 
private life adelman spoke in an los angeles times interview 
published thursday and in a washington times column on wednesday 
adelman said he was impressed with towers performance as a 
strategic arms negotiator yet his lack of discretion proved 
troublesome then as before and since 
tower has been dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing 
and many senators also have voiced concern whether tower could avoid 
conflicts of interest after receiving more than 1 million as a 
consultant for major defense contractors since he left the senate 
four years ago 
nunn at a georgia appearance thursday said he hopes his 
committee can vote on towers nomination next week he said the 
delay now is waiting on the fbi to check out an allegation that 
came from the justice department 
the fbi is known to be investigating new allegations that nunn 
has said are of a financial nature other senators have said they 
are related to the pentagons massive contract fraud case 
nunn said that if the committee were to vote today i think 
most people on the committee havent decided because we have not got 
all the information 
nunn said that if questions arise from members of the senate 
regarding towers personal life the senate may be forced to meet 
behind closed doors 
i hope not but it depends on the type of questions posed on 
the senate floor by senators who are not members of the senate armed 
services committee nunn told reporters wednesday during a visit 
to rome ga 
if an accurate answer to these questions include personal 
information i would recommend that a limited closed session be held 
to answer these questions and only these questions he said i 
emphasize that the leadership of the senate will make this decision 
not the armed services committee or its chairman 
meanwhile a prominent republican senators said he doubted that 
the senate will confirm bushs nominee sen david durenberger 
rminn said towers past associations with defense contractors 
would cast a shadow over his decisionmaking at the pentagon 
i think hed be haunted by that every decision hed try to 
make which doesnt make him a bad defense secretary because he 
probably is the kind of tough guy we need durenberger said in 
minneapolis 
but sen rudy boschwitz rminn said he expects tower to win 
senate approval and added hes a tough little dog i tell you 
and hes going to get into that defense department and hes going to 
think that his reputation needs a lot of repair and it does and i 
think hes going to do some pretty good work hes going to shake 
those folks up and they need to be shaken up in the department 
sen david pryor dark in an appearance at the university of 
arkansas in little rock said tower has really become his own 
worst enemy and predicted that he will not be confirmed 
the department of defense has enough problems today without the 
secretary of defense bringing in his own problems pryor said 
nunn has said he will reserve judgment on the tower nomination 
until the committee receives the final fbi report expected sometime 
next week a committee vote is possible next week when the senate 
returns from its recess 
a closed session of the full senate is highly unusual occurring 
on average about once a year and usually relating to national 
security issues 
the last closed session occurred on march 29 1988 when the 
senate met to discuss the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
with the soviet union 
in 1986 the senate held a closed session during the impeachment 
proceedings of judge harry e claiborne 
closed sessions were held in 1984 on nicaragua in 1983 on two 
state department nominations and in 1982 on ussoviet defense 
issues in 1980 the senate met behind closed doors on military 
readiness

claims that his promise to hold free elections is insincere telling

strong and backed by the people

at the end of a regional summit tuesday in el salvador he

americans are increasingly going to nursing homes 
to die as hospitals discharge terminally ill patients to keep them 
from running up big bills thus helping reduce the nations medicare 
costs according to two reports today 
one study based on nationwide death statistics suggests that 
the trend results largely from new medicare rules that pay hospitals 
flat fees for taking care of the elderly this approach gives them a 
financial incentive to keep patients hospital stays as short as 
possible 
what has to be said is that hospitals are in a bind because 
they are being pressured by cost cutting said dr mark a sager 
who directed the study nursing homes are in a bind because nobody 
wants to pay for nursing home care patients are in a bind because 
they are in a system that does not want to provide continuity of 
care and health care financing is fragmented 
his research showed that the number of elderly americans dying in 
nursing homes rose sharply during the 1980s while fewer died in 
hospitals

declaration of war by the soviets and premier nikita khruschev 
backed down from the brink for unexpected reasons scholars now say 
newly declassified documents indicate that luck as well as 
skill played a great role in resolving the worlds last major 
nuclear crisis 27 years ago soviet and american experts at harvard 
university said wednesday 
kennedy and khrushchev made key decisions based on serious 
misperceptions and faulty intelligence which however may have 
helped to resolve the crisis as well as to start it said graham t 
allison dean of harvards john f kennedy school of government 
looking at it in retrospect with all the new information i

surprisingly to khrushchev for the degree of control they tried to

those ubiquitous economic observers whose 
views are cited so often dont know whether to cheer or worry these 
days the economy has become that confusing 
the reason economic growth normally the most soughtafter goal 
of policymakers has become a cause of concern too much growth is 
bad you can take alan greenspans word for it 
greenspan chairman of the federal reserve board has stated and 
restated his view that the sixyearold expansion is headed toward 
inflation which often precede recessions unless growth is 
harnessed 
in a nutshell his rationale is contained in a statement made 
last summer to the senate banking committee to wit 
considering the already limited slack in available labor and 
capital resources a leveling of the unemployment and capacity 
utilization rates is essential if more intense inflationary 
pressures are to be avoided in the period ahead 
ever since he has been putting upward pressure on interest 
rates the better to slow growth 
it creates a perplexing situation for ordinary folks to 
understand there are even hints from time to time that president 
bush may be among the perplexed 
more than once the president has stated that he and greenspan 
arent far apart in their approaches to the economy but then the 
president has stated that he isnt nearly as concerned about 
inflation as greenspan is 
at most times 4 percent economic growth would be reason to 
cheer so would a sharp decline in unemployment a rise in the rate 
at which the nations factories are utilized higher retail sales 
consumer confidence and more 
to some extent these and other factors are still described as 
evidences of health strength and vigor but the descriptions are 
barely uttered when the caveats follow typical of course the 
threat of inflation 
for most americans it is difficult to believe that growth is bad 
since economic growth has been a continuing theme of the countrys 
history moreover isnt growth needed in order for america to meet 
foreign competition 
yes but greenspan and likethinkers say a nations capacity to 
produce is limited by the manpower money and machines at its 
disposal as they see it we are now straining all three resources 
when that happens the economy begins to smoke it becomes 
stressed less productive because it must rely on less efficient 
manpower and plants rather than producing goods and services the 
economy manufactures higher prices 
not everyone agrees with the slowgrowth theme and notable among 
them is edward yardeni economics director at prudentialbache 
securities yardeni is so outspoken that a year from now he will be 
either hero or bum 
we think growth is good he stated in a recent newsletter 
we believe greenspan is exaggerating the inflationary risks 
moreover yardeni contends much of recent economic activity has 
been in the expansion of capital goods which expand domestic 
capacity and boost exports to yardeni this is a critical 
consideration he explains 
if mr greenspan turns the screws too tight he could snuff out 
the capital spending boom we need to expand the capacity that he 
fears there isnt enough of 
of course yardeni says it is true that tight monetary policy 
can increase slack by depressing economic demand but his approach 
is the opposite we prefer policies that create slack by letting 
capacity grow 
ah theres the problem to which the answer is so elusive is 
growth good or bad do we slow down or do we speed up do we cheer 
or do we worry

well were all just so pleased that the cast and 
crew of abcs passion and paradise got to do part of the winter 
filming in jamaica 
that seems to be the best result of this twopart movie no doubt 
named passion and paradise because such a title will draw more 
viewers than the more apt tedium and purgatory 
was it only a week ago that we were hailing the triumph of 
quality in lonesome dove back to reality folks 
this is a mostly muddled attempt to make a suspense yarn out of 
the reallife 1943 murder of sir harry oakes a fabulously wealthy 
american miner who traded gold for british title and a plantation in 
the bahamas oakes murder was never solved though it likely was 
linked to his opposition to legalized gambling on the islands a 
development sorely desired by organized crime 
the movie which airs sunday and tuesday sports a rather bizarre 
cast yes rod steiger and mariette hartley together at last 
steiger and hartley are actually not bad as oakes and his wife 
saddled as they are with a lurching script that provides ample 
opportunity for great fits of overacting steiger playing the 
doomed sir harry manages to last through the first installment 
in the second hartley shrieks at one point kill me kill me 
now this seems to be part of the dialogue and not a spontaneous 
plea to be released from the proceedings 
armand assante looking like napoleon in exile seems to be 
making a career out of slouching through overwrought network 
miniseries he plays alfred de marigny a countslashchickenfarmer 
who casts aside his history of fortunehunting to woo and win sir 
harrys winsome and very rich daughter nancy she is played 
with fretful consternation by catherine mary stewart whose reaction 
to tragedy seems remarkably similar to observing a run in ones 
stocking when nancy discovers that alfred has a wife she 
complains do you know what this makes me feel like a new 
agent perhaps 
oakes is bludgeoned and burned in what appeared to be a voodoo 
ceremony there was an uprising among native workers at the time 
the rest of the movie is taken up with alfreds mindnumbing murder 
trial interspersed with scenes that attempt to portray everyone 
else as still a suspect this is the writingdirecting equivalent of 
trying to keep several plates spinning at one time 
but mystery turns to melodrama the villains mafia stereotypes 
partnered with snooty britons have all the subtly of a herd of 
snidely whiplashes michael sarrazin does however do an admirably 
oily job of playing the gangsters evil emissary to the islands 
it seems the gangsters are in cahoots with the duke and duchess 
of windsor andrew ray and linda griffiths a dastardly and 
enormously amusing pair 
the duke was governor of the bahamas during world war ii i 
want that casino the duchess pouts to the duke if i cant be 
queen of england ill make my own kingdom here 
why cant it be like the old days between us he whines 
it can be she purrs youll think of something wont 
you and plants a wet one on him in case he doesnt get the 
picture 
late in the movie if you last this long please consult a 
physician theres an entirely new twist when wayne rogers arrives 
impersonating columbo or in this case cheerfully frumpy private eye 
raymond schindler whom nancy has brought from the states to help 
prove alfreds innocence 
since we know the case was never solved we know the outcome of 
the trial but thats not the end of the movie schindler ensconces 
himself on a sofa to propound his own cockamamie theory about what 
really happened to oakes 
in a surprise ending it turns out there was really no reason to 
make a movie about the whole messy business at all

a very tricky matter is developing for monetary 
officials meaning those who have an input into federal reserve 
money policies and it will take luck as well as wisdom to deal with 
it 
it is odd as well as tricky the potential solution is part of 
the problem it means that in order to deal with the problem 
officials might be forced to delay the solution 
the problem involves an inflation threat the hard fact is that 
the economy is approaching the limits of its capacity when that 
point is reached prices might rise sharply demand will exceed the 
ability to produce 
the fed announced this week that in december and january the 
operating rate of industry was 844 percent figures that have not 
been surpassed since october 1979 in the past figures higher than 
that led to rising prices 
one way to deal with such a problem is to slow the economy thus 
keeping demand within capacity the fed has been trying to do that 
pressuring interest rates higher almost month by month since last 
summer 
based on experience high interest rates eventually will produce 
the slack that is sought by the fed but it might do something more 
it might very well force industry to forgo efforts to expand its 
capacity to meet the demand 
capacity is expanded in several ways by building new plants 
expanding manufacturing space adding more efficient equipment and 
instituting various other procedures that permit greater 
efficiencies 
that process is now going full blast but a serious question 
arises will rising interest rates snuff it out 
evidence of the capital outlays boom are contained in a 
justreleased analysis from the national federation of independent 
business which surveys its membership every three months on a 
variety of economic matters 
the latest survey shows that plans for capital outlays jumped to 
36 percent of all the federations 500000 business members the 
highest percentage since questions on the subject became part of the 
survey in 1977 
economist william dunkelberg who designed the study and 
interprets results every quarter said the findings suggest the 
underlying strength of capital spending in the economy is still not 
reflected in official statistics 
the study found that 57 percent of the companies made up of 
enterprises ranging in size from proprietorships to those with sales 
in the hundreds of millions of dollars have made capital outlays 
in the past six months 
he observes that major additions to production capacity are being 
made in a broad range of industries that major electricity 
generating plans are in the pipeline and that business construction 
of all types remains strong 
in short us industry is making a massive attempt to enlarge 
capacity to meet the stress of demand 
can it succeed or will it take too long to build enough capacity 
before inflation gets out of hand more importantly can industry 
continue to build capacity if interest rates continue to rise 
while nobody not even profound federal reserve minds can answer 
with any certainty a bit of encouragement is contained in the nfib 
report it shows that with profits strong many companies are able 
to finance internally 
if the economy slows however and especially if it dips into 
recession those profits might not be sufficient to the task 
dunkelberg says costly money already is discouraging some 
borrowing and he says since 48 percent of member shortterm loans 
are tied to the prime rate many companies are exposed to any 
slowdown attempts by the fed

the bards the thing on the london stage these 
days with a stream of productions to compete with the royal 
shakespeare company and a renewed confidence in shakespeares 
selling power 
shakespeare has been the obvious mainstay of the 
governmentsubsidized rsc since it was founded by sir peter hall in 
1960 in 198990 the company will mount more shakespeare than ever 
14 out of a total of 27 productions 
but what has changed is the amount of shakespeare available 
elsewhere 
last season the newly formed renaissance theater company mounted 
a sellout 10week run of three shakespeare plays at the west ends 
phoenix theater winning plaudits for actormanager kenneth 
branaghs vivacity plus a new audience for the bard 
the phoenix is now playing host to derek jacobi who directed 
the renaissance production of hamlet in the title roles of 
both richard ii and richard iii 
alan bates and felicity kendal open early in april in a west end 
staging of much ado about nothing in repertory with anton 
chekhovs ivanov dustin hoffman follows in june making his 
london stage debut as shylock in the merchant of venice 
in the fall michael gambon who starred in tvs singing 
detective will play othello with playwright alan ayckbourn 
directing 
and the english shakespeare company is staging a sevenplay cycle 
of history plays at the old vic under the collective title the 
wars of the roses 
the shakespeare boom continues and is challenging the rscs 
historic leadership wrote michael ratcliffe in the observer in an 
article headlined willpower shakes up the scene 
this theatrical landscape recalls the presubsidy 1940s and 50s 
when acting greats such as john gielgud ralph richardson and peggy 
ashcroft regularly performed the bard on the west end 
on broadway by contrast shakespeare works are rare and only 
two productions in the past decade have made money the james earl 
joneschristopher plummer othello and the derek jacobi much 
ado about nothing an rsc import 
alan bates who is associated in the theater with the modern 
plays of simon gray calls the return to classics very healthy it 
is also very brave but there does seem to be an audience for it 
michael pennington the 48yearold actor heading the wars of 
the roses cycle said he finds the trend very heartening 
a former rsc regular pennington and director michael bogdanov 
started their company in november 1986 to reinvigorate the bards 
plays outside the institutional confines of londons large 
subsidized companies 
pennington took the english shakespeare company to japan 
australia and the united states and returned to find that the 
companys richard iii is one of three on view in london this 
season 
his fears the british might be glutted on shakespeare have proved 
unfounded 
we were concerned the audience was going to be split because a 
small minority go to shakespeare let alone unpopular shakespeare 
said pennington referring particularly to the rarely performed 
henry vi history plays a trilogy which the esc has compressed 
into two plays 
instead he said we may have provoked something shakespeare 
is good box office 
the rsc is staging much of the same cycle this season under the 
title the plantagenets which conflates the three henry vi 
plays and richard iii into a ninehour marathon event opening 
april 1 
theres obviously an energy abroad which is thrilling said 
rsc associate director adrian noble the proof is in the pudding 
i have a feeling the experience each one offers is so different 
he thinks the rekindled interest in shakespeare may be a reaction 
to contemporary political drama which is often shrill and 
constricted where shakespeare is full of scope for new 
interpretation 
noble directed the rsc in a highly praised 1984 production of 
henry v turning it into an antiwar statement against britains 
war with argentina over the falkland islands two years earlier 
the strong didactic viewpoint of the 60s and 70s is a thing 
of the past he said theres actually a very strong thirst for 
noneditorialized political drama our lives are full of 
contradiction and these are complex contradictory plays 
the rsc survives on its subsidy and the esc on sponsorship by 
allied irish bank but both the jacobi doublebill and the bates 
much ado are straightforward commercial ventures of londons 
triumph theater productions ltd they are being presented in a 
financial climate that favors smaller casts and less elaborate 
scenery 
its like a smallscale musical with attendant costs peter 
wilkins triumphs deputy managing director said of the two 
richard plays which are expected to go to washington and 
broadway next year 
while refusing to give exact figures wilkins said costs ran 
three times as high as say the twocharacter a walk in the 
woods with alec guinness a triumph production whose 150000pound 
260000 budget roughly equals the average london budget for a 
straight play 
but he said jacobis presence made the risks worthwhile when 
you have a star like derek who has assumed the mantle of john 
gielgud that justifies it

isabella rossellinis film career has included 
mostly offbeat movies notably david lynchs underground classic 
blue velvet norman mailers tough guys dont dance and the 
sleeper hit siesta 
but in cousins the american remake of the popular french 
film cousin cousine rossellini plays a woman torn between the 
love of two men the kind of part that was a specialty of her 
mother ingrid bergman 
fans of casablanca who agonized over whether bergman would 
end up with humphrey bogart the man she loved or her husband paul 
henreid to whom she felt responsible can see rossellini forced to 
make a similar decision in cousins 
i do what i like the actress said in a recent interview 
if a commercial film comes about that i like i love to do it i 
have a different reason why i want to do each film 
she plays maria hardy who ends up falling in love with larry 
kozinski ted danson after her husband william petersen has an 
affair with kozinskis wife sean young 
rossellinis participation in the film which also stars lloyd 
bridges and the argentine actress norma aleandro came about by 
accident she had originally been asked to look at the script as a 
favor to friends who were putting the film together 
there was a kind of a warmth and nice feeling to it she 
said i was a little bit bashful i didnt know what i was going 
to do i told them i read the script and i really like it but i 
would like to do it 
the cast of cousins comes from a wide range of backgrounds 
danson had starred in the hit tv sitcom cheers petersen worked 
in the theater young pursued a dancing career before making her 
film debut at age 19 aleandro had appeared on stage screen and 
television and had won acclaim and honors for her part in the 
official story rossellini brought her experience as a model and 
journalist 
the ability to keep in character is the same thing that happens 
when you model not being thrown off and getting nervous and tense 
about having a lot of people around you 
modeling also helped rossellini become sensitive to the 
importance of wardrobe 
the way you dress shows a little the way your character is i 
love talking with the designers about my character i think i am 
trained to see the different ways people dress 
rossellini and her twin sister ingrid were born in 1952 the 
children of bergman and italian director roberto rossellini whose 
affair in the late 1940s shocked the film world and led to bergmans 
estrangement from hollywood for many years 
with her mother one of the worlds most famous actresses and her 
father a major director rossellini was reluctant to get involved in 
filmmaking 
i guess i never dared i thought it was kind of presumptous 
said rossellini who has been married twice to director martin 
scorcese and model jon wiedemann my father wanted me to finish 
school they always felt being an actress would be difficult and 
they were right 
so at age 20 she worked as a translator for italian television 
and eventually spent three years conducting interviews for the 
italian comedy series the other sunday 
that was rewarding the fact that i was able to become 
successful made me more secure about myself and helped me become an 
actress i think if i would have started at 18 i would have been 
devastated i was little more together when i started at 3031 
she said 
her modeling career started in 1980 when she agreed to have her 
picture taken by photographer bruce weber and ended up on the cover 
of vogue magazine she appeared in a few minor films the meadow 
and il papocchio and became popular with american audiences in 
1984 playing gregory hines russianborn wife in white nights 
but rossellini wasnt adverse to stepping out of the mainstream 
in 1986 she played dennis hoppers abused wife in blue velvet 
one of the strangest and most critically acclaimed films of the year 
it was very original very rich she said i had imagined 
it like this it was all in the script the atmosphere on the set 
was very warm and very friendly people think it must have been very 
unpleasant to play it but the atmosphere was just the opposite i 
dont think i could have played the scenes otherwise 
what also mattered to rossellini was the ability to relate to her 
character 
its essential how do you portray someone you dont like even 
when i read a script i kind of have to fall in love with my 
character love is the basis of an inspiration of creativity you 
spend hours and hours trying to figure it out if there isnt love 
nothing comes to your mind

the rev kan xueqing says his prayers have been 
answered one of his flock george bush has been elected president 
of the united states 
god has his own plan said kan as he sat smiling in an 
antechamber of his church in a bustling section of beijing he 
arranges things in wondrous ways 
bushs former tennis coach wang huailong says hed love to get a 
game in with the president when he comes to china feb 2527 after 
the funeral of emperor hirohito in tokyo but his old tennis partner 
will probably be too busy 
id like to see whether his backhand has improved said wang 
wearing a japanese track suit at beijings international club he 
never beat me in singles so id like to give him another shot 
bush and his wife barbara lived in china from september 1974 to 
october 1975 when he headed the us liaison office set up in the 
early days of uschinese rapprochement that resulted in full 
diplomatic relations in 1979 bush became chief of the central 
intelligence agency in washington after leaving china 
china considers bush an old friend an important moniker in 
this land where the distinction between friends and enemy is clear 
the government openly rooted for bush to win the presidency and 
chinese leaders were pleased when he was elected 
but when the bushes lived here beijing was a forbidding place 
for foreigners 
china was still in the throes of the ultraleftist cultural 
revolution chinese were not allowed to talk to foreigners and were 
often questioned by police if they did 
to cut some of the isolation bush and his wife often left their 
us government car at home and rode forever brand chinese 
bicycles 
they went to sunday church services for foreigners bush played 
tennis daily at the international club while mrs bush dabbled in 
tai chi a chinese breathing exercise 
mostly they fraternized with other foreigners because of the 
conditions at the time 
in 1975 hardly anyone chinese outside of the foreign ministry 
would speak to us said a western diplomat who served in beijing 
in the 1970s we were pariah dangerous so we made do with 
ourselves 
coach wang was one of the few chinese bush saw almost every day 
hed ride down here on his bicycle tennis balls in one basket 
and soda pop and ice in another said wang i was always glad to 
play him because that meant i could share his cold drinks 
wang said bush was a pretty good player in doubles but was a 
little weak in singles 
i remember when he would win a point with a good shot hed 
always fall to his knees and stick his arms in the air said wang 
laughing he was a pretty jolly fellow 
wang wasnt the only one impressed by the bushes bicycles 
the moment i saw the bushes riding toward our little church i 
knew there was something special about them said kan they 
didnt put on snobbish diplomatic airs 
kan and his colleague the rev shi zesheng met the bushes 
regularly at the request of the diplomatic community the pair who 
had been forced to work in the countryside during the early part of 
the cultural revolution began christian church services for 
foreigners only 
the services took place in the old bible house kan and shi were 
not allowed to preach but kan led hymns and shi accompanied on the 
piano 
i remember one winter day very clearly said kan mr bush 
was late instead of hanging up his big blue cotton coat he rolled 
it up and stuffed it under his chair i remember thinking he 
really is a regular guy 
another day stands out in shis mind the day we baptized mr 
bushs daughter 
it was aug 8 1975 the 16th birthday of dorothy bush now 
dorothy bush leblond 
he wanted to give her a special present shi said so we 
talked with our superiors and they agreed to let us baptize her 
shi presented the family with a baptismal certificate done in 
his own calligraphy 
kan and shi said they too supported bushs presidential candidacy 
i still pray for him said kan i have requested god to 
watch over him this good friend of china

crescendoing costs and tapering revenue are 
forcing many of the nations major orchestras to bow to financial 
pressure by playing more crowdpleasing music and jazzing up their 
image to lure new fans 
weve been doing the same concerts for 200 years now its a 
fixed animal it hasnt changed not even the dress has changed 
said gideon toeplitz managing director of the pittsburgh symphony 
orchestra but what has changed is what attracts the audiences 
you have to make it an exciting event no matter what it 
takes agreed joanna broussard spokeswoman for the new orleans 
symphony orchestra were competing for the same leisure dollar 
that goes to the movies on saturday night 
the problem once pianissimo is now fortissimo 
in new orleans symphony concerts are scheduled to resume march 
8 after more than a year of silence due to a local recession that 
crippled orchestral funding the comeback is due to a debt reduction 
plan that includes the sale of the orpheum theater the orchestras 
home 
in nashville tenn the symphony has emerged from bankruptcy 
and is back in operation following a sevenmonth moratorium thanks 
to contributions from corporatio 
we get a lot of onetime people a lot of quick comeandgo 
toeplitz said what we need to do in the long run is build 
commitments

the next time producers of the grammy awards want 
to pay tribute to the music industrys past they may have to 
consider the longplaying record with lp sales falling drastically 
and the compact discs popularity soaring the future of vinyl 
seems at best limited 
its getting close says jack eugster chairman of the 
musicland chain whose 685 stores nationwide include musicland and 
sam goody i dont think anyone wants to say goodbye but its 
certainly not going to be a category that anybody is going to be 
stocking in any depth 
figures released by the recording industry association of america 
show that in 1985 the cd sold 226 million units nationwide compared 
to 167 million for the lp 
but by 1987 the cd had pulled virtually even selling 1021 
million units while lp sales dropped to 107 million figures 
available for the first half of 1988 show an even more drastic shift 
with records moving just 435 million units and cds selling 704 
million 
while record stores are busy returning unsold lps u2s the 
joshua tree recently became the first cd to be certified platinum 
for selling a million copies the dirty dancing soundtrack def 
leppards hysteria and faith by george michael have all 
followed suit 
but as major labels and record stores follow the market others 
insist that lps sound better than cds and should not be phased out 
lps generally sell for about 898 and cds are in the 1020 range 
cds are digitally mastered as opposed to analog for lp a 
concept first tested in france in the 1920s digital recorders 
sample sound waves at a rate of a little over 44000 times a second 
and put them back together resulting in a clean but sometimes 
hollow sound 
the effect could be compared to watching a film which consists 
of a series of still frames run at a high enough speed to give the 
appearance of a moving picture analog recordings pick up everything 
thats sent out increasing the chance for hiss and distortion but 
also producing a fuller sound 
the necessary equipment for digital was not available however 
until the 60s when nhk the japanese public televison station 
worked with sony and denon america to develop prototype recorders 
digital recordings also known as pcm or pulse code modulation 
were first demonstrated in the late 60s and became available to the 
general public in 1972 when denon released the mozart hunting suite 
by the smetana quartet 
pcm recordings were only available on vinyl and cassette until 
the 80s when they were issued in the form of a 5inch compact 
disc developed by sony and phillips and they quickly became the 
hottest audio item of the decade 
analog recordings are subject to the environment and get 
destroyed there are old recordings of vladimir horowitz that are 
gone said robert heiblim executive vice president of denon 
america records which produces both digital and analog recordings 
with cds we can just keep making copies so we have it forever 
what the engineer hears in the recording studio the consumer 
does not hear on analog sometimes they get less than onefifth the 
sound quality the digital allows you to hear what the engineer 
hears also each analog recording we stamp out sounds slightly less 
good than the first in compact disc or digital recordings the 
millionth copy is the same as the first copy 
but some authorities disagree 
with the compact disc youre listening to a musical event 
without the sense of being there said larry archibald of stereo 
file magazine 
the second thing is that high frequencies in analog are more 
easily and graciously produced than in digital and the third thing 
has to do with general lowlevel information subtle clues about 
the recording site and where the recording was made little details 
in the sound of instruments digital tends to lose this 
harry pearson publisher of the absolute sound also prefers 
analog recordings 
youve got to consider that analog technology is 100 years old 
and its been refined and perfected he said this is the first 
generation of digital technology its going to take a long time for 
digital to sound as good as analog analogue retrieves more 
information because digital cannot reproduce a wide band signal 
cds are not immune to damage though no wear occurs during play 
since they are grooveless and operated by a beam of light they can 
still be scatched and dirt stains or smudges can cause mistracking 
extreme temperatures also can damage cds 
lou dennis the senior vice president of sales at warner bros 
records isnt taking sides hes letting the sales figures speak 
for themselves 
were not trying to form peoples opinion were reacting to 
the market our job is to make available what people want to buy 
he said if the market buys something it will be available if i 
ship 1000 lps and take back 582 the market has told me theyre not 
interested 
because lps are selling so poorly four of the six major record 
companies warner elektra asylum capitol emi manhattan angel and 
cbs have increased their penalties from 5 to 10 percent for records 
returned for example a sam goody store might order 1000 lps of 
the new paul mccartney album but only be able to sell 500 the 
remaining copies could be returned to the record company but the 
store would be penalized 
its a real challenge to stay in stock it puts pressure on you 
to do very well there are certain titles that are not brought out 
in lp thats an increasing percent eugster said 
since the major labels are unlikely to put their entire catalog 
on cd analog proponents are worried that some records will become 
difficult to find gene dingernari coowner of footlight records a 
manhattan store that buys and sells used lps says business has 
expanded greatly 
so much of what we have is just not available on cd he said 
some of the most expensive records are the ones that were the 
dogs theyve become very rare and unavailable we deal with 
collectors who are still hooked on vinyls 
one such collector is frank doris the technical director of the 
absolute sound ten years ago you get could get any of frank 
zappas records either on verve or reprise for 3 to 5 doris 
said now theyre worth 15 to 50 also the grateful dead you 
could find their albums easily 10 years ago now theyre going for 
20 or 30 
the audio magazines while conceding that digital recordings are 
here to stay have urged the music industry not to turn its back 
entirely on the lp but archibald sees little chance of the industry 
giving way 
unfortunately i see a future where lps will only fill a niche 
market he said most of the major recording studios are now 
done in digital those recordings will inherently miss some of the 
great information from analog recordings

the china that president bush returns to this week 
is brasher brighter and betterdressed than it was when he lived 
here in 1974 and 1975 but it is also a country riven by discontent 
and searching for a new role in the world 
chinese officials were openly pleased by the election of bush 
the first us president to have lived in china since herbert hoover 
came as a mining engineer in 1900 he understands china many 
said 
but china has undergone vast changes since bush lived here as 
head of the us liaison office that was established in the early 
days of the uschinese reapproachment that culminated with full 
diplomatic relations in 1979 it has changed much even since he last 
visited in 1985 
as it was before the communist revolution china these days is 
torn between confidence in its historic greatness defensiveness 
about its poverty envy of richer nations and determination not to 
simply copy them 
china in 1974 was still in the grip of the cultural revolution a 
violent decadelong struggle by radical leftists to create a pure 
egalitarian society untouched by foreign or bourgeois influence 
the few thousand foreigners who lived in beijing mostly 
diplomats were allowed few contacts with chinese giving a 
foreigner directions on the street could land a chinese at the 
police station for hours of interrogation 
other than government officials the only chinese bush had an 
opportunity for regular contact with were his tennis coach and 
governmentassigned servants 
chairman mao tsetung was rarely seen in public bush saw him 
only twice but his face and his sayings were omnipresent and he 
was likened to the sun sending his revolutionary influence 
everywhere 
pursuit of individual wealth was an offense against communism as 
was wearing high heels braiding ones hair dancing or playing any 
music other than a handful of approved revolutionary songs 
about the only dissipation allowed was smoking 
china in 1989 is awash with dissipation in the cities women in 
tight skirts slowdance with men sporting long sideburns at discos 
that play western pop music small private bars have begun appearing 
around beijing and pool tables line the streets in warm weather 
in the countryside men prosperous from capitaliststyle schemes 
gamble their earnings away sometimes eliciting the wellpublicized 
ire of local womens groups prostitution has returned to some 
coastal cities bringing with it veneral disease 
most of the more than 10000 foreigners who now live in china 
still live separately from chinese but restrictions on contacts 
with chinese are much relaxed 
young men with frizzy perms change currency illegally on the 
sidewalks sometimes physically accosting passing foreigners 
except for his portrait hanging at tiananmen gate and his body 
lying in a mausoleum a few hundred yards away mao is little seen 
the autobiography of american automaker lee iococca is a best seller 
at the staterun xinhua bookstore but the store no longer stocks 
posters of mao 
the communist party has acknowledged that mao made serious 
mistakes in launching the cultural revolution and a few daring 
intellectuals have urged the party to give up its exclusive hold on 
power 
few chinese who watched the lifeanddeath power struggle inside 
the party during the cultural revolution and wanton destruction of 
property and lives still accept the partys claim to selflessly 
serve the people 
disillusioned with marxism and bored with ideologies many people 
have refocused on making money and trying to get the most out of the 
current policy of allowing limited free enterprise 
increased crime and corruption growing rudeness in daily social 
exchanges and increased interest among intellectuals in going 
abroad to study and perhaps stay all reflect the new 
mefirstism workers and farmers hungry for a bigger share of the 
pie have held sporadic strikes 
as a nation too china is groping for a redefinition of its 
role in the early 1970s china still believed it was at the 
vanguard of a world revolution that would free working people from 
exploitation 
now china would like to play the role of a world power in 
settling issues such as the middle east conflict but lacks the 
economic and military clout at the same time it emphasizes its 
poverty and backwardness in seeking concessionary loans and 
technological help abroad 
whether or not bush understands china china is seeking to 
understand him his autobiography has been translated into chinese 
and is starting to show up in bookstore windows

whatever the game smart money goes on the side 
that knows how to take advantage of the rules so far in the 1989 
budget contest that would be president bushs team 
in presenting the new budget and in preliminary talks with 
congress on it and the old federal deficit the administration 
has set the agenda thats an advantage in any negotiation 
the real bargaining is yet to come but bush has the upper hand 
as it begins he has presented a basically conservative budget but 
one that includes some thrifty proposals for added social program 
spending at home 
that certainly offers no reprise of the great society even 
though some democrats said the republican budget shifted priorities 
in their direction the change from the budget left by ronald reagan 
has more to do with tone and direction than with actual numbers 
with no real money to spend on new programs bush emphasized what 
would be minimal increases for education environment the homeless 
child care and other domestic programs he put compensating spending 
cuts in the pending file for discussion with congressional 
democrats thats drawn some democratic complaints that the budget 
isnt as specific as the law requires an argument that will go 
nowhere congress annually ignores its own budget laws 
bush followed his campaign script in recommending a freeze on 
most federal programs a freeze in two flavors he would curb 
pentagon spending with an inflationadjusted freeze allowing dollar 
increases but no real growth and thus curtailing the reagan defense 
budget for a year anyhow he would rein in domestic programs with 
what the administration calls a nominal freeze holding spending 
to prior amounts without regard to inflation 
budget cuts had been defined in terms of current services 
meaning the cost of maintaining a program from one year to the next 
was adjusted for inflation and for increases in the number of people 
offered the service or subsidy involved 
that way even if more money went into a program it was deemed 
to have been cut if the increase didnt keep pace with inflation and 
caseloads 
the bush budget changed that 
we are being conned said richard darman the new director of 
the office of management and budget there are an awful lot of 
politicians who are calling things cuts that arent cuts 
the logic applies in the opposite direction too measured the 
old way the domestic budget freeze represents a cut of at least 
96 billion 
itemized cuts have yet to come bush said those should emerge in 
negotiations with congress 
mine is a budget that will not work with business as usual 
he said in one of three speeches he gave on the road in a quick 
campaign to promote his budget while congress was in recess it 
will require a partnership with the congress my team and i are 
prepared to work with the congress to negotiate in good faith with 
the leadership to work day and night if thats what it takes to 
meet budget targets and to produce a budget on time 
on time would mean passage of the 13 appropriations bills that 
finance the federal government by oct 1 the government new year 
that deadline hadnt been met in a dozen years until 1988 when 
congress was spurred by crisis the stock market collapse of 
october 1987 
instead congress wound up passing resolutions to continue 
federal spending at earlier rates so the government wouldnt run out 
of money sometimes it did before the catchall resolutions were 
approved often they were giant incomprehensible lastminute 
measures sometimes passed before members of congress could read the 
law they were writing 
as a candidate bush said flatly that he would not tolerate the 
practice but there is little chance that absent a crisis like the 
wall street crash the ontime appropriations performance of 1988 
can be repeated in 1989 
according to the white house the administration will set out 
areas and guidelines for budget cuts with specifics to await 
negotiation with congress 
marlin fitzwater the presidents press secretary said that 
should avoid confrontation we want it to be cooperative a 
partnership kind of arrangement he said 
while it lasts thats a partnership in which bush cant lose 
the strain will start showing when democrats insist on negotiating 
and voting not just on cuts but on increases in their priority 
programs

veteran globetrotter george bush sets out 
wednesday on his first overseas journey as president a fastpaced 
trip to three asian nations anxious about americas budget problems 
and its military commitments abroad 
over 5 days bush will travel to japan china south korea and 
back home again more than 36 hours of his time will be spent on air 
force one flying from place to place 
playing down expectations white house officials said the trip 
offers an opportunity to demonstrate resolve and affinity with 
friends and the region it would be unreasonable to expect major 
resolution of policy issues four weeks into the administration 
one official said 
symbolically its important said robert a scalapino 
director of the institute of east asian studies at the university of 
california at berkeley theres no region in the world in which we 
have greater economic political and strategic interests 
the trip originated with bushs decision to attend the funeral 
friday of japanese emperor hirohito which will attract scores of 
world leaders the president has defended his decision to attend the 
funeral amid criticism from those who still resent hirohitos role 
in world war ii 
im doing whats right the president said recently 
bush a former navy aviator whose plane was shot down by the 
japanese in the pacific in 1944 said we have a good relationship 
with japan i want to see it even better and this doesnt concern 
me a bit and youre talking to a person who was in combat in world 
war ii i feel you look ahead not always look back you do whats 
right 
taking advantage of the occasion bush will hold separate talks 
in tokyo with 16 to 20 heads of state or government including 
french president francois mitterrand egyptian president hosni 
mubarak jordans king hussein and philippine president corazon 
aquino 
bushs trip comes at a time of concern in asia that budget and 
trade deficits could prompt the united states to scale down its 
defense commitments or to demand that allies shoulder a bigger share 
of regional security costs in particular there are tensions over 
the big trade imbalances that japan and south korea have with the 
united states 
there is a good deal of anxiety in this region about the future 
of the american economy the degree to which our strategic 
commitments might be cut back said scalapino 
bush will meet in tokyo with japanese prime minister noboru 
takeshita their second visit in three weeks following a white house 
conference feb 2 white house officials believe takeshitas 
attention will be diverted by the funeral and his role as host for 
foreign dignitaries and that there will not be much opportunity to 
tackle substantive issues 
after two nights in tokyo bush will fly to beijing for a 
nostalgic visit to a country where he served for more than a year as 
the us envoy he will visit major landmarks such as the great hall 
of the people and meet with chinese leaders including 84yearold 
deng xiaoping communist party general secretary zhao ziyang and 
premier li peng 
bush will spend two nights in beijing and then take an early 
morning flight to south korea 
with antiamericanism on the rise from both the left and the 
right seoul is bracing for demonstrations during bushs stop 
bush will be there less than five hours visiting president roh 
tae woo at the presidential palace called the blue house and 
delivering a speech at the national assembly traveling by 
helicopter bush will not be exposed to any disruptions by 
demonstrators 
bush who visited 74 countries in his eight years as vice 
president stopped in japan south korea and china during a 1982 
journey he visited japan again in 1984 and china again in 1985 
some commentators have suggested that bushs visit to beijing 
before any trip to moscow is a snub to the kremlin however bush 
denied that he was trying to play china off against the soviet 
union saying recently theres nothing of that nature in this 
visit 
bushs visit to beijing comes amid a warming in relations between 
china and the soviet union soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will go 
to beijing in may for the first sinosoviet summit in three decades 
scalapino said he expects bush will welcome improvement in 
sinosoviet relations because they may make possible settlements 
of some of the more thorny political issues in asia such as the 
divisions between north and south korea 
bush said that since he already would be in japan a stop in 
china just seemed like an appropriate visit 
administration officials said it would have been a slight to the 
seoul government if he didnt stop there as well 
the very fact hes giving a public speech is in itself of some 
significance said scalapino how many presidents have addressed 
the korean national assembly

an american management guru credited with 
helping to pull japans business out of the rubble of world war ii 
says he wishes his own country would adopt his methods 
w edwards deming an 88yearold statistician and scientist who 
built a management style stressing quality and worker happiness 
said america is headed for more trade woes if it clings to the 
rugged individualism winlose approach in running business 
its shortterm thinking much of our talent is spent churning 
money looking for a takeover deming told about 500 students 
faculty and business leaders wednesday at the university of 
tennessee 
its a winlose system its rugged individualism out of which 
comes the socalled merit system competition means increase your 
share of the market i win you lose 
snubbed by american companies in the 1950s deming took his ideas 
to japan where businesses decided they had nothing to lose and 
adopted his theories since then japan created the deming prizes 
based on a medal of honor he received from emperor hirohito 
some of the deming prize winners such as fuji photo and 
mitsubishi electronic are among the most successful in penetrating 
american markets 
starting about 1980 some us businesses began expressing 
interest in the deming method but significant commitment has yet to 
jell said deming who jets around to various corporations to teach 
his methods 
some of his main points 
dont make quick profits and stock prices the main corporate 
objectives 
make quality control from the procurement of materials on up a 
high priority since it actually brings down the cost of production 
work closely with as few suppliers as possible and dont 
automatically sign contracts with the lowest bidder 
assign responsibility for good product design at the top 
management echelon 
deming likened the united states to a colony selling off its 
metal real estate and other raw materials while buying finished 
goods from other countries 
fortyfour percent of the real estate in downtown los angeles 
is owned by the japanese he said our natural resources are 
petering out how can this be things were so good he said of the 
countrys prosperous postwar years 
we ship out aluminum nickel coal real estate scrap metal a 
colony ships out raw materials and buys back manufactured goods 
he said weve become a colony 
he also decried the grading and evaluations systems used by 
american managers and educators 
the socalled merit system has destroyed us he said what 
are grades they are predictions a high grade is a prediction that 
a worker will perform well 10 years from now under conditions 
nobody would dare foretell 
people are entitled to joy in learning joy in work he 
said 
rugged individualism the days when it could work passed about 
three decades ago we must change our economics to cooperation 
everybody wins equally no but everybody is better

eastern airlines machinist union members talked 
about getting even as they overwhelming supported a strike 
against the troubled carrier if no contract is reached by a march 3 
federal deadline 
ever since texas air chairman frank lorenzo took over its 
like the soviet union has taken us over union member angel 
rodriguez said at a packed union hall meeting wednesday night at 
last we can do something strike everybody has been looking 
forward to that its getting even time 
union leader charles bryan announced wednesday that 97 percent of 
the voting membership had authorized a strike if no contract was 
reached by midnight march 3 when a federally imposed 30day 
cooling off period expires eastern could then impose its own work 
rules 
the miamibased carrier says it has focused on negotiating a 
settlement but the union maintains eastern has been stalling the 
talks and hasnt engaged in true bargaining 
they have not moved in 16 months in their original opening 
position bryan said 
eastern worker guy knaak who has been working on strike 
contingency plans while on a 30day suspension for walking out in a 
dispute over mandatory overtime said lorenzo has not budged while 
the union has made some concessions 
i dont think frank lorenzo wants a settlement knaak said 
the union also contended that management has started recruitment 
of possible strikebreakers 
members of the machinists union representing 8500 machinists 
baggage handlers and other ground workers have been working without 
a contract for 13 months if there is no resolution by late next 
week federal mediators plan to bring both sides together in 
washington 
the machinists represent more than a quarter of easterns work 
force eastern management has been seeking substantial contract 
concessions saying the union members wages are too high and have 
made the airline noncompetitive 
meanwhile the carrier charged that an illegal work slowdown has 
backed up 19 aircraft and delayed flights 
eastern attorney david ross charged in federal court wednesday 
that the machinists have caused the aircraft backup by taking twice 
the normal time to perform tasks ranging from routine mechanical 
inspections to major overhauls 
historically we have had no backup the attorney said we 
would normally only have a certain number of planes in being done 
and then put back in service 
bryan called the charge a smokescreen the work is being done 
bryan said that easterns recent performance it advertises 
itself as the no 1 ontime operator in the industry citing federal 
figures refutes the carriers allegation of widespread work 
slowdowns 
how could that possibly be going on if our people are slowing 
down he said 
the airline and union also pressed their arguments in federal 
court wednesday regarding the subcontracting of work traditionally 
done by organized labor 
us senior district judge c clyde atkins agreed to accept the 
machinists subcontracting case after us district judge james w 
kehoe granted easterns motion wednesday to send the case to atkins 
atkins who ordered an end to a wildcat strike by ground crews 
last week directed eastern to file a response in the subcontracting 
case by noon today 
in an amended complaint filed tuesday the airline said it had no 
choice but to subtract certain work because of circumstances 
beyond its control 
in another development the union charged that eastern has 
started recruiting strikebreakers with newspaper ads offering 
airport opportunities for baggage handlers agents and managers but 
listing no employer

the countrys healthiest line of supermarket 
frozen dinners owes its existence to the heart attack of an 
agribusiness giant charles m harper the 6foot6 chairman and 
chief executive of conagra inc 
the idea for a lowerfat lowersalt line of frozen dinners came 
to harper as he lay recuperating from the heart attack that struck 
him on a business trip sept 14 1985 he says 
healthy choice was served up to the national press wednesday on 
plastic trays by maroonjacketed waiters at new yorks posh plaza 
hotel with harper on the dais 
this isnt just for people on restricted diets this is for 
healthy people that like to be healthy harper said in an 
interview 
the lowcalorie segment of the frozen dinner market is the 
fastestgrowing expanding an average of 24 percent a year from 1983 
to 1987 according to business trends inc a market research firm 
it estimated that 1987 sales of lowcalorie meals reached 15 
billion 
harper said he issued the challenge to his research and 
development staff after his wife josie invented some healthful but 
tasty dishes at home convincing him that conagra could do the same 
to make it taste good that was the toughest thing theres an 
entertainment value to food he said 
other lowcalorie frozen dinner lines have some dishes that are 
low in fat and relatively low in salt but conagras entry is more 
consistently healthy nutrition experts said 
healthy choice meets the dietary recommendations of the american 
heart association and the national institutes of health although it 
does not have their endorsement 
a consumer can buy the healthy choice and know that theyre 
going to get lower sodium lower fat with the others you have to 
read the label to find out evelyn tribole a dietitian and 
spokeswoman for the american dietetic association said in a 
telephone interview 
most companies do a lot of their caloriecutting simply by making 
portions smaller ms tribole said healthy choice portions are 
heavier than the competitions 
darlene doherty president of the association said the closest 
products to healthy choice are frozendinner lines that baxter 
international inc and diamond crystal specialty foods inc sell to 
healthcare facilities for distribution to patients 
conagra is second in the overall frozendinner market with a 28 
percent share behind campbell soup cos 29 percent according to 
business trends conagras other principal brands are banquet 
armour morton patio chun king and sensible chef 
healthy choice is already available in about a quarter of the 
country 
conagra has no plans to reduce fat and salt in all its 
frozendinner brands even though it would make them more healthful 
harper said we will continue to make products that people want 
as an example of healthy choices nutritional breakdown its 
chicken parmigiana dinner has 290 calories 65 milligrams of 
cholesterol and 320 milligrams of sodium it derives 15 percent of 
its calories from fat and 6 percent of those calories from 
saturated fat 
by comparison campbells le menu chicken parmigiana dinner has 
380 calories 890 milligrams of sodium and 43 percent of its 
calories from fat figures on cholesterol and saturated fat are not 
available 
the weight watchers brand equivalent which is an entree rather 
than a full meal has 280 calories 85 milligrams of cholesterol 
840 milligrams of sodium 51 percent of its calories from fat and 
19 percent of those calories from saturated fat

takeover attempt now that the cloud of the bhopal gas leak has 
lifted though the rise in its stock price after the settlement was 
announced could provide protection analysts say 
carbide agreed tuesday to a supreme court of india ruling that 
ordered the company to pay 470 million by march 31 to settle all 
claims stemming from the 1984 accident which killed more than 3300 
people 
the settlement which is expected to have only a minor effect on 
the companys earnings ended speculation about how much the bhopal 
incident would cost danburybased carbide 
there are a lot of companies that would be interested in the 
mix and quality of carbides component assets said barry sahgal 
director of research at ladenburg thalmann amp co in new york 
its just a guessing game but what one can certainly focus on 
is the undervaluation of carbides assets in the marketplace he 
said wednesday its an upstock its attractive for investors 
the risk reward looks quite compelling 
news of the settlement sent carbides stock soaring by 2 a share 
tuesday in heavy trading to close at 31125 it advanced another 
1375 wednesday to 3250 its highest level over the past year 
im in the camp that says the settlement does not make them a 
more attractive candidate said james wilbur a vice president 
with smith barney harris upham amp co inc in new york 
while the settlement of the bhopal issues does relieve that 
concern about liability the increase in the price yesterday 
makes a takeover about 270 million more expensive 
even before the settlement wall street was rife with speculation 
that a takeover bid could emerge one rumor feb 7 pushed carbide up 
2 a share with more than 916 million shares traded several times 
the ordinary volume 
there has been talk that carbide might fetch 50 a share as the 
target of a takeover fight which would make the total value of the 
company about 7 billion carbide has approximately 140 million 
shares outstanding 
three names have been mentioned as possible suitors including 
investor edmund safra of safra republic holdings an unidentified 
west german chemical co and carl c icahn the wellknown takeover 
strategist 
wilbur suggested that last weeks surge simply reflected 
investors desire to take advantage of the 25 percent increase in 
the companys quarterly dividend from 20 to 25 cents a share 
carbide increased its dividend in january after slashing it from 
150 to 80 cents a share last summer the move traumatized 
stockholders and sent stock plummeting to about 17 a share 
that would have been a more logical time to attempt a takeover 
wilbur said 
we have identified at least at eight other companies that would 
produce returns to a takeover group that would be higher than union 
carbide right now he said 
one stock speculator who requested anonymity said the takeover 
talk is probably all hot air 
right now its just a 7 billion company that doesnt have the 
overhang anymore he said but there are lots of companys that 
dont have an overhang 
carbide is vastly different from the farflung flourishing 
conglomerate it was before the bhopal catastrophe it was well known 
for consumer products ranging from eveready batteries to glad 
sandwich bags 
its stock fell from about 50 a share to about 35 after the 
disaster leading to a hostile takeover attempt by the muchsmaller 
gaf corp in 1985 
to fight the takeover carbide sold its consumer divisions and 
undertook other drastic restructuring steps including the sale and 
leaseback of its headquarters building sales slipped to 64 
billion in 1985 and the companys work force was halved 
even before tuesdays settlement analysts had said carbide was 
well on its way back 
in the year ended dec 31 the company earned 720 million or 
531 a share on revenue of 832 billion that compared with 1987 
earnings of 231 million or 176 a share on revenue of 691 
billion

cents a pound over the last month the denverbased national 
cattlemens association said 
reporting on its monthly 19city survey of supermarket beef 
prices wednesday the association said the average price of five 
cuts on feb 9 was 293 per pound up from 287 per pound on jan 
12 
there apparently was less retail featuring or special pricing 
of beef and more efforts to market cheaper meats which are in large 
supply said the association which noted beef production has 
decreased recently 
compared with a month earlier the february fivecut average was 
up in 12 cities and down in seven 
the price average also was affected by a longterm trend of 
higher demand and higher prices for the more convenient beef steaks 
and a somewhat lower demand for the less convenient cuts like chuck 
roast the association said 
over the last month the national average ground beef price was 
unchanged at 142 and chuck roast rose only slightly to 188 
other averages were round steak 271 sirloin steak 357 and 
tbone steak 508

per pound in new york to 237 in san francisco with the highest

housing construction jumped 8 percent in january the biggest 
monthly advance in nearly a year the government said today in a 
report providing fresh evidence of robust economic activity 
the commerce department said new homes and apartments were built 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 169 million units last 
month up from the 157 million rate in december 
last months gain attributed in part to an unusually warm winter 
in much of the country followed a revised 01 percent gain in 
december and a 23 percent rise in november 
januarys was the biggest monthly increase since construction 
climbed 86 percent in february 1988 and was the highest level of 
activity since march 1987 when construction took place at an annual 
rate of 172 million units 
the home building news was the latest in a series of recent 
government reports showing considerable economic strength 
on wednesday a report said us factories continued to operate 
at their highest rate in a decade in january flirting with output 
levels that could strain their capacity and lead to inflation 
stock and bond prices rose in spite of the federal reserve 
boards report wednesday the dow jones average of 30 industrial 
stocks broke the 2300point barrier as it rose 2268 points to 
230393 
the federal reserve said januarys operating rate of 844 percent 
of capacity was unchanged from december the december figure was 
revised upward from an earlier estimate of 842 percent 
the operating rate for january and december has not been 
surpassed since october 1979 when factories were functioning at 
846 percent of capacity 
historically capacity utilization rates of around 85 percent 
are the flashpoints for a speedup in inflation said robert 
defina senior economist for security pacific national bank in los 
angeles there are signs that things are getting tight that 
inflation pressures are building 
in a related report wednesday the fed reported that its 
industrial production index in january climbed 03 percent following 
a revised increase of 05 percent in december januarys increase 
was paced by a 05 percent rise in manufacturing production 
as use of industrial capacity rises so does concern that 
factories will have trouble keeping up with orders leading to 
shortages and price increases 
although some economists said the fed needs to tighten credit to 
cool off production and slow inflation richard rahn chief 
economist for the us chamber of commerce said the reports 
indicate industrial expansion was unnecessarily restrained by the 
feds tightening 
further hiking of the rates will restrict investment in 
capacity equipment even more and hold down further growth in 
capacity rahn said 
a third economic report released wednesday showed that business 
inventories rose 09 percent in december while sales jumped 08 
percent leaving the ratio of inventories to sales unchanged at 150

pennwalt corp chairman edwin e tuttle wont 
discuss his position on centaur partners increased offer for the 
company while centaur today announced it has scheduled a special 
shareholders meeting on the offer 
the new york investment firm in a statement said it scheduled 
the meeting for march 30 at pennwalts headquarters in philadelphia 
pennwalt spokeswoman sue kinard said the company had no comment 
she also said no date had been set for a pennwalt board meeting 
where according to tuttle the board will consider centaurs latest 
offer 
centaur on tuesday raised its offer from 100 to 110 per share 
for the chemical company its proposals to shareholders include 
removing all members of the pennwalt board and electing new 
directors nominated by centaur 
it is obviously a higher price tuttle told the philadelphia 
inquirer on wednesday what conclusions the board will come to 
will have to wait for a special board meeting to take place 
he did not disclose a date for the meeting 
pennwalts stock climbed wednesday to 114125 up 1 in trading 
on the new york stock exchange 
i think we have to consider any offer seriously tuttle said 
and we considered the first one seriously after that serious 
consideration we came up with a very firm conclusion that one it 
was not a bona fide offer and was highly conditional two it was 
certainly inadequate and three the centaur people were not very 
worthy 
centaur which has sought a shareholder meeting in the absence of 
a meeting with the pennwalt board claims the partnership gained 
enough support to have a shareholder meeting called 
pennwalt sought an injunction to block the meeting but a federal 
judge last week affirmed centaurs right to have it called the 
company has filed an appeal 
we have the financing centaur spokesman jerry seeman said 
we are not investing in pennwalt to destroy it it is for the 
shareholders to decide the merits of our offer not mr tuttle 
alone

a group of coleman co shareholders have 
filed a lawsuit seeking to block the coleman family from acquiring 
the publicly held corporation 
in the action filed wednesday in sedgwick county district court 
the stockholders held the 64 per share offer made by the family was 
not enough 
coleman closed at 71 wednesday up 87 cents on the new york 
stock exchange as more than 67200 shares changed hands in early 
trading today it was down 62 cents to 7037 
some analysts said wednesday there was nearly a 50 million gap 
between what the stock was trading for and the coleman familys 
offer 
the suit calls the offer grossly inadequate 
fred anschel an analyst who follows coleman for dean witter 
reynolds inc said such suits are routine 
he also said it probably would take a week for other bidders for 
the company to step forward if there are going to be any

associates charles miller william steiner and katherine reilly 
the petition asks that the lawsuit be declared a class action on 
behalf of all coleman stockholders the attorney who filed it roger 
sherwood of wichita refused comment 
we believe the suits to be without merit but can comment no

lawrence perlman president and chief 
operating officer of control data corp says he has not ruled out 
any options for cutting the companys losses including the sale 
of part or all of the computer business 
but perlman said wednesday that options under consideration also 
include seeking equity partners to help turn around the computer 
business which had operating losses of about 130 million last year 
his comments came in response to a question during an interview 
about widespread rumors that control data is about to sell its 
computer operations unisys corp has been mentioned most often as 
the buyer 
its too early to tell if we have to sell portions of the 
computer business said perlman dismissing published reports that 
unisys representatives recently visited the st paul assembly plant 
of control datas eta supercomputer subsidiary 
we have unisys and every other computer manufacturer visiting 
eta said perlman who was named to his current posts in december 
were trying to sell them on eta as a compatible supercomputer 
with their mainframes 
perlman would prefer to keep the computer business more or less 
intact but he acknowledged that theres no question that one of 
the ways to help make computers profitable is to find the right kind 
of partner 
we dont have to own all of eta or the cyber group control 
datas mainframe computer business for that matter

scandal with special favors by ordering nippon telegraph and 
telephone co and the ministry of posts and telecommunications to 
buy supercomputers from the united states for use by recruit 
in reply to yamaguchis questions in parliament minoru shioya a 
telecommunications ministry official said nakasone asked the 
ministry to help solve trade frictions with the united states but 
gave no specific orders the united states has pressed japan to buy 
more american supercomputers

summon nakasone who was prime minister from 1982 to 1987 
two of nakasones secretaries were among 150 influential 
politicians and businessmen offered bargain stock in a recruit 
subsidiary recruitcosmos before public trading of company shares 
began the stock price later soared 
in arresting two recruit officials and two nippon telegraph 
officials on monday prosecutors noted a supreme court ruling that 
nonpublic offers of stock expected to rise in price amounted to

violating securities laws another was arrested last year for 
allegedly trying to bribe an opposition member of parliament to 
defuse an investigation of recruit an information services 
conglomerate

supercomputer deal between cray research inc of the united states 
and the japansese firms 
she also said nakasone personally recommended recruit founder and 
former chairman hiromasa ezoe who was among those arrested monday 
for a spot on government committees during 
another opposition lawmaker yanosuke narazaki of the united 
social democratic party said nakasones role is essential in 
unraveling the scandal

currencies thursday but below its best levels in dull european 
trading 
gold prices rose slightly 
foreign exchange dealers said the dollar climbed to around 18500 
west german marks after the bundesbank announced it would not be 
raising its key interest rates amid expectations a rate hike would 
be announced 
but the market lacked the energy to push the dollar through the 
18500mark level and the us currency drifted back to its late 
levels 
people have chased the dollar higher and lower a few times this 
week and are obviously tired of it said one dealer who said the 
market was awaiting the release of us trade figures friday 
dealers said trade figures released over the past few months 
havent had the same impact on the market as last year 
but the dollars inability to respond to any good news this week 
together with the fact that the longawaited hike in the us 
discount rate has failed to materialize may mean the trade figures 
will have an exaggerated impact on the dollar

wheat and soybean futures prices closed sharply 
lower thursday on the chicago board of trade amid a flurry of late 
sell orders linked to bearish supplyanddemand factors 
corn and oat futures also retreated 
wheat market led the decline with much of the selling sparked by 
news that a sale of 15 million metric tons of french wheat to the 
soviet union was expected to proceed smoothly 
the report disappointed market bulls who had recently bid up 
wheat prices on indications that some european grain producers were 
running into logistical problems in meeting their sale commitments 
to the soviets 
this latest announcement about the french puts an end to 
that speculation said ted mao an analyst in new york with 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
new studies showing less coldweather damage to the us winter 
wheat crop than many had expected also weighed on the wheat market 
reports of improved soybeangrowing conditions in south america 
contributed to the soybean markets decline 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 9 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 423 a bushel corn was cent to 
2 cents lower with march at 268 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 
4 cents lower with march at 204 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents 
to 10 cents lower with march at 728 a bushel

millionaire industrialist victor posner 
sentenced to help the homeless instead of going to jail for tax 
evasion on thursday announced a program by one of his companies to 
raise money for the homeless 
posner refused to say whether the royal crown cola co drive is 
related to his tax case in which he was ordered to give 3 million 
to aid the homeless in florida an rc executive said the two were 
not connected 
we all know this problem exists and discussing it further wont 
help to alleviate the sorrow and waste connected with this national 
blight nor will it create shelter or provide food posner said 
reading from a prepared statement at a news conference 
posner 69 pleaded no contest last year to evading 12 million 
in federal income taxes by fraudulently inflating the value of land 
he donated to a college in the 1970s 
a federal judge fined posner 4 million in fines and ordered him 
to give 3 million to help floridas homeless with the stipulation 
that the money not be taxdeductible the judge appointed a 
committee of civic leaders to determine how the money would be spent 
for the homeless in florida 
this is an rc campaign and has nothing to do with mr posner 
said carey keane vice president of marketing for the cola company 
of which posner is chairman 
keane said the company hopes to raise 1 million and other 
corporations have been invited to join the effort 
rc said it will donate a portion of the proceeds from sales of 
its soft drinks to help the homeless through local organizations 
the money will come from sales in 14 markets around the country 
buyers of royal crown products in other markets will not be 
contributing to the campaign which ends april 30 
the cities involved are miami new york chicago philadelphia 
tucson and phoenix ariz st paulminneapolis washington dc 
nashville tenn los angeles pittsburgh boston detroit and san 
diego 
posner who controls a 40company empire valued at 4 billion 
last september was named in a securities and exchange commission 
civil complaint against the investment firm drexel burnham lambert 
inc which has agreed to pay a record 650 million to settle 
criminal charges of securities fraud 
posner and his son stephen were accused of shady dealings with 
nowjailed wall street speculator ivan boesky in a takeover deal 
the complaint is pending

the stock market pieced together a modest gain 
today as traders awaited fridays monthly report on the nations 
international trade position 
the dollar rose against leading overseas currencies in early 
foreignexchange trading 
that helped prompt a slight increase in bond prices and decline 
in interest rates in the domestic credit markets 
but buying interest in the dollar bonds and stocks waned a bit 
as the session passed apparently because of worries about the 
monthly trade report due out friday 
wall street economists generally expect the figures to show about 
a 12 billion trade deficit for december compared with the 125 
billion gap between imports and exports previously reported for 
november

the defense department citing the effects of 
inflation over the past decade said thursday it would soon raise 
its dollar standard for reporting contracts to the public and 
congress 
effective march 1 the pentagon said its daily listing of 
contract awards would be restricted to contracts worth 5 million or 
more 
the current contractreporting level is 3 million and was 
established in 1978 
the inflationbased adjustment up from the current 3 million 
announcement threshold is the first to be made in almost 11 
years the pentagon said 
consequently the number of contract actions requiring 
notification has increased significantly as a result of inflation 
over the intervening years a contract valued at 3 million in 1978 
is now equivalent to a 56 million contract today 
the pentagon said the change would have no effect on the manner 
in which contracts are awarded or on the number of contracts 
awarded the new standard will keep manageable the contract lists 
printed every day for distribution to the media public and 
congress the pentagon said 
as is the case now any contract awarded by a defense agency or 
service that falls below the threshhold will be publicly announced 
but not on the day of award as happens with the larger contracts 
smaller contracts are normally disclosed after a lag of a week or 
so in the government publication commerce business daily 
the defense department awards roughly 15 million contracts every 
year

lyphomed inc won nationwide prominence a 
few years ago when it become the only licensed maker of a drug used 
to fight a deadly pneumonia linked to the aids scourge since then 
the company has been fighting a scourge of its own quality 
complaints product recalls and plant closures 
now lyphomed is trying to restore customer confidence a daunting 
task in a business where trust is crucial to survival company 
executives and outside analysts agree any recovery wont be smooth 
the company does have a credibility gap that they have to fill 
with the major institutional investor not only explaining what 
happened but that it wont happen again said michael 
harshbarger an industry analyst at hayes and griffith a chicago 
firm that specializes in healthcare investments 
in 1984 lyphomed became the only company federally licensed to 
make pentamidine used to combat a pneumonia that frequently kills 
people afflicted with acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
lyphomeds success seemed assured 
three years later inspections of lyphomed plants by the us 
food and drug administration revealed numerous violations of what 
the watchdog agency calls good manufacturing practices 
its grand island ny plant still doesnt comply with fda 
standards and the chicago and orlando fla plants have been 
closed permanently but the main plant at melrose park ill is 
back in compliance and a new plant under construction in puerto rico 
will replace the florida operation 
the worst is behind them harshbarger said 
in early february lyphomed reported a 58 million fourthquarter 
loss and a 1988 loss of 211 million vs a 21 million profit in 
1987 
but harshbarger predicted 1989 will be a watershed year 
from investment trade turnaround and operationally 
to strengthen senior management and avoid repeating history 
lyphomed created five new positions late last year in manufacturing 
quality control research and development and regulatory affairs 
with that team lyphomed has pledged to adding patented products 
to their existing business of injectible drugs for the critically 
ill 
when weve come through a situation where the company has 
almost been frozen for a year because of the fact that weve been 
beset by so many problems its a refreshing feeling for everybody 
to get going again said gary nei whos leading lyphomeds 
revitalization plans 
nei 44 a veteran healthcare industry executive who formerly 
worked at american hospital supply corp was hired in the fall for 
the newly created position of president and chief operating officer 
his job nei said is to bring a more disciplined and 
controlled environment to the corporation and one at a time begin 
to set aside the things that have plagued the company 
the first challenge is restoring customer confidence and sales 
which plunged by about 50 percent last year 
lyphomed officials decline to say how many clients have taken 
their business elsewhere but nei acknowledged in a recent interview 
that the fda scrutiny certainly led to a significant 
disappointment on the part of a lot of pharmacists 
but the fact is he said the company grew at such a 
ratethat we were unable to provide the necessary people and 
systems to control our quality systems in the face of that growth 
annual sales totaled 4 million in 1981 when lyphomed was 
acquired from stone container corp in a managementled takeover by 
john kapoor chairman and chief executive officer in 1987 sales 
totaled 172 million reflecting lyphomeds success in selling drugs 
to large hospitals at attractive prices 
the surge laid the foundation for trouble among the main 
problems were these 
an fda inspection report in july 1987 on the firms melrose park 
plant that cited improper drugtesting procedures and inadequate 
employee training or supervision 
a november 1987 fda letter that cited serious violations of 
federal law including release of underfilled vials of drugs and 
failure to follow up on indications of contamination of several 
drugs including pentamidine 
a november 1987 fda suspension of lyphomeds applications to 
market new drugs until qualitycontrol problems were corrected 
a january 1988 company recall of amphotericin b an antibiotic 
used on fungal infections after patient complaints of high fever 
and chills 
a march 1988 fda report on a threemonth inspection at the 
melrose park plant that listed 44 violations of good manufacturing 
practices similar to problems disclosed in the november 1987 
letter 
a june 1988 suspension of lyphomeds florida plant operations to 
correct qualitycontrol problems found by the fda 
finally this past september under fda orders lyphomed agreed to 
destroy or clean up hundreds of thousands of contaminated injectable 
drugs seized by federal authorities it also agreed to recall some 
drugs that were distributed including heparin ascorbic acid and 
potassium chloride which is commonly given to hospitalized patients 
with congestive heart failure 
the firm had bad problems said an fda official who requested 
anonymity out of the 100 violations we dealt with in fiscal 1987 
lyphomeds were among the most seriousbut it was not unique 
important clients spooked off by lyphomeds travails included 
university hospital consortium a pharmaceuticalbuying group for 48 
university hospitals nationwide 
the group disapproved lyphomed as a vendor about a year ago and 
its pharmacy advisory committee voted in december not to reinstate 
lyphomed as an approved vendor through 1989 said karen packard 
vice president of planning and marketing for the oak brook terrace 
illbased consortium 
we were not convinced that lyphomed could be a consistent 
supplier of products of assured quality she said in a phone 
interview but she said the consortium may restore its relationship 
with lyphomed eventually 
we would like to have them be reapproved because they provide a 
product that is not readily available she said referring to 
pentamidine 
nei said lyphomed is trying to convey the message that the 
company has reformed and were certainly sorry over some of the 
inconvenience that weve caused some of our customers

president jose sarney said brazil doesnt 
have the money to pay its foreign debt due in march and called the 
debt burden intolerable 
in a message to the opening session of congress wednesday sarney 
said brazil has paid back 55 billion in interest since 1985 but 
the total amount it owes hasnt changed 
sarney will meet with president bush in tokyo this month to 
discuss new solutions to the debt problem the foreign ministry said 
brazils foreign debt is 115 billion the largest in the third 
world the government says debt payments this year will total 
between 12 billion and 14 billion 
the country cannot go on being an exporter of capital to the 
rich countries sarney said 
we have normalized our accounts with international creditors 
but the total of the debt and its respective servicing still 
constitute a serious restriction to our economys development 
sarney said brazil doesnt have enough money in its reserves to 
pay 13 billion due in march to commercial banks and the 
international monetary fund 
he called a recent agreement to reschedule debt payments a step 
forward but added that it cannot be considered a definitive 
solution 
the 82 billion agreement calls for the rescheduling over 20 
years of debt due between 1987 and 1993 lower interest rates and 
52 billion in new loans 
brazil has insisted that new ideas are needed to reduce the latin 
american debt estimated at more than 400 billion 
it is fundamental to insist on the political responsibility of 
the industrialized countries for the creation of institutional 
mechanisms that permit a quick and definitive lowering of the 
debt sarney said 
the debt will be on the agenda of a private meeting between bush 
and sarney when the presidents attend the funeral of japanese 
emperor hirohito in tokyo this month the foreign ministry said 
sarney also will meet with japanese prime minister noburo 
takeshita to discuss the release of 600 million in credits by the 
japanese government according to the ministry 
brazil is counting on the japanese loan plus 500 million from 
the world bank and 600 million from commercial banks to meet its 
debt obligations this year 
the finance ministry has warned that brazil could again suspend 
debt payments as it did in 1987 if its cash reserves fall too 
low 
however the level of brazils reserves depends largely on the 
success of a radical antiinflation plan announced last month 
the plan aimed at curbing 1000 percent inflation includes a 
freeze on wages and prices and sharp cuts in government spending 
on wednesday night sarney went on nationwide television and 
radio and said the plan was working despite growing signs of labor 
unrest 
he said the specter of hyperinflation has been halted and price 
increases in february will be minimal 
however the president warned that a mania for striking could 
bring instability to the 4yearold civilian regime until 1985 
brazil was ruled for 21 years by a rightwing military government 
labor unions have called for a national strike on march 14 and 15 
to protest the end of costofliving raises under the antiinflation 
plan

ford motor co on thursday posted a 244 
percent rise in its fourth quarter earnings and record annual 
profits as results in its overseas business overshadowed a decline 
in its us automotive earnings 
ford reported a fourth quarter profit of 116 billion or 242 
a share compared with 932 million or 187 a share in the same 
period of 1987 revenue during the quarter rose to 2391 billion 
from 2099 billion a year earlier 
annual profits rose to an industryrecord 53 billion or 1096 
a share on revenue of 9245 billion in 1987 the nations no 2 
automaker made 463 billion or 905 a share on revenue of 799 
billion 
were particularly pleased with our overseas performance and 
with our us car market share said david mccammon fords vice 
president for finance and treasurer 
fords share of the us automobile market climbed to 217 
percent in 1988 its highest in 10 years and up 17 points from 1987 
during the year fords earnings in the united states slipped 91 
percent to 25 billion from 275 billion in 1987 while overseas 
profits rose to 21 billion from 1987s 1 billion 
mccammon said us profits partly declined because of a lopsided 
mix of vehicles the company had available mainly caused by 
lowerthananticipated production of thunderbird and cougar cars 
ford also blamed higher marketing costs including sales incentives 
and increased factory costs 
profits in fords financial operations including its lending 
business fell 194 percent in 1988 from 1987 the automaker also 
reported 
the sag in us performance means fords workers wont receive as 
much in their profitsharing checks this year as they did last year 
when a typical employee got 3700 
mccammon said profitsharing figures would be announced friday to 
ford employees via closedcircuit television and would be the 
secondhighest in company history that means the checks will be 
less than last years but more than the 2100 each worker received 
in 1986 
general motors corp which reported its earnings tuesday said 
it would issue profitsharing checks of about 254 to each employee 
chrysler corp said earlier this month its workers would receive 
about 720 apiece 
together the big three reported 1988 earnings of 1121 billion 
topping the previous annual profit record of 979 billion in 1984 
but analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc of new 
york said the big threes earnings were boosted by inflation and 
accounting changes 
fords mccammon said the cost of sales incentives used to lure 
customers into showrooms rose by about 400 million in 1988 over 
1987 but he declined to say how much the company spent on 
incentives 
mccammon said and decline in fords financial operations profits 
stemmed from a shrinking margin between the rate at which ford 
loaned money and the rate at which it borrows and partly because of 
an increasing number of bad loans 
a trend toward longer car loans up to five years tends to 
increase odds of the loan turning sour he said about half of the 
loans that ford handles are for five years 
mccammon also said no further financial acquisitions are 
anticipated for first nationwide bank a san franciscobased savings 
and loan institution whollyowned by ford but mccammon said that

churchs fried chicken inc running 
out of time and courtroom manuevers to prevent a takeover by popeyes 
famous fried chicken and biscuits has agreed to be bought by its 
rival for about 330 million 
churchs the nations secondlargest fried chicken restaurant 
chain and popeyes the no 3 chain agreed late wednesday on a 
buyout ending a fourmonth dispute that saw churchs take popeyes 
to court sell 120 unprofitable restaurants and put itself up for 
auction to avoid the hostile takeover 
the agreement calls for popeyes owner al copeland to purchase up 
to 301 million shares or about 865 percent of churchs 
outstanding shares for 11 per share 
each share of churchs stock not purchased in the tender offer 
will be converted to 044 share of a new series of preferred stock 
to be issued by the corporation that survives the merger the 
statement did not say what the new company would be called 
churchs stock closed at 1025 in new york stock exchange 
composite trading thursday up 125 a share 
popeyes previously had offered about 290 million to take over 
the ailing churchs whose sales have been declining over the past 
three years 
the companies said the agreement reached four days before 
popeyes tender offer deadline came about amicably 
i am pleased that we have agreed to this merger and believe it 
will create a very strong no 2 fast food fried chicken chain 
churchs president and chief executive officer ernest renaud said in 
a statement 
the companies statement said that canadian imperial bank of 
commerce has offered to provide up to 300 million and merrill lynch 
amp co has offered up to 178 million in financing for the tender 
offer 
neither renaud nor copeland immediately returned telephone 
messages thursday to the associated press 
it was not known how many jobs might be lost as a result of the 
merger 
in documents submitted to a federal court during the takeover 
process popeyes said that if it acquired churchs it would close 
250 churchs restaurants keep 92 with the churchs name rename 303 
others as popeyes and sell 440 others for about 160 million over 
the next four years 
popeyes with 703 restaurants had been attempting since november 
to take over churchs a publicly held company with 1478 
restaurants 
even with a merger the new company would lag behind no 1 
kentucky fried chicken which is owned by pepsico inc and which 
has annual sales of about 4 billion in its 7000 restaurants 
churchs founded in 1952 by george church sr had grown 
steadily over the years but internal bickering including a 
leveraged buyout attempt and other management and marketing 
problems the last several years began taking its toll on the company 
churchs sales have gone down steadily from 639 million in 
fiscal year 1985 to 577 in 1986 and 533 in 1987 popeyes 
meanwhile started by copeland 15 years ago is expected to have 
sales about 480 million this year 
during the takeover attempt churchs sued popeyes arguing that 
former churchs executives working for popeyes took with them 
information that was used in the buyout proposal churchs also 
adopted a poison pill takeover defense that would make it more 
difficult to carry out a hostile takeover 
federal judges in san antonio and new orleans had sided with 
popeyes

sugar futures prices rocketed to new 1989 highs thursday on 
rumors that mexico historically a net exporter of sugar had 
purchased 400000 tons of refined white sugar on world markets 
because of a domestic shortage 
the mexican government later denied the rumors which had 
triggered massive buying of sugar futures on both new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange and the london futures and options exchange 
on other markets grain and soybean prices tumbled over concern 
that supply exceeded demand livestock and meat were mixed energy 
futures gained and precious metals retreated 
new york sugar futures settled 39 cent to 49 cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in march at 1097 cents a pound its 
highest settlement price since dec 30 march sugar traded as high 
as 11 cents a pound during the session 
mexico had been rumored earlier in the week to have purchased 
75000 metric tons of sugar from the french trade house sucres et 
denrees even so thursdays reports of largerscale buying took 
traders by surprise 
arthur stevenson an analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york said the rumors incited heavy buying of sugar 
contracts by futures speculators 
trading volume in new york soared to 40000 contracts compared 
with about 30000 on wednesday and 23000 on tuesday 
analysts said mexico may have overextended itself on export 
commitments and needed to replenish supplies for its own use 
wheat led the late decline in grain and soybean futures on the 
chicago board of trade with much of the selling based on news that 
a sale of 15 million metric tons of french wheat to the soviet 
union was expected to proceed smoothly 
the report disappointed market participants who had recently bid 
up wheat prices on indications that some european grain producers 
were running into logistical problems in meeting their sale 
commitments to the soviets 
wheat settled 2 cents to 9 cents lower with march at 422 a 
bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower with march at 269 a 
bushel oats were 3 cents to 4 cents lower with march at 204 a 
bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 11 cents lower with march at 
727 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the chicago mercantile 
exchange in cautious trading ahead of an agriculture department 
report on the number of cattle on feedlots in the seven largest 
cattleproducing states 
the report issued after the close showed 77 million head of 
cattle on feed as of feb 1 a 2 percent reduction from a year ago 
the report also showed a 5 percent decline in marketings of 
cattle off of feedlots last month and a 3 percent increase in the 
number of cattle placed on feedlots during january 
the usda figures were all within the trades expectations so 
analysts said the report would have little impact on livestock 
futures prices on friday 
live cattle settled unchanged to 33 cent higher with april at 
7547 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent lower to 10 cent 
higher with march at 8172 cents a pound hogs were 12 cent lower

an apparent oversight in drafting a legal 
settlement could cost hughes aircraft co 270 million in potential 
damage payments from the federal government in a longrunning patent 
infringement suit a published report said thursday 
the error was identified in a ruling by us claims court judge 
william turner who said hughes lawyers made a mistake in a 1987 
outofcourt settlement in a related patent case 
the ruling issued sept 29 was published recently in us 
patent quarterly it was first reported in the general news media 
thursday in the los angeles times 
the case involves an 18yearlong patent infringement case 
pursued by hughes now a subsidiary of general motors corp 
involving a device used to control orbiting satellites hughes 
maintains the device made the modern communications satellite 
network possible and claims the government used the device on 108 
satellites without paying royalties 
in the case which presently is in the penaltysetting phase 
hughes seeks 316 billion in damages based on 15 percent royalties 
plus compensation for delay in payment 
turners ruling released the government from liability connected 
with 13 government satellites built by ford aerospace a unit of 
ford motor co which hughes sued for infringement of the same patent 
the ruling was based on wording of a september 1987 settlement of 
the hughes suit against ford that absolves ford customers from 
further liability the times said the government was a ford 
customer 
turner said hughes could have prevented the exclusion of the 13 
satellites from the total by adding except the united states 
after the wording releasing ford customers from liability 
ford agreed to pay hughes 75 million in the 1987 settlement the 
times said quoting unidentified sources 
john walker managing partner at latham amp watkins the law firm 
representing hughes in the case denied the los angeles firm erred 
in drafting the settlement 
everything i know is that we didnt make a mistake at all in 
the case walker told the times 
hughes officials refused to comment because the matter concerned 
litigation according to mike murphy a spokesman at the companys 
corporate headquarters said thursday 
the company has asked the judge to reconsider the ruling 
hughes values its royalties and penalties on the 13 satellites in 
the disputed ruling at 270 million but the government puts the 
potential payment to the company at 50 million the times reported 
citing secret court filings 
the patented device was invented in the early 1960s by donald 
williams a hughes engineer 
the device allows a single small rocket motor to control the 
orbit of a spinning satellite by employing gyroscopic principles 
hughes claims the invention made possible the creation of practical 
communicatins satellites today a multibilliondollar industry 
the government contends hughes has overblown its claims and that 
it doesnt possess a valid patent 
in two previous stages of the case federal courts have held the 
los angelesbased aerospace company has a valid claim to a patent on 
the device and that the government infringed on that patent the 
present phase is to set the penalty against the government

bankrupt yugoslav carmaker 
impex car corp the american agent for yugo and the liquidator 
norauto ltd of columbus ohio battled this week over control of the

represented a financing arrangement to bail out the financially 
ailing company norauto insists it bought the cars outright and 
should be allowed to sell them

protection under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws 
us bankruptcy court judge vincent j commisa has temporarily 
barred the sale of the cars he said he would rule next week on

granted yugo a buyback option

eastern airlines machinists union has engaged in 
economic warfare by staging a twoday wildcat strike illegal 
slowdowns and sickouts since contract talks broke off early this 
month the carrier charged in federal court thursday 
eastern claimed in response to union criticism that management 
has acted solely within the legal bounds of a federally imposed 
30day coolingoff period after the breakdown of 16 months of 
contract talks 
easterns allegations were contained in a fivepage response 
plus 50 pages of related documents delivered to us district 
judge c clyde atkins 
atkins has ordered the airline to respond to the militant unions 
motion for a temporary restraining order to block eastern management 
from hiring nonunion workers to perform tasks traditionally handled 
by organized labor 
the machinists union represents easterns 8500 machinists 
baggage handlers and ground personnel who have been working without 
a contract for the past 13 months 
atkins scheduled a hearing on the union request for late friday 
morning 
the hearing will come at the end of a week that saw an 
overwhelming 973 percent of machinists members vote nationwide to 
authorize a strike if no agreement is reached by midnight march 3 
the end of the coolingoff period 
the miamibased airline will be free to impose its own work rules 
and the union is free to strike legally at that time 
easterns response to the wildcat strike and ongoing slowdown 
has been measured and consistent with its railway labor act 
contractual obligations the airlines court documents said 
the wildcat walkouts were overt acts of economic warfare and 
tended to further the bargaining goals of the union they said 
the airline charged that a work slowdown has grounded 17 of the 
carriers jetliners which the document says amounts to almost 10 
percent of easterns scheduled fleet a company attorney said 
wednesday that 19 planes were grounded 
the airline said the planes were awaiting scheduled checks that 
could not be completed due to a work slowdown by machinists 
union leader charles bryant dismissed managements slowdown 
charges wednesday recalling easterns recent performance 
advertised as the no 1 ontime operator in the industry 
how could that possibly be going on if our people are slowing 
down he asked 
another passage in easterns response appeared likely to evoke

the government is scheduled to close the books 
friday on the first annual improvement in the trade deficit since 
1980 but the deficit has leveled off in recent months and many 
economists say it will get worse again 
the financial markets mild reaction to the recent trend could 
reflect a view that with inflation the big concern a widening 
deficit is not of primary concern 
american industry already running near full tilt may not be 
able to produce a big increase in exports or substitute for imports 
without overheating and leading to higher inflation some economists 
say 
when the commerce department reported last month that the us 
trade deficit widened to 1251 billion in november a 22 percent 
jump from octobers 1026 billion the financial markets brushed it 
off surprising many analysts 
fridays report is expected to show the us trade gap narrowed 
to around 137 billion for 1988 a sharp improvement over the record 
1703 billion in 1987 
the last time the deficit narrowed was during president carters 
last year in office it widened during each year of president 
reagans administration 
until recent months poor trade reports induced currency dealers 
to dump dollars out of fear that the dollar would need to decline to 
make americanmade goods competitive in world markets 
but after the surprisingly bad november report heavy buying 
pushed the dollar higher spurring a rise in stocks and bonds 
analysts at a loss to explain the market reaction fully attributed 
it largely to technical factors 
reaction by the fickle financial markets to fridays report is 
unpredictable many economists believe decembers deficit shrank 
slightly from november 
some economists believe that the kind of strong growth in exports 
that would be needed to shrink the deficit would be inflationary 
because american industry is already running close to full capacity 
reduction in the budget deficit would give the economy some 
slack giving more room for the manufacturing sector to pick up 
speed some economists say 
we should ask if we need an improvement in the trade balance 
before we lower the budget deficit said robert lawrence senior 
fellow at the brookings institution in washington 
in the context of the overall economy i guess you can say its 
not so bad that the trade deficit hasnt improved he said 
the dollar has been supported lately by high us interest rates 
which make dollardenominated securities attractive at the same 
time the federal reserve and other central banks have stepped in to 
prop the dollar up whenever it went into a steep slide 
both those factors have made the markets pay less attention to 
unfavorable trade numbers 
what the markets are saying is that if the trade numbers are 
adverse they can count on the fed to take remedial action so it 
makes them less uncomfortable said carol stone senior economist 
with nomura securities international inc 
one economist who is concerned about the trade deficit robert 
brusca of nikko securities co international inc said the first 
annual decline in the trade deficit in eight years obscures the 
recent negative trend 
if you look at the annual decline you get a picture of 
progress but that just reflects the first half the second half 
doesnt reflect progress he said 
more significant than the growth in imports brusca believes is 
the slowdown in the export growth rate with no clear evidence that 
is has bottomed out 
the brookings institutions lawrence said there are signs that 
the inaugural euphoria is wearing off and that the financial markets 
might be more inclined to take the trade numbers seriously this time 
around 
i see more of a chance that the dollar would take it if we see 
a surprisingly large widening of the deficit lawrence said but 
if we see big trade numbers and nothing happens i guess we can 
expect that too

spending is down unemployment and 
bankruptcies are up and norways oilbased economy is still 
recovering from the morningafter effects of a 15year binge the 
head of the central bank said thursday 
tough government measures last year made headway in limiting 
wages trimming inflation and swinging foreign trade into the black 
said bank of norway director hermod skaanland 
there are no easy solutions to the problems we are facing 
fifteen years of speculation oil boom and an everincreasing 
standard of living have put us where we are today said skaanland 
skaanlands address to the banks steering committee coincided 
with the publication of the 1988 balance sheet which showed an 
increase of 274 percent to 79 billion kronor or about 118 
billion the bank transferred 112 billion to the state treasury 
skaanland said the end was near for norways era of petroleum 
wealth which began with the 1969 discovery of oil off its north sea 
coast production in 1989 is expected to average 144 million 
barrels per day 
we are already approaching the peak in our oil production he 
said it will continue to increase for a few more years and then 
begin to taper off in the late 1990s 
skaanland urged the labor government of prime minister gro harlem 
brundtland to continue the belttightening measures started after 
oil prices collapsed in 1986 
last year most of us began to feel the direct effect of 
norways new economic reality the feeling of job security is 
lower than at any time since world war ii he said 
unemployment doubled last year to 4 percent of the work force 
the highest rate since the 1930s during 1988 3494 companies filed 
bankruptcy petitions up 81 percent over 1987 many of them were 
forced out of business by high interest rates and a drop in private 
consumption by 16 percent 
he urged the government to continue keeping the lid on wages to 
help norway regain its international competitiveness a wage limit 
last year helped bring inflation down to 56 percent from 7 percent 
in 1987 foreign trade scored a 1988 surplus of 618 million 
norways 1988 banking crisis cost banks more than 104 billion 
in losses on loans according to official estimates skaanland said 
these losses were due to bad banking bad policies and bad luck 
even if banks show significant losses in 1989 as well we 
expect net results to show an improvement he said

last weeks deep freeze could have walloped 
californias citrus groves but officials said thursday a blend of 
hard work timing and good luck spared the crop from a devastating 
loss 
it would have been a disaster and it just didnt develop 
said denny myers vice president of agricultural affairs for dole 
citrus overall were just not seeing it 
growers said it was still too early to provide a full damage 
report from the recordbreaking cold weather which brought snow to 
malibu and left icicles clinging to california oranges 
the san joaquin valley navel orange crop was damaged but did not 
suffer a major internal freeze as some growers had feared orange 
rinds were scarred by ice which means fruit will be downgraded in 
packing sheds and command a lower price those interviewed said 
valley lemons were hurt the worst with estimates ranging from 20 
to 50 percent of the existing crop lost to the freeze officials 
said but san joaquin valley lemons total only 10 percent of the 
californiaarizona crop and about half the valley lemons had been 
picked and stored before the freeze said curt anderson spokesman 
for sunkist in van nuys 
we dont see it as enough to be that concerned anderson said 
southern californias citrus groves largely escaped freeze damage 
because santa ana winds kept the cold temperatures from damaging the 
crop anderson said but those winds scarred fruit and knocked some 
of it to the ground 
citrus is damaged when the mercury remains at 26 degrees or lower 
for four hours or more in one part of tulare county which boasts a 
357 million citrus crop temperatures last week stayed at 23 
degrees for 8 hours 
a sudden burst of warm weather still could harm the oranges by 
frost causing frosttinged fruit to swell with liquid and drop from 
the frozen stems officials warned 
growers throughout the valley got hit it was a democratic 
freeze said joel nelson president of visaliabased california 
citrus mutual which represents 800 growers who raise 50000 acres 
of citrus trees 
but there was room for optimism regarding the valencia orange 
crop which has three months to recover from the frosts bite before 
harvest 
i dont think consumers will see a large cost increase said 
nelson reflecting the view of several industry officials id be 
very surprised if they see a major increase at the retail level 
wholesale orange prices generally have increased 150 to 2 a 
box in the last week due to the freeze and retail prices have gone 
up 20 cents a pound in some outlets said rod rosales a buyer for 
ok produce in fresno before the freeze a 40pound box of 
mediumsized oranges cost 650 
mike burchett general manager of central valley citrus 
association in tulare county predicted frost damaged 10 percent to 
15 percent of the navel crop which is in harvest now 
growers credit the crops apparent survival to a number of 
factors said myers of dole 
farmers ran warm water in groves burned fuel oil and cranked up 
giant fans to raise the temperature around the trees the cold 
weather came later than usual which is good news since the crop 
contained a higher sugar content and that acted much like 
antifreeze myers said

soft drink giants cocacola co and pepsicola 
co each claimed thursday they had been vindicated by the television 
networks in their latest advertising spat 
cocacola said it agreed to make what it called two minor 
alterations in its new ads that claim a move is on from 
regular pepsi to diet coke 
the atlantabased company said the revised campaign would 
continue to air on network television 
diet coke wins again the company said 
but pepsicola which had complained to the networks that the 
diet coke spot was false and misleading said the requested 
alterations represented fundamental changes 
they called a foul against coke we are overjoyed said 
tod mackenzie a spokesman for pepsi in somers ny 
at the same time pepsi said it had voluntarily withdrawn its ad 
that poked fun at how cocacola came up with its claims showing 
executives poring over soft drink statistics while wearing 
distorting 3d glasses 
mackenzie said its ad was aired only as an interim measure while 
the networks reviewed its complaint abot the diet coke ads 
in the original series of ads launched in late january cocacola 
took the unusual step of positioning diet coke against the sugared 
version of pepsi 
last year nearly two million families stopped buying pepsi and 
more of them moved to diet coke than any other major soft drink 
the diet coke ads said 
after a review by the networks cocacola said it agreed to 
change the second part of its claim to say and about a half 
million of them moved to diet coke 
cocacola also agreed to indicate on the screen the name of the 
research company that came up with the data supporting its claim and 
note that it includes both diet coke and caffeinefree diet coke
