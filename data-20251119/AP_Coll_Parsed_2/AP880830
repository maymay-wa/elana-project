leaking rocket fuel 
forced the evacuation of a titan 2 launch pad during the weekend 
the air force said tuesday 
the air force declined to confirm whether the mishap sunday 
delayed the classified launch of four navy spy satellites 
john pike a space policy expert at the washingtonbased 
federation of american scientists said last week that a classified 
titan 2 launch was expected soon 
he said the onetime intercontinental ballistic missile in its 
maiden flight as a space booster was almost certain to carry into 
orbit a set of four white cloud navy ocean surveillance system 
satellites designed to eavesdrop on radio and radar transmissions 
by the soviet fleet 
the air force and martin marietta corp have previously said 
that space launch complex 4 west will be used to launch refurbished 
titan 2s carrying military payloads 
we had a minor vapor escape of monomethyl hydrazine at space 
launch complex 4 west this weekend said capt john sullivan a 
spokesman for the air force space and missile test organization at 
this military base 140 miles northwest of los angeles 
the leak was detected by our sensors and the pad was evacuated 
with our safety procedures he added the vapor dispersed 
harmlessly into the atmosphere at no time was there any danger to 
the base or community population in nearby vandenberg village or 
the neighboring city of lompoc 
sullivan emphasized the leak wasnt serious but said he didnt 
know how many people were evacuated from the launch pad 
he also declined comment on whether a titan 2 was being loaded 
with the hydrazine fuel to prepare it for a classified launch 
for about 25 years titan 2 rockets served as icbms each 
carrying a ninemegaton hydrogen warhead maintenance and safety 
problems spurred removal of the obsolete missiles from their silos 
in arkansas kansas and arizona 
the air force has ordered 13 titan 2s reconditioned as space 
boosters under a 5289 million contract with martin marietta 
because it was cheaper than building new rockets

the agriculture department says there is some 
likelihood that farmers net cash income in 1989 will drop from 
this years level even if there are droughtbusting rains and 
production increases 
according to the departments economic research service 
production expenses may increase substantially in calendar 
1989 judging from what has happened after previous droughts and an 
expected boost in plantings as a result of relaxed acreage 
setaside requirements 
as in the second half of 1988 higher feed prices will affect 
1989s costs the agency said in a new outlook report higher 
prices for feeder cattle likely will help boost livestock incomes 
for crops bigger planted acreage will boost expenditures for seed 
fertilizer chemical and fuels 
the report in the september issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine by economists richard kodl and andrew bernat said 1988 net 
cash farm income is expected to be in the range of 55 billion to 
60 billion near last years record of 571 billion 
they offered no specific figure for 1989 income 
bernat said monday that the first official projections for 1989 
farm income wont be made until november but that we thought it 
would add something to the report by including some of the 
factors down the road 
as used by the agency net cash income in a calendar year is the 
difference between gross cash income which includes government 
payments in addition to farm sales receipts and cash expenses 
the economists noted that higher prices for some commodities hit 
hard by drought have more than offset losses due to drought on a 
national scale the rub is that only those farmers whose crops were 
not hurt severely are able to benefit from the higher prices 
unless they hold inventories from earlier harvests 
for 1988 crop sales receipts are forecast at 66 billion to 68 
billion up from 59 billion in 1987 and reversing two years of 
decline the report said livestock receipts this year may be in 
the range of 77 billion to 79 billion compared with 77 billion 
in 1987 
consistent with recent droughts this years livestock 
receipts will probably be relatively stable the report said 
this years smaller cattle herd appears to limit cullings thus 
preventing substantial price weakening 
the report added also contributing to lowerthanexpected 
cullings is the fact that the five largest cattleproducing states 
texas nebraska kansas colorado and oklahoma have not been as 
hard hit by the drought as many other states 
crop deficiency payments to farmers are declining as a result of 
higher market prices with the greatest effects likely in 1989 
also if a large portion of the 39 billion drought emergency 
payments authorized recently go to farmers by the years end that 
will mean further 1989 reductions in benefits 
following the drought next years crop prices may remain 
higher and crop production will increase the report said 
this would boost total cash receipts however it seems unlikely 
that revenue gains will compensate for reduced federal supports and 
higher operating costs

fed by what appears to be another bumper 
cotton crop in the making the us supply could be pushed to a 
22year high in 198889 according to agriculture department 
analysts 
based on aug 1 indications the cotton harvest could be 149 
million bales up from 148 million bales last year the increase 
would result from a larger acreage this year despite a reduction 
in peracre yields 
in all counting cotton left over from previous harvests the 
total 198889 supply will be about 205 million bales the most 
since the 196667 season the departments economic research 
service said monday 
because domestic and export use is not keeping pace with 
production the us cotton stockpile when the next marketing year 
begins on aug 1 1989 could rise to 89 million bales from an 
estimated carryover of 56 million bales this aug 1 the agency 
reported 
meanwhile world cotton production in 198889 is expected to 
rise to nearly 86 million bales up 7 percent from last season 
foreign production at about 71 million bales is expected to gain 
5 million bales including record crops in india greece turkey 
and australia 
world cotton consumption forecast at nearly 83 million bales 
will about match last season the report said cotton use is 
expected to increase primarily among producing countries while 
falling among importers 
as a result world cotton stocks are expected to increase nearly 
9 percent in 198889 to more than 35 million bales by the end of 
the season all of the buildup will occur in the united states 
while foreign inventories are expected to decline 2 percent 
the report said us cotton has not been priced competitively 
in world markets for several months and that reduced export 
sales along with large crops last year and in 1988 translate into 
the rise in inventories

the air force says safety concerns prompted 
its request that nasa cut back drastically on the number of people 
allowed on a closein press site to cover next months launch of 
space shuttle discovery 
in the past there have been as many as 3500 people on the 
press mound during a launch at cape canaveral fla said william 
sheehan chief spokesman for the national aeronautics and space 
administration nasa already has processed 2600 news media 
applications for the discovery launch 
sheehan declined to specify the number the air force wants to 
allow but the number circulating around the kennedy space center 
in florida is 100 including nasa public affairs personnel those 
excluded would be allowed back onto the press site soon after the 
shuttle lifts off 
as discussions with the air force continued top nasa managers 
met monday and decided not to set a specific launch date until 
after a detailed preparedness review on sept 1314 nasa has been 
working toward a liftoff of the first postchallenger mission in 
the last week of september 
the air force which has jurisdiction over safety at nasas 
kennedy facility is worried about flying shrapnel should one of 
the solid rocket boosters explode 
they are asking us what are the minimum numbers you can have 
there and still be able to operate effectively sheehan said he 
said 6000 to 7000 space center workers not involved with the 
shuttle on the pad also might be barred for some period preceding 
launches 
the press site and nasas huge vehicle assembly building are 42 
miles from pad 34b reporters have been there for every launch 
beginning with the apollo program in 1967 
they have some real basis for concern sheehan said it 
came about because of what they learned after the challenger 
accident and what they learned from the atlas that had to be 
destroyed 
what they learned is you cant predict where its going to go 
it can go down it can go forward it can go up 
after the challenger shuttle was engulfed in flames 73 seconds 
after liftoff on jan 28 1986 killing its crew of seven the 
challengers booster rockets careened about over the atlantic for 
another minute before they were destroyed by a command from the air 
force safety officer 
in march 1987 an atlas centaur rocket had to be destroyed 51 
seconds into its flight when it started to tumble no one on the 
ground was injured in either incident 
before challenger sheehan said engineers assumed the booster 
rockets would continue on the same path if they were released 
during flight perhaps tumbling 
the detonation of the srb is not as clean as everyone thought 
it was he said it breaks apart at different times and has 
debris as large as an automobile and as small as a piece of small 
shrapnel the issue concerns the spread of debris and the 
fragmentation of the srb when it disintegrates

the man who would be president came to 
the shores of pontoosuc lake with a mission and a rather large 
following 
the housing development here was one stop monday for michael 
dukakis on a nostalgic trip with all the trappings of a 
gubernatorial reelection campaign talk of the rebound from 
doubledigit unemployment plans to convert an abandoned mill into 
a major art museum and praise of partnership after partnership 
that has spurred western massachusetts sudden resurgence 
it was the sixth such annual visit for dukakis but this time 
things are a bit different hes running for president not 
governor 
while george bush and running mate dan quayle denounce dukakis 
as soft on crime and weak on defense while questioning his 
patriotism dukakis has spent two days in each of the past three 
weeks touring his home state talking about home ownership health 
care economic development and drunken driving those are all 
important issues to be sure but such talk has for the most part 
been lost in the aggressive tone of the early campaign 
on monday for example bush toured a missouri defense plant and 
characterized dukakis as opposed to every modern weapon system 
since the slingshot 
dukakis was here at a lakefront housing development touting his 
homeownership opportunity program which made it possible for 
moderateincome families to buy their first homes in an area that 
otherwise would have been out of their price range 
this at a time when dukakis is being criticized for allowing his 
presidential campaign to lose its edge and bush to surge ahead in 
the polls 
i am the sitting governor of this state and ive got to do my 
job was dukakis straight answer to a simple question what was 
he doing here 
there were complaints from dukakis aides that his message was 
being obscured by coverage of the attacks on dukakis by bush and 
the controversy over the quayle selection 
its been a little difficult to get through dukakis said in 
a huge understatment 
but the problems arent all the doings of bush and the medias 
quayle hunt 
dukakis has offered few new national ideas during his regional 
trips at home and has focused most of his dicussion on state 
programs 
many of these initiatives in fact are models for the nation 
used as examples in shaping congressional proposals ranging from 
the national economic development act to major welfare reform 
and had these trips come at another time dukakis might get out 
of them what his campaign wants media coverage of some of his most 
successful programs several of which he touts almost daily when 
campaigning for the presidency 
but with bush and quayle crisscrossing the country pushing 
their agenda and slamming dukakis his attempt to talk about 
publicprivate partnership health care and jobs to bring the 
campaign in dukakis words up where it belongs has been 
frustrating 
bush for sure hasnt faced any questions or protests lately 
over the route 7 interchange proposal here in pittsfield but 
opponents of the plan to widen the rural highway from two lanes to 
four at the cost of more than 20 homes turned out monday 
dukakis appears undaunted by the recent criticism much of which 
has come from the large media contigent he has brought with him to 
pittsfield this week lawrence last week and worcester the week 
before 
i am a sitting governor and i do have a responsibility to the 
citizens of this state he told curious reporters monday 
but his postlabor day schedule will have him in massachusetts 
less frequently and his only remaining regional visit to 
southeastern massachusetts is scheduled for just one day 
none of the criticism of the backyard stumping has been lost on 
dukakis who was perhaps mindful of it when he delivered this 
promise monday the dog days of august are almost over

americans are giving less to the two major 
political parties and republicans hold a smaller fundraising lead 
over democrats than before the federal election commission says 
the fec said in a report released monday that contributions to 
five fundraising committees operated by each party totaled some 
226 million during the first 18 months of the 198788 election 
cycle 
that was well below the 267 million the 10 committees took in 
during the corresponding period in 198384 when ronald reagan was 
heading for a second term as president 
the 226 million also was about 1 million below the combined 
take for the first 18 months of the 198586 cycle a 
nonpresidential election period when contributions usually are 
less than in presidential years 
the fec said contributions to the five gop committees totaled 
16619 million during the 18 months ending june 30 compared with 
5984 million raised by the five democratic counterparts in the 
same period 
that left the republicans in front by 10635 million but their 
lead was smaller than the 1527 million bulge during the 
corresponding period in 198586 and the 14785 million advantage 
for the first three quarters of the 198384 election cycle 
the federal election commission report covered the finances of 
the democratic and republican national committees their house and 
senate campaign committees their national convention funds and 
their statelocal finance committees 
the republican national committee saw its 198788 receipts fall 
to 6158 million the lowest point for a similar 18month period 
during the reagan presidency corresponding figures were 6416 
million in 198586 7523 million in 198384 and 6575 million in 
198182 
kathryn murray the committees communications director blamed 
the falloff on poor response to the gops directmail solicitations 
in the first and second quarters of 1987 
during this period the scandals that rocked the television 
evangelists hurt directmail appeals by the gop and a variety of 
nonpolitical fundraisers according to murray 
she said that since then contributions have picked up with the 
second quarter of this year running second only to a threemonth 
period in 1984 
the national republican senatorial committee and national 
republican congressional committee which support gop candidates in 
races for congress also showed lower receipts in the first 18 
months of this election cycle 
the senate committee reported contributions of 423 million 
down from a 1980s high of 6581 million in 198586 the house 
apparatus had receipts of 2132 million nearly half the 4196 it 
had in the first 18 months of the 198384 cycle 
on the democratic side contributions to the five entities in 
the current cycle were only about 98000 above where they were at 
the same period in the last presidential cycle 
the democratic national committee which relies less than its 
republican counterpart on directmail solicitations had receipts 
of 1685 million down from the 2976 million taken in during 
198384 
this drop however was offset by increased giving to the 
democrats house and senate committees and their committees for 
state and local party affairs 
the senate panel received 1142 million compared with a 
previous high of 756 million in 198586 the house panel was at 
945 million up from 874 million in 198586 the statelocal 
share was 1264 million compared with a previous high of 1097 
million in 198384

a pair of entrepreneurs turned 
rejection into a profitable business venture by creating a 
fraternity that anybody can join even women and everybody is 
president 
fraternities are elitist organizations said ronald 
southwick cofounder of sigma phi nothing we feel that everyone 
should be special 
southwick 24 his 21yearold partner joe toth launched sigma 
phi nothing after an unhappy rush week at one of michigan state 
universitys fraternity houses 
i got in and joe didnt and that kind of upset us both so i 
decided not to join southwick said 
later they figured the rejection signified nothing sparking 
the sigma phi nothing idea 
so the two invented their own fraternity created a logo and 
held a dont rush relax party they brought 48 sigma phi 
nothing tshirts which quickly were sold at 10 a shirt 
as their story spread they sold more than 300 shirts in a few 
weeks 
then a marketing company expressed interest in selling the 
fraternity idea nationwide the two have spent the summer 
developing plans for selling the tshirts at big ten schools this 
fall 
so far the fledgling company has expanded its inventory to 
include sweatshirts corduroy caps and bumper stickers and the 
tshirt price has risen to 11

the electoral college on monday ended a 
23hour session by approving the last of 300 congressmen elected 
directly to the chamber of deputies during balloting in july that 
the opposition says was fraudulent 
the body then postponed until tuesday night its certification of 
the elections of 200 other deputies assigned to the different 
parties according to a proportional representation formula 
the electoral college made up of the newly elected members of 
the chamber of deputies began its marathon session at 1 pm 
sunday and ended it shortly after noon monday 
protests from opposition parties accusing the governing 
institutional revolutionary party known as the pri of fraud in 
the july 6 elections delayed the certification process 
the delay raised the small possibility there would not be a 
quorum for the opening session of congress on thursday and 
threatened president miguel de la madrids state of the nation 
speech that day 
under the constitution the president must attend the opening 
session and by tradition that is when he delivers the state of the 
nation address 
if the pri does not have the 251 seats for a majority in the 
500member chamber of deputies an opposition boycott could cancel 
the session 
the electoral college began the certification process seat by 
seat on aug 15 and in the results announed monday the pri won 235 
of the 300 seats the conservative national action party had 36 and 
leftist parties backing presidential candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas 
received 29 
an earlier official vote count by the federal election 
commission gave the pri 247 seats in the 500 member chamber and 
opposition parties 227 with 26 in dispute 
the pri has dominated mexican politics since 1929 and this year 
for the first time it will not have the twothirds majority 
required to amend the constitution 
opposition parties claim the election commission has not 
released results from about 25000 polling places they say those 
would show that carlos salinas de gortari the pri presidential 
candidate did not win the 5036 percent of the vote awarded him in 
official results 
cardenas received 3112 percent of the vote in the official 
results and manuel j clouthier the candidate of the national 
action party 1707 percent 
in early september the electoral college of the chamber of 
deputies is to confirm salinas as presidentelect 
the senates electoral college has finished certifying all its 
members parties backing cardenas won four of the 64 seats marking 
the first time the pri had lost any seats in the upper house

the reagan administration is abandoning 
efforts to get the palestine liberation office kicked out of 
offices at the united nations in new york while continuing to 
fight any attempt to reopen a plo office in washington the justice 
department says 
the reagan administration following what one source described 
as a bitter internal fight over the plo issue decided not to 
appeal a judges ruling that allowed the plo to maintain its un 
office 
a yearold law had ordered the administration to close plo 
facilities in both new york and washington but us district judge 
edmund l palmieri on june 29 struck down the provision regarding 
the un office saying obligations to the international body took 
precedence 
monday was the deadline for appealing palmieris order 
the justice department said the decision not to fight palmieris 
order was based on a determination that on balance the 
interests of the united states are best served by not appealing 
the department said its normal policy was to appeal adverse 
district court decisions of this kind but it was decided in 
light of foreign policy considerations including the us role as 
host to the un organization not to appeal in this instance 
the department said however it would continue to oppose any 
effort to reopen the plos washington office 
the state department had opposed justice department efforts to 
launch an appeal according to us officials who spoke on condition 
they not be identified 
the antiterrorism act of 1987 required closure of the plos 
un and washington offices on ground that the organization 
sponsors terrorism 
the administration had opposed enactment of the antiterrorism 
measure saying it could possibly violate international 
obligations but once the act became law the administration moved 
to enforce it 
the washington office which has no un affiliation was shut 
down but palmieri said the new york office must remain open 
because of the us obligations under the un headquarters 
agreement 
the plos representative in washington hassan abdul rahman 
praised the administrations decision saying it is the only 
sensible thing to do because otherwise they would have pursued the 
misguided policy of confrontation with the un and of acquiescence 
with the proisrael lobby in congress 
abdul rahman whose palestine information office was shut down 
by the state department last year now heads the palestine affairs 
center which operates out of the arab league offices 
republican sens jesse helms of north carolina and william roth 
of delaware had urged the administration to proceed with an appeal 
at issue is the question of who determines the sovereign 
powers of the united states the congress and the president 
through the constitutional process or the united nations and a 
single district court judge in new york helms wrote in a letter 
to white house chief of staff kenneth duberstein 
roth and helms both said the fbis ability to control access to 
the united states would be hampered by allowing the plo office to 
remain open roth added there was clear and irrefutable 
evidence that the plo sponsored terrorism 
roth in a letter to attorney general richard thornburgh last 
week said he intended to proceed further in this matter once 
congress returns after the august recess

burmas besieged government and 
military may be deliberately pushing the country toward anarchy in 
an attempt to reassert control after 26 years of authoritarian 
rule diplomats and other analysts say 
remaining silent since aug 19 the government has withdrawn 
troops and police from the streets while looting and other crimes 
reportedly go unchecked civilian administration has ceased to 
function in many areas 
there have been increasing reports and some witness accounts of 
military agents seeking to provoke tensions the state media has 
reported nine almost simultaneous prison uprisings in widely 
different areas of the country and the escape or release of nearly 
9000 inmates 
my impression is it is strongly possible that this chaos is 
being planned by state authorities to give them good reasons to 
intervene eventually said a japanese diplomat in rangoon the 
burmese capital 
however others also speaking on condition of anonymity 
caution that with virtually no access to the current leadership 
analysts can at best make educated guesses on its intentions 
one western diplomat watching developments from bangkok said the 
drift towards chaos may simply reflect confusion within the 
leadership coupled with an arrogance an unwillingess to accept 
that they have to give up 
theres an obvious vacuum with students and others trying to 
find some leadership the obvious people to step into the vacuum 
are the military conspiratorially or not an asian diplomat in 
bangkok said 
the leadership withdrew into itself following the announcement 
aug 19 after months of bloody antigovernment rioting in which 
hundreds were killed that civilian lawyer maung maung had 
replaced the widely hated sein lwin as president and head of the 
sole political party 
maung maungs promise of a referendum on sept 12 that would 
pave the way for democracy did not quiet the protests that have 
erupted throughout burma in the past month 
unsatisfied opposition leaders demanded an interim government 
and the end of oneparty rule a number of burmese and some 
outsider observers believed that ne win who formally retired in 
late july after wielding almost absolute power for 26 years was 
still pulling strings behind the scenes along with loyal military 
officers 
leaders have urged that demonstrations remain peaceful so the 
government cannot take advantage of the turmoil 
the public must be united and well disciplined people must 
be alert to prevent machinations of destructive elements to create 
anarchy in the country a former defense minister tin oo told 
an antigovernment rally last week 
in rangoon and other areas democracy centers and block 
committees have replaced judicial and civil authorities to maintain 
law and order 
whether such makeshift measures will stop the growing 
lawlessness widespread strikes soaring commodity prices and food 
shortages remains a crucial question 
one swedish journalist and burma expert bertil lintner notes 
that ne win and his military followers used the pretext of domestic 
turmoil and threats to national security to seize power from a 
democratic government in 1962 
the government cant control the situation so they are letting 
things get worse they hope the people will beg them to come back 
its vicious lintner said quoting a burmese proverb that 
translates if you cant eat the beef yourself throw sand on 
it 
one bangkokbased diplomat said the students and other 
antigovernment forces might react dramatically to keep up their 
hitherto remarkable momentum 
the students have been the engine of change and used a lot of 
imagination but now they have to take a new initiative he said 
there appears to be a paralysis in the government a hiatus 
has set in and nobody knows what to do next the diplomat said 
referring to ne win he added in every dictator there is an 
element of contempt for the people he cant accept that the people 
no longer want him

a federally ordered building ban on major new 
southern california polluters is largely symbolic because the 
region has no plans for heavy industries fuel refineries or power 
generating plants officials say 
the environmental protection agency on monday announced plans to 
ban construction of industry emitting more than 100 tons of carbon 
monoxide or ozone pollutants a year as a congressional moratorium 
on such sanctions expires 
the ban could be extended to more than a dozen other us 
locations including denver and suburban chicago 
the los angeles basin comes under the sanctions slated to take 
effect at midnight because the air pollution control plan submitted 
to the agency was rejected 
the order came as no surprise to james m lents executive 
officer of the south coast air quality management district who 
said it would do nothing to reduce smog in the nations largest and 
most populous urban area 
a lawsuit by environmentalists resulted in a january federal 
court order requiring the epa to reject the los angeles plan 
because it failed to bring regional air quality into compliance 
with a 10year deadline set by the 1977 clean air act lents said 
weve known for some time that if congress didnt act the 
construction ban would go into effect said lents who oversees 
smog eradication efforts in los angeles orange san bernardino and 
riverside counties 
but he said the epa ban only affects heavy sources of pollution 
such as oil refineries power plants or automotive factories no 
such plants are planned for the region lents said 
based on the permit applications weve received this year and 
last the ban will have absolutely no effect on smog abatement in 
the short run lents said adding that it will take at least 20 
years to clear southern california smog to acceptable levels 
there will be some psychological impact certainly lents 
said 
he said he hoped the epa move would spur congress to revise the 
clean air act and allow cities more time to clear smog 
a complete solution calls for federal action he said 
congress needs something to motivate them but im afraid this 
wont be enough 
mayor tom bradley hailed the ban as a signal that the federal 
government cares about reducing air pollution even though the 
effects may be insignificant 
while it will not have a major impact on the southern 
california economy bradley said the construction ban on major 
stationary pollution sources reemphasizes the difficult air 
quality challenge facing cities and counties of this area 
the epas announcement followed a weekend air pollution 
summit at city hall organized by the coalition for clean air and 
campaign california which were brought together by assemblyman tom 
hayden 
among other proposals speakers called for tight controls on 
urban growth 
los angeles has intolerable levels of air pollution hayden 
said im told current smog levels will expose everybody in the 
basin to toxic pollution 200 to 300 percent above acceptable health 
standards 
los angeles was one of about 100 metropolitan areas that the epa 
said missed decembers deadline to contain smog at acceptable 
levels because of its weather and terrain los angeles has by far 
the nations highest ozone concentrations 
lents said his agency will present a draft of a new 20year smog 
reduction plan that would go to the epa for approval 
before the end of the year the epa expects to adopt a policy 
requiring areas not meeting pollution standards to demonstrate 
steady progress with a goal of an average 3 percent reduction in 
pollution concentrations annually 
when it adopts that policy the agency will decide whether to 
impose construction bans at denver reno nev bakersfield 
sacramento and fresno calif east st louis ill the indiana 
suburbs of louisville ky cleveland atlanta and dallas 
decisions on similar construction bans are pending for ventura 
county and for the indiana and illinois suburbs of chicago

thirty years of 
firefighting havent steeled fire boss dave ponce poncin 
against the worst fear a commander harbors while calling the shots 
against a fire 
i think the biggest fear is killing someone injuring 
people poncin said during a break from his command of the 
85000acre north fork fire that is eating through yellowstone 
national parks forests 
he especially dreads aircraft accidents 
when a helicopter goes down there are usually fatalities 
when there arent you count your blessings 
but in eight years as a fire boss the softspoken man who seems 
to have a minute for everyone has never realized his greatest fear 
he knows too that hes been lucky 
poncin called a helicopter crash earlier this month in the 
bighorn national forest in which one firefighter died and three 
were injured a harbinger or an alert for his squad of 
tactical firefighters 
its not unexpected he added 
it just seems like theres more potential for accidents 
poncin said especially considering the long weeks of firefighting 
the beating the helicopters take and the stress that the crews and 
the machines endure 
relaxing in a lawn chair at his madison junction fire base the 
51yearold poncin looked back on his 30 years with the us forest 
service and didnt mention a single regret he also said hes 
learned how to live with but not forget his fears 
it accumulates with you and when you think back over the 
years you think of the bad things he said 
as a boy growing up in cedar rapids iowa he looked up to his 
uncle in montana and longed for the day when he could head west and 
join the forest service poncin got his chance out of high school 
when he worked as a smoke jumper parachuting into strategic hot 
spots in northern idaho to pay his way through college 
now based in idahos nez perce national forest where he is an 
assistant to the forest supervisor poncin spends summers as the 
leader of 10 people who make up one of the nations few forest fire 
overhead teams who coordinate the firefighting of major forest 
fires 
from the beginning of may until the end of october he and his 
team live on twohour standby always knowing that wherever they 
are they can immediately be summoned to a fire 
but poncin wouldnt want it any other way 
firefighting is a lot like circuses he said it gets in 
your blood part of it is the people you work with part of it is 
the challenge of chasing and catching a big fire 
in yellowstone during this unusually dry summer poncin has 
mostly been chasing 
he spent 14 days as commanding the forces for the snake 
complex a collection of three tricky fires that by monday had 
charred 92000 acres in yellowstone 
less than a week later he was sent back to yellowstone this 
time to oversee the north fork fire which twice threatened the old 
faithful geyser complex burned across the madison river and 
through norris 
married 28 years poncins wife and two sons have grown 
accustomed to his being away from home summers and his wife is 
quick to tell young women to steer their affections clear of 
firefighters he said 
i think shes gotten used to it poncin added chuckling 
its hard on a wife and family but its a commitment they make 
he realizes too that his family may not have to make that 
commitment for much longer 
i hear the engines of a retirement plane warming up on the 
runway poncin said

nasa engineers say they can begin 
final testing of space shuttle discoverys payload now that a 100 
million spacecrafttracking satellite has been loaded into the 
cargo bay 
the tests are scheduled for the first two weeks of september and 
are intended to ensure the payload nearly identical to one 
destroyed in the 1986 challenger explosion was installed properly 
said george diller a spokesman for the national aeronautics and 
space administration 
one test will involve the launch control center in florida and 
one will involve a groundbased tracking station at white sands 
nm 
the tracking and data relay satellite designed to help ground 
controllers monitor shuttles and their payloads is the principal 
cargo for the 26th space shuttle mission scheduled for launch in 
late september or early october 
loading the satellite took 10 hours monday and was completed 
with no significant problems diller said deployment of the 
satellite is set for the first day of the fourday discovery 
mission 
payload engineers and technicians wary of the potential of 
lightning from a tropical weather system that moved up the coast 
had been working feverishly during the weekend to prepare for the 
satelliteloading 
nasa officials in washington meanwhile decided not to announce 
a date for the resumption of space shuttle flights until after a 
review sept 1314 said spokesman jim kast 
nasa had scheduled and postponed the launch five dates 
previously beginning with july 15 1987 the us manned space 
program has been grounded since the january 1986 challenger 
explosion that killed seven astronauts

a virus common in dogs has 
killed more than 11000 seals in western europes coastal waters 
this summer and humans can do little to stop the spread of the 
disease a dutch biologist says 
up to 80 percent of the seals in the north sea and kattegat 
waters between denmark and sweden might die ab osterhaus told a 
news conference monday 
canine distemper virus or a closely related virus is the 
primary cause of the seal deaths said osterhaus in this northern 
dutch village which has western europes largest seal nursery 
the virus causes infections of the respiratory and central 
nervous systems and the digestive tracts osterhaus said no 
specific cure exists for seals with the virus 
distemper may have spread to seals when one was bitten by a dog 
said osterhaus who works for the dutch national institute for 
public health and environmental protection 
specialists in western europe who have been investigating the 
seal deaths have speculated that pollution has played a role in the 
killer epidemic 
osterhaus said research is still being conducted to determine if 
the massive pollution of western european waters could have 
accelerated the epidemic by weakening seals immune systems 
we know that certain substances we find in the seas today 
can affect the immune system he said pollution may have 
triggered the thing but it was not the cause as such 
osterhaus said antibodies to canine distemper virus were found 
in all of the dead seals he examined the development of these 
antibodies coincided clearly with the surfacing of symptoms of 
the disease 
a similar report was made at a news conference monday in 
stockholm sweden by patholigist anders bergman of stockholm 
universitys veterinary school he said he began suspecting in june 
that the canine distemper virus was linked to the seal deaths 
bengt klingeborn a virologist at the veterinary school said he 
believed the 25 percent of western european seals that have 
survived so far will live through the epidemic because they have 
developed antibodies 
osterhaus noted that there had been an outbreak of the canine 
distemper virus among dogs in greenland shortly before the epidemic 
broke out among seals early this year each summer thousands of 
seals migrate from greenland to western european waters 
osterhaus said his team had developed an experimental vaccine 
against the canine distemper virus but added it will not be 
possible to carry out preventive vaccinations in the wild 
sweden has reported 3400 dead seals denmark nearly 3000 west 
germany 3900 norway 600 and the netherlands 175

nearly 4000 years after it was built the 
funeral boat of one of egypts most powerful pharaohs takes another 
journey this week 
the delicate 32foot long wooden craft was gently lifted off 
the floor of the field museum of natural history on monday and 
rotated 180 degrees expert riggers who performed the tricky 
maneuver kept their hands off fearing sweat or body oils would 
harm the ancient wood 
today the boat used in the funeral of king senwosret iii in 
about 1850 bc will be moved inch by inch a few yards to its new 
setting in the museum a 22 million permanent exhibit 
when the exhibit opens in november it will allow visitors to 
walk through the eerie world of tombs mummies shrines to cat 
goddesses and other treasures from ancient egypt the museum said 
the exhibit would give visitors the only opportunity outside egypt 
to enter and explore a lifesize tomb complex 
king senwosrets boat a graceful crescentshaped canoelike 
craft is but one of more than a thousand artifacts and treasures 
from the museums collection used to recreate the burial scenes 
visitors enter the tomb chambers of the 5th dynasty pharaoh 
king unis dating to 2400 bc and excavated from saqqara egypt 
in 1908 
beneath a false door a 35foot burial shaft takes visitors into 
the dark and eerie burial chamber the sarcophagus is empty when 
it was excavated the pharaohs mummy was gone stolen by robbers 
or destroyed by time 
leaving the burial chamber the visitor passes through a roughly 
hewn tomb robbers tunnel and into another scene depicting a 
variety of egyptian burial rites 
this could well be the most fascinating part of the exhibit 
said its developer janet kamien it gives them visitors a 
chance to explore the ageold mysteries of mummies and life after 
death 
next month the museum staff will move 23 mummies into the 
exhibit along with the accouterments their souls were to take with 
them to the afterworld 
senwosrets boat will be displayed nearby 
no one actually knows if the boat was used to transport the 
kings body across the nile river to the burial site said frank 
yurco a scholar on ancient egypt at the oriental institute and a 
consultant on the museum project 
the boat was one of six found at the burial compound in 189394 
by jacques demorgan a welsh egyptologist two badly deteriorated

gangs of high school students are roving the 
industrial city of canton committing an increasing number of 
violent crimes an official newspaper reported today 
the legal daily fazhi ribao said students have murdered 
raped robbed and are imitating feudal and underworld practices 
by forming illegal gangs 
in another story the paper called on the police to protect 
railway passengers from bands of teenagers who raid trains and 
steal food and luggage 
lets deal with these little railroad guerrilla bands the 
paper said

been committed by the young hoodlums it did say that 769 students 
were convicted of violent crimes last year a 784 percent increase 
over 1986 
the paper said the students took to a life of crime mainly 
because they didnt have sufficient political education 
some teachers these days are more willing to give three 
classes in math and literature than one class in political 
studies the paper quoted one school principal as saying 
the paper also said pornographic and violenceoriented 
literature and videocassettes were to blame for encouraging 
students to break the law 
in addition it said an increasing number of students are 
leaving school early to work the paper said the dropouts exert a 
bad influence on their friends still in school 
china is in the midst of economic reforms that are transforming 
the social stucture of the nation violent crime especially 
robbery and corruption have risen dramatically in the past few 
years canton because it is in the forefront of the reforms is 
changing most rapidly 
in the report on the railroad guerrillas the paper related 
an incident that occurred on june 19 as a train entered a station 
in hunan province 
several dozen youngster ran to the train and began walking by 
the windows occasionally looking in the report said 
just as the train began moving these children shoved their 
hands in the windows and grabbed food beer bottles cans luggage 
and then fled with the goods 
said the report all the victims could do was curse

new york gov mario cuomo says he believes 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis will soon regain 
the political spotlight from rival george bush by refining his 
message of the need for change 
cuomo told a state capitol news conference monday attention in 
the campaign has remained centered on the republican ticket 
primarily because of the controversy surrounding the nomination of 
indiana sen dan quayle as bushs vice presidential running mate 
to me the problem is very simple said cuomo you go 
to the republican convention they get the focus were still in 
the republican convention because of this ironic twist that 
quayle kept the republicans in the mainstream with the light on 
them 
bush has used the spotlight to go on the offensive against 
dukakis cuomo said but he predicted interest would swing back 
towards dukakis as he focuses on americans desire for change

the chubb group and other insurance 
companies have been charged with violating ohio law by overselling 
drought insurance policies to farmers officials say 
the charges filed by ohio insurance director george fabe 
followed hearings on chubbs marketing practices at which farmers 
insurance agents and officials of chubb and other companies 
testified 
chubb also faces a classaction lawsuit by farmers in 10 states 
accusing it of reneging on its obligations to pay drought insurance 
claims 
in addition minnesota indiana and iowa have scheduled hearings 
regarding the drought insurance in their states 
the testimony gathered in the investigation shows that the 
companies involved failed to properly control the marketing of the 
insurance as a result there were numerous violations of ohios 
insurance laws neil rector deputy director of the department 
said monday 
fabe issued a 12count order against chubb subsidiary federal 
insurance co underwriter of the drought insurance 
other orders involving fewer counts were filed against chubbs 
administrator good weather international of jericho ny a good 
weather subsidiary good weather agriculture of fresno calif 
piogard ltd an insurance agency based in des moines iowa and 
piogard of ohio piogards ohio operation 
the order against chubb charges it with violating ohios 
deceptive practices act it also charges the company with using 
unlicensed agents and failing to file proper insurance policy forms 
a spokesman at chubbs warren nj headquarters said the 
company had not seen fabes orders and would not comment on them 
until it has time to review them 
penalties the department may impose range from reprimands to 
suspending or revoking their licenses to operate in ohio and fines 
of up to 25000 
the companies have 30 days to request a hearing on the charges 
while he said he did not believe the companies actions were 
premeditated fabe said the insurance was not carefully designed 
and controlled and was administered sloppily 
during june about 600 ohio farmers applied for the coverage 
but chubb announced in july that agents had oversold the policies 
and began returning premium payments 
fabe said that even after the insurance was oversold agents 
were at farmers homes into the early morning hours selling 
policies 
rains that have fallen in ohio since the hearings precluded many 
farmers from collecting on the policies but rector said that does 
not affect the departments investigation 
just because theres been no harm doesnt mean theres no 
foul he said 
two weeks ago a federal judge in cincinnati granted 
classaction status to lawsuits by farmers in 10 states against 
chubb the action allows other farmers to join the lawsuit the 
farmers involved live in ohio indiana kentucky tennessee 
michigan illinois missouri minnesota iowa and wisconsin 
the farmers say chubb sold them drought insurance but failed to 
pay their claims for damage from this years drought chubb has 
offered to repay farmers twice the amount they paid in premiums 
but some state insurance regulators have termed the offer 
inadequate 
chubb has maintained its innocence the company said it 
initially intended to underwrite 30 million in drought insurance 
nationwide but that a lastminute flurry of applications this 
spring resulted in potential liabilities of more than 400 million 
in recent weeks the company took out fullpage advertisements 
in newspapers around the country saying it has a longstanding 
reputation for business integrity

have you heard the one about the wisecracking 
political prankster who switched to standup comedy no one could 
tell the difference 
erstwhile yippie abbie hoffman fresh from a reunion of 
demonstrators from the 1968 democratic convention in chicago made 
his new york comedy debut monday night at an upper west side club 
hoffman whose humor and courtroom antics got national attention 
during the chicago 7 trial spent more than an hour needling 
actor in chief ronald reagan and the republicans and 
reminiscing 
predictably vicepresidential candidate dan quayle came in for 
a few jabs looks like a hawk runs like a chicken 
hoffman 51 wore a blue sweater with white stars and red 
stripes reminding the audience of his arrest for wearing similar 
garb in the 60s then stripped to a just say no tshirt 
in addition to politics and protest hoffmans topics of choice 
were drugs sex and religion straightforward jokes were rare and 
rambling stories and observations the norm 
as one of the 150 or so who paid 1350 for the show at stand up 
ny said jay leno doesnt have to worry hoffman had performed 
his comedy act in california and ohio before coming to new york 
during a questionandanswer session he was asked why he took 
up comedy he replied that his talks on college campuses always got 
laughs and it wasnt hard to pull out all the elements of humor 
from the talk 
hoffman who lives in pennsylvania spoke of his three children 
not a yuppie in the litter and proudly recounted how his 
16yearold son was thrown out of class for telling his teacher 
that if america is a melting pot then the indians must have been 
boiled alive

an alarming number of babies were exposed to 
drugs in the womb according to researchers who found the problem 
not confined to innercities and warned that a generation of 
innocent addicts was being created 
the study by the national association for perinatal addiction 
research and education found that at least 11 percent of women in 
36 hospitals had used illegal drugs during pregnancy 
the hospitals were chosen to represent institutions of varying 
sizes with patients from varied socioeconomic levels said dr ira 
j chasnoff who directed the survey 
the study financed by the federal office of substance abuse 
prevention and the march of dimes birth defects foundation showed 
the incidence of substance abuse among the hospitals surveyed 
ranged from fourtenths of 1 percent to 27 percent of pregnant 
patients 
chasnoff said monday the differences often reflected how 
carefully the hospitals looked for the problem with those 
hospitals with an established system of determining drug abuse 
among pregnant women finding considerably more instances 
substances in the survey included cocaine marijuana heroin and 
methadone amphetamines and the hallucinogen phencyclidine or pcp 
chasnoff said the high rate of pregnancies or births in which 
drugs are present is not confined to the largest urban areas but is 
similar in hospitals across the nation 
he also said damage to the baby from the drugs could include 
prenatal strokes lasting brain damage seizures after birth 
premature birth retarded fetal growth breathing lapses absence 
of part of the intestines or structural abnormalities in genital 
and urinary organs 
the illegal drug use in pregnancy cuts across racial and 
socioeconomic lines and maternal age groups especially since 
cocaine has become so popular said dr elaine m johnson 
director of the office of substance abuse prevention 
its not just a minority problem and its not just an 
innercity problem she said 
we are producing a new generation of innocent addicts

a black box tape recording from an illfated 
continental airlines flight shows the pilots joked about a flight 
attendants dating habits but failed to discuss the falling snow 
before the jet crashed killing 28 people a newspaper reported 
in the nearly three minutes of pilot conversation omitted from a 
national transportation safety board transcript released earlier 
discussion between the pilot and copilot centered around whether a 
woman flight attendant dated pilots the denver post reported today 
there was no discussion about deicing the jet or of the snow 
falling at stapleton international airport in the minutes before 
the nov 15 1987 crash the newspaper said 
the union of flight attendants has filed a statement with the 
transportation board saying the tape shows the pilots discussing 
unnecessary and unprofessional topics 
but continental spokesman bruce hicks said monday the blackbox 
recording shows the pilots operated a highly skilled 
welldisciplined professional cockpit 
continental he added agreed with the transportation board that 
the unreleased section of tape was not pertinent to the accident 
investigation 
the fact that the pilots didnt comment on the snow indicates 
they didnt feel it was a problem hicks said 
what it means is that they were human beings who had some 
conversations he said but at no point did they neglect their 
duties pilots arent robots 
transportation officials are investigating the possibility that 
the dc9s wings were not adequately deiced prior to takeoff 
the board also is studying the experience level of the pilots 
who both died in the crash and turbulence from a plane landing on 
the next runway as possible causes of the crash 
the recording shows the plane taxied into position near the end 
of the runway and was prepared to take off at 205 pm 
in the minutes that followed there was confusion in the 
stapleton control tower about the identity of flight 1713 and the 
tower cleared another plane to take off first 
in the conversation between pilots that followed the newspaper 
said frank zvonek the 43yearold captain mentioned a flight 
attendant 
she said she doesnt date pilots zvonek was quoted as 
saying she doesnt go for onenight stands 
copilot lee edward bruecher 26 reportedly asked how come 
she doesnt date pilots is it the same reason why i dont date 
flight attendants laughter 
she seems real nice 
minutes later flight 1713 was cleared for takeoff and began 
rolling down the runway at 215 pm the plane climbed into the 
air 
ten seconds later bruecher shouted an obscenity the dc9 
flipped and crashed

jim and tammy bakker told attorneys they 
didnt know where ptls money came from or how its finances were 
managed when they led the television ministry documents filed with 
us bankruptcy court show 
in depositions filed monday with the columbia court the bakkers 
said top aides handled most of ptls money matters 
asked about sixfigure bonuses given her mrs bakker said i 
just know they board members put them in my account and i spent 
them like a typical woman 
bakker who repeatedly said he did not recall seeing various 
memos about ptls finances was asked if he thought aides did not 
properly inform him 
he replied i was exhausted half the time and reading memos at 
11 or 12 oclock before dropping off to sleep and i could have 
been informed and would not even know it i would have been so 
tired 
the irs claims mrs bakkers annual salaries during her last 
four years at ptl were 84964 in 198384 142586 in 198485 and 
90736 in both 198586 and 198687 during that period she also 
received bonuses totaling 825000 irs records show 
ptl records show that during those years bakker as ptls 
leader received nearly 83 million in salary bonuses and other 
perks 
the bakkers comments were contained in 814 pages of depositions 
taken under oath for a sept 12 trial in which ptl attorneys will 
try to recover 52 million in ministry assets from the bakkers and 
former top aide david taggart ptl claims they grossly mismanaged 
the ministry and took millions of dollars from ptl for their 
personal use

years salary

suing ptl for 18 million 
mrs bakker who was cohost of ptls jim and tammy show and 
had her own program called tammys house party said in the 
deposition that she didnt know how many bonuses ptls board gave 
her and didnt recall the amounts of the bonuses 
i would go to them and tell them they didnt need to do 
that she said and they would always tell me well youre 
worth more than that to us and we wish it could be more 
mrs bakker said she and her husband were always careful to use 
their money not ptls to pay personal billsshe also said she 
and her husband have always been very very open with the 
internal revenue 
a federal grand jury in charlotte nc is investigating 
whether bakker and his top aides committed tax wire or mail fraud 
that probe focuses on how ptl under bakker raised and spent 
millions of dollars in contributions 
bakker resigned as ptl president in march 1987 after 
acknowledging a sexual encounter with former church secretary

china is interested in buying at least a dozen 
boeing helicopters that would be used in developing a rapid 
deployment force a chinese military official said today 
he said chinese officers recently tested a chinook ch47d 
helicopter on the tibetan plateau at more than 15000 feet high 
a boeing spokesman in philadelphia where the companys 
helicopter division is based said boeing rented a c5 cargo plane 
from the us air force to ship the helicopter to tibet in early 
august 
the chinese interest is very encouraging said company 
spokesman robert togerson the helicopter met or surpassed their 
specifications 
the spokesman for the prospective purchaser poly technologies 
inc which handles weapons deals for the chinese military said 
china would decide in september whether to buy the helicopters 
he said the military had so far only considered the boeing model 
a spokesman for boeing in beijing said the helicopters sell for 
about 15 million each 
if completed it would be one of the largest direct sales of 
military goods between the united states and china he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the largest uschina military contract was signed in august 
1987 with grumman corp of bethpage ny and is worth 245 
million the avionics firm contracted to upgrade the electronics 
system of chinas f8 fighter jet 
the chinese military spokesman who identified himself only as 
kang said china would use the helicopters for military purposes 
inside china 
he said the copters were being considered as part of a program 
to develop a rapid deployment force for the chinese military 
the boeing spokesman in beijing said the chinese also could use 
the helicopters to add an airborne wing to their army 
the ch47d is the latest version of the ch47 the us armys 
primary mediumlift helicopter boeing says that its main use is 
for rapid deployment of tactical units in combat 
the helicopter can carry up to 44 combatequipped soldiers and 
has a top speed of 174 mph and a cruising speed of 161 mph 
kang said the helicopter tests in tibet had nothing to do with 
recent unrest in the area tibetan activists rioted in lhasa last 
autumn and again in march more than 30 tibetans and chinese police 
were killed 
a western military analyst in beijing said he did not think the 
helicopters if purchased would be used to quell domestic unrest 
the chinese traditionally test helicopters for highaltitude 
over onethird of the country is mountainous he said before 
buying 24 mediumsized blackhawk helicopters from the american firm 
sikorsky co several years ago china also tested them in tibet he 
said 
western military analysts who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the prospective purchase would be consistent with chinese 
military reforms designed to create a more professional army 
the analysts pointed to chinas poor showing in its brief war 
with vietnam as an example of chinas need to modernize its 
military china has shifted its military focus from preparedness 
for allout war to training for limited conflicts 
these types of conflicts need a speedy response said one 
diplomat the boeing helicopters could be useful 
in june china announced the formation of the first platoon 
an airborne force trained in rapid response techniques 
todays official china daily reported several military regions 
recently completed exercises in north and south china to upgrade 
their ability to respond rapidly to local conflict

and whether ms forster should obtain one to abide by the terms of 
her probation 
the judge said that she would never make such a ruling

a beverly hills neurosurgeon and convicted 
slumlord who ignored needed repairs to his vermininfested 
buildings has agreed to pay 70 tenants as much as 35000 apiece 
under a record settlement lawyers said 
the 25 million settlement was announced monday by legal aid 
foundation attorneys barrett litt and michael bodaken who brought 
the suit against dr milton avol 65 
avol once described by a prosecutor as the most recalcitrant 
slumlord in los angeles previously was sentenced to house arrest 
in his own ratinfested building he served 30 days 
he also served 55 days of a ninemonth jail sentence a term 
that began christmas eve 
tenants accused avol of cutting off water failing to make 
needed repairs allowing buildings to become infested with rats and 
bugs and attempting to evict the tenants who complained to 
authorities 
payments averaging from 30000 to 35000 will be made to 70 
families comprising 319 adults and children who lived in two of 
avols downtown south main street buldings litt said 
we hope it will give a clear signal to those who run buildings 
in dilapidated conditions that it will cost them a great deal of 
money to do so and its in their own best economic interest to 
clean up the buildings litt said 
paul hittelman avols attorney said the settlement did not 
mean his client was admitting liability 
also named as defendants were avols wife ann and hyoung and 
sook pak who bought the building from avol in 1986 the paks will 
pay about 10 percent of the settlement costs

lebanese christian villagers joined by israeli 
troops today blocked a guerrilla squad trying to infiltrate israel 
from south lebanon and at least one guerrilla was wounded israel 
radio said 
it was the first time israel has reported that lebanese 
villagers helped thwart a border crossing the infiltration attempt 
was the 17th since the palestinian uprising broke out in 
israelioccupied territories almost nine months ago 
in the west bank and gaza strip palestinians went on strike to 
protest the planned deportation of 25 fellow arabs 
israeli troops shot and wounded four palestinians in the west 
bank city of nablus during a protest hospital officials said the 
army said it was checking the report 
israel radio said the attempted infiltration today occurred near 
the village of khalata about 2 miles north of the israeli border 
it said a villager spotted the guerrilla squad walking out of a 
ravine and moving across a field near the village the villagers 
alerted others and 10 lebanese men armed themselves and stopped the 
squad it said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin speaking on the radio said the 
israelibacked south lebanon army initially encountered the 
guerrillas 
the idf israeli defense forces soldiers joined them he 
said to the best of my knowledge there were no people wounded 
on our side 
israel ended a threeyear occupation of lebanon in the summer of 
1985 but maintains about 1000 soldiers in a selfdeclared 
security zone to back up the mostly christian south lebanon army 
in other developments the supreme court turned down two appeals 
by faisal husseini head of the banned arab studies center to open 
his court hearings to the public and to make secret prosecution 
documents available to his attorneys 
husseini whose case is currently before the jerusalem district 
court is being held for the third time under emergency regulations

husseini or bring him to trial israel maintains husseini is a key 
palestine liberation organization leader in the occupied 
territories

killed most of them by army gunfire four israelis also have died 
curfews were in effect today on the jabaliya bureij and 
nusseirat refugee camps in gaza

measures because previous general strikes a main tactic of 
resistance had triggered violent protests in the camps 
in nablus the largest city in the west bank with over 100000 
residents the army lifted a fiveday curfew but streets remained 
deserted because of the general strike outlawed palestinian flags 
flew from the citys largest mosque and others were draped on

a homeless man who barricaded himself in 
a historic 19thcentury fort and threatened to blow it up had 
enough provisions to last two weeks but surrendered after about 
seven hours 
while police and fbi agents surrounded fort vancouver on monday 
the man used black powder to fire several apparently harmless shots 
from replicas of cannons inside the reconstructed log fort no one 
was injured 
the man who identified himself as ken rose 40 surrendered in 
exchange for an opportunity to talk to reporters 
the former marine said vietnam veterans need their own program 
run by other veterans to overcome unique emotional and 
psychological problems 
veterans in this country paid their dues they served with 
pride rose of the tillamook ore area told reporters its 
a disgrace to see them sleeping on the sidewalk they face a lot of 
emotional psychological and physical problems that are unlike 
those facing any other segment of the population in america 
police arrested rose and he was held in the clark county jail in 
lieu of 10000 bail on a state charge of firstdegree burglary 
police capt ray anderson said federal officials declined to 
prosecute him 
rose used a rope to scale the forts 15foot walls and said he 
had enough provisions to hold out for two weeks but he agreed with 
an fbi negotiator who told him that would be pointless 
fbi negotiators initially took charge because the 4acre fort 
originally built in the early 1800s is a federal landmark 
rose said he was recently treated in the veterans administration 
hospital in portland ore for posttraumatic stress syndrome and 
alcoholism 
he said he had been living in his car and with friends he said 
he was a marine corporal in vietnam in 1967 and 1968 including the 
tet offensive

a reputed member of the gambino crime family who 
reportedly served as a government informant for years was killed 
outside his brooklyn home 
i think his days were numbered from the day his informer 
status was made public in march 1985 said a federal source who 
spoke on the condition his identity not be revealed 
the victim wilfred willie boy johnson was a codefendant 
in a racketeering trial at which he and john gotti reputed head of 
the gambino family were acquitted in april 1987 
an fbi agent testified in court that gottis faction had put out 
a murder contract on johnson 
johnson 53 was shot several times including in the back of 
the head with a 380caliber automatic shortly after 6 am 
monday said detective louis llanes a police spokesman several 
spent shells were found between johnsons home and his car which 
was parked a block away 
i dont think there was any doubt that it was 
gottisanctioned said the source one bullet in the head would 
have done the job the 13 other ones were meant as a message 
the government said johnson whose criminal record dated to 
1952 had been jailed for 18 months before the trial for his own 
safety because he had been on the fbi payroll from 1966 to 1974 and 
then resumed working as an unpaid snitch in 1980 
a prosecutor said in court papers that johnson had passed the 
fbi details of the gambino family hierarchy and its activities in 
gambling loansharking hijacking and murder 
but his lawyer richard rehbock denied that johnson was ever an 
informant and said he was denied bail in an unsuccessful government 
attempt to make him cooperate and discredit him with his 
codefendants 
prosecutors offered johnson a place in the federal witness 
protection program before his informer status was revealed but 
johnson refused saying he would never testify against his 
associates according to court documents

the 10yearold daughter of a 
couple presumed killed by security forces during argentinas 
dirty war was ordered taken from her natural grandparents and 
returned to her adoptive parents 
federal judge alfredo sanudo who handed down the decision 
doesnt deserve to live said ruben fontana julianas maternal 
grandfather 
fontana vowed to appeal the order issued monday in a 
closeddoor hearing in the buenos aires suburb of moron 
jose and carmen trevino adopted the dark chubbycheeked juliana 
after she was found as an infant in the doorway of a building and 
taken to an orphanage they did not comment on the ruling to 
reporters outside the courtroom 
the juliana case as it is called in south america is 
reminiscent of the official story the oscarwinning 1985 
argentine film about a family that adopts the child of a woman 
killed by security forces 
in the 1970s at least 9000 people vanished in argentina and 
were presumed abducted and killed by security agents in the dirty 
war which was ordered by the military dictatorship to quell the 
leftist opposition several military leaders have been tried 
convicted and sentenced for their role in the terror 
the trevinos unlike other families who didnt question where 
their children came from adopted juliana legally told her she 
was adopted and tried for years to track down her biological 
parents 
jose trevino a journalist recently told the associated press 
from the first moment we told juliana she was adopted if 
her real parents appeared my wife and i told ourselves we would 
rip up the documents and return the child 
the trevinos brought juliana to the attention of her natural 
grandparents earlier this year when they gave a sample of her 
blood to a clinic set up to match children with parents who had 
disappeared 
the blood sample proved juliana was the daughter of pedro fabian 
sandoval and liliana fontana who was pregnant when the couple was 
arrested on july 1 1977 and the granddaughter of ruben and 
clelia fontana 
on june 23 the day the trevinos received the news from the 
blood bank they were ordered to appear in court former federal 
judge juan ramos padilla gave them two choices return juliana to 
her grandparents or give her to a foster home 
the trevinos chose the former but filed an appeal arguing that 
they had followed the legal requirements to adopt juliana and were 
better suited to care for her than the grandparents 
sanudo who replaced ramos padilla after the latter retired 
overturned his predecessors ruling 
the military which staged a 1976 coup turned over power to 
elected civilian president raul alfonsin in 1983

transportation has caused hardship to the people and also caused 
the price of food to spiral staterun rangoon radio said 
the government therefore appealed to the buddhist monks and 
the public to help solve the rail transportation problem the 
brief broadcast said 
monks are an influential element of burmese society they and 
activist students have been in the vanguard of mass prodemocracy 
demonstrations that began july 23 when 77yearold ne win resigned 
after 26 years of authoritarian rule and was replaced by hardliner 
sein lwin 
the nations railroad workers went on strike last friday 
shutting down the most affordable form of longdistance 
transportation and making it difficult to move food into the cities 
union burma airways suspended all domestic and international 
operations and bus service was severely reduced private buses 
have since raised their fares from 8 to 50 
strikes also closed oil refineries in syriam across the rangoon 
river and in mann in central burma crippled most factories of the 
industries ministry and left foreign ships waiting at rangoon port 
officials said 
gasoline became scarce and its price soared with most gas 
stations closed the black market price rose from about 417 to 
1667 per gallon 
that sent people running to buy bicycles which were selling 
today at 15 percent above their normal price 
bicycles imported from thailand and china sell for about 
600700 in burma those produced at governmentrun factories sell 
for about 133 but are in short supply and today the black market

after ne win led the 1962 military coup that ended burmas 
experiment with democracy he outlawed all political parties 
unions and associations except for the ruling burma socialist 
program party the unions and the new committee for democracy are 
illegal under burmas present constitution 
burmas leadership disintegrated following the aug 19 
announcement that civilian lawyer maung maung had replaced the 
hated sein lwin as president and head of the sole political party 
maung maungs promise of a referendum sept 12 that would pave 
the way for democracy did not quiet the demonstrations in which 
hundreds of people have died in the past month

michael dukakis today countered george 
bushs criticism of him on defense issues and said the next 
president cant have it all if hes serious about erasing the 
federal deficit 
the democratic nominee also hinted he was approaching the point 
at which he would respond more aggressively to republican attacks 
saying it would be unfortunate but necessary to reshape the 
election debate 
dukakis meeting with western massachusetts editors on the final 
day of a twoday visit to the region fired back quickly when asked 
about bushs assertions that dukakis would endanger national 
security because of his foreign policy inexperience 
mr bush says he wants them all dukakis said after listing 
his opposition to building mx missiles on railroad cars two new 
supercarrier task forces and deploying the star wars space defense 
system 
you cant have them all dukakis said not if youre 
serious about providing the resources our conventional forces need 
and not if youre serious about getting that deficit down 
dukakis who has been trying to dispel talk that his campaign 
has stagnated has blamed such talk on the media attention given to 
bush and his running mate indiana sen dan quayle following the 
republican convention and to reports about unsubstantiated rumors 
about dukakis and his wife 
if it continues you have to respond he said i think 
thats unfortunate but i think its very clear what kind of a 
campaign the republicans are running and i think were going to 
have to deal with it 
for dukakis monday was a bizarre day in which he first canceled 
a news conference after aides complained network television was 
ignoring his speeches but later met with reporters armed with 
questions about whether his campaign was in a state of confusion 
back by popular demand he joked as he walked into a 
rescheduled news conference 
the confusion comes at a time when many democratic strategists 
inside and outside the dukakis campaign are concerned that dukakis 
has allowed bush to seize control of the debate with attacks on the 
democrats patriotism views on defense and gun control and the 
furlough program 
dukakis told reporters he was trying to get this campaign up 
where it belongs by discussing his economic positions he came to 
western massachusetts to highlight that regions economic 
resurgence 
the governor said facetoface debates were the best place to 
respond to bushs attacks but then offered a preview by countering 
the vice presidents attacks on the furlough program which until 
amended last year extended eligibility to firstdegree murderers 
dukakis said he wanted to ask bush about the 16000 furloughs 
granted to federal prisoners last year some lasting 45 days and 
many to convicted drug pushers mr bush says he wants to execute 
in a speech before the news conference dukakis also attacked 
bushs support for a reduction in the capital gains tax 
were not going to accept mr bushs suggestion that the way 
to build opportunity for our citizens is to cut taxes for the 
wealthy again this time with a 40 billion handout 70 percent of 
which would go to those making 200000 a year or more he said 
dukakis also called for an end to questions about quayles 
military and academic records in favor of issuesrelated media 
coverage 
lets put the last few weeks behind us dukakis said the 
dog days of august are almost over the curtain is going up on the 
greatest exercise of political freedom the world has ever known 
dukakis said time was too short to engage in personal attacks 
ten weeks from tomorrow america will choose a new 
president he said the campaign is a golden and historic 
moment to define our nations future my friends let us not waste 
this opportunity 
because the issue in this campaign is not how well mr bush 
did one night in new orleans or how well i did one night in atlanta 
the issue is not whose speechwriter should get an emmy the 
issue is whose values should get into the white house 
the american people arent interested in the grades that some 
of us might have gotten while we were in college they care about 
whether their children will have the chance to go to college

a fuming mad geraldo rivera says hes going to 
go after two parttime actors who say they fibbed their way onto 
his and other popular tv talk shows by pretending to have undergone 
sex therapy 
tani freiwald 37 and wes bailey 33 both of chicago said 
they acted the roles of people with sexual problems because they 
wanted to experience the thrill of appearing on millions of 
television screens from coast to coast 
in addition to the geraldo show both appeared on sally 
jessy raphael show while ms freiwald appeared on the oprah 
winfrey show 
appearing this morning on cbs this morning bailey said the 
only time he was a little scared during the talkshow stints was 
during a sally jessy raphael show when the host told the 
audience that he and ms freiwald were not actors reproducing a 
scene 
there was a little clenching in the stomachs but weve 
both been performers all our adult lives bailey said 
after you go through the first one they get really easy 
ms freiwald added 
rivera said he is considering legal action 
these people are admitting now to having committed fraud or at 
least misrepresentation and were going to go after them 
rivera said monday in a telephone interview from new york 
this is something that goes right to the integrity of the 
broadcast itself im really spitting mad 
however a psychologist who recommended the pair as guests 
maintained they werent acting 
bailey said he played a 35yearold virgin on a rivera show in 
july and an impotent husband on a sally jessy raphael show 
televised in may 
in both cases he said he claimed to be undergoing therapy with 
a sex surrogate in which a patient has sex with a standin chosen 
by the therapist 
geraldo tapes at a little studio on 42nd and broadway so now 
i can say ive appeared on broadway said the parttime actor who 
also cares for an elderly man 
ms freiwald said she appeared with bailey and played the role 
of his sex surrogate on geraldo and appeared on a sally 
jessy raphael show taped in april 
it was the idea of going on national television from a 
performers standpoint thats pretty big said ms freiwald a 
fulltime secretary and parttime actress 
she said her favorite role was on a november 1986 oprah 
winfrey show in which she pretended to be a sexhating woman who 
had been married 14 years 
during the taping according to ms freiwald ms winfrey came 
backstage and said i know this is going to be a great show 
just be honest and i died a thousand times 
ms freiwald and bailey said they were asked to appear on the 
shows by a chicago psychologistauthor dean c dauw for whom ms 
freiwald was working as an office manager 
he asked me to do it because the surrogates he does have 
working for him are neither presentable or articulate enough to 
go on television ms freiwald said 
dauw who had appeared on some of the shows to promote his 
books is frequently asked to suggest guests who can give personal 
accounts of sex therapy said linda finnell a producer for the 
sally jessy raphael show taped in new haven conn 
we try to check peoples stories out as much as possible but 
when you have a professional youve worked with before theres no 
reason to doubt that professional ms finnell said 
we take every precaution to ensure a persons credibility 
said debra dimaio executive producer of ms winfreys show 
dauw did not return numerous messages left sunday and monday on 
his business telephone answering machine and a woman who answered 
the telephone at his chicago home said he was in florida she 
refused to give her name or release a telephone number where he 
could be reached 
earlier dauw told the omaha worldherald that ms freiwald 
worked as an office manager and a sex surrogate and bailey was his 
client they didnt play act anything dauw said

morocco and the polisario guerrillas said today 
they had agreed conditionally to a un peace plan aimed at ending 
their 13year conflict in the western sahara 
un spokesman francois giuliani said both sides accepted with 
remarks and comments the aug 11 peace plan for a ceasefire and 
a unmonitored referendum in the phosphaterich desert territory 
the text of the proposal has not been made public 
the marxistled polisario has fought for western saharas 
independence since 1975 when spains colonial forces gave up the 
northwest african territory and morocco annexed it 
algeria has backed polisarios campaign but morocco and algeria 
restored diplomatic relations in may after years of tension verging 
on war over the territory 
in madrid spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez 
told spanish national radio spain that he viewed as very good 
news the announcement 
we expect this process to lead to the establishment of peace 
and prosperity in this region of great importance to spain the 
minister said 
giuliani said secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar expects 
to begin a un peacekeeping operation in the western sahara before 
the end of the year the un is considering sending about 2000 
peacekeeping troops to the remote sparsely populated territory 
authorities say 
perez de cuellar will also be appointing a special 
representative to supervise the peace process giuliani told 
reporters 
through the two replies the conflict in the western sahara 
enters a new phase with difficulties still to be settled 
polisario delegation leader bechir mustapha said 
we have accepted with certain conditions mustapha added 
moroccan foreign minister abdellatif elfalali said there is 
an accord in principle to work together with the secretarygeneral 
for the implementation of his proposals 
a referendum can be held in the relatively near future the 
foreign minister said 
announcement of the tentative agreement followed lastminute 
meetings between perez de cuellar and the two sides their deadline 
for submitting responses to the peace plan was thursday 
perez de cuellars detailed proposals included a ceasefire and 
a referendum calling for the regions independence or affiliation 
with another nation most likely morocco 
western sahara covers about 110000 square miles but had only 
about 76000 inhabitants in the last spanish census in 1975 most 
of its people have fled to moroccanheld cities or to refugee camps 
around the algerian oasis of tindouf 
the major remaining dispute now likely is to be over who has the 
right to vote in a referendum 
polisario claims about 165000 western saharans live around the 
tindouf oasis but morocco says most of them are not western 
saharans 
polisario also claims that twothirds of the 150000 inhabitants 
of the moroccanheld areas are immigrants not eligible to vote but 
morocco claims 90 percent of them are western saharans 
moroccos army has kept polisario from major gains mainly by 
building a series of defensive walls in the desert but king hassan 
iis war effort has been costing up to 2 million a day in recent 
years

as forest fires spread through the west the 
us forest service is spreading the word help 
the forest service has put out a call for temporary firefighters 
to battle the hundreds of blazes scorching the wests timberlands 
but the emergency help must endure backbreaking labor smoke and 
flame and only local people need apply 
meanwhile governors in idaho and wyoming called up national 
guardsmen today to help fight fires in their states 
the boise interagency fire center has notified forest service 
regions affected by the dozens of out of control fires that 
temporary firefighters may be hired on a contingency basis said 
mike ferris information officer for the center that coordinates 
fire suppression in the west 
the temporary emergency firefighting hires or casuals 
must have the physical and mental capacity to work on the fire 
lines including long days of shoveling and chopping on steep 
hillsides very near burning timber ferris said 
the job carries with it a lot of drama and romance ferris 
said but somedays youve got to ask yourself why am i doing 
this 
what were doing is only hiring from the local community he 
said ive had people calling from all over the country and some 
wanting to volunteer ive had people wanting to take their 
vacation and work if you can believe that 
ferris said those interested should contact their local national 
forest office not the boise center and not the forest service in 
washington dc 
applicants will undergo an aerobic stress test which measures 
the ability of the heart to recover from exertion 
while some fire officials have set the total number of temporary 
workers needed at 4000 ferris said each national forest must 
determine its requirements and the cost of employing those extra 
people 
were making assessments about our needs in the situation 
were not saying were going to hire 4000 or 8000 he said 
the emergency labor is a unique situation in a unique fire year 
late last week the fire center estimated that 66000 fires had 
scorched more than 33 million acres mostly in alaska 
there are 547 20member crews or 10940 regular firefighters 
battling the wests fires ferris said 
nearly 1600 water pumper trucks are manned by 15213 people or 
an average three crew members per vehicle about 630 people are 
flying in helicopters for aerial observation or water drops and 
2400 soldiers have been called to the lines ferris said 
that does not include the scores of people who have contracted 
to cut timber cater meals at fire camps or bulldoze lines 
the forest service does not expect to have the casuals 
trained and fitted for fighting fires until friday ferris said 
we will not put them in a situation that is more than what 
they can bite and chew he said

the mysterious helicopter that swooped 
into a federal prison yard where an international technobandit 
was waiting to escape actually belonged to the government because 
the plot was no secret 
werner bruchhausen didnt know government agents were aware of 
his plan and he ran and walked toward the aircraft as it hovered 
above the empty softball field at the federal correctional 
institution saturday evening officials said monday 
the helicopter belonged to the us customs service and was 
flown by a customs agent and bruchhausen only got to within about 
20 feet of the aircraft before he was arrested by an fbi agent and 
four prison officers 
possibly 2 weeks ago we received information at the 
institution from an unnamed source that mr bruchhausen was talking 
about escaping from the institution said prison warden bob 
honsted 
through the monitoring of telephone conversations we were able 
to piece together along with the other agencies certain elements 
of the plot honsted said 
officials released some details of the foiled escape attempt at 
a news conference monday but refused to answer many questions 
citing a continuing investigation 
after the thwarted escape attempt the west german citizen 
convicted in los angeles of selling hightech products to the 
soviet union and eastern european countries was transferred to the 
federal penitentiary in atlanta 
bruchhausen who has been at the medium to minimumsecurity 
facility since may 1987 was willing to pay for his escape honsted 
said 
its our belief that a sum of money approximately or possibly 
as high as a quarter of a million dollars was mentioned the 
warden said there was actually 5000 that was received in 
tallahassee as partial payment 
bruchhausen could face additional charges of attempted escape 
and conspiracy to escape us attorney mike moore said monday 
those charges have not yet been filed but a conspiracy charge has 
been filed against an individual still at large whom moore refused 
to identify 
bruchhausen and three others were indicted in august 1981 in los 
angeles on charges of conspiracy and violating the export 
administration act the arms export and control act and federal 
income tax laws 
he was arrested may 1985 in london extradited and convicted of 
wire fraud in 1987 
bruchhausen allegedly smuggled a microwave receiver system 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment a computer system and other 
military and scientific items to the soviet bloc through dummy 
corporations in california and west germany said customs service 
commissioner william von rabb 
von rabb in 1981 called bruchhausen one of the worlds top 
technobandits and said he was deceiving and defrauding 
american businesses by selling potential high technology to the 
soviets

these are occupied territories for me and everybody with the 
exception of course of the israeli government we call them 
palestinians and call the land palestine perez de cuellar said

a 36yearold white man accused of 
lobbing a hand grenade into a crowd of blacks during a racial melee 
could be charged with as many as nine counts of attempted murder 
police said 
the brawl between clubwielding whites and rock and 
bottlethrowing blacks capped longsimmering tensions in a racially 
mixed community residents said 
wayne t langston was arrested monday and charged with two 
counts of attempted murder and with throwing an explosive device 
manatee sheriff charlie wells said 
langston was held in the manatee county jail with bail set at 
150000 
there were no critical injuries from the blast authorities 
said seven people were treated for shrapnel wounds and two others 
suffered minor injuries wells said 
we possibly will be charging him with as many as nine counts 
of attempted murder said wells who described the grenade attack 
was an isolated racial incident 
but residents of the neighborhood called duplex city said 
racial tensions have run high since the opening three months ago of 
the midway bar which they said is frequented by rednecks and 
members of a motorcycle gang 
it was not known whether langston who worked at the pub was a 
member of a motorcycle gang wells said 
the fight broke out sunday evening between about 15 blacks in 
the parking lot of a convenience store and about 35 patrons of the 
adjacent bar police said 
whites yelled racial slurs as the confrontation grew heated 
according to witness lynn butler 19 he said he saw a white man 
emerge from the area of the bar and lob the grenade 
he just popped the clip he just threw it then in five 
seconds there was a boom butler said adding that everyone in 
the parking lot scrambled for cover 
the explosion caused about 30000 damage to the cars and 
shattered windows of surrounding businesses it looked like 
guerilla warfare butler said 
langston was arrested on warrants issued after witnesses and 
acquaintances talked to police wells said police reports show 
langston has been charged twice since 1981 for aggravated battery 
but never convicted

the un secretarygeneral today blamed 
disagreements over an immediate troop withdrawal and a maritime 
ceasefire for stalling formal iraniraq peace talks 
we are trying to clear the first part of a un peace 
resolution on an immediate ceasefire and a troop withdrawal 
without delay the ceasefire at sea is part of the problem 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said 
formal sessions between foreign ministers ali akbar velayati of 
iran and tariq aziz of iraq have been suspended since friday plans 
for a formal session monday were shelved without explanation and 
no formal talks were planned today 
lowlevel talks with iran and iraq were continuing 
in an interview today velayati told the associated press that 
iran would not grant iraq any concessions which it had failed to 
win in the 8yearold war he blamed iraq for lack of progress in 
the talks 
velayati said iraq was facing many internal difficulties adding 
we think this is the main reason they are looking for some 
advantage some concessions but if they couldnt get any 
concessions during this long war with a lot of casualties of 
course they will not be able to get any concessions or anything 
beyond their legal rights during the peace talks 
tehran radio today quoted velayati as saying iraq had raised 
unnecessary or outofplace issues to disrupt the talks 
in the interview with tehran radio monitored in nicosia he said 
he hoped perez de cuellar the un security council and other 
nations can pressure iraq and put a stop to this deviating course 
or force them to come back to the correct path 
un spokesman francois giuliani said perez de cuellar met with 
representatives of the five permanent members of the security 
council the united states britain china france and the soviet 
union on monday to brief them on the negotiations 
giuliani did not comment on the discussions but diplomats 
speculated that the un chief was hoping the five nations would 
help get the talks moving 
iraq has been insisting on an early reopening of the 
shattalarab waterway which has been blocked by sunken ships 
since early in the war iran has said clearing the waterway 
iraqs only outlet to the sea should come later after a permanent 
ceasefire and troop withdrawal 
talks reportedly faltered at the ministerial level because of 
the dispute over the shattalarab baghdad claims sovereignty over 
the entire shattalarab iran claims rights to half of it the 
issue is central to the talks because the un peace plan calls for 
troop withdrawal to internationally recognized boundaries 
perez de cuellar said today you all think that everything is 
the shattalarab this is not quite true this is one of the 
difficulties we are facing and not the only one 
aziz said monday that it would be impossible to advance to other 
points until iran agreed that the ceasefire extended over all 
persian gulf waters 
it is a very difficult problem and it cannot be expected that 
this will be resolved in a few days perez de cuellar said 
the talks began thursday to try forge a peace treaty and a 
timetable for troop withdrawal and prisoner exchange under a 
unmediated aug 20 ceasefire 
the two countries have in the past often ignored previous 
agreements on the shattalarab waterway a point of friction since 
the days of the persian and ottoman empires 
a western diplomat trying to settle the question in 1914 called 
it a phenomenon of procrastination unparalleled in the chronicles 
of oriental diplomacy 
five days before iraqi troops invaded iran in september 1980 
after weeks of border clashes president saddam hussein of iraq 
tore up the latest treaty on the waterway the algiers agreement of 
1975 during a televised speech 
the agreement between hussein then foreign minister and the 
late shah of iran set the border between the two nations in the 
middle of the 125 milelong waterway instead of its iranian bank 
a dividing line in a 1969 agreement 
velayati said monday that iraq could not unilaterally abrogate 
the 1975 treaty but aziz told reporters that it was iran that 
always abrogated previous agreements imposing new ones by force 
this reflects the situation in the 17th 18th 19th and early 
in the 20 centuries right up to present times he added

a 27yearold swimming instructor waded out of 
lake ontario today the first person to swim all five great lakes 
canadian marathoner vicki keith took just less than 24 hours to 
make the 31mile crossing much faster than her original estimate 
of 36 hours despite using the difficult butterfly stroke for most 
of the swim 
she began at niagaraonthelake ontario and was supposed to 
finish her swim at the canadian national exhibition grounds in 
toronto but strong currents pushed her about three miles east 
she waded out of the lake at 603 am edt 
i feel good im glad its over though said keith visibly 
tired and disoriented 
it was really tough because of the butterfly she said her 
teeth chattering she was taken away quickly in a van 
during her crossing keith claimed a womens world distance 
record for the butterfly stroke bettering her 1984 mark of 12 
miles after just six hours in the water 
she swam the butterfly stroke for 236 miles across the lake 
nearly doubling her record 
before the crossing keith said she planned to switch to the 
easier freestyle stroke shortly after breaking her record for the 
butterfly 
but the kingston ontario woman didnt seem to feel the strain 
of the awkward butterfly which involves throwing both arms over 
the head and doing a dolphinlike kick simultaneously

former philippines president ferdinand marcos and 
his wife imelda must stand trial to determine whether they had a 
part in the slaying of two union leaders in 1981 a federal judge 
ruled 
in a decision she said was certain to be appealed us district 
judge barbara rothstein denied a request monday by the deposed 
leader and his wife to be dismissed from a wrongful death suit 
filed by relatives of the slain unionists the case is scheduled to 
go to trial next year 
silme domingo and gene viernes antimarcos reform leaders in 
the overwhelmingly filipino alaska cannery workers union were 
gunned down at the union hall on june 1 1981 
their survivors filed suit the next year claiming in part that 
the marcos regime ordered the shootings the marcoses claimed 
headofstate immunity 
a second federal judge dismissed the marcoses as defendants in 
the lawsuit in december 1982 while marcos was still president in 
1987 after the marcoses fled the philippines ms rothstein ruled 
they had to stand trial and her decision monday reaffirmed that 
ruling 
headofstate immunity serves to safeguard the relations among 
foreign governments and their leaders not as the marcoses assert 
to protect former heads of state regardless of their lack of 
official status the judge ruled 
this court believes it is neither inequitable nor disturbing 
that a foreign official who takes refuge in the united states must 
defend the legality of private acts committed in the united 
states she added 
other defendants in the case include the republic of the 
philippines leonilo malabed a san francisco doctor and three men 
who were convicted on state criminal charges in the case the suit 
says malabed controlled a fund from which 15000 was paid for the 
slayings 
the marcoses fled the philippines for the united states in 
february 1986 when corazon aquino was sworn in as president they 
now live in hawaii 
in an interview monday malabed said he and marcos have been 
close friends for many years he denied that he or marcos had 
anything to do with the shootings 
i have no doubt even if he stood trial in seattle that he 
would win the case because there is no evidence malabed said 
george greer a local attorney representing the philippines in 
the case said he had yet to see evidence linking marcos or the 
philippine government to the killings

democrat michael dukakis today scoffed at the republican wish 
list of weapons saying you cant have them all and still 
balance the budget while republican running mate dan quayle said 
dukakis is wrong to call star wars a fantasy it is called 
defending america he said 
dukakis finished up a twoday swing through his home state of 
massachusetts and republican george bush toured kentucky today as 
representatives of both campaigns opened summitstyle negotiations 
to hammer out a schedule for fall debates 
i believe they recognize how important it is to the american 
people that there be debates dukakis chairman paul brountas said 
before he and campaign manager susan estrich met with bushs 
campaign chairman james baker media adviser roger ailes and 
adviser bob goodwin 
baker speaking to reporters on his way in to the meeting in the 
washington offices of brountas law firm was asked how many 
debates were expected thats what were here to find out he 
said 
the democratic nominee hinted strongly he would let no more 
republican broadsides go unanswered if it continues you have to 
respond dukakis said in springfield mass i think thats 
unfortunate but i think its very clear what kind of campaign the 
republicans are running 
dukakis also cited his opposition to the mobile mx missile 
system two new supercarrier task forces and the star wars space 
defense system 
mr bush says he wants them all the democrat said you 
cant have them all not if youre serious about providing the 
resources our conventional forces need and not if youre serious 
about getting that deficit down 
bushs top surrogate running mate quayle defended star wars in 
a speech today it is not a fantasy as the governor of 
massachusetts has called it it is called defending america he 
said 
in an appearance before the international association of fire 
chiefs meeting in washington quayle opened by saying ive 
become very accustomed to fighting fires the last couple of weeks 
dukakis made his call monday for a return to the rhetorical high 
ground while being criticized by democrats for letting bush control 
the debate with attacks on the democrats patriotism views on 
defense and gun control and a massachusetts prison furlough program 
dukakis during a tour of western massachusetts to highlight 
that areas economic resurgence said he was trying to get this 
campaign up where it belongs by discussing his economic 
positions but the massachusetts governor also countered bushs 
attacks on the furlough program and launched his own salvo on the 
vice presidents support for a reduction in the capital gains tax 
in his counterattack dukakis showed a newly aggressive posture 
dukakis said at a news conference he wants to ask bush about the 
16000 furloughs granted to federal prisoners last year some 
lasting 45 days and many to convicted drug pushers mr bush says he 
wants to execute 
and in a luncheon speech before the news conference dukakis 
said were not going to accept mr bushs suggestion that the 
way to build opportunity for our citizens is to cut taxes for the 
wealthy again this time with a 40 billion handout 70 percent of 
which would go to those making 200000 a year or more 
bush has criticized dukakis for the furlough program since 
amended because one prisoner on a weekend pass raped a woman the 
vice president also advocates the death penalty for drug dealers 
ten weeks from tomorrow america will choose a new 
president dukakis said the campaign is a golden and historic 
moment to define our nations future my friends let us not waste 
this opportunity 
bush during a tour of a defense plant in st louis belittled 
dukakis for saying the united states needs antitank weapons rather 
than mx mobile missiles saying both systems are needed for a 
strong defense 
does he understand the principles of deterrence keeping the 
peace by deterring war bush said its not a choice between 
the two 
during a later appearance in tennessee bush said dukakis has 
little standing to criticize the administrations drugfighting 
policies saying he is the governor who vetoed mandatory 
sentencing for drug dealers and is opposed to capital punishment 
for drug dealers 
both presidential contenders agreed it was time to leave by the 
wayside inquiries into quayles background and concentrate on the 
issues 
the american people arent interested in the grades that some 
of us might have gotten while we were in college dukakis said 
referring to queries about quayles less than sterling academic 
performance they care about whether their children will have the 
chance to go to college 
bush said quayle has absorbed a tremendous pounding over his 
national guard service and other issues and has emerged to where 
he will be an asset to the gop ticket 
on the issue of presidential debates the two campaigns disagree 
on the when and where 
there will be an opportunity to debate and i just dont feel 
under any great rush bush said of todays meeting between top 
aides in both campaigns we might meet somebody halfway but im 
not about to be stampeded i say explain your views on defense 
the response is how about debates totally irrelevant 
democratic national chairman paul kirk charged that bush is 
using longdistance innuendo and transcontinental slurs 
while avoiding facetoface confrontation 
dukakis has pressed for an earlier debate schedule than the bush 
campaign wants 
republicans lead in assembling campaign warchests the federal 
election commission in a report released monday said 
contributions to the five principal republican campaign committees 
totaled 16619 million during the 18 months ending june 30 during 
the same period the five comparable democratic committees raised

a mayor accused of voodoo antics 
undermined the legal process by granting pardons to repeat 
offenders and pocketed payments of some fines the city attorney 
testified at his impeachment trial 
larry grissett the city attorney testified monday at the trial 
of florala mayor ht mathis that he had warned the 85yearold 
official about abusing his legal authority to grant pardons 
charges against mathis who is accused of incompetence and 
damaging his small towns reputation with voodoo antics 
include wholesale pardoning of convicted drunken drivers 
its my turn today the mayor said monday at the 
conclusion of the first day of his trial in covington county 
circuit court 
early today three of the mayors supporters stood outside the 
courthouse carrying placards that said impeach don siegelman 
the state attorney general who rarely appears at trials but joined 
his aides at this one 
grissett also testified that the town of 5000 located near the 
florida border was forced to file suit against the mayor to 
prevent him from accepting payments of some fines and depositing 
them in his personal account 
he was taking partial payments outside court on the 
installment basis grissett told the jury he said mathis 
deposited 225 in fines in his personal account and did not return 
the money until i filed suit 
mathis attorney james prestwood questioned grissett about the 
mayors authority to grant pardons the attorney conceded that 
mathis had that power but contended that he had abused it by 
granting pardons to repeat offenders 
siegelman and a county grand jury accused mathis of misusing his 
office by granting too many pardons for drunken drivers the mayor 
is accused of willful neglect of duty incompetency in office and 
corruption 
mathis whose fouryear term expires oct 3 attracted national 
attention by sprinkling socalled voodoo dust around city hall 
and later proclaiming national voodoo week in florala he says 
he sprinkled the powder as a joke 
in opening arguments prestwood portrayed mathis as the victim 
of a political struggle with the city council 
but councilman lewis collins testified that the voodoo 
dusting incident had damaged the towns reputation and that the 
mayor offered no explanation except to say when it works he 
would let us know 
collins said the council had to obtain a court order to halt the 
mayor from releasing people from jail 
he would order the dispatcher to turn people out of jail 
collins said later the mayor began granting pardons to those in 
custody 
in other testimony several florala residents who had been 
arrested on minor offenses said they had pawned their cars to the 
mayor in exchange for payment of fines they said they later 
reimbursed mathis in amounts larger than the fines to get their 
cars back 
in one instance however rachael aplin said the mayor had 
already sold her car to the daughter of a city councilman and she 
was unable to get the vehicle back 
alabama officials found guilty of impeachment charges are only 
removed from office not fined or sent to jail however they can 
face another trial for the same crimes an official thrown out of 
office can appeal the verdict directly to the state supreme court

governors in idaho and wyoming called in national guardsmen 
today to bolster weary firefighters battling dozens of wildfires 
while a remote california town mopped up after lightningsparked 
blazes swept within feet of the community 
fire forced officials to evacuate a hospital in the remote town 
for several hours 
favorable weather conditions monday helped firefighters keep 
blazes from gaining much ground in wyoming montana idaho oregon 
washington and utah but the wildfires were far from out and 
dozens of fires that have been allowed to burn for months in the 
vast interior of alaska largely in scrubland have charred more 
than 12 million acres 
a fire flareup prevented yellowstone national park officials 
from reopening the parks south entrance today and they braced for 
possible stronger wind that could whip up the fires firefighters 
in montana hoped to get the upper hand on fires that have blackened 
almost 200000 acres 
in idaho gov cecil andrus placed the entire state under an 
extreme fire emergency releasing national guardsmen to reinforce 
2000 firefighters battling the worst wildfires 
but officials feared a weather front expected today would bring 
gusts that would push the flames past fire lines 
among the priorities was the 16000acre battle axe fire on the 
middle fork of the salmon river in the frank churchriver of no 
return wilderness it jumped the river to threaten a score of 
summer homes and an unoccupied forest ranger station and airstrip 
at indian creek 
in california firefighters late monday kept fastmoving fires 
from reaching a hospital school and other buildings in remote 
portola 
there were no injuries in the town of 1600 residents and the 
only building lost was a barn as a fire shooting flames 150 feet 
high was halted at the eastern edge of the sierra town 
about 30 patients and staff were evacuated from the eastern 
plumas district hospital first to a community hall several blocks 
away on the other side of the middle fork of the feather river 
which runs through the center of portola and then to other 
hospitals the hospital was reopened after 5 hours 
officials said an afternoon storm sparked about 20 fires around 
the community about 45 miles northwest of reno nev most of the 
fires continued burning today blackening 1200 acres 
one lightning strike started a fire behind portola high school 
just a few minutes before classes were dismissed 
when we walked out onto the field for football practice it 
was just smoking said mike muscatt 15 adding that within a few 
minutes the flames were 80 feet high 
in alaska where some fires have been burning since april the 
biggest blaze had covered more than 541000 acres 50 miles north of 
fairbanks but the fires do not threaten any developed property or 
valuable timber and a special interagency office handing fire 
information for the state has been disbanded for the season 
in wyoming firefighters in yellowstone regained ground against 
one of the tougher fires roaring in the park sealing off old 
faithful geyser from flames five miles away 
continued calm winds allowed thousands of firefighters to make 
further inroads in their battle against 10 major fires which have 
charred 450000 acres of the parks 22 million acres 
that calm weather had prompted a decision to reopen 
yellowstones south entrance for the first time in 10 days but 
park spokeswoman amy vanderbilt said fire activity put the area 
back in danger she would not make a new prediction as to when the 
road which has been closed for 10 days would reopen 
wyoming gov mike sullivan called out 120 army and air national 
guard volunteers monday to aid in the battle against a 15000acre 
blaze near fayette lake in the bridgerteton national forest 
outside yellowstone the guardsmen were to go to jackson for 32 
hours of training and the majority would then be sent to that 
blaze 
in montana one major fire was brought under control monday but 
others burned on more than 187000 acres 
the 37600acre warm springs creek fire which destroyed 13 
homes and cabins near helena was declared controlled after three 
weeks and most of the 2500 firefighters were released said 
george bukenhofer fire information officer 
costs of fighting the blaze are expected to reach 10 million 
the combination fire between philipsburg and drummond in 
westcentral montana grew to 10000 acres and firefighters braced 
for gusty winds the winds could move the flames east toward the 
small community of maxville about four miles away said 
information officer palmer bowen 
but at the 1900acre lolo creek fire in western montana the 
winds were expected to bring safety to about 56 homes sandwiched 
between the southern edge of the fire and a highway 
all but one of oregons major forest fires have been virtually 
contained or controlled but the largest burned out of control 
monday in the northeast 
the tepee butte fire grew to 33600 acres of grass and timber in 
the wallowawhitman national forest and the hells canyon national 
recreation area about 25 miles north of enterprise 
the growth from 28000 acres was largely due to backfires set to 
consume fuel in the path of the flames officials said 
shifting winds in washington state fanned worries that several 
fires burning on the kettle range would merge to become one large 
conflagration said diana baxter a spokeswoman for the forest 
service the kettle range fires on the colville indian reservation 
were the biggest of the blazes that have blackened more than 19000 
acres of the states forest and rangelands 
in utah firefighters contained a 525acre fire near the 
pineview reservoir 25 miles east of ogden and moved in to douse 
remaining hot spots

rundu southwest africa ap the last south african troops 
withdrew today from angola after fighting for more than a year in 
support of antimarxist guerrillas 
the armed forces chief of staff lt gen ian gleeson said at a 
ceremony that nearly 1000 soldiers crossed into southwest africa 
during the day as part of a regional peace accord 
as of this moment we are out of angola gleeson said 
south african and foreign journalists were flown to rundu on 
the angolan border to witness what the final stages of the 
withdrawal of south african forces they saw 50 military vehicles 
cross a pontoon bridge over the okavango river before the bridge 
was dismantled 
in southwest africa also known as namibia military officials 
said security forces in the past week killed 14 guerrillas fighting 
to end south african rule over the territory south african forces 
also staged their first amphibious landing exercise today on the 
namibian coast 
south african forces have been in angola since early 1987 the 
pullout from angola is part of a ceasefire agreement that is 
intended to clear the way for withdrawal of about 50000 cuban 
troops from angola and independence for namibia 
an estimated 2500 south african troops in angola have been 
leaving since a ceasefire was declared aug 8 
the cuban troops support angolas marxist government in its 
13yearold war against guerrillas of unita national union for the 
total independence of angola south africa and the united states 
back unita 
unita is not party to the ceasefire and was excluded from 
recent peace talks held by south africa cuba and angola under us 
mediation 
there have been unconfirmed reports that south africa has been 
reinforcing its line of bases in northern namibia 
the amphibious landing exercise was conducted on a beach near 
walvis bay a south african enclave that serves as namibias only 
commercial port highspeed landing craft carried marines and 
paratroopers ashore as part of a sixweek exercise involving about 
2500 military personnel 
the southwest african peoples organization the main 
proindependence movement in the territory contends walvis bay 
should become part of a sovereign namibia south africas deputy 
defense minister wynand breytenbach said monday the port would 
remain under south african control and continue to serve as a 
military base 
the south africanled territorial army said today that 14 swapo 
guerrillas have been killed in the last week swapo considered 
likely to take power if independence elections are held has said 
it will observe a ceasefire in namibia starting thursday if south 
africa reciprocates 
south africa says it will begin withdrawing from namibia on nov 
1 and allow the territory to hold independence elections next june 
1 if cuban troops leave angola by the latter date 
the four countries involved in the negotiations met last week in 
brazzaville congo but failed to agree on a timetable for cuban 
withdrawal from angola and namibian independence more talks are 
planned next week 
south africa has intervened in angola regularly since 1975 when 
it invaded the country on the eve of angolan independence from 
portugal south africa advanced several hundred miles up angolas 
west coast before turning back 
south african forces returned to angola several times in the 
early 1980s but in may 1985 announced a complete withdrawal 
several weeks later two south african commandos were killed and a 
third was captured in northernmost angola 
thousands of south african troops entered angola in 1987 to 
assist unita south african generals said their maximum strength in 
angola was 3000 men although other reports claimed the force was 
twice that size during heavy fighting last october 
in november south africa said its forces again had begun 
withdrawing but most of the troops remained until this month 
dozens of white south african troops most of them conscripts 
have been killed in angola the past year black units including 
angolans fighting for south africa are believed to have suffered 
heavier casualties but no comprehensive figures have been released

in west germany in which 47 people were killed and hundreds injured 
when three italian air force jets collided during a highspeed air 
show maneuver above ramstein air force base 
lt col richard hill a public affairs officer at vandenberg 
said the bases sept 18 air show would be held in strict 
accordance with department of defense and faa regulations 
hill said base officials had to submit a map of the runway area 
to the federal aviation administration for approval 
earlier today rep norman dicks dwash said he had written 
to defense secretary frank c carlucci asking for a review of us 
policy on air shows 
i think we can make these shows safer dicks said on 
abctvs good morning america he said officials should 
consider requiring that spectators be moved back further from 
aerial demonstrations 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater briefing reporters 
monday in santa barbara while president reagan vacationed at his 
nearby ranch said the united states was assisting in the 
investigation of sundays accident in germany 
fitzwater said reagan was sending messages of condolence to the 
german people and others 
members of americas military aerial stunt teams have been 
killed in the past but none has ever killed a spectator the 
federal aviation administration regulates the aerial teams and 
limits the maneuvers they may perform 
fitzwater asked whether the united states was rethinking its 
position on such shows said we dont have all the details of 
this incident so were most reluctant to pass judgment on this 
episode or on air shows in general 
america has a lot of air shows the spokesman said we 
have them at air force bases many are militaryoriented there are 
a lot of private air shows around the country its been a long 
tradition in various circumstances to have these kinds of air 
shows so we would be reluctant to make any judgments at this time 
it certainly does however emphasize the need for vigilance 
and safety fitzwater added and im sure that those matters 
will be considered i noticed that the west german authorities did 
indicate they would not have any more air shows but at this point 
we dont have any conclusion on that subject 
the navys blue angels and the air forces thunderbirds have 
been appearing at air shows for decades 
the navy determined last year that 63 percent of the students 
entering navy flight school had seen at least one blue angels 
performance of those the navy said almost 40 percent cited the 
team as a direct influence on their decision to join the military 
a pilot was killed during a blue angels demonstration over 
niagara falls ny in july 1985 the worst accident in the 
history of the thunderbirds occurred jan 18 1982 during a 
practice session in nevada four pilots died as a team followed its 
leader into the ground 
john leyden a spokesman for the faa said monday the agency 
wouldnt allow aerobatic maneuvers above the crowd or 
approaching spectators 
our minimum flight line for jets is 1500 feet from the crowd 
and we require all maneuvers be performed along that line leyden 
said 
witnesses to the west german disaster said the italian air 
forces team of 10 jets was flying about 180 feet off the ground 
and intersecting over the field from three different directions a 
maneuver that put some of the jets on a course directly toward the 
crowd 
overall the safety record for air shows in this country is 
really outstanding said leyden noting that there are more than 
200 such shows staged annually nationwide 
we control the air space so it is up to us to make sure that 
all operations in that airspace are conducted properly and 
safely leyden said the thunderbirds and the blue angels put 
their shows together but we decide on a showbyshow basis whether 
there is airspace to accommodate the maneuvers safely 
fitzwater told reporters the administration was deeply 
saddened by the accident 
we extend our sympathies to the families of those killed and 
injured in the crash he said the president will be sending 
messages of condolence to the german people and to others who are 
affected by the tragedy details of those messages are still being 
worked out but the united states government is assisting the 
italian government in investigating the cause of the accident 
most of the more than 300000 spectators at the air show were 
west germans and americans 
fitzwater said a team from brooke army medical center in san 
antonio texas was flying to germany to assist in treatment of the 
injured particularly burn victims

secretary of education william j bennett said 
today many us elementary schools suffer from defective curricula 
and need a strong dose of the classics rigorous math and science 
and foreign language study in the 4th grade 
bennett held a news conference to unveil his proposed model 
called james madison elementary school a curriculum for american 
students 
he said it is a sequel to the james madison high school 
model he issued last december and he joked that this one could be 
called jimmy madison elementary school 
he said elementary schools generally are in better shape than 
high schools but at most maybe a third of our schools are 
offering a curriculum as strong as the one he favors 
if theres a crucial point here its the 4th grade he 
said we see a 4thgrade slump in readingmath and science 
he said american grade schools probably devote more time to math 
than japanese schools do but too much of it is spent on dull 
workbooks and too often parents teachers and students alike accept 
the notion that some students just cannot handle math 
we need a little more persistence he said 
we have put together a curriculum for all children not just 
for the affluent or collegebound he said 
bennett who is leaving his post sept 20 called it my final 
report to the american people as secretary 
the report outlines what bennett calls a sound elementary 
school core curriculum from kindergarten through eighth grade in 
seven subjects english social studies mathematics science 
foreign language fine arts and physical and health education 
its suggested reading list ranges from the tales of pippi 
longstocking and mrs pigglewiggle for the early grades to the 
red badge of courage and alices adventures in wonderland for 
older pupils bennett said he emphasized classics because they 
are so often missing from elementary school instruction 
bennett has no authority to force a single school in america to 
follow any of his suggestions public school curricula are 
determined by state and local school agencies and private schools 
are free to set their own courses the 1979 law that created the 
us department of education specifically forbade the agency from 
prescribing curricula 
bennett said he was just offering some free advice 
i do not presume to instruct teachers or parents 
principals administrators and school boards in the details of 
their daily jobs or in the exact shape sequence and specialized 
content of their elementary school curricula he said 
the document is not a monolithic program to be uniformly 
imposed or slavishly followed he said instead it is intended 
more broadly as a statement of goals 
bennetts suggestions for social studies include american 
history in each of the first five grades world history and 
geography in sixth and seventh grades and both world geography and 
american government in eighth grade 
he would have all youngsters take either algebra or prealgebra 
by eighth grade his science curriculum would be capped with 
biology in seventh grade and some chemistry and physics in eighth 
grade he said foreign language instruction should start no later 
than fourth grade 
we want our students by the end of 8th grade to read 
write and speak clear and grammatical english and to be acquainted 
with the varieties and qualities of fiction and nonfiction 
literature we want them to know the essential features of american 
and world history the major landscapes and nations of the earth 
and the rights and obligations that belong to citizens of the 
united states he wrote 
we want them to be proficient in arithmetic and geometry and 
familiar with basic principles of algebra we want them to have 
begun exploring biology chemistry physics and a foreign language 
to have investigated the history and practice of art and music and 
to have developed the habits of health fitness and athletic fair 
play 
the report profiles seven schools as models of strong elementary 
curricula meridith magnet elementary school in temple texas

the fourman junta met today to nominate 
the sole candidate expected to be president augusto pinochet in 
a presidential referendum that could extend pinochets rule until 
1997 
national police troops cordoned off the defense ministry 
building where army commander gen pinochet navy chief adm jose 
merino air force commander gen fernando matthei and national 
police director gen rodolfo stange began their nomination session 
at noon behind closed doors 
their selection will be presented for ratification or rejection 
in an october referendum 
under the election rules established by the military government 
pinochet who deposed the elected president in a bloody 1973 
military coup and the other three junta members were to name a 
single nominee and voters will vote yes or no on that 
candidate 
pinochet merino matthei and stange all in dress military 
uniforms arrived one at a time at the ministry building entering 
on a thick red carpet rolled out for the occasion none made any 
remarks 
while the other commanders arrived by car the 72yearold 
pinochet and his entourage of aides and bodyguards came on foot 
from the government palace directly across santiagos central 
boulevard he was both cheered and booed by bystanders 
both proand antipinochet groups planned demonstrations in 
connection with the nomination 
gen oscar torres national police subdirector said we have 
certainly taken some special security measures especially in the 
slums where some day there might be problems 
we dont expect serious problems he added 
interior undersecretary alberto cardemil told reporters there 
is total and complete calm throughout the country and i dont 
think the government will need to take any extraordinary measures 
on monday police used water cannons to scatter a downtown 
demonstration by women chanting antigovernment slogans and urging 
voters to vote no in the referendum witnesses said about 25 
people were arrested 
if a majority of chiles 72 million registered voters cast 
yes ballots in the referendum the nominee will begin an 
eightyear term march 11 if a majority reject him an open 
election will be held in 1990 with pinochet remaining in power 
until then 
the 1980 constitution gives the junta 48 hours to nominate a 
candidate were the commanders to fail to reach a unanimous 
decision within that time the constitution calls for nomination by 
majority decision of an eightman national security council which 
includes pinochet navy chief adm jose merino air force commander 
gen fernando matthei and national police director gen rodolfo 
stange it also includes four other officials three of whom are 
appointed by pinochet 
opposition leaders said they had little doubt that pinochet 
would win a quick nomination and called on followers to bang empty 
pots and pans inside their homes tonight in protest 
it will be the noisiest potbanging ever heard predicted 
ricardo lagos a socialist and coleader of a 16party opposition 
coalition 
members of the youth wings of several opposition parties and a 
communistcontrolled slum dwellers organization planned street 
demonstrations in central santiago 
the defense minister adm patricio carvajal warned monday that 
the government will not allow any violent demonstrations they 
will be suppressed by police 
pinochet led the coup that ousted the elected government of 
marxist president salvador allende in september 1973

a group of climate researchers has warned that 
the greenhouse effect warming of the earth will continue even 
if there are sharp cutbacks in the use of the chemicals which cause 
the problem 
the heatup appears to be inevitable even with drastic 
and probably unrealistic reductions of greenhouse forcing by the 
release of carbon dioxide and other gases the scientists reported 
in the journal of geophysical researchatmospheres 
the group led by james hansen of the national aeronautical and 
space administration reached that conclusion after running 
computerized climate models in an effort to predict the climate in 
the future 
the models looked at the effect of chemical releases at three 
different levels continuing rapid release of the chemicals as in 
recent years release at slower rates and a drastic cutback in 
those chemicals 
in the first case the earths average temperature was 
calculated to rise by 16 degrees fahrenheit within 20 years 
it would take 25 years for that increase in the second model 
and even with the drastic and probably unrealistic cutback 
in chemical releases the temperature would rise that much 
eventually and probably would climb by 08 degrees within 15 
years according to the study 
the greenhouse effect has drawn increasing concern recently 
although most meteorologists contend that it is too early to 
determine if it is responsible for the current drought and hot 
weather affecting much of the nation 
it occurs when carbon dioxide largely from burning fossil 
fuels and other gases such as methane and nitrogen oxides 
increase in the atmosphere these gases let incoming heat from the 
sun reach the earth but block the earths own heat from traveling 
into space much as a greenhouse traps heat indoors as the gases 
become more abundant more heat is trapped and the planets 
temperature rises 
hansen told a congressional subcommittee earlier in the summer 
that the current hot dry conditions are an example of things to 
come 
in particular he noted in the new report while the average 
increase in global warming doesnt sound like a lot it means 
increasing frequency for hot summers and some areas will be 
affected more than others 
if the summer outlook were a die with six faces hansen wrote 
the period between 1950 and 1979 would have had two faces 
representing a hot year two representing a normal year and two a 
cold year 
by the 1990s he anticipates that die will be loaded with 
three or four faces coming up hot when it is rolled 
that means the chances of any particular summer being hotter 
than normal would top 50 percent compared to the 33 percent chance 
of the past 
and such a change would be large enough to affect the quality of 
life hansen and his coauthors reported 
for example they noted that over the past 30 years omaha 
neb experienced a run of five or more consecutive days with a 
high of 95 degrees or more on an average of 3 times in 10 years 
the climate model predicts that this could increase to 5 years out 
of 10 in the 1990s and 7 years out of 10 by 2020 
such an increase in the number of runs of hot weather can damage 
corn and other crops hansen warned and can also affect forests 
water supplies animals and people 
a warming of 08 degrees in a decade is faster than any found in 
historical studies and is thought to be faster than most plants are 
able to accommodate 
we emphasize that it is the possibility of rapid climate 
change which is of most concern for the biosphere there may not be 
sufficient time for many biosystems to adapt to the rapid changes 
forecast for scenarios involving rapid growth of trace gases 
wrote hansen and his coauthors 
other scientists have speculated that the increasing heat would 
cause some of the ice to melt in the polar regions possibly 
raising sea levels around the world 
the new report tends to reinforce that by noting that the polar 
regions would likely be more affected by the rising temperature 
than some other regions 
regions where the warming showed up strongly included certain 
ocean areas including the caribbean east indies bay of bengal 
parts of the indian ocean and sections of the pacific ocean near 
and just north of the equator in addition the effects would be 
strongly felt in china the kazakhmongoliamanchuria area and in 
the north and south polar regions the report said 
as to the united states warming weather was predicted to have a 
greater effect in the east than in the west 
seven other scientists from nasas goddard institute for space 
studies and the massachusetts institute of technology developed the 
study with hansen

a federal judge today rejected a request to 
unseal search warrants and other court documents used in the search 
of the homes of three men in connection with the governments probe 
of defense contractors 
the decision by us district chief judge alexander harvey was a 
setback for the washington post which had persuaded a us 
magistrate to unseal some of the documents in july 
in overturning the magistrates ruling harvey agreed with the 
government that making the papers public could impede the 
governments probe 
harvey also said the three maryland men whose homes were 
searched under the warrants had not been criminally charged since 
they were merely under investigation harvey said they had a right

sometimes democratic vice presidential 
candidate lloyd bentsen seems barely able to control his glee over 
his republican rival fellow sen dan quayle 
when george bush first picked the indiana senator bentsen 
hailed it as good news with quayle soon swamped in 
controversy bentsen was asked what he would do if he were george 
bush 
sweat he said 
bentsen 67 is one of the lions of the senate after 18 years 
hes chairman of the senate finance committee sponsor of some of 
the most important legislation of the decade a successful 
businessman and decorated world war ii bomber pilot 
by comparison in experience and accomplishments the 
41yearold quayle pales not a member of the club sniffed 
one top senate democratic aide 
and occasionally bentsen lets slip that he really doesnt think 
quayle measures up 
in eight years in the senate quayle has been known mostly for 
his fight for president reagans strategic defense initiative his 
battle for the controversial federal court appointment of daniel 
manion and a losing fight against the 60day notification for plant 
closings 
i dont remember anything in particular bentsen said when 
asked if he had squared off against quayle on any other issues 
and he makes repeated subtle references to quayles youth 
i certainly dont think hes too young but certainly youve 
got to have some maturity to be a heartbeat away from the 
presidency he said at one kentucky stop when reporters goaded 
bentsen with questions on whether quayle would still be on the 
ticket nov 8 the texan finally couldnt resist 
i hope so he said 
but away from the public eye bentsen and his top aides are 
concerned about going into debate against quayle 
bentsen is younger than president reagan was when he won the 
white house but his face looks older especially on television 
the campaign has signed him up for coaching and makeup consultation 
so he wont appear wooden when put sidebyside with the handsome 
quayle 
and while a senate record takes years of consistent work a 
televised debate is measured in 30second bites a wellbriefed 
quayle given the right format could hold his own 
and holding his own might be good enough to be declared the 
winner given the low expectations accorded the indiana senator 
were on the wrong end of the expectations game as far as the 
vice presidential debate is concerned because everyone expects 
sen bentsen to do so well said linda peek a longtime senate 
democratic strategist who is now a private consultant in washington 
other democrats already are defending bentsen in advance of a 
debate that may never come off 
the senator is concerned about a debate because his style as a 
senator is to get things done and he doesnt engage in a lot of 
sparring on the floor national party spokesman mike mccurry 
said on the other hand its easy to envision dan quayle as a tv 
talk show host 
bentsen also must be careful not to bludgeon quayle and win him 
a backlash of sympathy among voters as has occurred in the recent 
controversy over quayles national guard record 
norman ornstein who studies politics at the american enterprise 
institute says the democrats have reason to worry about quayle 
he is not a dummy ornstein said in past debates such as 
when he defeated incumbent birch bayh to win the senate in 1980 
quayle showed when he was prepared wellbriefed and focused he 
could do all right 
bentsen meanwhile has the difficult task of not wanting to 
help the republicans in their expectations game and also not 
wanting to speak well of quayle 
it isnt in bentsens interest to talk about quayle 
ornstein said 
so while he clearly sees quayle as a lesser opponent bentsen 
must focus his attacks away from the man and back to the issues and 
quayles conservative voting record 
i dont want to get into his personal life that i dont want 
to do bentsen says 
then bentsen hints about which republican would have been a 
worthy opponent 
i thought it would be bob dole frankly he says its a 
real gamble picking quayle and i think its going to be proven 
that way

gen augusto pinochet is shrewd 
combative and firmly in command of his army implacable with 
critics and tireless in what he sees as a mission from god to build 
a ommunistproof society 
the president disdains alcohol lifts weights and has a boxers 
physique at age 72 in which he takes extra pride because of 
weakness as a child 
he defends his authoritarian style of politics as a bulwark 
against marxism and has successfully resisted the current latin 
american trend toward elected civilian governments 
pinochet gained power in a 1973 coup that ousted the elected 
government of president salvador allende a selfdescribed marxist 
who died during the takeover 
social unrest and economic chaos created wide support for the 
coup and it was commonly believed civilian rule would return in a 
few years 
instead pinochet banned political activity and purged chile of 
tens of thousands of leftists most were expelled but human rights 
groups say hundreds were imprisoned and scores were tortured and 
executed 
the army navy air force and national police commanders were 
supposed to alternate as head of the junta but pinochet used 
political maneuvers and the pressure of his army the most powerful 
branch to become undisputed leader 
he uses the military tactics of surprise and force in directing 
the nation and proudly states that his character was formed in the 
army 
in recent years especially since escaping an assassination 
attempt by leftist guerrillas in september 1986 he has cited the 
support of providence pinochet declared last year god put me on 
top 
another result of that attempt is an obsession with personal 
security his motorcade routinely includes four carloads of heavily 
armed bodyguards a van of army commandos and an ambulance and a 
helicopter gunship often hovers overhead 
pinochet was born nov 25 1915 in the port city of valparaiso 
one of three children of a customs official he ignored parental 
pleas to study medicine and got into the military academy after two 
rejections the first time because he was too young and the second 
because of physical weakness 
he filled out to a solid 185 pounds at the academy and earned a 
university degree 
an autobiography published in 1980 says he became aware of an 
international marxist threat while commanding a camp for communist 
prisoners in 1948 and later lectured at the national war college 
on the dangers of communism 
when allende became president pinochet remained outwardly loyal 
and was named army commander in august 1973 less than a month 
before the coup some other participants in the military rebellion 
said later he was an opportunist who joined the conspiracy at the 
last minute 
political repression after the coup earned pinochet an 
international reputation as a harsh dictator 
that image was bolstered by assassinations of exiled critics 
they included orlando letelier a cabinet minister under allende 
who was killed with an american assistant in 1976 when their car 
was blown up in washington 
the general equated foreign criticism with interference in 
chiles internal affairs 
he announced plans to reshape chilean society and build durable 
safeguards against communism a constitution written by his 
administration and approved in a 1980 referendum outlaws ideologies 
based on class struggle 
it also includes a phased return of democracy but guarantees 
pinochet the presidency until 1989 and makes an additional eight 
years possible if he wins a presidential referendum later this year 
pinochet introduced a freemarket economic program that coupled 
with heavy foreign borrowing and an overvalued peso produced 
record unemployment in the early 1980s and nearly led to financial 
collapse 
economic hardship inspired protests that threatened his 
government pinochet moderated his policies winning international 
approval and even the grudging praise of opponents after five years 
of steady economic growth and stability 
he ceaselessly lashes the old guard civilian politicians he 
considers too weak and selfish to protect the nations interests 
and the attacks often are viciously personal he recently called a 
prominent but very short political leader a human remnant 
in the style of a stern uncle pinochet preaches patriotism 
family values and hard work that appeals to many common chileans 
but his rural vernacular grates on many educated ears 
lucia his wife often appears in public with pinochet and 
actively campaigns for his continuation as president they have 
three daughters and two sons

the navy has ordered ships in the atlantic 
ocean to stop dumping medical waste at sea in response to 
complaints involving waste that washed ashore 
earlier this summer beaches in new york and new jersey were 
closed after a large quantity of waste washed ashore the navy was 
not blamed in the dumping 
the navy admitted aug 8 that medical waste was dumped from two 
norfolkbased ships after personnel from the navy and the marines 
were used to clean up a 26mile stretch of north carolina beaches 
from fort macon to emerald isle sailors and marines collected what 
the navy said was a trashbag full of medical supplies 
adm frank b kelso head of the 300ship atlantic fleet said 
monday he sent a message to all commands on saturday to cease 
dumping at sea 
while only one of these incidents involved a small quantity of 
medical waste attributed to atlantic fleet ships these incidents 
clearly dictate increased emphasis on proper disposal of all types 
of waste kelso said 
regulations will be adopted immediately by ship commanders that 
would require special handling of all potentially infectious 
medical waste he said 
kelso defined potentially infectious waste as disposable medical 
supplies designed for use in diagnosis treatment laboratory 
testing or training those items will include all sharp objects 
containers of blood and blood products pathology specimens and 
tissue he said

an appeals court lifted a ban 
tuesday on the aug 28 edition of a popular local daily that had 
lampooned yugoslavias communist party chief the official tanjug 
news agency reported 
the district court in split a city on the central adriatic 
coast rejected the demand for a permanent ban of the edition of 
nedeljna dalmacija ruling there were no grounds to support it the 
news agency said 
the temporary ban was imposed by the split public prosecutors 
office because of a commentary that lampooned party chief stipe 
suvar president of the partys ruling presidium and other top 
officials 
it is hypocritical to forbid publications making fun of our 
top leaders when jokes about them are constantly being told by 
the people said the news agency quoted the court ruling as saying 
it was not clear whether the prosecutors office would appeal 
the verdict

they will increasingly face the combined fury of law enforcement 
agencies of all nations whose people they victimize

television satellite coverage of a news conference from bogota 
colombia where the international drug enforcement conference was

data he said never before has there been such systematic and 
comprehensive cooperation overcoming barriers of language 
national boundaries legal jurisdiction and other differences 
the conference was set up in 1983 and includes panama mexico

a delegation from warsaw will take part in a 
ceremony this week honoring the 4000 polish officers slain in the 
katyn forest although the soviet union is not taking responsiblity 
for the world war ii massacre a government spokesman said 
a joint sovietpolish investigation into the killings has not 
been completed and the final truth about responsibility is 
still to be determined said foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov 
for years the soviet government has blamed the killings in the 
forest near smolensk 250 miles west of moscow on nazi occupation 
forces the kremlin has maintained the massacre occurred in the 
fall of 1941 after the invasion of nazi forces in june of that 
year 
but western historians contend the soviet state security and 
police force carried out the massacre in april 1940 
the polish officers had been taken prisoner by soviet soldiers 
in 1939 during the red armys campaign against poland 
since mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 the soviet 
union and poland have labeled the katyn massacre a blank spot 
a taboo or disputed issue in the two nations histories they 
have set up a joint commission of historians to investigate the 
killings 
one soviet historian a latshev has been quoted as saying he 
saw evidence that soviet bullets were found in bodies exhumed at 
katyn 
many poles were disappointed that gorbachev did not mention the 
katyn massacre during a visit to poland in july 
gerasimov told reporters at a regular news briefing an official 
polish delegation will witness the unveiling of a plaque at a 
memorial complex during a ceremony at katyn on thursday 
a commemorative plaque will be set up there with the following 
inscription a memorial complex to polish officers who perished at 
katyn and a monument to soviet prisonersofwar will be erected in 
this place gerasimov said 
the polish visitors plan to lay wreaths on the site he said 
the dedication of the plaque did not mean the soviet union was 
accepting responsiblity for the massacre but that anyway the 
time has come for a monument to be built there gerasimov said 
on may 28 radio moscow reported soviet officials participated 
in a ceremony the day before at katyn at a recently renovated 
monument to the polish officers shot dead by the nazis in 1941 
the report went on to say that version of the massacre was being 
reconsidered 
it was not clear whether the monument was part of the same 
complex to which gerasimov referred he said in a telephone 
interview after the briefing he was unaware of the may ceremony at 
katyn and believed the memorial complex was still under 
construction at that time 
he said he did not know why the inscription on the monument 
which specifically blames the nazis and gives a date for the 
massacre differs from the one on the new plaque which places no 
blame or date

an albanian demonstrator used a 
portrait of the late president tito to attack a policeman in a town 
in southern yugoslavia the state tanjug news agency reported 
tuesday 
it said police arrested 13 of the estimated 200 albanians who 
hurled stones at them in kumanovo 260 miles south of belgrade on 
monday night 
the demonstrators were protesting the introduction of compulsory 
bilingual education in secondary schools in the region which 
belongs to yugoslavias southern republic of macedonia 
the clash occurred after 500 ethnic albanians gathered in front 
of the town hall and demanded that schools form separate classes in 
which the macedonian language would not be used for ethnic 
albanians who are a minority 
the authorities who earlier this year disbanded such classes in 
favor of bilingual education described the demonstrations as the 
work of albanian nationalists and separatists 
the protesters carried a portrait of tito and shouted better a 
grave than a slave and we want freedom and justice 
the perfidy and transparency of slogans used by the 
demonstrators was unmasked when a demonstrator attacked a policeman 
with the portrait of comrade tito said tanjug 
demonstrators in yugoslavia regularly invoke the name or carry 
portraits of tito who is still venerated as a moral shield 
against the security forces 
the demonstration is one of the largest by ethnic albanians 
since 1981 when at least nine people died in ethnic rioting in the 
neighboring province of kosovo where nearly 90 percent of the 
population is albanian 
the minority slav population of the province has recently held a 
series of rallies demanding that authorities put a stop to what 
they describe as discrimination by albanians whose actions they 
claim are forcing them to move out of kosovo

the chief us negotiator at the superpower 
antiballistic missile treaty review conference on tuesday 
reasserted us opposition to the soviet radar under construction 
at krasnoyarsk saying it violates the treaty 
william burns head of the us arms control and disarmament 
agency also reiterated the us commitment to the reagan 
administrations spacebased missile defense program 
the soviets maintain that some research of the program known 
officially as the strategic defense initiative and popularly called 
star wars violates the abm treaty 
in a speech to the 40nation conference on disarmament his 
first public comment since the treaty review conference began aug 
24 burns referred only briefly to the dispute and did not break 
any new ground 
he said the united states believes the krasnoyarsk radar is a 
significant violation of a central element of this treaty and that 
measures must be taken to resolve this serious problem 
the united states maintains the radar violates the 1972 treaty 
because it is not located on the periphery of the country facing 
outward as the treaty stipulates that missiletracking radars must 
be 
the abm treaty restricts each side to deploying only one abm 
system comprising a radar and antiballistic missiles the aim is 
to prevent either side from creating a full nationwide protective 
network under the theory that neither side would launch a nuclear 
attack if it feared devastating retaliation 
the two sides are holding their third review conference in 
geneva under the treaty such a review must be held every five 
years to allow both sides to air their grievances 
the soviet union has charged that some star wars research 
violates the abm treaty though it has not made clear in public 
statements where it draws the line 
burns said the proposed system is not a bargaining chip we 
will research it test it and if it works deploy it he said 
in his wideranging speech burns also warned about the dangers 
of the nuclear weapons proliferation 
it is indeed ironic that just when the two major nuclear 
weapon states have agreed to destroy their intermediate range 
nuclear forces similar weapons systems appear to be spreading to 
other regions of the world he said the spread will only 
create new security problems he said 
burns also said the upcoming us presidential election would 
not affect the us commitment to the search for a comprehensive 
ban on chemical weapons saying it is an enduring bipartisan 
commitment 
the disarmament conference has been trying to negotiate such a 
ban for about 19 years

collected 153000 in the first seven months of the program 
some people spoke out against the ordinance

sandinista troops are patrolling in 
rural areas undergoing intensive training and staying on the alert 
during a fragile ceasefire with contra rebels 
the governments combat units have spent time regrouping and 
farmers in this combat area about 80 miles northeast of managua 
said they have been able to plant crops despite lingering tension 
each side has charged the other with violating the ceasefire 
during the five months it has been in effect but the sandinistas 
recognize their advantage the contras dont have much of a 
possibility of major attacks said defense ministry spokeswoman 
maj rosa pasos in a recent interview in managua 
most of the contras trying to overthrow the sandinistas have 
holed up in honduras and they are continuing to train new fighters 
and ask for weapons from the united states 
each side says the other is planning for renewed combat and 
roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo recently charged both 
sides with preparing to renew the almost sevenyear war 
the 9yearold sandinista government and contra leaders signed a 
ceasefire agreement march 23 three weeks after the us congress 
cut off military aid to the rebels talks to define the pact which 
called for democratic reforms and an end to rebel attacks broke 
off june 9 
contra officials and sandinistas estimate that some 2000 rebels 
remain inside nicaragua mostly in the rugged northern mountains 
peasants in eastern matagalpa a northern province that has seen 
heavy combat during the war said contra rebels ambushed several 
civilian cars and military vehicles recently on the remote dirt 
roads 
many motorists venturing along the rutted 20mile stretch from 
matiguas to rio blanco a longtime contra route fly white flags to 
mark their neutrality while journeying through the area 
this road runs along the contra corridor to the north to 
honduras a sandinista military officer jose ortega said at the 
rio blanco base overlooking steep hills here you cant say any 
road is safe 
ortega said the rebels most in torn uniforms or civilian 
clothes kidnapped more than a dozen civilians recently 
in the town of matiguas several residents said the combat in 
the region was sharply reduced but that an air of tension remained 
its quiet by comparison said farmer jose sequira but we 
just wait and see 
the farmer and government officials said the lull in the war 
meant many peasants planted crops this spring for the first time in 
several years 
but we dont know if well be able to reap the harvest said 
sequira 
a series of informal talks started by sandinista troops with 
contra combatants ended in may an army officer said the rebels 
responded to messages with bullets 
contra leader enrique bermudez said recently the chats were 
part of a sandinista trick to dismantle us one by one 
contra officials report that most of their forces fled during 
the past four months to tent camps in eastern honduras where more 
than 9000 combatants are receiving ussupplied food and uniforms 
rebel commanders said recently they are prepared to return to 
the battlefields in nicaragua but needed weapons denied by the 
us congress since feb 29 many are now armed with rusted 
sovietdesigned kalashnikov rifles 
the sandinistas supplied by the soviet union last year 
received 505 million in war supplies according to the pentagon 
the nicaraguan defense ministry spokeswoman said shipments were 
arriving this year as usual but declined to elaborate 
army troops pasos said in an interview were moving into areas 
where contra presence had been strong and were seeking civilian 
support by backing health and educational services 
at rebel base camps in honduras contra officials said the 
sandinistas are getting ready for an attack aimed at finishing the 
contras once and for all 
the sandinista troops pasos said were refining combat skills 
looking at new tactics to counter contra ambushes and staying in 
the field 
our combat troops are in position pasos said 
asked about any plans to reduce nicaraguas 80000strong armed 
forces the largest in central america she replied for what 
the war hasnt ended 
more than 26000 people have been killed since the fighting 
started in 1981 a 18 months after the sandinistas overthrew 
dictator anastasio somoza

the soninlaw of the late soviet leader leonid i 
brezhnev could be sentenced to death if convicted next week of 
giving and accepting hundreds of thousands of rubles in bribes a 
government spokesman said tuesday 
the trial of yuri churbanov and eight other former government 
officials starts monday in moscow and is expected to last 1 to two 
months foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said at a 
regular news briefing 
the group will be tried before the military collegium of the 
supreme court and 200 witnesses are scheduled to testify 
according to gerasimov 
the investigation of churbanov and the others has become a 
sensation in the press which for more than a year have taken 
advantage of mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness to report widespread corruption nepotism and organized 
crime the reports usually center around churbanov who married 
brezhnevs daughter galina in 1971 and a crime racket with which 
he was allegedly involved in the republic of uzbekistan 
the communist party daily pravda published a detailed report on 
the case tuesday 
pravda described churbanov appointed deputy interior minister 
in 1980 as a powerhungry man who used family connections for 
criminal purposes it said he thrived during the rule of brezhnev 
who served as leader from 1964 until his death in 1982 
a phenomenon of the stagnation years was the practice of 
making decisions in private about nomination of people to the 
highest positions and a person was judged by his family status and 
the ability to please this or that clan and not by his business 
qualities the newspaper said 
the tass news agency has reported that churbanov is accused of 
accepting bribes totaling more than 11 million equivalent to 270 
years pay for the average soviet factory worker 
gerasimov said churbanov could face execution by firing squad 
because he is charged with serious economic crimes he noted that a 
new version of the criminal code being drafted would reduce the use 
of capital punishment for economic crimes but that this change had 
not yet taken effect 
selected foreign reporters will be allowed to attend the first 
and final days of the trial he said

the redesigned space shuttle booster 
performed to nearperfection during a critical firing earlier this 
month despite being peppered with intentional flaws morton thiokol 
announced tuesday 
it was as near perfect a test as you can imagine spokesman 
rocky raab said the test was so perfect that everyone associated 
with it has taken leave brother theres nobody out at the plant 
raab said workers had completed disassembly and primary analysis 
of the 126footlong solidfuel booster tested aug 18 at morton 
thiokols northern utah plant 25 miles west of brigham city 
success of the firing the fifth and final qualifying test 
required before thiokols redesigned booster is cleared for flight 
was critical to the national aeronautics and space administrations 
plans to resume shuttle missions grounded since the challenger 
disaster 2 years ago 
nasa says it plans to launch the shuttle discovery in late 
september or early october if sluggish oxygen valves and a hydrogen 
leak are repaired in time 
raab said nasa and morton thiokol engineers have gotten all 
the primary results from their painstaking examination of the 
rocket all that remains is mostly computer analysis of the more 
minor details of the testfiring he said 
meantime at space center houston the five discovery astronauts 
and ground support teams began staging their final longduration 
prelaunch rehearsal tuesday 
the crew will face about 150 simulated problems during the 
lengthy test 
morton thiokols 20 million twominute testfiring culminated 
its efforts to redesign the booster blamed for the jan 28 1986 
challenger explosion 
a presidential commission found that a faulty oring seal on one 
of the rockets joints failed during launch allowing superhot 
gases to escape and ignite an exterior fuel tank the challenger 
and its sevenmember crew were destroyed in the subsequent blast 
for the aug 18 test two of the rockets three field joints 
the casetonozzle joint and the ignitertocase joint were 
peppered with 14 intentional flaws 
one field joint was left unflawed for use in comparison

the chairman of george bushs campaign said 
today that the republican nominee was willing to have two debates 
with michael dukakis and a third between their running mates but a 
meeting between leaders of the two campaigns ended with no 
agreement on a set of facetoface confrontations 
top officials of the two presidential campaigns met for nearly 
two hours with james a baker iii chairman of the bush campaign 
saying that they were willing to hold two debates with the first 
coming as early as sept 22 subject to agreement on a format and 
other considerations 
dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas and campaign manager 
susan estrich said after the meeting that the campaign would like 
additional presidential debates and that the bush campaign leaders 
had not agreed to specific dates and places for the debates 
i believe that we will have debates we will have more than 
one debate because its in the best interest of the american 
people brountas said 
baker said were not afraid of holding a third debate 
between bush and dukakis but he said debates have a way of 
freezing campaigns and added its our view that a campaign is 
a continuing debate 
the two sides agreed to continue negotiations on thursday 
baker the vice presidents media adviser roger ailes and 
adviser bob goodwin met privately with brountas and estrich in the 
washington offices of brountas prestigious hale amp dorr law firm 
the meeting came as the rhetoric escalated over bushs delay in 
agreeing to a specific debate schedule 
there will be an opportunity to debate and i just dont feel 
under any great rush frankly bush said while campaigning in st 
louis we might meet somebody halfway but im not about to be 
stampeded 
democratic national chairman paul kirk charged that bush is 
using longdistance innuendo and transcontinental slurs 
while avoiding facetoface debate the dukakis campaign which has 
already accepted a bipartisan commissions plan for four debates 
said the next move was up to bush 
the bush campaign has been ducking these debates and its up 
to them said leslie dach dukakis communications director 
weve got a plan and its a plan thats been agreed to by both 
parties if they arent willing to follow that plan weve got to 
hear from them 
janet brown executive director of the bipartisan commission on 
presidential debates said she had been asked by each campaign to 
meet with them separately after the bakerbrountas session the 
commission set up the debates with the participation of both party 
chairmen 
brown said that while the bush campaign has voiced a willingness 
in principle to debate i dont think theyd like more than the 
minimum number my sense is they want two we all know publicly the 
dukakis people want more than that 
baker said last week it was unlikely a debate could take place 
before sept 20 effectively ruling out the commissions first 
scheduled debate sept 14 in annapolis md and an even earlier 
proposal by the league of women voters 
i see the statements that have been made recently as opening 
negotiating positions brown said in a briefing for reporters 
the league of women voters sponsor of fall debates in the last 
three presidential elections is pushing its own package of four 
debates 
nancy neuman president of the league said were definitely 
in the thick of it dont count us out 
the leagues proposal is for a debate sept 8 in birmingham 
ala other debates would be held oct 6 in minneapolis minn oct 
23 in boston and nov 1 in los angeles she said the debate in 
boston dukakis home would probably be for vice presidential 
candidates 
brown said the commission could hold a first debate in annapolis 
on a later date but she said there were few fall evenings 
available that would not conflict with television network 
obligations to cover the world series the summer olympics and 
professional football 
the commission wants other debates on sept 25 in winstonsalem 
nc oct 11 in omaha neb and oct 27 in pittsburgh the omaha 
debate could be for the vice presidential candidates brown said

marxistled guerrillas and morocco agreed 
conditionally tuesday to a plan for a unsupervised ceasefire 
and a referendum on the future of the disputed western sahara 
un spokesman francois giuliani said both sides accepted the 
plan for ending the 13year conflict over the phosphaterich 
western sahara with remarks and comments he declined to 
elaborate 
the polisario guerrillas have fought for western saharas 
independence since 1975 when spains colonial forces gave up the 
northwest african territory and morocco annexed it 
algeria has backed polisarios campaign but morocco and algeria 
restored diplomatic relations in may after years of tension verging 
on war 
in madrid spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez 
told spanish national radio spain that he viewed the announcement 
as very good news 
we expect this process to lead to the establishment of peace 
and prosperity in this region of great importance to spain the 
minister said 
giuliani said secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar expects 
to begin a un peacekeeping operation in the region before the end 
of the year the un is considering sending about 2000 
peacekeeping troops to the remote sparsely populated territory 
authorities say 
perez de cuellar will also be appointing a special 
representative to supervise the peace process giuliani said 
the aug 11 peace plan includes the ceasefire and a referendum 
on the desert territorys independence or affiliation with another 
country which would probably be morocco details of the proposal 
have not been made public 
determining who is eligible to vote in the referendum is 
considered the chief sticking point 
moroccan foreign minister abdellatif filali said a referendum 
could be held in the relatively near future under good 
conditions but cautioned that his side is waiting for un 
proposals on details of staging the vote 
bechir mustapha polisarios no 2 man said his side accepted 
the formulation of the question that will be put to voters in a 
referendum 
polisario agrees to consider a 1974 census taken when the 
region was under spanish control as basis for counting western 
saharans mustapha said 
mustapha said polisarios main remaining concern is the future 
of the moroccan administration and army and that details of 
their retreat would have to be settled through negotiations we 
have accepted with certain conditions he said 
the organization of african unity will have to play a major role 
in helping monitor a future accord along with the united nations 
mustapha added 
filali and mustapha gave perez de cuellar their replies to his 
peace plan offering in separate meetings at genevas un office 
the two sides were given a deadline of thursday to submit responses 
after meeting perez de cuellar on saturday for final clarifications 
on his plan 
the western sahara covers about 110000 square miles but had 
only about 76000 inhabitants in the last spanish census in 1975 
most residents have fled to moroccanheld cities or to refugee 
camps around the algerian oasis of tindouf 
polisario claims about 165000 western saharans live around 
tindouf but morocco says most of them are not western saharans 
polisario also claims that twothirds of the 150000 inhabitants 
of the moroccanheld areas are immigrants not eligible to vote but 
morocco asserts 90 percent are western saharans

a mountain lion possibly intended as a religious 
sacrifice was rescued from a cage in a junkyard a state official 
said tuesday 
the animal was found after an anonymous tipster said he was to 
take part in a rite of the cubanbased religious cult santeria 
said lt jim huffstodt of the florida game and fresh water fish 
commission 
the caller said the mountain lion was being held in a cage in a 
miami junkyard 
wildlife inspector tom quinn who checks zoos pet stores and 
private residences to ensure wild animals are treated well rushed 
to the site monday 
tom found where somone was living and found a western 
mountain lion in very bad condition it had certainly been 
neglected huffstodt said he said authorities did not know where 
the 50pound female cat had come from 
we are looking for the guy said huffstodt 
the game commission took the mountain lion to a special camp in 
the everglades to be treated huffstodt said 
santeria is an afrocuban religion created when caribbean 
plantation owners taught their roman catholic beliefs to slaves 
who then merged their native religion with christianity 
practitioners seek favors or advice from their gods with such 
offerings as fruit cigars or sacrificing chickens pigs or goats 
adherents say the animals are not mistreated before slaughter 
experts believe about 40 percent of south floridas hispanic 
community or about 1 million people experiment in santeria and 
anthropologists estimate that related similarly derived religions 
have 100 million followers in latin america and the united states 
animal sacrifices by priests of the religion have caused 
protests in south florida but efforts to ban the practice have 
failed

republican nominee george bush said 
today that the united states should avoid gambling with its future 
by electing michael dukakis who is another liberal governor 
coming out of nowhere 
the vice president who continued his strong defense theme of 
recent days sought to depict his democratic rival as inexperienced 
and weak on defense 
during a tour of a bendix defense plant which bush said keeps 
the muscle of our defense strong the gop nominee suggested that 
dukakis favors unilateral cuts in the muscle of the united 
states 
later as he addressed a 500aticket party fundraiser in a 
private residency bush said that while he didnt want anything 
to do with tearing down the character of his democratic rival 
we should not gamble americas future on another liberal governor 
coming 
on monday afternoon the feisty toughtalking bush was in high 
gear firing up a college crowd at middle tennesse state university 
in nearby murfreesboro 
he railed against dukakis accusing him of being weak on 
defense soft on crime in favor of new taxes and guilty of poor 
judgment and a liberal bias 
using an applause line that he has all but worn out since the 
republican national convention two weeks ago he said that if 
congress ever tried to insist that as president he raise taxes he 
would say read my lips no new taxes 
when he went down to shake hands in the front of the outdoor 
rally of some 3000 to 4000 the crowd surged forward hands 
reaching out excitedly 
i thought that was good bush later told reporters when 
asked how he felt about the enthusiasm of his supporters 
the combative and buoyant george bush has been delighting 
supporters in city after city since the new orleans gop convention 
as he speaks with a confident voice that seems to have been waiting 
until after the convention to project itself 
his apparent ease with the new image stood in contrast with a 
monday morning speech in which he slipped into his old lowkey 
style addressing employees of a defense contracting plant near st 
louis 
while some of the new rhetoric was there the tone was more 
measured recalling a style that was prominent in the primary 
campaign 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller said that was because bush 
wanted to lay out substantive material on the differences between 
himself and dukakis mostly on defense 
i think there will be times when hell give more serious 
speeches particularly when we move off of one set of issues into 
another fuller said 
but for now bush is having a good run with the more feisty 
style which coupled with improved standings in the polls has him 
in a relaxed good mood 
fuller said the campaign has not conducted polling yet to see 
how the new tough image is working but weve certainly noted a 
lot more enthusiasm in the crowds 
now that were in this phase of the campaign it certainly 
helps to build up enthusiasm he said 
fuller said the campaign looked at the convention as designed 
to be a break with the past and the convention was an opportunity 
to move from being vice president george bush to candidate george 
bush 
as a candidate hes felt compelled to draw distinctions 
between himself and his opponent fuller said 
and so bush has turned up the heat meter on dukakis sharpening 
his rhetoric and raising his voice as he tells audiences its 
important to show the enormous differences in their positions 
furthermore bush told reporters on monday morning he doesnt 
intend to be stampeded into conforming to a debate schedule 
favored by dukakis 
i say explain your views on defense he said the 
response ishow about debates totally irrelevant 
bushs campaign chairman james baker was meeting today with 
his counterpart in the dukakis campaign paul brountas to discuss 
the debate matter bush headed to north carolina for a oneday 
campaign trip 
campaigning at a defense plant near st louis bush belittled 
dukakis for his opposition to a number of weapons systems 
sometimes he give me the impression hes against every new 
weapons system since the slingshot he said 
bush said it didnt bother him a bit that he and running mate 
dan quayle differ on some policy issues and that the indiana 
senator didnt know bush headed a presidential panel on drug 
interdiction 
were so much in sync on broad issues you dont expect 
everybody to be in agreement on every single t being crossed or 
i being dotted he said when asked about positions he espouses 
that quayle voted against in congress

has been comprehensively answered the more important 
question can we image or could we trust a president quayle 
will not vanish so easily three of the last nine presidents were 
replaced by their deputies before the end of their term 
the furore about the indiana senators decision to join the 
national guard rather than go to vietnam in 1969 is beginning to 
subside it is not however the 22yearold but the 
41yearold quayle whom the american people are being asked to 
elect far more disturbing than his response to a messy moral 
choice two decades ago is his reaction to personal crisis and 
the pitiless logic of politics in the big league the most serious 
charges against mr quayle callowness and shallowness were 
suggested by his first armflapping fingerjabbing appearances 
alongside george bush in new orleans before the vietnam issue 
fully emerged they have been confirmed by his evasive and 
disjointed responses to the vietnam question essentially seeking 
to make the issue one which it is not the honor of the national 
guard the qualities the united states and the world has most 
reason to wish for in the american president are courage and

las ultimas noticias santiago chile conservative george 
bush has ahead of him the task of convincing voters that he is a 
capable leader its an uphill job 
bush must also fight to keep the support and the 
contributions of the republican partys most conservative groups 
which do not fully trust him because they see him as a 
representative us east coast liberal wing 
his strategy is to show dukakis as a representative of the 
democrats most liberal wing whose policies include to increase 
spending and taxes 
bush trusts that in the end voters will seek the security of 
keeping in power a party and a man promising them to maintain 
economic growth a curbed inflation and unchanged taxes that is 
why in his speech accepting the nomination he said dukakis 
represents the liberal ideology that has failed

le figaro paris conservative george bushs adversary is 
michael dukakis but his real problem is ronald reagan after eight 
years and two terms the president is still loved by the crowds 
the vice president has only the esteem of the experts reagan 
electrifies the man in the street with his patriotic speeches 
makes him laugh with gaffes which are generally forgiven right 
away draws tears from his eyes by reducing the grand events of 
history to tales full of good sentiments serious and measured 
informed and didactic bush puts his listeners to sleep 
bush therefore cannot win in november except by setting 
himself off from reagan expert in the art of nuance he must prove 
his firmness instinctive partisan of compromise he must show he

the times of london independent mr dukakis has made much 
of his managerial image this seems to appeal to the country after 
mr reagans handoff rule and its damaging outcome in the 
irancontra affair in a bush presidency policy is more likely to 
be managed by the president and not left in the hands of the foggy 
bottom foreign policy establishment mr bush has after all done 
much more managing his problem is that the appearance belies that 
fact prosperity at home ought also to be a strong card for mr 
bush the fact that after last octobers black monday the us 
economy did not plunge into a recession or soar with inflation can 
be seen as a victory for the management of the economy but 
american confidence in a prosperous fugure is not strong mr 
dukakis can claim to be able to do better and lumber the vice 
president with some of the less attractive economic leftovers of 
the reagan years bush is not built for presidential 
campaigning he has no clear saleable identity he is not quick he 
is not even consistenly clear but he does understand the 
dangers of the world in which he aspires for leadership from here 
that is no small thing in his favor

libyan leader col moammar gadhafi has 
criticized the killing of political deviates in his country 
saying the executions have given his revolution a bad name 
in a speech broadcast on state television monday night gadhafi 
also called for more political participation by libyans and 
encouraged the development of black markets 
the speech delivered three days before the 19th anniversary of 
the coup that brought him to power was addressed to a convention 
of revolutionary committee members the committees are assigned 
with safeguarding the principles of his revolution 
gadhafi said he was aware that people who had deviated from the 
course of the revolution had infiltrated some committees he 
said they were deviant in conduct and opinion 
he noted that the committees took it upon themselves to execute 
only some of these deviates this arbitrary reaction caused the 
masses to come to hate the revolutionary commitees he said 
according to the arabic version of the speech by the official 
news agency jana gadhafi said we want the people to govern 
themselves 
janas official english version of the speech which was 
delivered in arabic did not carry the criticism about the 
political executions 
gadhafi also declared that libyas growing black market economy 
was a positive development that should be encouraged calling it 
revolutionary since it is want the people want 
in the past year more consumer goods began making their way 
into libya especially after gadhafi eased restrictions with 
neighboring tunisia now many libyans drive to the border and 
purchase goods such as clothing batteries and american brand 
cigarettes and return to their cities to sell the goods on 
streetside stands or in the alleys of souks or markets 
about a year ago tripolis souk near green square was virtually 
deserted with the few goods for sale attracting few shoppers the 
souk now is elbow to elbow with libyans buying clothes tapes of 
such pop artists as madonna and sting and jewelry and watches 
speaking about government gadhafi advised the committees to 
make the people govern themselves because it is in their 
interst 
gadhafi also praised soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev saying 
he was the only man in the communistmarxist movement who has the 
courage to lead the movement in this risky turn of marxist 
history 
in the french text of his speech gadhafi conceded that 
certain negative aspects and even some mistakes had been 
connected with his revolution but he said they were part of the 
necessary process of a sad period requiring the elimination of 
all obstacles to the power of the people 
he also said libya needs to move a quarter of a million families 
from tents and slums to modern housing 
a handful of people build palaces and millions of others live 
in slums he was quoted as saying as a result the revolution 
has to remedy this situation

the united states accused the soviet union on 
tuesday of violating its afghanistan pullout agreement by using 
sovietbased airplanes in bombings against usbacked guerrillas 
the united states is also concerned about the redeployment of 
soviet units in support of afghan government forces fighting for 
control of the northern city of kanduz said state department 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
the soviets who withdrew their forces from kunduz in recent 
weeks returned with artillery and troops to bolster the government 
forces she said 
the soviet troops initially were withdrawn from kunduz about 30 
miles from the soviet border as part of a 50percent reduction of 
the soviet presence in compliance with the geneva accords 
the agreement signed last april by the united nations pakistan 
and afghanistan and coguaranteed by both superpowers calls for a 
total soviet pullout by feb 15 1989 
the soviets appear to be using airplanes based inside the soviet 
union to carry out the aerial bombardments around kunduz in support 
of the ground forces mrs oakley said 
in our view the use of the soviet aircraft coming from inside 
the soviet union are a violation of the geneva accords she said 
the redeployment of soviet troops from other parts of afghanistan 
to kunduz is not viewed as violation mrs oakley added 
the pact which brings about an end to more than eight years of 
soviet occupation is not in any danger of unraveling she said 
we fully expect the soviet union to adhere to the geneva 
accords she said 
the united states has raised the issue of soviet compliance 
with the un good offices mission which monitors the geneva 
agreement the soviets for their part have complained to the un 
body about pakistans continued arming of the usbacked 
mujahedeen guerrillas 
the united states has said it will continue supplying pakistan 
with weapons for the mujahedeen as long as the soviets continue 
arming the kabul government 
the battle for kunduz is viewed as a test of the kabul 
goverments ability to overcome the mujahedeen once the soviet 
pullout is completed some analysts believe the government will 
fall without its soviet backers and the seven major mujahedeen 
groups will vie for control of the country among themselves 
despite claims by the kabul government that it has wrested 
control of kunduz from the mujahedeen the authorities have refused 
requests by western reporters to visit the city mrs oakley said 
the government is flying five planeloads of food and ammunition 
into kunduz daily to resupply its troops in the continuous 
fighting she added 
the soviets are using artillery to back the government troops 
rather than committing any infantry to the battle mrs oakley said 
the soviet involvement in kunduz will likely be raised next week 
in moscow at a meeting between undersecretary of state michael 
armacost and deputy soviet foreign minister yuli vorontsov 
mrs oakley said the two men would meet sept 1 and 2 for their 
third discussion of regional issues in the past 18 months other 
areas on the agenda are the persian gulf the middle east cambodia 
and southern africa she said

william j bennett in his final report as 
education secretary said tuesday that american elementary school 
pupils need stronger doses of math science and literary classics 
as well as foreign languages starting in the fourth grade 
students are willing and teachers are for the most part good 
and capable bennett said but too many schools suffer from 
defective curricula 
at a news conference he released a 61page report james 
madison elementary school a curriculum for american students 
summarizing his views of what should be taught to the 32 million 
youngsters enrolled in kindergarten through the eighth grade in 
81000 elementary and junior high schools 
the report is a sequel to a model high school guide entitled 
james madison high school which bennett wrote last year he 
quipped that the latest report might be called little jimmy 
madison elementary school 
bennett said he still believes as he concluded in a 1986 
report that elementary schools are in pretty good shape and 
face fewer and less severe problems than now plague our high 
schools 
by some measures he said achievement in the elementary grades 
stands at its highest level in three decades 
but american youngsters still have an insufficient grasp of 
basic school subjects and they lag well behind their foreign 
counterparts he said 
bennett said the culprits include 
dull texts that make reading a chore instead of a joy 
dismal social studies courses that start teaching children 
about selfdevelopment when they are more interested in dinosaurs 
and space 
math courses that rely on dronelike repetitive work books 
bennett has no authority to require any school to adopt his 
ideas by law his department is barred from attempting to impose 
any curriculum on state and local school officials 
i wish i had gone to james madison elementary school said 
samuel g sava executive director of the national association of 
elementary school principals 
to meet such a rich curriculum standard sava said schools need 
better textbooks better prepared teachers and more authority to 
manage their own affairs 
bennett said his model is a statement of goals not a 
monolithic program to be uniformly imposed or slavishly followed 
he laid down a broad outline of topics to be covered in seven 
subjects english social studies mathematics science foreign 
language fine arts and physical and health education 
his reading lists range from the tales of pippi longstocking and 
mrs pigglewiggle for the early grades to the red badge of 
courage kontiki and alices adventures in wonderland 
for older pupils 
maybe a third of our schools are doing this or approaching 
this bennett said but even some of those schools dont offer an 
enriched curriculum to all their pupils 
if theres a crucial point here its the fourth grade he 
said we see a fourthgrade slump in reading math and 
science 
he said less than twothirds of each school day is spent on 
academics even accounting for lunch and recess he said 
something like 20 percent cant be accounted for at all 
bennett who is leaving his cabinet post on sept 20 said his 
suggestions include american history in each of the first five 
grades world history and geography in sixth and seventh grades 
and world geography and american government in eighth grade 
he would have all youngsters take either algebra or prealgebra 
by eighth grade biology in seventh grade and some chemistry and 
physics in eighth grade foreign language instruction should start 
no later than fourth grade he said 
the report profiles seven schools as models of strong elementary 
curricula they are meridith magnet elementary school in temple 
texas miller junior high school in west san jose calif blaine 
elementary school in blaine wash school no 59 science magnet 
in buffalo ny lasalle language academy in chicago st patrick 
school in miami beach fla and maryette elementary school in 
stilwell okla 
bennett said he will miller junior high in california on 
wednesday then he said he will speak thursday on behalf of the 
bush campaign at san francisco where democratic nominee michael 
dukakis is expected to discuss education 
i want to bring a little sunlight to that discussion 
bennett said 
copies of james madison elementary school can be purchased 
for 250 each from the us government printing office

talks between the government and 
solidarity on solving polands problems can begin as soon as lech 
walesa calls off a strike at the lenin shipyard a government 
spokesman said today 
in gdansk senior solidarity adviser adam michnik said walesa 
would hold talks wednesday with interior minister gen czeslaw 
kiszczak and a representative of the roman catholic church other 
aides said there had been no immediate agreement to end the strikes 
that have swept poland for two weeks 
the stoppage of strikes by mr lech walesa and the shipyard 
where he works would mean automatically convening a round table 
chief government spokesman jerzy urban told reporters earlier in 
the day 
urban said there were no preconditions on what subjects could be 
discussed adding the starting of talks will be a common 
victory 
kiszczak would mediate the roundtable talks urban said he 
declined to elaborate on other possible participants but hinted 
the head of the official opzz union would be included 
wednesday is the eighth anniversary of accords signed in gdansk 
guaranteeing the right to free trade unions solidarity once the 
only independent trade federation in the soviet bloc was outlawed 
following the imposition of martial law in 1981 
if the talks do take place they would be the first direct 
contact between walesa and high government officials since he was 
interned after the martial law crackdown that crushed solidarity 
roundtable talks were proposed first friday by kiszczak who 
said there would be no preconditions although he indicated the 
strikes must first end 
aides earlier quoted walesa a founder of solidarity as saying 
he would not call for an end to the strikes without pledges that 
talks involve the issue of union pluralism he also was quoted as 
saying he should take part as recognized chairman of solidarity 
ten enterprises remained idled by work stoppages in polands 
most serious wave of strikes since 1981 the work stoppages began 
aug 16 
about 5000 workers joined an occupation strike at a major 
southeastern steel mill on monday after authorities attempted to 
reopen it and talks between striking workers and management broke 
off at a coal mine and in the baltic port of szczecin 
during the peak of the unrest about 20 enterprises employing 
100000 workers were idled 
the weekold strike at the defenserelated stalowa wola mill in 
southeastern poland swelled dramatically monday when managers tried 
to reopen the 18000worker plant strikers and authorities said 
strikers control a substantial part of the complexs 
territory state radio said of the strike they control roads 
inside the plant they check ids of passing people who are not on 
strike 
piotr niemczyk a spokesman for the solidarity information 
center in warsaw said the strikers demanded walesa negotiate on 
their behalf 
talks broke down at the july manifesto coal mine where the 
series of strikes began after management refused to allow workers 
to speak to walesa by telephone according to solidarity activist 
lech bosiak 
july manifesto is in jastrzebie near the czechoslovak border 
and is the last of 12 coal mines still on strike its strike 
committee was waiting for lech walesas talks at the famous round 
table bosiak said 
jerzy majka a communist party spokesman on sunday called 
walesa a possible participant in roundtable national 
reconciliation talks 
but he said walesa could not be participate as the head of an 
illegal organization 
in a statement spirited out of the strikebound lenin shipyard in 
the baltic port of gdansk walesa said he was ready to participate 
in talks but there must be compromise on both sides 
i do not want to participate as a private individual i 
stand behind solidarity he said adding that the talks must take 
up the issue of trade union pluralism 
the mediator between walesa and the government andrzej 
stelmachowski a law professor and head of the warsaw branch of the 
catholic intellectuals club said it remained unclear whether the 
talks endorsed by polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski would 
come about 
the workers must decide if they wish to start the talks or 
not because the government insists the strikes must end before the 
talks around the round table begin stelmachowski said 
the workers are hesitant because of the risk which is 
enormous he said 
stelmachowski said that although he felt there was good will on 
both sides mistrust is so great that it is very difficult to 
put them together 
he said there was no deadline for agreeing to talks but some of 
the strikes were connected with military products and the 
government would not tolerate such stoppages indefinitely 
air force col mieczyslaw laskowski interviewed by state 
television noted that stalowa wola is a defense industry plant 
serving poland and its socialist allies and said no country in the 
world allowed strikes at such facilities 
the situation cannot tolerated ad infinitum he said

production last weekend also wound up in the cast playing 
reporters covering their last news story 
while the original thriller was done with sound effects in a 
studio the update is hitech stateoftheart 
half the production was recorded outdoors to get natural 
background sounds at the lucas ranch in the summerbrown hills of 
marin county about 40 miles north of san francisco 
and unlike most radio drama in which actors simply stand at 
microphones the actors in this new production moved around as they 
would for film the man behind this technique is sound designer 
randy thom who won an oscar for his work in the right stuff 
but even without such techniques the original broadcast was so 
realistic that some people contemplated suicide rather than die at 
the hands of the terrifying creatures others ran weeping through 
the streets and panicked callers clogged telephone lines to public 
safety offices 
in the story the martians finally succumb not to mans weapons 
of war but to germs 
later when their bodies were examined in laboratories it was 
found that they were killed by the putrefactive and disease 
bacteria against which their systems were unprepared slain 
after all mans defenses had failed by the humblest thing that god 
in his wisdom put upon this earth the original script read 
john houseman who coproduced the welles show has told of 
phones jangling off the wall in his control room and a shrill 
voice through the receiver announcing itself as the mayor of a 
unnamed big midwestern city 
houseman went on choking with fury he reported mobs in the 
streets of the city women and children huddled in church violence 
and looting 
the new production is funded by 100000 in grants from the 
national endowment for the arts and the mcgavern guild radio

a federal judge temporarily blocked the 
department of housing and urban development on tuesday from selling 
foreclosed singlehomes across the nation to the highest bidder 
us district judge harold h greene said his temporary 
restraining order would remain in effect until sept 14 while judge 
oliver gasch who has jurisdiction over the case schedules further 
deliberation 
greene said clearly hud did not comply with housing 
laws he said challengers of the sales would likely be 
successful on the merits 
he said his order would apply nationwide but would not affect 
hud sales previously entered into with buyers 
the suit was brought by a coalition of advocates for the 
homeless as part of a broader effort to force the federal 
government to make the federal governments inventory of 47000 
foreclosed houses available to the homeless 
florence wagman roisman representing the national housing law 
project said the restraining order was sought because hud planned 
to sign contracts to sell 170 homes in the washington d c 
metropolitan area on wednesday last week the project blocked hud 
from selling 200 homes in michigan 
greene accepted the projects arguments that hud had violated 
the homeless assistance act of 1987 requiring hud to survey all 
federal buildings and properties to identify which are 
suitable to assist the homeless 
the project also said the legislation stipulates that hud must 
then make properties in excess of the agencys need available to 
the homeless 
greene said hud also violated the national housing act which 
calls for the realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a 
decent home and a suitable living environment for every american 
family 
we dont want hud to sell off these units to speculators and 
investors said roisman they have 47000 units available even 
if they had 80000 it would be a drop in the bucket there are 
800000 families on a waiting list for housing around the country 
w robert irwin a justice department attorney representing hud 
said there is no need for the court to block any house auctions 
there is a continuing recycling of houses into and out of the hud 
inventory he said 
under the restraining order irwin said the houses will 
remain vacant they will be the subject of vandalism and there will 
be a loss of property values depending on the length of the suit 
roisman said the houses do not have to remain vacant because in 
just the washington area there are 700 families with 2500 
children living in hotels and motels they would be very happy to 
move into a home she said

one plunged into a forest another onto the runway the solo jet 
hurtled into a crowd of thousands of people and exploded into a 
ball of flames 
in rome the italian air force chief said the stunt team

year

parliament on tuesday enacted 
legislation that could mean prison sentences of up to five years 
for journalists who write defamatory articles 
opposition leaders said the bill was motivated by a government 
dogged by corruption scandals 
the defamation bill 1988 piloted by the federal government was 
passed by a voice vote amid strong resistance from opposition 
political parties indian news agencies said 
members from opposition parties walked out to protest the bill 
they called draconian and designed to muzzle the press 
according to the press trust of india news agency a walkout is the 
strongest form of protest available in parliamentary procedure 
the news agency said they objected to a clause that says 
where any matter which is grossly indecent or scurrilous or is 
intended for blackmail is published in any newspaper periodical 
or circular the author of such matter and the printer publisher 
and editor of such newspaper periodical or circular shall be 
punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 
five years 
opposition parliamentarians resisted the bill because it seeks 
to cover any imputation of criminal offence against an individual 
as aggravated defamation pti and the united news of india said 
janata party leader madhu dandavate said the government wanted 
the bill passed to protect itself from the scandals that have 
surfaced since 1987 
most allege that kickbacks from various defence purchases have 
been accepted by top government officers and officials of prime 
minister rajiv gandhis congress party 
dandavate said the bill was motivated by a government under 
the shadow of scandals 
p chidambaram the minister of state for home affairs who 
introduced the bill monday denied the charge 
he said the government did not intend to curb the press but 
intended to ensure that a persons privacy and honor were not 
destroyed 
i will defend until my death the right of newspapers to 
publish what is truth he said but the right must be to 
publish only the truth investigations by journalists must lead to 
facts and not to insinuations and innuendos

a federal judge on tuesday refused to allow the 
washington post access to search warrants and other court documents 
used in the search of three homes in the governments pentagon 
bribery investgation 
us district chief judge alexander harvey reversed a us 
magistrate who had decided in july to unseal some of the documents 
but not others 
it is apparent to this court that unsealing the search 
warrants and inventories would reveal much of the information in 
the applications and affidavits harvey said 
the judge also said the three maryland men whose homes were 
searched were merely under investigation not criminally charged 
and thus had a right to privacy 
assistant us attorney joseph aronica had argued that 
information in the documents if made public could interfere with 
the continuing inquiry by government investigators and a grand jury 
in virginia 
but barbara percival attorney for the post said information in 
the warrants could have been passed on by the people whose homes 
were searched since they had had the papers for two months 
the documents pertain to the governments investigation of a 
senior air force procurement officer and two private consultants 
the newspaper challenged the sealing of the documents by us 
magistrate james kenkel who then directed them to be made public 
july 18 but gave the government 10 days to appeal the decision 
at the same time kenkel said the more sensitive affidavits used 
to support the request for the warrants could remain secret for 45 
more days a period that ends thursday aronica said during 
tuesdays hearing that his office would ask kenkel to extend the 
sealing of those documents 
in his ruling harvey said kenkel was wrong to decide the search 
warrants and inventories of what was seized at the three homes 
should be unsealed but that applications for the warrants and 
affidavits supporting them should not 
harvey noting that there was no disagreement that the 
information should eventually be made public said the real dispute 
was over timing he said all the documents should stay sealed the 
same amount of time

inch by inch with the help of expert riggers 
the funeral boat of one of ancient egypts most powerful pharoahs 
took another journey tuesday to a new 22 million museum exhibit 
hydraulic jacks dollies and a forklift were used to move the 
fragile 3847yearold wooden boat about 50 yards from a display 
section of the field museum of natural history to an exhibit 
designed to recreate a pharoahs tomb 
it went very well said suzanne santos a museum spokeswoman 
before the move the 32foot boat a graceful craft resembling 
a canoe was gently lifted off the floor and rotated so it was 
pointing south to its new destination mrs santos said 
riggers who performed the tricky maneuver had to keep their 
hands off so no sweat or body oils would harm the ancient wood 
the boat used in the funeral of king senwosret iii in about 
1850 bc now becomes part of a new permanent exhibit called 
inside ancient egypt which opens in november 
the actual moving of the boat took about an hour mrs santos 
said 
the ancient craft has been at the museum since 1900 and for at 
least a dozen years has been encased in glass in a room with other 
egyptian artifacts 
it was your typical museum collection mrs santos said 
the new exhibit will give visitors a feel for ancient egypt 
though glass will still prevent any direct contact with the boat 
she said 
the exhibit will give visitors their only opportunity outside 
egypt to enter and explore a lifesize tomb complex with two 
burial chambers mummies and a shrine to the cat goddess bastet 
the museum said 
king senwosrets boat is among more than 1000 artifacts to be 
displayed 
visitors will enter the tomb chambers of unisankh son of the 
5th dynasty pharaoh unis the chambers date to 2400 bc and were 
excavated at saqqara egypt in 1908 
beneath a false door a 35foot burial shaft will take visitors 
into the dark burial chamber itself the sarcophagus is empty when 
the tomb was excavated the mummy was gone probably stolen by tomb 
robbers 
leaving the burial chamber visitors will pass through a roughly 
hewn tomb robbers tunnel and into a series of egyptian burial 
scenes featuring dioramas 23 mummies and other artifacts 
it gives visitors a chance to explore the ageold mysteries 
of mummies and life after death said the exhibits developer 
janet kamien 
senwosrets boat was one of four excavated in 1894 from his 
tomb at dashur by jacques demorgan a welsh egyptologist the 
museum said two are at the egyptian museum in cairo and the other 
is at the carnegie museum of natural history in pittsburgh 
no one knows if senwosrets boats were used to transport his 
body across the nile to the burial site or if they was buried near 
the tomb for use in the afterlife by the kings soul said frank 
yurco a scholar on ancient egypt at the oriental institute and a 
consultant on the museum project 
senwosret conducted military campaigns that extended egypts 
boundary into the nubian region of ethiopia and the sudan as well 
as securing control of the nile river to the south he said he 
also centralized the government setting the pattern for several 
hundred years 
senwosret is believed to have died when he was about 50 yurco 
said

in the neighborhood where 82 people died 
two years ago after the collision of a jetliner and a small plane 
few signs of the disaster remain 
im surprised what another year has done i think the 
neighborhood is fine now said sue nelson who once wanted to 
erect a plaque inmemory of those who died in the collision between 
an aeromexico dc9 and a light plane 
at dawn tuesday homeowners watered carefully cut and edged 
lawns cats scrapped in the street a deliveryman plopped 
newspapers onto driveways and an occasional runner passed 
its been two years if you didnt tell me i wouldnt have 
remembered i never think about i dont even remember that day 
said gladys rubio 47 as she completed her morning jog where 
wreckage once burned 
on aug 31 1986 a piper archer with three people aboard 
collided in flight with the aeromexico dc9 carrying 64 people the 
jetliner plunged into the neighborhood exploded and killed another 
15 people on the ground 
sixteen houses burned 10 of them destroyed by flames or falling 
wreckage there was nearly 3 million in damage 
the piper fell in front of a church the jet fell and exploded 
sending bodies and flaming debris raining to the ground as it cut a 
swath through the tidy suburb 30 miles southeast of los angeles 
now there are only hints that tragedy once visited a 
weedinfested lot on holmes avenue where a house once stood three 
80foot pines with firescorched trunks several new oversized 
homes 
where the smoldering airliner finally stopped incinerating a 
modest 150000 home a fivebedroom threebathroom spanishstyle 
house is being sold for 485000 average home prices have nearly 
doubled since the crash 
a new house alongside the nelsons whose home was clipped by the 
jetliner and set ablaze was rented to a couple for 1400 a month 
on the eve of the crash 
we told people who looked at it that three people died here 
when the plane crashed said tom samuelson who manages the 
property we feel that if someone has any apprehension we didnt 
want a tenant for a few weeks and have them vacate 
another year is all it took to get back with our lives and 
forget all about it said mrs nelson adding she has given up 
the idea of a neighborhood memorial plaque to honor the dead we 
are forgetting 
the memories were rekindled this week however by televised 
coverage of sundays air show crash at a us air base in west 
germany 
the air show in west germany had a big impact on us it 
brought memories back as a matter of fact i dreamed a plane 
crashed last night she said the wounds have healed for the 
most part im surprised about that 
but her son robbie 9 still wont get in an airplane 
we went on another driving trip this year mrs nelson said 
i just have to get him on a plane so we can really get away 
the sound of jetliners flying overhead doesnt seem to bother 
anyone anymore i dont even think about it said mrs rubio 
gone are the sightseers who cruised the neighborhood for a year 
afterward averaging six carloads an hour on some weekends 
for about the first year people came by a lot and it was 
annoying but the sightseers dont show up anymore said pete 
armenta owner of a local barber shop the customers bring it up 
once in a while but everybodys pretty much gotten over it 
a year ago too local ministers arranged a memorial service to 
remember the dead there will be no service this year 
the local clergy didnt plan anything this year they are 
trying to put it behind them said michelle ogle spokeswoman for 
the city of cerritos i would say it is typical of the majority 
of the community to forget but im sure those people in the 
neighborhood will never forget

an 18yearold mother of three ordered to 
practice birth control throughout her childbearing years is 
pregnant again but the judge who sentenced her for child abuse 
says she wont revoke the probation 
i have not been presented evidence that she is not in 
compliance with the court order maricopa county superior court 
judge lindsay budzyn said during a hearing monday she noted that 
no method of birth control was foolproof 
pregnancy doesnt necessarily constitute a violation ms 
budzyn said 
the judge sentenced debra ann forster to lifetime probation last 
may 24 with the birthcontrol stipulation the judge who could 
have imposed a 30year jail term said it was the only way to make 
sure mrs forster did not have other children to abuse 
mrs forster who has appealed the sentence pleaded guilty in 
april to two counts of attempted child abuse stemming from a may 
1987 incident in which she left her sons william 1 and scott 6 
months alone in a mesa apartment for three days authorities said 
the apartment had no air conditioning and both babies were 
dehydrated and near death when found 
the birthcontrol order attracted protests from such disparate 
groups as the roman catholic church which proscribes birth 
control and the american civil liberties union 
ms budzyn said monday she would not order mrs forster to have 
an abortion nor issue any abortion ruling 
she also said she would rule by friday on motions from garrett 
simpson mrs forsters public defender and the aclu to modify the 
terms of probation and delete the birthcontrol requirement 
the aclu attorney colin campbell argued that the order was 
invasive amounted to cruel and unusual punishment and violated 
freedom of religion for mrs forster a catholic 
jeff sandler a deputy county attorney countered that the 
sentence served useful purposes in rehabilitating the defendant and 
protecting others 
the judge learned in court of the new pregnancy mrs forsters 
fourth from simpson who said it was confirmed last week the 
baby is due april 23 he said 
he refused to say whether mrs forster was practicing birth 
control when she became pregnant 
while awaiting trial this year mrs forster gave up the rights 
to her sons and a daughter who was born in jail according to 
court records all three have been adopted

patients from a military ambulance onto a c141 us air force 
transport plane 
as the four were being loaded onto the transport a fighter jet 
screamed overhead 
the decision to move them from the landstuhl hospital was made 
after the san antonio team headed by two surgeons examined them 
monday and tuesday 
the west german bild and abendpost newspapers said at least 
three children had been hospitalized with serious burns but no one 
had inquired about them leading to speculation their parents had 
been killed in the accident 
in udine italy the commander of the italian stuntflying team 
said that the teams soloist lt col ivo nutarelli had caused 
the crash when he reached the point were the jets intersected too 
soon and too low

to reporters shortly before the remains of the three pilots killed 
in the crash arrived home about 2000 people were at the airport

and we havent heard a word is it possible they were at 
ramstein said dietzen 
west germanys ard television showed pictures of a special 
missing persons bureau set up after the disaster in the town of 
kaiserslautern near ramstein 
im looking for my sister said a german man whose name was 
not given the whole family didnt come home 
officials said that of the 282 people still hospitalized about

danger of dying

the parents of two badly burned girls 6yearold nadine and 
10yearold melanie who are being treated at a hospital in 
oggersheim 
their faces and their bodies are burned 70 percent and 
their hair is singed the newspaper reported 
bild quoted head surgeon dr rudolf zellner as saying it was 
possible the parents of both girls were dead since no one inquired 
about them 
one young boy thought to be about 13 with burns on 95 percent of 
his body has still not been identified because he is in deep shock

vietnam has agreed to resume cooperating with 
the united states on accounting for the more than 1700 american 
military personnel still missing in the vietnam war ending a 
boycott that lasted less than a month the state department said 
tuesday 
a us technical team will meet with vietnamese authorities in 
hanoi to work out details for a joint field survey and excavation 
activities in vietnam department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
the meeting is tentatively set for sept 912 
we welcome this resumption of cooperation and anticipate that 
the joint field activities will make a major contribution in 
achieving the fullest possible accounting for americans still 
missing in vietnam she said 
she said a us team also will visit hanoi on sept 58 to 
discuss a plan to allow private american organizations to treat 
vietnamese with warrelated disabilities 
on aug 3 vietnam suspended cooperation with the united states 
on the accounting effort foreign minister nguyen co thach said his 
government was retaliating against a hostile policy the united 
states was pursuing against vietnam 
his statement was prompted by testimony in late july in which 
assistant secretary of state gaston sigur reaffirmed the 
longstanding us policy of maintaining diplomatic distance from 
hanoi until its troops are withdrawn from cambodia 
the united states has agreed to discuss humanitarian issues with 
vietnam but says there can be no trade or diplomatic relations 
between the two countries until the cambodian issue is resolved 
sigur said the reagan administration was opposed to a proposal 
by several members of congress to establish a small us diplomatic 
mission in hanoi 
mrs oakley said vietnam has not agreeed to resume discussions 
on resettlement in the united states of former political detainees 
who were associated with the former usbacked government in 
saigon 
she expressed disappointment there will be no discussions on 
that issue but said the administration hopes the two september 
meetings will initiate a period of increased cooperation on all 
humanitarian issues of mutual interest

united states and the soviet union of plotting against his country 
official tehran radio reported 
the radio monitored in nicosia said khomeini urged iranians to 
man the front lines but also called for a national effort in irans 
postwar reconstruction 
the 88yearold religious patriarch who said last month that 
irans acceptance of a un ceasefire resolution was more deadly 
to me than poison declared we must not take it that the war 
has ended 
our enemy be it big enemies such as america and the soviet 
union or their surrogates such as iraqi president saddam 
hussein and others are constantly plotting because they have 
seen how islam has become a major force in the world khomeini 
was quoted as saying 
velayati blamed iraq for blocking the peace talks the main 
problem is the raising of new preconditions by iraq he said 
he said the preconditions included a demand for the immediate 
clearing of the disputed shattalarab waterway iraqs only outlet 
to the sea and baghdads unilateral abrogation of the 1975 algiers 
treaty 
the treaty places the border between the two countries down the 
middle of the waterway iraq demands full sovereignty over the 
waterway 
velayati said iraq was facing a lot of internal difficulties 
because people ask them why did you start this 8yearold war for 
what reason 
we think this is the main reason they are looking for some 
advantage some concessions he said 
the shattalarab has been blocked by sunken ships since the 
outbreak of the war 
aziz said monday the waterway should be cleared as soon as 
possible to balance the advantage gained by iran when iraq stopped 
attacks on iranian shipping under the terms of an aug 20 
ceasefire 
aziz also complained of irans continued searches of iraqibound 
vessels in the persian gulf 
velayati said the clearing of the shattalarab should come at 
an appropriate time after all the provisions of the ceasefire 
have bneen implemented 
we do not think that a deadlock has been reached the 
iranian minister said we do hope that the secretarygeneral can 
find a solution for such difficulties 
he said he would remain in geneva as long as the 
secretarygeneral will be here and asks us to remain here aziz 
made a similar declaration the previous day

former presidential hopeful jesse jackson has 
reached an outofcourt settlement with a company that sold 
thousands of videotapes of his address to the democratic national 
convention attorneys said tuesday 
yes there has been a settlement said eric cohen an 
attorney for mpi home video but i believe the terms are 
confidential 
jacksons attorney henry mason also refused to discuss the 
agreement and both sides refused to say whether it would allow the 
sale or distribution of more mpi tapes of jacksons speech 
the parties have reached an agreement in principle mason 
said we hope to wrap it up in the next 10 days or so 
the settlement avoided a trial which had been scheduled to 
begin tuesday over whether mpi had the right to profit from tapes 
of jacksons july 19 speech in atlanta 
mpi sold about 7500 of the videotapes at 1495 each before 
us district judge james b zagels temporary order july 29 
brought a halt to the sales said robert breisblatt another 
attorney for oak forestbased mpi breisblatt said he did not know 
exactly how long the videotapes had been on sale before then but 
he estimated it was less than week 
mason said jacksons camp which had gone to court to block the 
sales was pleased with the settlement 
mpi had contended that the black leaders speech was news and 
unprotected by copyright law but jackson argued that the 
videotapes exploited his name as well as his literary and 
oratorical skills 
he testified at an earlier hearing that mpis tape which he did 
not authorize hurt his livelihood by limiting the marketability of 
a videotape of the speech that he planned to sell 
zagel in his order halting the sales agreed 
there is more than negligible probability that jackson 
earns part of his living on his oratory the judge said

the soloist for the italian air force stunt 
team caused the fatal crash at the west german air show when he 
arrived too low and too soon at the point where the jets 
intersected his commander said tuesday 
lt col diego raineri spoke to reporters shortly before the 
remains of the three pilots killed in the crash sunday at ramstein 
west germany arrived at the airport about 2000 people were at 
the airport when the bodies arrived 
defense minister valerio zanone will attend the funeral 
wednesday for the pilots identified as lt col mario naldini 38 
the soloist lt col ivo nutarelli 41 and capt giorgio alessio 
31 who was the youngest member of the team 
it is easy enough to tell what happened said ranieri who 
as commader was coordinating the teams manuevers by radio from the 
ground at the time of the collision that sent one plane hurtling 
into the crowd 
the first section of the formation flew in one direction and 
the soloist came in from 90 degrees colliding with two planes 
he said two of the three other planes in that group were damaged 
he said 
i was the only one team member to see the tragedy but i 
dont understand what happened the soloist came in early on the 
rest of the formation and at the same altitude ranieri said 
the other section composed of four planes did not know what 
happened until the end of the manuever when the pilots saw the 
wreckage and the smoke on the runway he said 
some italian politicans called for a parliamentary investigation 
of the crash called for the resignation of the defense minister 
and the air force commander and criticized the defense ministrys 
decision to allow the team to continue its performances this year 
the decision of the defense ministry to continue the next 
exhibitions of the national aerobatic team seems like an offense in 
front of the victims the hundreds of injured at ramstein and the 
pilots that died in the accident said greens party deputies rosa 
filippini and giancarlo salvoldi 
the two said they would demand an urgent meeting of the chamber 
of deputies to debate the tragedy 
deputy flaminio piccoli a member of the dominant christian 
democrats and the president of the chambers foreign committee 
criticized the risks to the lives of the exceptional pilots and 
to the lives of the citizens and spectators and said it was 
necessary for the government and parliament to investigate the 
tragedy 
the organizers of an air show satuday in fribourg switzerland 
announced they have asked the italian team to withdraw because of 
the accident at ramstein they said the request was to show respect 
for the dead pilots and because the crash investigation is still 
underway 
also on tuesday organizers canceled a sept 11 air show in 
venice 
ranieri during his impromptu news conference defended the 
decision to continue performances by the team this year 
an experience like ramstein cannot be erased from the memory 
but the motivation to do our work has not changed very much he 
said the time to reconstruct the unit decimated by the accident 
will be months probably years we were the best in the world

the united states and the soviet union have 
completed initial 60day inspections under the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty detecting any apparent discrepancies in their 
claimed arsenals defense sources said tuesday 
the numbers matched said one pentagon official referring 
to the number of nuclear missiles stored at various military 
installations inside the soviet union and warsaw pact countries 
and they verified our numbers too 
the first 60 days of compliance with the treaty signed by 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev last 
december ended monday when the superpowers completed all authorized 
inspections 
the socalled baseline inspections were intended to allow each 
country to verify the number and location of mediumrange and 
shorter range nuclear weapons in each arsenal before their 
destruction begins under the inf treaty 
american inspectors had to visit 133 soviet weapons facilities 
at 115 locations during the twomonth period the soviets had to 
inspect 31 facilities at 26 sites in the united states and western 
europe 
the treaty which the senate ratified earlier this summer calls 
for the elimination within three years of all american and soviet 
landbased missiles with ranges of 300 to 3400 miles 
the treaty covers 859 nucleararmed missiles on the us side 
compared with 1831 on the soviet side 
defense department spokesman dan howard refused to discuss 
details of the inspections tuesday but told reporters i have not 
seen any reports of problems with regard to the baseline 
inspections 
we completed our baseline inspections and they completed 
theirs said cmdr ken pease a spokesman for the pentagons 
onsite inspection agency 
the soviets were very flexible very professional and very 
knowledgeable about the treaty which facilitated our 
inspections pease said both sides knew the terms of the 
treaty and worked in a professional manner together 
under the treaty both sides next will be entitled to conduct 20 
shortnotice inspections over the next year at selected military 
facilities 
in addition permanent inspection teams are on duty at soviet 
and american missile plants to guard against cheating and 
inspectors from both countries will be able to observe the actual 
destruction of missiles 
the soviets are now operating elimination or destruction 
programs for missiles and launchers at five different sites pease 
said in addition the russians plan within the next week or two to 
begin destroying up to 100 ss20 missiles by launching them without 
their warheads 
the united states will begin destroying the mediumrange 
missiles in its arsenal on sept 8 by firing some solidfuel 
rockets used in pershing ii missiles at the longhorn army 
ammunition plant near marshall texas

conservationist richard leakey accused a 
government ministry of providing little more than lip service 
to stop widespread poaching that has claimed 93 elephants since 
april it was reported tuesday 
it is a national crisis the standard quoted leakey 
chairman of the east african wildlife society as saying monday 
he said highranking people whom he did not identify were 
involved in the poaching he described it as economic sabotage 
with farreaching and lasting effects on the posterity stability 
and success of our country 
leakey also challenged george muhoho minister of tourism and 
wildlife to prove his claim that 22000 elephants remain in kenya 
we may have less than half that number in reality at this 
time said leakey until a proper census is carried out the 
figure of 22000 should be taken with caution 
muhoho cited the 22000 figure monday when he reported to a 
meeting of ornithologists that in the last four months poachers had 
killed 92 elephants in several game parks the standard and 
nairobis other two englishlanguage papers kenya times and daily 
nation reported tuesday 
studies by the un environmental program show that in the last 
15 years elephant populations have dropped 85 percent in kenya and 
that herds in tanzania and uganda have been similarly depleted 
an aerial survey in february of the vast tsavo national park in 
southeastern kenya found 5363 elephants down from an estimated 
35000 in that park alone in 1974 
an alltime high ivory price is fueling the slaughter according 
to experts who say poaching will not abate until the illegal trade 
is halted 
muhoho said the government was trying to combat the animal 
slaughter by increasing manpower training and equipment 
available to rangers 
but leakey said rangers were equipped with inadequate weapons 
against wellarmed poachers and were seriously hindered by 
impassable roads brokendown vehicles and inadequate fuel supplies 
the minister and his officers are urged to do more than give 
lip service to the growing crisis said leakey brother of 
kenyas only white parliamentarian philip leakey and son of noted 
paleontologists louis and mary leakey

a man suspected in 60 rapes pleaded 
innocent tuesday to a 21count indictment charging him with raping 
and kidnapping five women and assaulting a sixth 
robert biddings 34 of columbus appeared handcuffed before 
franklin county common pleas judge frank reda no trial date was 
set 
biddings a former restaurant dishwasher was indicted friday 
for allegedly abducting his victims who included a 12yearold 
girl handcuffing and raping them from 1986 to march 1988 
he was arrested after the parents of a 24yearold rape victim 
spent more than a year pursuring her attacker the victims mother 
stood at the same eastside bus stop where her daughter was 
attacked in june 1987 and acted as a decoy while her armed husband 
waited nearby 
the woman was attacked on aug 5 but her husband scared off the 
assailant and gave police the license number of the attackers 
vehicle biddings was arrested three days later 
biddings is suspected of being the handcuff rapist a term 
that refers to the use of handcuffs in early attacks and later was 
attributed to the same man over four years 
the indictment said biddings had been convicted of rape in 
summit county in 1973 and served a jail term on the charge 
in all he was indicted on 12 counts of rape six counts of 
kidnapping two counts of aggravated robbery and one count of 
felonious assault 
two of biddings sisters were in the courtroom tuesday but 
refused to talk to reporters after the hearing 
theyre upset said thomas erlenbach biddings attorney 
but theyre sticking by him 
biddings himself is upset by the charges because he does not 
understand the terminology in the indictments said erlenbach who 
was hired by the defendants family 
he does not understand a lot about it he said but he has 
maintained his innocence to me all along 
county prosecutor michael miller said last week he expects more 
indictments against biddings and that he would present further 
evidence to the grand jury this week 
biddings is being held in lieu of 750000 bond 
meanwhile the 24yearold victim urged other rape victims to 
report their complaints 
i want victims to know that they have to come forward thats 
the only reason im talking about this right now they have to come 
forward the woman said in a copyright story in tuesdays 
columbus dispatch 
she told the newspaper she has agreed with police not to discuss 
specifics of the attack until after biddings is tried

a 65foot tall latin cross erected 22 years 
ago at a marine base in hawaii must be removed or replaced by a 
nonreligious symbol a federal judge ruled tuesday 
us district judge thomas f hogan said the cross which was 
lit nightly at camp h m smith in the suburbs of honolulu appears 
to be an unconstitutional endorsement of religion by government 
the principal symbol of christianity this nations dominant 
religion is too laden with religious meaning to be appropriate for 
a government memorial assertedly free of any religious message 
wrote hogan while the court is unwilling to say that a latin 
cross is ipso facto by the fact or act itself unconstitutional 
it is constrained to find its use inappropriate in this case 
however hogan said his order would not go into force for 60 
days to give the government an opportunity to seek a further stay 
from an appellate court while it appeals his decision 
the jewish war veterans of the usa contended in its suit that 
the wooden cross on a prominent point at the marine base violated 
the constitutions ban on governmental endorsement of a particular 
religion 
origin of the cross was disputed during the trial according to 
one account the cross was built in april 1966 for eastern 
sunrise services to which the public was invited a former 
commanding general of the fleet marine force pacific lt gen 
victor h krulak said it was built to serve the purely secular 
purpose of honoring marines killed or missing in action in the 
vietnam war 
hogan noted the constitution prohibits congress from making any 
laws respecting an establishment of religion but the establishment 
clause is not an easy area of the law he said 
hogan said a single thread runs through decisions by federal 
courts that the latin cross one whose base stem is longer than 
the other three arms is a readily indentifiable symbol of 
christianity 
the 65foot lighted cross on bordelon field at camp smith may 
fairly be considered to convey a message of governmental 
endorsement of christianity the judge wrote 
the use of a cross as a memorial to fallen or missing 
servicemen is a use of what to some is a religious symbol where a 
nonreligious one likely would have done as well said hogan

prices farmers got for raw products in august 
rose 21 percent from july boosted in part by the momentum of this 
years drought the agriculture department said tuesday 
compared with a year earlier august prices averaged 13 percent 
higher the report also included revised figures showing that the 
index roseonly 29 percent in july compared with the preliminary 
reading of 36 percent announced a month ago 
since april as drought cut into this years harvest prospects 
farm commodity prices overall have climbed 108 percent according 
to the latest figures 
but there were signs that the upward spiral of some commodity 
prices were beginning to level off in august 
the departments agricultural statistics board said in its 
preliminary report that higher prices for cattle apples tomatoes 
and lettuce contributed most to the august increase while prices 
declined for cotton corn onions and soybeans 
in the earlier months corn and soybeans helped lead the way for 
rising prices however by late july widespread rains began to 
dampen further increases although the drought of 1988 has not been 
broken by any means 
at the chicago board of trade on tuesday grain and soybean 
futures closed sharply higher but it was on the strength of new 
export business not further crop losses due to drought analysts 
said moreover they said the corn and soybean crops have passed 
their most critical stages of development 
based on aug 1 estimates this years corn harvest may drop 37 
percent from 1987 wheat 13 percent and soybeans 23 percent 
all feed grain and soybean prices declined from july but 
rough unmilled rice and all wheat prices increased slightly 
the report said average prices of beef cattle and calves 
increased sharply from july but were below the high levels recorded 
during february through may of this year 
prices of some major commodities are based on midmonth averages 
and then are revised the following month when additional 
information is available 
as a commodity group prices of feed grains and hay dropped 28 
percent from july to august averaging 68 percent above a year ago 
the report said 
prices of meat animals rose 43 percent as a group but averaged 
06 percent below the yearearlier mark beef cattle prices 
averaged 6640 per 100 pounds of liveweight up 320 from july 
hog prices increased 1 from july to 4680 in august 
apple prices at the farm level rose to 261 cents per pound in 
august from 197 cents in july and 16 cents a year ago lettuce was 
reported at 1220 per 100 pounds up from 762 in july but far 
below the 18 of last year tomatoes at 4170 per 100 pounds 
were up from 31 in july and 1730 in august 1987 
overall the august allcrops price index was up 23 percent 
from july averaging 33 percent above the yearago level 
the august price index for all livestock and livestock products 
was up 34 percent from july and averaged 13 percent more than a 
year earlier higher prices for cattle hogs milk turkeys and 
eggs accounted for the increase from july 
although the projections are subject to change usda economists 
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 55 
billion to 60 billion this year compared with the record level of 
571 billion in 1987 that is the difference between cash receipts 
and cash expenses during the calendar year 
consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent 
this year compared with a 42 percent average increase in 1987 
before the drought took hold usda was predicting a 1988 food price 
hike of 2 percent to 4 percent 
department officials have predicted that the drought may add 2 
percentage points to food prices in 1989 above the expected 
increase in inflation currently forecast at around 4 percent that 
could mean a 1989 food prices increase in the range of 6 percent to 
7 percent 
the report did not include new figures showing what farmers pay 
to meet expenses those are reported quarterly and the most recent 
figures released in july showed farm production costs were up 24 
percent from april averaging 49 percent more than in july 1987 
the report said 
cattle averaged 6640 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally up from 6320 in july and 6190 reported for august 
1987 those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 4540 per 100 pounds compared with 4410 in 
july and 5860 a year earlier 
corn at 266 a bushel was down from 272 in july and the 
average of 147 per bushel a year earlier 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 356 per bushel compared with 350 in july and 236 a 
year earlier 
rice averaged 761 per 100 pounds compared with 751 in july 
and 374 a year earlier 
soybeans were 840 per bushel compared with 850 in july and 
502 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 552 cents per pound compared 
with 586 in july and 637 cents in august 1987 
eggs were 599 cents per dozen compared with 622 cents in 
july and 519 cents a year earlier 
milk was 1160 per 100 pounds compared with 1140 in july 
and 1220 a year earlier 
broilers were 419 cents per pound live weight compared with 
421 cents in july and 317 cents a year ago

rundu southwest africa ap fifty army vehicles rumbled 
across a pontoon bridge tuesday carrying the last south african 
troops out of angola where they spent more than a year fighting in 
support of antimarxist guerrillas 
south africas army chief of staff lt gen ian gleeson said 
at a ceremony that nearly 1000 soldiers crossed into southwest 
africa during the day to complete the first phase of a 
usmediated regional peace initiative 
as of this moment we are out of angola gleeson said 
the peace effort is aimed at ending a 13yearold war in angola 
whose marxist government is backed by thousands of cuban troops 
after a cuban withdrawal from angola south africa says it will 
grant independence to southwest africa also known as namibia 
an estimated 2500 south african troops some of them 180 miles 
inside in angola have been leaving in stages since a ceasefire 
was declared aug 8 they supported the national union for the 
total independence of angola or unita 
unita also backed by the united states is not party to the 
ceasefire and was exclued from recent peace talks between angola 
cuba south africa under us mediation 
the four countries involved in the negotiations met last week in 
brazzaville congo but failed to agree on timetables for 
withdrawal of the estimated 50000 troops in angola and namibian 
independence more talks are planned for brazzaville next week 
gleeson said there were no truce violations but later a senior 
official of south africas foreign affairs department complained 
cuban forces were put on red alert during the withdrawal 
this is hardly the action of an army sure of itself or one 
aiming at peace but rather one aiming for a return to 
hostilities said the diplomat glenn babb 
south african and foreign journalists were flown to rundu on 
the angolan border to witness the completion of the withdrawal by 
south african forces which have been inside angola since early 
1987 
cuban and angolan officers serving on a ceasefire monitoring 
committee also attended the ceremony while soldiers dismantled the 
bridge across the okavango river 
our governments have shown the world that we will pursue 
peace said angolan maj osvaldo van dunem we hope to continue 
in the spirit of mutual understanding and sincerity 
the south african trucks crossing into rundu carried troops and 
supplies and some towed giant g5 longrange cannon across the 
shallow river while villagers washed their clothes nearby 
many of the vehicles had graffiti on them such as no retreat 
no surrender and hello mom they drove into a compound that 
had a banner that said welcome winners 
angola is to try to keep guerrillas of the southwest african 
peoples organization at least 150 miles north of the namibian 
border gleeson said he said swapo has said it will observe a 
ceasefire starting sept 1 but hasnt commented on whether its 
guerrillas will move away from the border area 
gleeson said south africa will not conduct any more hot 
pursuit raids into angola after swapo units

a nuclear weapon was detonated tuesday 
at the nevada test site 13 days after soviet scientists monitored 
another us test at the same site in a historic breakthrough in 
international relations 
two soviet scientists were still on site at the time of 
tuesdays blast but were not involved in monitoring the test us 
scientists are in the soviet union and will monitor a test there 
sept 14 
tuesdays test measured 49 on the richter scale of ground 
motion at the national earthquake information center in golden 
colo 
the test codenamed bullfrog was conducted at 11 am pdt and 
produced a very distinct rocking motion in a control center 10 
miles from ground zero according to energy department spokeswoman 
barbara yoerg 
the test was not preannounced as are larger tests at the 
desert site 
the energy department said the shot had an explosive force of 
less than 150 kilotons the limit under treaties signed in 1974 and 
1976 
the device was buried in a 1600foot shaft at yucca flat 85 
miles northwest of las vegas 
it was the 10th announced shot this year and the 685th announced 
since testing began in nevada in january 1951 
the most recent previous test was kearsarge which was monitored 
by soviet scientists as part of tests aimed at developing a method 
of confirming treaty compliance 
tuesdays test was conducted by lawrence livermore laboratory 
and was weapons related ms yoerg said 
she said three protesters were at the gates of the sprawling 
desert site when the test was conducted but they were more than 40 
miles from ground zero 
ms yoerg said no radioactive material escaped from tuesdays 
test the ground above the device subsided an hour after the blast 
she said that is considered a good sign by doe officials because 
it indicates the radioactive materials have been permanently sealed 
underground

more than 2200 cuban detainees have been 
released since last falls riots at federal prisons in atlanta and 
oakdale la and one advocate for the cubans credits the uprisings 
for their freedom 
a former federal official however denies that the riots 
speeded up the releases 
its unfortunate that it came to a riot but 2200 of the 
3800 in custody before the riots last november have been 
released because of the public attention the riot attracted said 
gary leshaw an atlanta attorney who advised the cubans the 
lesson is that the government should have instituted a legitimate 
review plan years before it did 
but randy levine a former associate us attorney general who 
helped set up the review process that decides the detainees fates 
said that a repatriation agreement reached last fall by the united 
states and and cuba would have had a similar effect without the 
riots 
it would have been set up anyway and i think the speed of 
the releases would have been maintained he said 
to say that the riot had no impact in bringing this to the 
publics attention would be wrong but to say that the riot set the 
review process in place is not fair levine said 
final appeals are scheduled to begin this week in washington for 
the first of 73 cuban detainees who were found to be deportable 
through the review process 
george w calhoun director of the justice departments mariel 
cuban review program said he expects some cases to be decided by 
late september that could mean the deportation of some cubans 
within six weeks 
the detainees were among more than 125000 cubans who came to 
the united states in the 1980 mariel boatlift they were jailed 
after their arrival because they committed crimes or were 
considered risks for other reasons 
although more than 2200 cuban detainees have been released 
since the riots an additional 1000 have been taken into federal 
custody most of them after serving time in state prisons 
more than 2500 cubans are in federal custody and the 
immigration and naturalization service has decided that more than 
1500 of them are too dangerous to return to society 
even among those inmates few are in imminent danger of being 
deported however cuba has agreed to take back only people named 
on a list which was compiled in 1984 and is considered outdated now 
calhoun said only about 500 of 2746 people on the list are 
still being held by federal authorities duke austin an ins 
spokesman said cubans who are not on the list can be deported only 
after further negotiations with the cuban government 
austin said the detainees being released are not being given an 
immigration status but are being reparoled as long as they 
dont commit a crime they could conceivably remain here in the 
united states for the rest of their days he said

lebanese villagers helped israeli troops and 
local militia drive back a palestinian guerrilla squad trying to 
infiltrate israel tuesday the army and israel radio said two 
guerrillas were captured and two escaped 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip palestinians began a 
twoday strike to protest deportations arab hospital officials 
said troops wounded 12 palestinians in west bank clashes 10 of 
them in nablus 
the infiltration attempt was the 17th reported since 
palestinians began rebelling against israeli rule nearly nine 
months ago 
the uprising has killed 255 palestinians and four israelis since 
dec 8 
israel radio identified the guerrillas as members of a small 
prosyrian palestinian faction the popular struggle front 
a firefight broke out after lebanese villagers from khalata 2 
miles north of the israeli border spotted the squad walking out of 
a ravine and moving across a field israel radio and military 
sources said 
ten lebanese men in the village armed themselves and villagers 
summoned lebanese militiamen from the mostly christian south 
lebanon army who were backed by israeli troops from border zone 
patrols the reports said 
the army said two guerrillas were captured and two escaped one 
after being wounded 
two lebanese militiamen were slightly wounded the radio said 
it was the first time israel has reported that lebanese 
villagers helped thwart a border crossing 
an army statement said an investigation showed the terrorists 
planned to take hostages in one of the settlements in the northern 
galilee 
the intruders carried barbed wire cutters three sovietmade 
rifles a pistol with a silencer four hand grenades three 
rocketpropelled grenade lauchers and food and medical supplies 
israel ended a threeyear occupation of lebanon in 1985 but 
maintains about 1000 soldiers in its selfdeclared security zone 
to lend support to the south lebanon army 
the army said youths stoned an israeli car in the west bank 
village of anabta slightly wounding one passenger in the head in 
husan near bethlehem troops rounded up residents and searched 
homes after villagers stoned an israeli bus arab reports said the 
army said it was checking the report 
prime minister yitzhak shamir personally intervened to have a 
submachine gun returned to a jewish settler in the west bank 
police confiscated the weapon last week after the man fired in the 
air to disperse palestinians stoning his car near a west bank 
refugee camp 
shamir believes that people who live in judea and samaria 
biblical names for the west bank should be allowed to carry 
weapons for selfdefense said shamir aide avi pazner 
israel radio on tuesday quoted defense minister yitzhak rabin as 
saying that recently introduced plastic bullets would ease the 
frustration of soldiers trying to quell violent protests rabin 
addressed a closeddoor session of parliaments defense and foreign 
affairs committee 
a defense official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
live ammunition can be used only in selfdefense but officers may 
fire plastic bullets in hot pursuit of palestinian 
demonstrators or to incapacitate ringleaders plastic bullets 
penetrate the body but generally cause less serious injuries 
tuesdays strike in the occupied territories and east jerusalem 
seized by israel in the 1967 middle east war was the fifth such 
protest in 10 days 
nablus was the scene of the most violent protests after a 
fiveday curfew was lifted at dawn 
troops trying to disperse stonethrowers shot and wounded 10 
palestinians including two who were in serious condition hospital 
officials said the army said five arabs were hurt 
two palestinians were wounded in two other west bank clashes 
hospital officials said 
the strike was to protest deportations of 33 palestinians since 
the uprising began and israeli orders to expell 25 others 
in jerusalem about 150 israeli leftists demonstrated near the 
supreme court to protest deportations 
the army clamped curfews on three refugee camps and a village in 
the occupied lands confining more than 100000 palestinians to 
their homes 
the army said tuesday that 5116 palestinians now are being held 
in israeli jails including 2516 held for up to six months without 
trial

the army prompted by the governor of utah 
announced tuesday it was extending into october the public comment 
deadline on a draft environmental impact study covering its 
biological warfare research program 
lt col john chapla an army spokesman said utah gov norman 
bangerter had requested a public hearing be held in his state and 
we saw no reason not to accomodate him 
as a result the deadline for public comment has been extended 
to oct 4 and a public hearing has been scheduled at the tooele 
army depot in utah on sept 19 chapla said 
the biological defense research program is of interest to 
citizens of utah because it is conducted in part at dugway proving 
ground the service added in a statement 
the utah hearing will be the second held by the army since it 
released its draft impact statement a massive study designed to 
support biological warfare research work at facilities around the 
country the army has portrayed the research work in that study as 
safe to the environment essential to national security and a boon 
to science in general 
in recognition of the potentially hazardous nature of this 
type of research the defense department as well as the 
scientific community has developed and implemented elaborate 
controls to assure adequate protection for the workforce and 
virtually total protection for the external environment the army 
concluded in the draft assessment 
the environmental study released last may was prompted by a 
lawsuit filed by the foundation on economic trends in september 
1986 the foundation is a washingtonbased environmental activist 
group that has long focused its attention on the dangers of 
biological research and genetic engineering 
after forcing the army to conduct the study the foundation 
attacked the draft work as shoddy and incomplete vowing to 
launch a new legal assault if a more complete study was not 
performed 
in releasing the draft study last may the army said it would 
accept written comments from the public only through aug 12 that 
deadline has been put aside and the new deadline of oct 4 
established the army said tuesday 
within the biological field the united states has committed 
itself by international treaty not to develop offensive biological 
weapons however the pentagon through the army maintains a 
large defensive program aimed at developing vaccines and 
antidotes detection systems and battlefield gear that could be 
used to protect american soldiers if attacked with natural or 
manmade poisons 
in order to develop such defenses laboratories must work with a 
variety of deadly toxins 
according to the pentagon roughly 60 million is now being 
spent every year on the research which is conducted at more than 
100 military university and private laboratories in 27 states and 
eight foreign countries

a former president of the southern baptist 
convention said that while abortion is an abomination before 
god he opposes tactics of the antiabortion protesters that have 
led to hundreds of arrests this summer 
the rev charles stanley pastor of the first baptist church of 
atlanta issued the twopage treatise sunday saying abortion should 
be protested only through lawful means 
the leaflet a biblical perspective on civil disobedience 
said it represents the carefully studied view of the pastoral 
staff and deacons of the church the states largest baptist 
congregation 
in the leaflet the ministers reaffirmed the southern baptist 
stance against abortion saying we strongly oppose abortion as 
an abomination before god we also advocate all lawful means of 
protesting abortion 
more than 700 demonstrators have been arrested in atlanta in 
protests organized by the new yorkbased operation rescue since the 
group arrived during the democratic national convention in july 
the leaflet which stanley read from the pulpit cites biblical 
grounds for disobeying the law and concludes that operation 
rescues tactics fail in three areas 
protesters have been charged with criminal trespassing 
obstructing rights of way or other similar ordinances not for 
directly preventing abortions if certain antigod protesters 
blocked the entrance to the church so we could not enter to 
worship we would use the same ordinance to have them arrested 
the us supreme court decision legalizing abortion neither 
requires abortions nor prohibits them but makes them permissible 
with certain restrictions 
women are free moral agents responsible before almighty god 
for their actions including the exercise of the rights of their 
innocent unborn child 
operation rescue leader randall terry who has directed his 
demonstrations mostly with the help of clergy and supporters from 
outside atlanta responded 
we are glad dr stanley agrees that abortion is murder we 
wish he could also see that operation rescue is not about protest 
or civil disobedience it is about saving the lives of babies 
scheduled to be murdered 
stanley had been silent on the issue of civil disobedience since 
watching a protest several weeks ago where his friend jerry 
falwell the moral majority founder and an independent baptist 
appeared and offered his endorsement falwell who gave operation 
rescue 10000 said he would return to be arrested and had 
predicted that stanley would join the protests

the state department praised the laotian 
government tuesday for its recent arrest and conviction of 48 
persons on drug smuggling charges 
while crediting laos with strong action against drug 
traffickers department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said some 
laotian authorities may be promoting narcotics trafficking with the 
support of the central government 
she said that among those convicted was a member of the 
communist party central committee who also served as a provincial 
governor he was given a sevenyear sentence 
the departments position tuesday differed from its conclusion 
in a report prepared last spring that laos was the only nation 
for which the preponderance of information suggests that the 
government promotes drug trafficking as a matter of policy 
the report which covered several countries suspected of 
involvement in drug smuggling was dated may 1 the national 
security council ordered it withheld from members of congress until 
last week because it contained sensitive information the study was 
released to the media tuesday 
one us official who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
said recent actions by laotian authorities indicates their attitude 
on the drug issue may be changing 
the may report said there was coordinated participation among 
laotian government officials in drug smuggling and suggested this 
could not have taken place without the approval of authorities in 
vientiane 
specifically the us finds that laotian officials have 
become involved directly in the processing of opium and marijuana 
including three marijuana processing centers run by government 
organizations and at least four sanctioned heroin laboratories 
the report said 
the government also allows independent traffickers to operate on 
laotian territory said the study which observed that large 
portions of the country are not under vientianes effetive control 
it said the northern lao importexport co is a government 
agency suspected of marketing narcotics abroad the mountain area 
development co described as a state enterprise controlled by the 
military is alleged to be the chief agency involved in narcotics 
trafficking the report said 
governments found to be engaged in drug smuggling are subject to 
us sanctions prescribed by congress but no action was taken 
against laos because president reagan decided that laotian 
cooperation in accounting for missing american servicemen might 
otherwise be impaired 
in any case sanctions imposed against laos would be largely 
symbolic because laos receives no us assistance 
the administration has concluded that panamanian leader gen 
manuel antonio noriega commander of panamas defense forces has 
engaged in drug smuggling activities but the report said noriega 
is not a senior official of panama because the united states 
regards the ousted government of president eric arturo delvalle as 
the legitimate authority in panama 
therefore noriega was considered beyond the scope of the 
report which is aimed primarily at government officials who engage 
in drug trafficking

michael dukakis said tuesday that george bush flunked a key 
test of leadership in the irancontra affair and questioned 
whether his republican rival has the judgment needed to deal with 
the soviet union bush shot back that dukakis favors unilateral 
cuts in us defenses 
the two contenders for the white house swapped charges in their 
escalating war of campaign words as their top aides met in 
washington without agreeing on a schedule for presidential debates 
this fall 
bush campaign chairman james a baker iii said the republicans 
would accept two presidential debates and one confrontation between 
vice presidential contenders but nothing before sept 22 dukakis 
aide paul brountas said he favored a more extensive schedule 
we want more debates they want fewer he said we want to 
start them earlier they want to start them later we want to 
continue them up until the election takes place they would like to 
end them much earlier he added the two sides will meet again on 
thursday 
dukakis bargained through aides with bush over debates as fresh 
reports surfaced of lingering tensions with jesse jackson the 
democratic nominees most persistent rival during the primary 
campaign one source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
jackson met with top dukakis aides last week and was angered when 
he was handed a list of states to avoid during the fall campaign 
including several where he won primaries and caucuses earlier this 
year 
but dukakis spokesman dayton duncan called the report about the 
list absolutely false 
dukakis who has sharpened his rhetoric in the face of 
widespread published reports that he has lost the campaign 
offensive said bush was a failure as a crime fighter and misguided 
on defense matters and he resurrected the irancontra affair as a 
campaign issue 
making tough decisions is a test of leadership george bush 
endorsed the decision to sell arms to iran and in doing so he 
failed that test dukakis said 
referring to the irancontra affair dealings with panamas 
indicted leader manuel antonio noriega and bushs support during 
the early 1980s for ousted philippines president ferdinand e 
marcos dukakis said and hes talking about judgment about 
negotiations about taking risks i would be very concerned about 
someone with that kind of judgment negotiating with the soviet 
union 
bush kept up his own steady drumbeat of criticism as he 
campaigned in north carolina we should not gamble americas 
future on another liberal governor coming out of nowhere he 
said likening dukakis to former president carter 
later bush said dukakis wants to make unilateral cuts in our 
strategic systems the mx the midgetman no testing get rid of 
two aircraft carrier groups as well 
the vice president also cautioned against complacency in dealing 
with the soviet union im glad there is change in the soviet 
union he said but wed better not let our guard down 
bush said he was encouraged by recent polling things 
indicating an unturn in his fortunes in recent weeks thats 
turned around now after our upbeat republican convention he said 
dukakis aides scheduled a briefing with reporters for wednesday 
they are expected to emphasize that despite a recent republican 
trend in the polls their campaign is on track with television 
commercials set to begin running within the next two weeks an 
organization in place in most of the 50 states and an estimated 25 
million raised for the fall campaign 
the money will be used in addition to the 46 million subsidy 
that both presidential tickets receive from the federal government 
despite plans for dukakis to campaign jointly with jackson 
there were indications that relations between the former rivals 
were strained 
top dukakis campaign aides met thursday with jackson to discuss 
his role in the fall campaign and a source said these aides 
arrived with a list of states where they asked jackson not to 
campaign 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the list 
included michigan louisiana mississippi georgia and texas 
jackson carried all but texas and georgia during the democratic 
primary season and finally the two sides agreed he would campaign 
in all but texas this fall 
also left undecided was whether any top jackson campaign aides 
would move into a substantive role in the dukakis national campaign 
organization 
dukakis referred only briefly to jackson during the day saying 
its going to take a little longer to fully integrate the 
campaign but im pleased 
instead he focused his fire on bush 
dukakis said bushs record on crime was a blank on the rare 
occasions when the vice president has been asked to do something on 
this subject its been a failure he said 
dukakis also said bush wants them all when it comes to new 
weapons and you cant have them all particularly in view of 
the federal deficit 
dukakis also chose the day to resurrect the irancontra affair 
as a campaign issue 
he said that bush was head of an antiterrorism task force that 
had issued a report denouncing any concessions to terrorist nations 
the president and the vice president and a number of other 
people proceeded to do precisely what that commission said you 
should never do he said 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle spoke to a 
meeting of fire fighters in washington and noted wryly that hed 
gained a lot of experience in recent weeks in their line of work 
where were you when i needed you he said in a reference to 
the controversy that erupted over his service in the national guard

pows who have switched their loyalty to irans ayatollah khomeini 
the un experts said in a report scheduled for release thursday 
the associated press saw a copy of the report tuesday 
in each camp we visited in iran there were fanatical 
hysterical and sometimes violent demonstrations by the prisoners 
who were assembled inside along the barbed wire fences the 
three un experts reported 
iraqi prisoners shouted slogans denouncing iraqs president 
saddam hussein and the superpowers and praised islam and khomeini 
the investigators said and rallies were so fervid at the arak and 
davoudieh camps that they could not enter safely 
about half the prisoners participated in each case and clearly 
were under the influence of 1020 percent or the group the report 
said the team visited the camps in late july and early august 
camp committees provide religious and political instruction and 
persuasion under the name spiritual guidance the experts said 
and to us it is indistinguishable from mental pressure 
in the camps in iran holding iraqi prisoners the team 
concluded there is a risk that riots may break out for example 
in the moment when transfer is to take place with a view to 
registration and repatriation 
in the camps in iraq the iranian pows were more orderly and 
iraqi authorities maintained control but many prisoners also 
appeared hesitant about going home after the 8yearold war 
the majority however seemed inclined to return to iran 
provided they were given effective gurantees that they would not be 
subject to persecution on their return the report said in the 
absence of such guarantees however their future looks gloomy 
iran listed 46098 pows in its camps but many new prisoners had 
not been registered so the un team decided the number could be 
about 70000 
iraq furnished a list of 18139 pows as of aug 1 but iraqi 
authorities told the team many new prisoners had not been 
registered the investigators decided the total could be about 
35000 
conditions in the camps of both sides are on the whole 
acceptable although it might be desirable to have them further 
improved on some points the report said 
prokhomeini iraqis dominating irans camps reject western 
institutions including the international committee of the red 
cross which registers prisoners of war and looks after their 
welfare the investigators said 
because they view the red cross as ineffective and dominated by 
the west many have refused to register with it complicating the 
repatriation process 
the un team also found however that some iraqi pows were 
never given a chance by iranian authorities to register with the 
red cross or were dissuaded by the prokhomeini iraqi prisoners 
according to the report iranian authorities cooperated in 
verifying the whereabouts of nearly all 7327 iraqi pows 
registered by the red cross before 1984 who were listed as missing 
showing them to be safe and alive in or out of pow camps 
iraqi authorities cooperated in tallying about 25000 iranian 
kurds 30000 iranian arabs and more than 300 other iranians 
listed by iran as missing 
iraq said they sought asylum and were in three refugee camps 
the un team found the facilities similar to pow camps surrounded 
by barbed wire but the residents had relative freedom of movement 
more than 200 pows held by iran are from syria lebanon egypt 
sudan or somalia the team said iran has called them 
mercenaries but has promised to free them 
iran and iraq have accused each other of the torture and 
maltreatment of pows 
in iran the un team said we never saw any direct evidence 
of atrocities torture or beating but from the conversations we 
had with some prisoners we cannot dismiss allegations that such 
acts have occurred 
in iraqs camp number nine in the ramadi region the team found 
abuse that did not seem typical of iraqi camps at large 
members of the un team were maj gen rene bats of belgium 
wolfram karl an austrian professor of international law and 
torkel opsahl of norway also a professor of international law 
they visited irans camps july 2330 and the iraqi camps july

the agriculture department said tuesday it 
will not extend certain crop price support loans made to farmers 
including some that begin to come due on aug 31 
milton hertz executive vice president of the departments 
commodity credit corp said the action is consistent with loan 
extension decisions that the agriculture department announced in 
january and march 
the proposal leading up to the decision has been criticized as 
heavyhanded by some farm groups and is involved in a legal 
challenge by a group of farmers in us district court in st paul 
minn 
in the past the department has frequently allowed farmers to 
extend their regular ninemonth price support loans for an 
additional year or longer as a way of keeping surplus grain off the 
market 
when locked up in the loan program or in the farmerowned 
reserve or for grain cannot be sold on the market until the loan 
is settled when the loans come due farmers have the option paying 
the loans in full or forfeiting their crops to the commodity credit 
corp 
hertz said the following loans will not be extended 
1987 and subsequent crop price support regular loans for feed 
grains rice soybeans and wheat 
1985 and 1986 crop extended loans of wheat barley oats and 
soybeans 
1983 and prior cropyear loans for commodities in the for 
special producer loans 
hertz said the following loans can be extended at the producers 
option for one year 
1985 and 1986 crop corn and sorghum extended loans which mature 
on march 31 through dec 31 this year

stress cannot be ruled out as the cause of some of 
the mysterious deaths and disappearances in britains defense and 
electronics industry a union said tuesday 
the manufacturing science and finance union said it recently 
surveyed technical managerial and professional staff in six 
companies and found many experience high stress levels and fewer 
than 4 percent are happy in their jobs 
sixteen men employed in defense or security work including 
seven who worked for marconi co ltd or its related companies 
have died in unusual circumstances since 1982 
many of the men died in unexplained even bizarre circumstances 
most deaths resembled suicides although only two have been so 
ruled 
stress cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor in the 
spate of marconi deaths said larry brooke the unions national 
officer 
the people who have died were overwhelmingly in responsible 
positions the electronics industry is highly competitive and the 
defense side has undergone an immense change over the last five 
years the screw has been tightened and more and more pressure has 
been piled on he said 
brooke called for employers in the industry to treat people at 
work like people and not numbers in an attempt to ease the 
pressure 
the union surveyed employees at marconi racal plessey co plc 
ferranti philips and thorn emi all major electronics companies 
with a sizeable involvement in government defense work 
it found only 35 percent said they were happy and fulfilled in 
their work and 41 percent said they were dissatisfied with their 
work environment to the point where they said it affected their 
home life and health 
nearly onequarter said they often found it difficult to relax 
and the same proportion complained of bringing their problems home 
and of feeling constantly drained and lethargic 
the survey results are based on 500 replies to 2000 
questionnaires distributed to union members and nonmembers in the 
industry 
the british government has said the spate of deaths and 
disappearances is odd but has insisted the frequency of deaths is a 
coincidence and has rejected calls for an inquiry 
the string of deaths dates from march 1982 when keith bowden a 
45yearold expert on supercomputers and computercontrolled 
aircraft drove his car off a highway and down a railway 
embankment police said he had been drinking but friends denied it 
among the succeeding deaths was a computer systems analyst for a 
marconi unit who killed himself by tying a rope to a tree looping 
the other end around his neck and then driving off in his car at 
high speed 
a computer expert for easams a marconi sister company drove 
his car its trunk loaded with tanks of gasoline into a vacant 
restaurant and burned to death 
three of the men died in or under their cars in fumefilled 
garages and a digital communications expert fell from a hotel room 
in the ivory coast after expressing fear for his life 
most recently john ferry was found electrocuted aug 24 in his 
apartment at the headquarters of marconi command and control 
systems ltd at frimley 35 miles southwest of london the former 
army brigadier 60 was an assistant marketing director with 
special responsibility for liaison with the armed forces 
his widow said the pressure of his secret work may have 
contributed to his death

george bushs campaign said tuesday the 
republican nominee was willing to meet michael dukakis in two 
debates and hold a third between their running mates but the 
dukakis campaign held out for at least one more debate 
a meeting between the top officials of both campaigns ended with 
disagreement over both the number and timing of debates between the 
presidential nominees 
there was no decision on who would sponsor the debates or on 
what the format would be but both sides agreed to meet again 
thursday for more negotiations 
we want more debates they want fewer said paul brountas 
campaign chairman for dukakis the democratic presidential nominee 
we want to start them earlier they want to start them 
later brountas said we want to continue them up until the 
election takes place they would like to end them much earlier 
james a baker iii chairman of the republican nominees 
campaign said the bush campaign has offered to hold two 
presidential debates and a third between the vice presidential 
nominees with the first coming as early as sept 22 
that date would rule out however rival proposals for debates 
on sept 8 sponsored by the league of women voters and on sept 
14 sponsored by a bipartisan commission set up by both parties to 
hold the debates 
provided that the issues of format and staging and so forth 
are resolved the vice president has agreed to debate twice and we 
have agreed that there could be a vice presidential debate baker 
said 
baker said the commissions proposed second debate on sept 25 
would be agreeable with us 
both officials spoke after a twohour private meeting in the 
washington offices of brountas law firm brountas and campaign 
manager susan estrich represented dukakis and bush was represented 
by baker media adviser roger ailes and campaign aide bob goodwin 
they met as the public debate over debates continued from both 
sides of the presidential campaign 
dukakis in massachusetts pressed bush anew to meet him in 
debate and charged the republicans dont want to debate the 
reagan administrations record bush in north carolina declared 
there will be debates but said too many would be boring 
baker explaining the bush campaigns opposition to a third 
presidential debate said that the campaign is a continuing 
debate and that the bush offer was for as many debates as were 
held in the 1984 campaign 
were not afraid of three presidential debates at all 
baker said but there are other ways to campaign debates 
have a way of freezing the campaign during their pendency and 
were quite anxious that we continue to campaign the way in which 
weve been campaigning over the course of the past couple weeks 
bush chief of staff craig fuller told reporters traveling with 
bush that the proposal for two presidential and one vice 
presidential debates was a firm position and our only 
offer he pointed to dukakiss experience as a debater and said 
were cognizant of the fact that its one of his areas of 
expertise 
brountas said that bushs negotiators had ruled out devoting the 
first debate to foreign policy and national security issues the 
subjects dukakis wants to debate first 
one of the reasons is that would create very high expectations 
in light of the vice presidents experience over the past seven and 
a half years and they dont want to be confronted with those high 
expectations brountas said 
estrich said the bush negotiators objected to holding a debate 
within two weeks of election day because they wouldnt have time 
to recover from a potential disastrous mistake at that debate 
complicating the argument over when to hold the debates are 
major sporting events which will occupy much of evening television 
network time during the fall the professional football season 
begins sunday and the olympics get under way sept 17 and run for 
two weeks both events are followed by baseballs world series 
estrich said dukakis wants to begin the debates with the 
commission on presidential debates proposal for a sept 14 debate 
in annapolis md because it is virtually the last date possible 
before the olympics because the bush campaign refused to meet on 
that date the dukakis campaign asked for a substitute date for 
that debate 
similarly estrich said dukakis wants a final debate on oct 25 
26 or 27 in hopes the world series would no longer provide a 
distraction to viewers 
the talks did not resolve the dispute over sponsorship of 
thedebates the dukakis campaign has accepted the proposal of the 
commission which was established with the republican and 
democratic party chairmen 
the league of women voters sponsor of fall debates in the last 
three presidential elections has proposed a debate sept 8 in 
birmingham ala followed by debates oct 6 in minneapolis minn 
oct 23 in boston and nov 1 in los angeles 
league president nancy neuman offered to help mediate and said 
the lingering dispute is evidence of the political parties 
inexperience in debates sponsorship 
after annapolis on sept 14 the commission wants other debates 
on sept 25 in winstonsalem nc oct 11 in omaha neb and 
oct 27 in pittsburgh the omaha debate could be for the vice 
presidential candidates 
in 1984 president reagan met democrat walter mondale in two 
debates on oct 7 and oct 21 and a third debate was held oct 11 
between their running mates in 1980 reagan and president carter 
met in one debate on oct 28 in 1976 president ford met carter 
in three debates and their running mates also held a debate

the number of americans behind on their 
mortgage payments rose in the apriljune quarter for the second 
time in 2 years an organization of lenders said tuesday 
the mortgage bankers association of america said the number of 
homeowners who were at least 30 days late in making a mortgage 
payment edged up to 490 percent of the 98 million mortgages 
surveyed in the second quarter 
the increase in late mortgage payments was the second rise since 
the fourth quarter of 1985 
the delinquency rate had fallen in the first quarter to 478 
percent after rising in the last three months of 1987 to 495 
percent the third quarter 1987 level 471 percent was the 
lowest in eight years 
warren lasko executive vice president of the association 
called the latest increase disturbing 
however he said in a statement one quarter does not make 
a trend and this uptick should be kept in perspective 
the mortgage bankers report said employment growth and rising 
wages should continue to shrink the delinquency rate in future 
quarters 
despite the slightly higher delinquency rate in the second 
quarter foreclosures held steady at 027 percent the same as in 
the januarymarch period and the last three months of 1987 
even with the latest rise in the delinquency rate from the 
previous quarter all regions of the country had a lower 
delinquency rate when compared with a year earlier 
the northeast had the lowest delinquency rate 378 in the 
second quarter down from 413 percent a year earlier it was 
followed by the west where the delinquency rate dropped from 414 
percent to 405 percent over a year 
the south where some states have been hard hit by the 
depression in the oil industry had the highest delinquency rate 
519 percent a scant improvement from 521 percent a year earlier 
the second quarter rate in north central states was 489 percent 
down from 496 percent

an unreviewed calculation flawed four 
different ways led to the failed restart of a nuclear weapons 
production reactor an energy department advisory panel was told 
thursday 
but no one knows why the same reactor at the savannah river 
plant near aiken sc underwent a power surge a few days later 
after a successful restart the panel was told 
it was discovery of a flawed calculation decades ago that led 
the department earlier this year to order its remaining weapons 
reactors limited to half power a runaway power surge with safety 
systems disconnected caused the 1986 chernobyl reactor explosion in 
the soviet union 
department officials have said their concern was not so much the 
two abnormal restart events in themselves but delays in being told 
about them by the operating contractor the du pont co 
du pont reported the aug 10 power surge only in the next days 
routine operations report despite assuring the department on aug 9 
it would be quicker to report unusual events 
the series of events at savannah rivers preactor was described 
in a report to the departments new advisory committee on nuclear 
facility safety by a subcommittee headed by elmer schwartz 
associate dean of engineering at the university of south carolina 
richard starostecki deputy assistant secretary for environment 
safety and health told reporters that new communications 
agreements had been reached between du pont and the department but 
the reactor in question was shut down aug 17 and would remain 
closed until investigators discover why power surged by 2 percent 
without explanation 
when the power surge occured the reactor was 90 percent of the 
way to its planned halfpower operating level 
you arent supposed to have any power surges starostecki 
said 
the committee also was given an analysis of the events of aug 
8aug 17 done for schwartz by dana a powers of the sandia 
national laboratory in new mexico 
powers report said the surge was miniscule and though rare 
had happened before it was quickly corrected by the operators 
schwartz said it was well within the trigger point that would have 
led to an automatic shutdown 
the three reactors at savannah river produce no electricity 
neutrons produced in the nuclear reactions of uranium make either 
plutonium or tritium a radioactive form of hydrogen for nuclear 
weapons 
all three reactors were shut for various reasons when the 
department decided to finish a tritium production run in the 
preactor after a 119day shutdown this was the longest idle 
period the reactor had ever undergone with a fuel core in place 
the flawed calculation of the expected strength of the nuclear 
reactions on startup was used to position the neutronabsorbing 
control rods according to powers report the reactor becamed 
selfsustaining only when the rods where withdrawn far more than 
the calculation said they should have been and selfsustaining 
operation could not be maintained 
the department admitted earlier that the calculation had ignored 
the buildup of helium in the reactor from decay of tritium during 
the long shutdown helium tends to poison or suppress the 
nuclear reaction 
powers pinpointed three other flaws in the calculation he said 
no one reviewed 
the actual history of the fuel was not used in the calculation 
the analyst in question used the outofdate planned use of the 
fuel oversight or not this is a less readily excused error 
than neglecting helium 
the presence in the fuel of samarium a metallic element in the 
rareearths group was not sufficiently accounted for 
three control rods that couldnt be raised were left out of the 
calculation 
there appears to be no department of energy standards on the 
nature of operational readiness reviews powers said 
since the shutdown had been the longest ever it is surprising 
then that no department of energy personnel were present for this 
restart what kind of oversight is it that does not follow unusual 
events during this period of enhanced scrutiny of the production 
reactors he said 
powers said he found no evidence that desire for production at 
the expense of safety prompted the restart and in fact a fresh 
fuel charge would have optimized production after the long shutdown

american businessman darrell marion 
alexander and two ghanaians have pleaded innocent to charges of 
trying to export 2000 african gray parrots to the united states 
illegally 
alexander identified as managing director of exotic fauna 
international and ghanaian wildlife exporters christian leslie 
mills and wabi bello were held over for court appearances wednesday 
they entered pleas monday before a national public tribunal 
where each faced a 25count charge including acts detrimental to 
the welfare of the sovereign people of ghana 
a month ago the record newspaper of lompoc calif quoted 
relatives as saying alexander 46 of the los angeles suburb of la 
crescenta went to ghana in november and got all the necessary 
permits for exporting the gray parrots 
they said exotic fauna international is a bird import company 
based in los angeles and sanctioned by the us department of 
agriculture the paper reported 
we consider him a hostage not a criminal alexanders 
nephew mark a resident of lompoc was quoted as saying 
at the democratic national convention july 19 in atlanta about 
a dozen onlookers and reporters watched when darrell alexanders 
family took the podium to urge that he be released from jail in 
ghana 
ghanaian authorities said june 13 that alexander and another 
american were arrested after lt cmdr k assassiegyimah a senior 
government official discovered the birds squawking in an airplane 
hold the other american was not identified and was neither 
mentioned nor present at the court proceeding monday 
exporting african gray parrots from ghana is illegal 
the gpverment accuses alexander of paying more than 6 million 
cedis 200000 to the ghanaians who are accused of bribing 
officials for phony export permits 
the african gray parrot once common in west african forests is 
noted for its ability to learn to talk quickly excessive trapping 
of the birds and destruction of their habitat have made them scarce 
alexanders brother alvin of las vegas nev was quoted by the 
lompoc paper as saying he visited the military compound in ghana 
where his brother was held and found prisoners chained together

florala mayor ht mathis accused of 
embarrassing his town with voodoo antics testified tuesday 
that he granted pardons to convicted offenders because he has a 
soft heart 
my mission on earth is to help people the 85yearold 
former tire store owner testified as the defense began presenting 
its case at his impeachment trial for alleged incompetence and 
misuse of office 
before taking the stand he told reporters satan is trying to 
destroy floralas government i love florala 
prosecution witnesses depicted mathis as a man who undermined 
the law by abusing his pardon power he is accused of pardoning 
more than 100 traffic offenders including 27 drunken drivers 
i have more power than ronald reagan mathis was quoted as 
saying by city clerk betty hooten the final prosecution witness 
in alabama removal from office is decided by a civil proceeding 
conducted much like a criminal trial covington county circuit 
judge william baldwin will send the case to the jury wednesday 
morning 
in closing arguments mathis attorney james prestwood said it 
would be cruel to impeach mathis 
why go to all this expense prestwood said theyve done 
everything in the book to make ht mathis look bad 
but attorney general don siegelman described the situation in 
florala as the most abusive case ive ever heard of in the united 
states he said the impeachment complaint was brought to 
prevent a tragedy such as a highway death caused by a drunken 
driver who had been pardoned at the whim of a mayor 
mrs hooten said she told the mayor some of the offenders 
getting pardoned had been highly intoxicated asked his reaction 
she said it didnt seem like it mattered to him 
questioned by prosecutors about the pardons mathis said people 
came to him with sad stories and he was just trying to help them 
im just a little softhearted he said 
in earlier testimony tuesday witnesses told the jury that 
mathis once threatened a councilman with a knife and asked the 
police chief to give him confiscated wine 
the mayor of florala a town of about 5000 on the florida line 
20 miles south of andalusia was charged with corruption 
incompetence and willful neglect of duty by the grand jury that 
called for his ouster 
mathis critics also deplored his july proclamation of 
national voodoo week and his earlier purported attempt to scare 
the police chief by sprinkling socalled voodoo powder around 
city hall council chambers and down corridors to the jail 
in his testimony the mayor elaborated on the caper 
mathis said he did not believe in voodoo and the yellow powder 
he spread at city hall was sulfur powder not meant to harm anyone 
after the incident was reported by the media the mayor said he 
decided to capitalize on publicity 
i dont even know what voodoo means i made a mistake in 
the way i did it he testified 
police chief av patrick testified tuesday that he was not 
influenced by the mayors voodoo joke patrick however said the 
mayors abuse of pardoning power turned florala law enforcement 
into a joke 
he said arrested motorists would laugh at officers and one told 
him i dont mind you arresting me im going to get a pardon 
the mayors attorney tried to show tuesday that the pardons 
granted by mathis demonstrated his concern about the cost of 
housing people in the city jail and his belief that it was better 
for them to be working earning an income 
mathis defended his performance in office over the last four 
years citing annual increases in the citys sales tax collection 
from 850152 in 1984 to last years 930365 
in her testimony mrs hooten said the pardons granted by 
mathis who was elected in 1984 cost the city 27767 in canceled 
or refunded fines she said the mayor told her he didnt think some 
of the arrested offenders were guilty 
mathis term expires oct 3 but floralas city election has 
been postponed by a federal court and the mayor barring removal 
through impeachment could hold the office for an indefinite period 
as a result

fairly moderate earthquake ground motion could 
damage a major protective system of the energy departments 
preactor at the savannah river plant in south carolina a 
department official said tuesday 
but major reactor components could withstand larger quakes 
according to a report by richard starostecki deputy assistant 
secretary for environment safety and health to the departments 
new advisory committee on nuclear facility safety 
the department plans to operate the preactor for another year 
before beginning a major upgrade of its protection against 
earthquakes 
starostecki presented does first numerical estimates of the 
ability of major systems of the reactor to come through earthquakes 
and still function studies aimed at similar estimates are under 
way for the two other nuclear weapons material production reactors 
at the savannah river plant 
ground acceleration of about 1 foot per second per second would 
be enough to harm the filtration system designed to remove 
radioactive particles from air escaping from the reactor building 
in a major accident starostecki said 
in this confinement system the limiting areas are 
primarily the filters and at that acceleration there is doubt 
that you can keep them up against the ductwork 
beyond about 32 feet per second per second you probably 
dont have confinement capability starostecki said 
one foot per second per second is about 3 percent of the 
acceleration that gravity imparts to a freely falling object about 
32 feet per second per second 
the acceleration due to gravity is called g and engineers 
frequently express other accelerations as a fraction of g 16 
feet per second per second is 05g 1 foot per second per second is 
003g and so forth 
people in a car accelerating steadily to 60 miles per hour in 15 
second undergo an acceleration of a little less than 6 feet per 
second per second or 018g 
there is no necessary connection between ground acceleration and 
earthquake severity said ken campbell a civil engineer in the 
boulder colo office of the us geological survey 
destructiveness is a function of duration of the shaking and its 
frequency content as well as local geology he said 
campbell estimated that the 1886 earthquake centered 19 miles 
west of charleston sc caused ground accelerations of about 05g 
over the center of the earthquake which has been estimated at 68 
to 72 on the richter scale 
acceleration in the 1886 earthquake probably would have been 
less than 01g about 200 miles away he said savannah river is 
about 115 miles northwest of charleston 
according to starosteckis report ground accelerations of 01g 
could disable the emergency cooling system at 02g ability to shut 
down the reactor and remove its decay heat could be jeopardized 
each year there is a 1 per cent to 2 percent chance of an 
earthquake large enough to produce ground accelerations of 005g to 
01g at savannah river said john knight of starosteckis office 
the chance of accelerations of 02g is about one in a thousand 
as i see it there is a crying need to sit back and say what 
are the seismic criteria for the site no pun intended from the 
ground up knight said keep in mind these systems were never 
subjected to a seismic analysis 
civilian reactors must be able to shut down in earthquakes of 
varying severity with standards tailored to individual sites 
frank ingraham of the nuclear regulatory commission said the 
most lenient is the site for the yankee rowe plant in 
massachusetts where shutdown must be possible in ground motions of 
005g the strictest is the diablo canyon site in california close 
to a major fault where shutdown must be possible in motions of 
075g

eastern airlines labor leaders embraced a federal 
judges ruling tuesday that blocked layoffs of 4000 employees 
although it allows the company to go ahead with service cutbacks 
were please at this ruling it will save 4000 jobs and it 
rules that the proposed furloughing is illegal said charles e 
bryan president of district 100 of the machinists union easterns 
largest with 12000 workers 
bryan flight attendants leader mary jane barry and pilots 
local vice chairman dan vician talked to reporters at the transport 
workers union hall just off the miami international airport as 
their attorneys studied the 50page opinion by us district judge 
barrington parker in washington 
eastern while satisfied that parker will allow the closing of 
its kansas city hub and the elimination of 140 flights said it 
will appeal his decision that the company cannot make mass layoffs 
without bargaining with its unions 
bryan called the decision an opportunity for texas air corp 
chairman frank lorenzo to show he is more than the no 1 
unionbuster 
here now is a chance for him to change his style the ball is 
in frank lorenzos court bryan said 
he and the other union leaders expressed willingness to meet 
with management to discuss costcutting measures that preserve jobs 
were not here as laborers trying to direct the business of 
the airline were trying to protect jobs vician said 
ms barry said the flight attendants were still willing to offer 
a jobsharing and leave plan rejected earlier by management to 
save jobs and money 
eastern spokeswoman paula musto said she couldnt comment on the 
unions interpretation of the opinion 
the union leaders stressed parkers findings of fact that texas 
air which took over miamibased eastern two years ago has been 
antagonistic toward unions tried to spin off assets such as the 
northeast shuttle service and has worsened easterns financial 
problems by using eastern resources to pay for its own sale taking 
a noninterest 16 million note from eastern and taking a 6 
million annual management fee from eastern 
in short the record shows that eastern has served as a 
lending institution to meet the needs of texas air and continental 
the nonunion carrier also owned by houstonbased texas air 
the opinion said 
it confirmed what weve been saying bryan said this is a 
federal judge its not the unions anymore or our consultants 
talking 
eastern is cutting 140 flights and service from 14 cities while 
reducing its kansas city hub from 53 to six flights and nonhub 
status ms musto said the company hasnt determined what it will 
do with the protected employees

panama was among the 30 nations that 
participated in a usbacked drug crackdown even though the 
united states brought economic sanctions against the country 
because of drug charges against its military leader 
colombian narcotics officials meanwhile were skeptical about 
the success of the joint drug crackdown they said no major 
traffickers were arrested in the operations from aug 128 and the 
amounts of drugs seized were not impressive 
the us drug enforcement agency had encouraged the 30 countries 
to step up enforcement and specifically to cooperate in 
crossborder raids mostly in south america during august 
dea head john c lawn praised the antidrug campaign and said it 
showed that international cooperation could eliminate sanctuaries 
for drug traffickers who tried to evade capture by going to other 
countries 
lawn and other representatives made brief statements during a 
meeting with reporters but journalists were not allowed to ask 
questions 
the bogota meeting coincided with a report in washington on the 
results of the operations by the international drug enforcement 
conference 
us attorney general richard thornburgh said in washington that 
the raids led to more than 1200 arrests the seizure of 11 tons of 
cocaine and the destruction of 244 tons of marijuana 118000 coca 
plants and 13 cocaine laboratories 
the panamanian delegate to the bogota meeting lt col nivaldo 
madrinan said in his statement that panama participated in the 
program even though it is suffering the greatest aggression in 
its history he did not specifically mention the us sanctions 
panamas military leader gen manuel antonio noriega was 
indicted in february by two federal grand juries in florida that 
accused him of drug trafficking the united states imposed economic 
sanctions against panama after noriega refused to resign and leave 
the country 
noriega commander of panamas defense forces controls the 
civilian government 
madrinan said the monthlong drug crackdown in panama produced 
96 arrests and the seizure of 48 pounds of cocaine 2084 eight 
vehicles and eight weapons 
reporters were now allowed to ask who had been arrested 
panama peru ecuador brazil colombia and venezuela sent 
delegates to the bogota meeting 
colombian officials speaking with the condition they not be 
identified noted the dea reported the raids turned up 13 cocaine 
laboratories and they said more than 13 labs are frequently found 
in a single week in colombia 
the dea report said that of the 11 tons of cocaine and cocaine 
base seized 62 tons were found in south american countries the 
colombian officials said that in one raid in colombia five years 
ago more than 10 tons of cocaine and cocaine base were seized 
the colombians also questioned a section of the dea statement 
that said the raids were the result of cooperation among the 
participating countries 
they said crossborder operations between venezuela and colombia 
were a week late because of border disputes and claimed venezuela 
did virtually nothing during the campaign

supreme court justice sandra day oconnor on 
tuesday allowed the government to begin enforcing a new law banning 
sexually obscene dialaporn message services pending the full 
courts review of the statute 
oconnor denied a request by sable communications of california 
inc for a stay of a los angeles federal court ruling that upheld 
that portion of the law banning telephone services whose messages 
fall under the legal definition of obscene 
the california court however also ruled that federal 
regulators may not ban indecent messages from phone lines the 
government has appealed that decision and both portions of the law 
are now before the supreme court 
the justices denial of a stay means the government ban on 
obscene telephone messages is in effect and the federal 
communications commission will begin enforcing it said diane 
killory fcc general counsel 
i dont see any basis for us to hold up enforcement she 
said 
sable attorney richard simon said he was not surprised by 
oconnors action but said i think we can make a very 
convincing case that the statute as written is unconstitiuional and 
we expect to do that 
the fcc considers material indecent if it depicts or 
describes sexual or excretory organs or activities in a patently 
offensive way 
the commission deems material obscene if it depicts sexual 
acts in a patently offensive way appeals to the prurient interest 
of an average person and lacks serious literary artistic 
political or scientific value 
the law applies only to interstate dialaporn calls and those 
in the district of columbia it provides for both criminal and 
civil prosecution and carries penalties of up to 50000 for each 
day of violation and imprisonment of up to six months 
the law had been scheduled to take effect july 1 but sables 
lawsuit challenge and another separate lawsuit filed in new york 
delayed enforcement

injuring hundreds officials said 
after the accident riedel a government employee who lives in 
karlsruhe drove home and went to sleep simon quoted him as saying 
on monday he went to a color lab to have the pictures 
developed simon said the woman working at the lab saw how 
dramatic the pictures were 
simon said the woman knew the ap stringer for the area and

a large innercity hospital and a tiny rural one 
tuesday joined the growing number of community hospitals across the 
nation forced to close their doors because they cant make ends 
meet 
st annes hospital which has 437 beds is the 10th community 
hospital in chicago to shut down since 1986 officials said it 
will close its doors within a few weeks after 85 years of service 
to the west side said spokeswoman candace hulsebusfong 
white hall hospital an acutecare facility with 30 beds in 
southwestern illinois is the sixth small rural hospital to shut 
down in the state since 1986 said kenneth robbins president of 
the illinois hospital association 
the fact that both of them were forced to close was no 
coincidence at all but the result of conscious decisions of 
federal and state governments to underfund the medicare and 
medicaid programs that pay for health care for the elderly and the 
poor robbins said 
in 1987 a record 79 community hospitals shut down across the 
nation five of them in illinois said jan shulman a spokeswoman 
for the american hospital asssociation 
st annes officials said the hospital has suffered from late 
and inadequate federal reimbursement for its service to poor 
patients 
illinois medicaid program strapped for funds itself owes the 
hospital 17 million they said 
in april st annes laid off 60 percent of its staff to meet 
expenses since then it has used only 115 of its beds 
about 80 percent of st annes patients rely on medicaid or 
medicare to pay their bills ms hulsebusfong said 
another 10 percent of those are indigent so less than 10 
percent have any kind of commercial insurance she said 
all but about 15 percent of white halls patients relied on 
medicaid or medicare said glenn klein the hospitals 
administrator 
our board just could not justify maintaining an operation that 
lost money every single day of the week he said

a california brush fire destroyed at least five homes while 
crews fighting forest fires gained ground tuesday in yellowstone 
national park and the forest service went to employment offices in 
the west in search of more firefighters 
national guardsmen in idaho were sent to the firelines and 
wyoming guard volunteers were sent for fire training 
firefighters were at work against fires charring woodland in 
wyoming california montana idaho oregon washington and utah 
and dozens of fires have been allowed to smolder for months in the 
vast interior of alaska 
across the bay from san francisco in the grass and 
brushcovered orinda hills a fire burned out of control for two 
hours tuesday afternoon in an exclusive section of orinda 
five houses were totaled and two others had an undetermined 
amount of damage from flames still burning late tuesday after the 
blaze was largely contained fire chief ed lucas said 
the hills are steep and when the wind comes up it makes 
those hills like chimneys with flames just coming right up them 
said nancy artist she said the fire came within yards of her home 
another remote california town mopped up after lightningsparked 
blazes swept within feet of the community and forced evacuation of 
the town hospital for several hours 
nationally 18000 firefighters were on the job in one of the 
nations worst fire years reported the boise interagency fire 
center a central office in idaho that coordinates the fighting of 
forest fires in the west 
to date 34 million acres of forest has burned slightly ahead 
of last years pace but 21 million of that total is in alaska 
where 30 fires smoldered tuesday the center reported 
the fire center told forest service regions affected by the 
fires that temporary firefighters may be hired on a contingency 
basis for about 7 an hour said information officer mike ferris 
ferris said each national forest must determine its 
requirements were not saying were going to hire 4000 or 
8000 he said 
applicants lined up at state employment offices in the affected 
areas weve got them hanging out our ears said applicant 
interviewer dan rummel of missoula mont

were given 32 hours of training 
firefighters in yellowstone national park regained ground they 
lost last week against one of the tougher fires blazing in the 
park sealing off the popular old faithful geyser from flames 5 
miles away 
continued low wind in the countrys oldest national park on 
monday allowed firefighters there to make further inroads against 
the fires which have charred some 450000 acres of the 
22millionacre park 
that calm weather had prompted a decision to reopen 
yellowstones south entrance for the frst time in 10 days but 
spokeswoman amy vanderbilt said fire activity put the area back in 
danger the road had been closed for 10 days 
in californias sierra nevada firefighters late monday kept 
fastmoving lightning fires from reaching a hospital school and 
other buildings in remote portola there were no injuries in the 
town of 1600 residents and the only building lost was a barn 
it burned trees right up to the high school lawn said 
highway patrol officer rod mccurley 
about 30 patients and staff were evacuated from the eastern 
plumas district hospital for 5 hours while deputies the local 
search and rescue team and volunteers helped state firefighters 
halt the blaze 
it was amazing people came from all over to help save our 
homes people i never saw before said joann cavarg 41 i was 
raised in new york i never knew what it was like before to live in 
a small town were everybody cared about everybody else 
the combination fire in southwestern montana made no gains 
overnight beyond the 11200 acres it has burned between philipsburg 
and drummond said fire information officer palmer bowen it has 
burned a mining camp and threatened the small community of 
maxville bowen said it was 85 percent contained tuesday 
in the absarokabeartooth wilderness north of yellowstone 
national park fire officials predicted the 40300acre storm creek 
fire and the 34200acre hellroaring creek fire would eventually 
meet said nick tafoya information officer 
a fire crew bus careened off an embankment in northeastern 
washington late monday while returning 16 firefighters to the 
colville indian reservation and five were injured authorities 
said fires on the reservation and the neighboring colville 
national forest have burned more than 22500 acres 
in alaska where some fires have been burning since april the

for 30 days beginning at sunset thursday 238 license holders 
will be stalking areas of the state where the gator population is 
extraordinarly high the hunt the first since 1962 is needed to 
trim the numbers of the oncethreatened alligator which has 
rebounded strongly since strict antipoaching measures were 
instituted in the early 1970s 
the estimated 1 million alligators in florida is nearly double 
the 1975 population said allan woodward head of the alligator 
research unit for the state game and fresh water fish commission 
with each permit holder allowed up to 15 gators dunaway is 
prepared to easily exceed the 130 gators skinned at the plant since 
it opened in 1986 
we expect to be up nonstop from thursday until about monday 
either skinning or hunting he said were gonna be looking at 
a lot of dead gators 
some of the veteran hunters will be permitted to use the 
equipment at the gator house a cement frame enclosed by screen 
wire and decorated by a few deer antlers and empty beer cans a few 
junk cars rest nearby while the cicadas scream incessantly 
but the novice trappers randomly selected from 5000 
applications will watch their catch be pried apart 
alligators are cut up the back to preserve the valuable hide 
covering the belly and underarms said dunaway the hide which 
sells for about 42 a foot to foreign manufacturers is submerged 
in a brine solution for about a week 
the excess flesh is then scraped off and the skin is sun dried 
and we bury the innards as far away as possible said 
dunaway they got a powerful smell and if you ever cut open the 
stomach you better start running 
the meat which dunaway says makes a nice addition to spaghetti 
sauce must be frozen within several hours after the alligator is 
killed one 12foot gator bought to the plant in 1986 yielded 230 
pounds of meat 
youre fixing to eat gator for a long time with a catch like 
that said dunaways brother grant 34 
yet the gator business is just a hobby for the dunaways and 
uncle william busby 36 all will take vacation time from their 
jobs to process the gators 
they say the best they can do charging a 30 fee and 2 a pound 
is break even 
we just like it out here with the gators said grant 
with state officials publicizing that a 10foot gator could net 
1000 in meat and skin dale dunaway wonders if greed rather than 
adventure is motivating the new hunters 
you got to laugh when you hear these people say theyre going 
to make money off this hunt he said they dont figure in the 
time expenses and dont forget the danger id like to see some 
peoples faces the first time a gator takes a bite at their airboat 
but if they want to catch em then well skin em well just 
say stack em up 
he folded his knife in a triumphant clap

republican presidential nominee george 
bush on tuesday called rival michael dukakis another liberal 
governor coming out of nowhere and suggested the democrat would 
advocate unilateral cuts in us defense muscle 
the vice president continuing on the strong defense themes he 
has been sounding over the past few days sought to depict dukakis 
as inexperienced and weak on defense 
bush toured a bendix defense plant where fuel systems are made 
for fighter planes and was shown a replica of the carburetor used 
in the world war ii fighter plane he had flown in the navy 
this plant keeps the muscle of our defense strong bush told 
a group of plant employees he suggested that dukakis favors 
unilateral cuts in the muscle of the defense of the united 
states 
the vice president earlier told a 500aticket fundraiser 
that while he didnt want anything to do with tearing down 
dukakis we should not gamble americas future on another liberal 
governor coming out of nowhere that was a reference to former 
president carter 
later bush repeated his theme in a speech to an american legion 
post at fort campbell ky 
if he doesnt want to modernize his snowblower thats his 
concern bush said referring to the 25yearold snowblower that 
dukakis keeps at home as a sign of his frugality but if he 
doesnt modernize our weapons systems that puts the national 
security of the united states in considerable risk 
and he said he had no response none to a new attack by 
dukakis accusing him of being a hypocrite who sat idly by during 
the irancontra scandal 
in his north carolina appearance the vice president also warned 
against complacency in dealing with the soviets despite recent 
moves by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev toward improved relations 
with the united states 
we cannot adopt a naive hope that just because mr gorbachev 
looks different and talks different that there are fundamental 
changes because there arent he told the fundraiser 
and in his speech at the bendix plant bush said im glad 
there is change in the soviet union but we better not let our 
guard down 
the republican nominee speaking at a rally at north carolina 
wesleyan college later in the day praised his running mate 
indiana sen dan quayle who has come under close media scrutiny 
over allegations that he and his wealthy family pulled strings to 
get him into the national guard at the height of the vietnam war 
im proud of my running mate bush told several thousand 
students its nice to have a running mate going in the same 
general direction as i am well do just fine 
at the outdoor campus rally bush was flanked by stock car 
driver cale yarborough a resident of south carolina and 
conservative north carolina sen jesse helms all states will be 
in safe hands with george bush as president helms said 
bush meanwhile shed little light on the subject of 
presidential debates a touchy topic being negotiated in 
washington asked whether he would commit himself to more than two 
debates bush said there will be debates 
he also suggested that too many debates would be boring to 
voters 
the fundraising brunch earlier in the day was held at the home 
of jack laughery president of imasco usa which owns the 
hardees fastfood chain 
speaking to about 150 people outside the house on a dreary 
rainy day bush conceded that democrats held a solid voter 
registration edge in north carolina 
youre talking to a guy who knows you cant win if youre 
outnumbered you need 51 percent bush said 
the vice president said he was encouraged by recent polling 
things showing him to be leading dukakis 
thats turned around now after our upbeat republican 
convention bush said 
i think i am more clearly spelling out why i want to be 
president bush said

a federal appeals court tuesday overturned 
the nineyear sentence and most of the criminal convictions of 
former guam gov ricardo bordallo who allegedly exchanged 
political favors for payoffs 
in a 30 decision the 9th us circuit court of appeals said 
four briberyrelated convictions had to be reversed because the 
federal crime of bribery applies only to state officials and guam 
is a territory not a state 
the court also reversed four extortionrelated convictions 
because the jury was not told that it must find bordallo demanded 
or otherwise induced the payoffs totaling 79600 in cash 
the court ruled recently in another guam case that extortion 
does not cover payments that an official accepted without either a 
request or an understanding that the donor would get benefits in 
exchange the ruling if it stands would entitle bordallo to a 
retrial on those charges 
the court upheld bordallos two other convictions tampering 
with a witness for asking a supporter to lie to the grand jury 
and a related charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice 
but according to bordallos lawyer the entire nineyear prison 
sentence was for the extortion convictions he was given suspended 
sentences on the other charges 
bordallo a democrat elected in 1982 was indicted a few days 
before the 1986 democratic primary he won the primary but was 
defeated in november 1986 by republican joseph ada he has been 
free on bail during his appeal 
prosecutors said bordallo approved government contracts and 
permits for various firms in exchange for payments mostly 
delivered to him in unmarked envelopes 
the money was described by the donors as campaign contributions 
or gifts but never was reported by bordallo in his campaign 
statements authorities said he also was accused of approving a 
103000 government contract for a company that agreed to hire his 
campaign manager

up they were turned away 
city officials said the whites never should have been told they 
could take the test

were on the list all the blacks who passed the exam already have 
entered the academy or are scheduled to enter this fall

gov george deukmejian on tuesday 
vetoed a bill to make the banana slug the state mollusk leaving a 
troop of blue birds singing the blues 
deukmejian explained in his veto message that the slug isnt 
californian enough and that its reputation just doesnt fit with 
californias image 
but members of the redwood city blue birds say the governors 
grasp of mollusk lore is a bit slippery 
deukmejian said the species was first identified in oregon and 
ranges as far north as alaska so its not a trueblue californian 
besides the yellowish mollusk has an image that isnt befitting 
the golden state he said he suggested that native california 
fauna such as the pismo clam the black abalone the red abalone or 
the turban shell would make a better choice 
if there is a need to designate a state mollusk it would be 
more appropriate to select one that is indigenous to california and 
perhaps one that is more representative of the international 
reputation that california enjoys deukmejian said 
the blue birds who sponsored the campaign and the bills author 
said the governor was all wet 
four of five types of banana slug are native to california said 
janice hopcraft an aide to assemblyman bryon sher hopcraft and 
her coworkers wore yellow armbands tuesday to mark the bills 
demise 
i think basically the banana slug has gotten a bad rap she 
said theyre obviously easy to look down upon and they do have 
some odd habits perhaps the governor looked too much at that and 
not their good side 
as far as its representative qualities its absolutely a 
unique example of the diversity of californias wildlife 
yeah he didnt know all the facts said 9yearold susanna 
farley whose blue bird troop worked six weeks on the bill 
i feel really bad that he vetoed it said her friend grace 
moses also 9 i mean why did he have to do that he didnt know 
anything about it i hope he watched the news about it 
hopcraft said the veto is a disappointing end for the bills 
young supporters 
i think this is basically the ultimate lesson for the dynamite 
blue birds and camp fire kids that not all things have a happy 
ending 
gubernatorial vetoes can be overturned by twothirds majorities 
in the assembly and senate but assembly republicans have vowed to 
block any attempts to override deukmejians vetoes

fifteen blind workers who make military 
equipment for the government at a workshop for the blind have 
struck the facility demanding that they receive the same pay as 
their sighted coworkers 
the employees walked off the job last week at the southwest 
lighthouse for the blind after they were told they would have to 
pay 65 a month for health insurance 
the strikers are asking that all blind workers be given the 
335anhour minimum wage earned by sighted employees instead of 
the present 205 wage they also want companypaid health 
insurance 
i think its about time for some changes to be made said 
teresa wiggins 28 as she walked a picket line outside the 
lighthouse ive been here since 1984 and theres hardly anything 
here for the blind we need better opportunities 
the 15 strikers among 49 employees also want assurances that 
their jobs and pay wont be affected by the walkout 
ms wiggins grosses 320 a month an amount supplemented by a 
small social security check but her rent alone is 320 a month and 
she has a guide dog for whom she must pay 
some of the workers also pay 20 a month for transportation 
in the lighthouse van said william harmon a former workshop 
employee and president of the lubbock chapter of the national 
federation of the blind they would be losing 85 a month out of 
a 320amonth income with the health insurance requirement 
dick edlund of the kansas city kan office of the national 
federation of the blind told the lubbock avalanchejournal that 
under federal law blind workers can be paid only 25 percent of 
wages paid to sighted workers 
the lighthouse which provides jobs for blind people is under 
federal contract to produce military helmet pads and chin straps 
the facilitys director dale odom declined to comment on the 
walkout or whether the strike would affect the lighthouses ability 
to fulfill the military contract 
the strikers also have been circulating union cards from the 
teamsters union in hopes of gaining enough support to hold an 
organizing election

the state agency that has taken over 
yonkers finances warned four defiant councilmen tuesday that 
unless the us supreme court takes their side they will be hit 
with criminal charges 
the councilmen who have stalled a federal judges order to act 
on a housing desegregation plan have appealed both the judges 
ruling and asked for a stay of their fines until a decision comes 
from the us supreme court 
the councilmen who personally may have to pay contemptofcourt 
fines of up to 500 a day and the city whose fines could go up to 
1 million daily applied for stays to supreme court justice 
thurgood marshall who often handles such appeals from the 
northeast but a court spokesman said tuesday afternoon the five 
applications were turned over to the full court the spokesman who 
asked not to be named said he could give no indication when the 
court might rule 
for the third time since the contempt finding the city council 
at its regular meeting tuesday night refused to endorse the 
desegregation plan which would approve incentives for 800 units of 
moderateincome housing throughout the city 
in a packed council chamber mayor nicholas wasicsko asked if 
any of the councilmen wanted to change their vote but none of them 
did the mayor is required by the contempt ruling to have a weekly 
vote on the desegregation plan 
us district judge leonard sand who in 1985 found the city 
liable for segregating schools and housing for 40 years held the 
city in contempt aug 2 for failing to approve the housing plan 
sand imposed fines against the city that began at 100 a day and 
doubled daily the fines were later stayed by a federal appeals 
court 
besides the personal fines on the four councilmen sand also 
threatened them with jail 
on friday a federal appeals panel upheld the contempt finding 
but gave yonkers a week to take the case to the supreme court 
before reinstating the penalties the panel also capped any daily 
fine at 1 million 
the fines are slated to go back into effect friday the jailing 
of the councilmen would come sunday 
meanwhile the rev jesse jackson said in new york city tuesday 
that even if the housing dispute in yonkers is not a result of 
racial discrimination the citys resistance to the law is 
unhealthy 
we must be as intolerant of a class rejection because 
someone is poor as we would be of racial or religious bigotry 
jackson said 
after a meeting with black leaders in westchester county 
jackson said he would be willing to meet with the four councilmen 
three of the four responded they would be happy to meet with 
jackson while the fourth said have him call me 
at a meeting tuesday of the yonkers emergency financial control 
board its chairwoman said she will notify the district attorney 
that the four councilmen are breaking the law the state watchdog 
agency was already in place because of money problems the city had 
several years ago 
its the city councilmen who are defying the law and putting 
the citys financial profile at risk who are putting all the 
citizens of yonkers at risk said gail shaffer the chairwoman 
shaffer labeled the recalcitrant lawmakers reprehensible for 
jeopardizing the city financially 
criminal charges should give them pause shaffer said of the 
four henry spallone nicholas longo edward fagan and peter chema 
shaffers remarks came a day after gov mario cuomo said he 
would initiate removal proceedings and urge the jailing of the 
councilmen if the supreme court refused the stay 
the financial control board asked city manager neil deluca to 
prepare a detailed phaseout plan by thursday for the gradual 
elimination of city services

if voters approve pinochet 72 his term will run until 1997 if 
the voters reject him open elections are to be held in 1990 and 
pinochet will remain president until then 
this is a decisive moment in the institutional process begun 
sept 11 1973 pinochet said in his acceptance speech 
pinochet led the bloody coup in september 1973 that ousted the 
government of marxist president salvador allende who died in the 
palace takeover pinochet has been president of the military 
government since then 
pinochet was nominated by himself navy chief adm jose merino 
air force leader gen fernando matthei and national police director 
gen rodolfo stange in a onehour 45minute nomination session in 
the defense ministry 
pinochet later appeared on a balcony of the government palace 
and addressed about 10000 cheering supporters 
he said his years of rule have been dedicated to forging a 
chilean society in which a new type of democracy with tough 
safeguards against communism will be established 
the full democracy that approaches constitutes a new challenge 
for everyone he said it also will demand of us all 
overcoming adapting and rectifying to create a new style of 
political coexistence he said 
pinochet is backed by his army which is by far the most 
powerful military service and has campaigned for months for 
popular support 
opposition politicians immediately denounced the selection 
the nomination of gen pinochet with his own vote as 
candidate to succeed himself is the best denial of the supposed 
democratic intentions of the regime the centrist democratic 
party said in a written statement 
pinochets nomination was announced by air force gen enrique 
montero secretary for the nominating session 
he said the commanders designated pinochet as the person who 
pending citizen ratification occupies the position of president of 
the republic for the eightyear presidential period beginning 
march 11 1989 
there were antigovernment demonstrations in downtown santiago 
and also in conception and osorno in the south and and in the 
centrl port city of valparaiso 
more than a thousand youths marched through downtown santiago

but the protesters regrouped and continued their marches during the 
afternoon 
some of the demonstrators carried pictures of leftists who 
disappeared after being arrested by security agents beneath the 
pictures were the words where are they

even drastic cutbacks in the release of the 
chemicals blamed for causing the global greenhouse effect are 
unlikely to halt the heating of the planet according to a new 
climate analysis 
the greenhouse effect has been widely discussed recently 
although most meteorologists contend that it is too early to 
determine if it is responsible for the current drought and hot 
weather affecting much of the nation the effect occurs when carbon 
dioxide largely from burning fossil fuels and other gases 
increase in the atmosphere these gases let incoming heat from the 
sun reach the earth but they reflect outgoing heat keeping it from 
traveling back into space that traps heat much like a greenhouse 
traps heat indoors 
james hansen of the national aeronautics and space 
administration the lead author of the new study told a 
congressional subcommittee earlier in the summer that the current 
hot dry conditions are an example of things to come

religious ethicists say the central moral 
question about sen dan quayles conduct as a young man during the 
vietnam war period is whether his actions squared with his attitude 
some see inconsistency between his stated support for the war at 
that time while virtually assuring he wouldnt be involved in it 
by joining the national guard when he faced being drafted 
several theologians said in interviews that quayle as a youth 
may not have understood the implications then and that motivations 
are nebulous but his course appears equivocal on the surface 
the case was termed due for analysis in some ethics courses this 
fall 
it borders on hypocrisy and its certainly not heroic but 
none of us fully takes the consequences of his or her beliefs all 
the time said the rev roger shinn of new yorks union 
theological seminary 
there comes a time when the chips are down that youve got to 
live up to your convictions and take the costs but you cant get 
involved in every fight that comes along even if you believe in 
it you muddle through sit one out 
shinn a teacher of christian ethics for a quarter century 
counseled troubled students during the vietnam war he noted some 
opposed it paying for it by going to jail while some supported it 
and died in vietnam 
either way they paid the costs he said thats what real 
integrity is whether you agree with a person or not acting with 
integrity means taking a stand and willingness to suffer for it 
quayle says he entered the national guard so as to go to law 
school i did not join to avoid service in vietnam he says he 
says he supported the goals of fighting communism in vietnam 
and disliked the nowin policy aspect 
ethicists say the issue was not his entering the guard which 
many war opponents did to avoid the draft and not mainly whether 
he used family influence to do it but whether he practiced what he 
preached 
if you believe one way you have to act consistently with it 
or your ethical stance collapses said catholic psychologist 
eugene kennedy of loyola university in chicago 
th rev paul simmons who teaches christian ethics at southern 
baptist theological seminary in louisville ky said if quayle was 
really honest about it he would come clean that he was dodging 
the draft 
the real issue is one of honesty and straightforwardness if 
he supported vietnam and then tried to get out of it it was 
hypocritical to the core it was not a matter of conscience but of 
expediency 
moral philosopher peter simpson of the catholic university of 
america in washington said quayles course raises a small 
question mark about his integrity 
but its relatively minor simon said its not worth all 
the hullabaloo i have doubts about how strong his convictions were 
on vietnam maybe he should have sought to go there and help the 
cause 
but he chose not to for reasons we dont fully understand you 
cant judge guilt from the outside but should give a person the 
benefit of the doubt young men make mistakes were all entitled 
to be wrong sometimes 
he may now regret it 
catholic moral theologian germain grisez of st marys college 
in emmitsburg md said it is not clearly inconsistent for people 
to favor fighting a war but not particularly want to be in it 
themselves 
very often people want their dirty work done but dont want 
to do it themselves im not sure its wrong and not sure its all 
right either its a question of fairness of being unfair to other 
people by shirking 
its clearly not heroic character but that does not mean its 
immoral 
rabbi alexander schindler an ethical scholar and president of 
the union of american hebrew congregations said there seems to 
be quite a distance between what quayle professes and what he 
does 
obviously one should not proclaim what he fails to do if his 
words belie his deeds he becomes a hypocrite actions should come 
close to ideals yet nobodys actions reflect the ideal totally 
everybody fails it sometimes 
the rev james t burtchaell of the university of notre dame 
said people may see quayles strong view of the war as in 
conflict with his public action i dont think hes profound 
enough to be hypocritical 
episcopal moral theologian harmon smith of duke university said 
the meaning of actions and statements always have to be 
interpreted i dont know how to say his are consistent but i 
reckon that he does 
typically there is more than one way to look at it

diekmann 80 a benedictine authority on liturgy who helped

says the failure of the church to ordain women was based on custom 
not tradition 
referring to arguments that priests must image a male 
christ he told a symposium our consistent and really authentic 
tradition about imaging christ finds that image first of all not 
in bodily similarity but in spiritual affinity 
diekmann who teaches patristics writings of the early church

dynasty isnt exactly turning into a bastion 
of high morality but its new producer promises more meaningful 
relationships than affairs this season and more ginger ale than 
ginandtonics 
david paulsen named executive producer of the show as it begins 
its ninth season said hes betting that more realism more action 
and some new characters will attract more viewers even as the 
characters clean up their acts 
i dont think people will be popping in and out of every 
bed he said in the age of herpes and aids its irresponsible 
to have flagrant bed hopping and i dont think we ought to do it 
he promised that men and women would develop less ephemeral 
relationships and there would be less smoking and drinking on 
dynasty 
were going to cut that down because i just dont think its 
healthy paulsen said although he cautioned that any one show 
should not be used as a barometer of societal changes 
paulsen who was in new york auditioning actors and actresses 
for the show is no stranger to glamorous primetime soaps he 
spent five years writing or directing more than 50 episodes of 
dallas he also was supervising producer of knots landing 
for one year 
dynasty finished the 198788 television season ranked 37th 
out of 85 regularly scheduled series 
although he is planning some new wrinkles for dynasty 
paulsen said some of the strengths of the past will be revived 
well see the character of blake carrington be a driving 
force again the character was allowed to weaken he said 
blake will lead the charge of men with stronger 
personalities he said the women have always been the stronger 
force he added 
also there will be more action in the episodes and he said 
were going to tell a faster story 
one of the new characters will be a young detective a street 
guy somewhere between serpico and colombo he said 
and although there will be plenty of elegant clothing diamonds 
and fancy place settings there will be more people from other 
walks of life people who even live without air conditioning 
paulsen said 
thus viewers will see more of what it is like when the rich 
encounter the poor experiences projected from the typewriters of 
three new writers two of whom were reporters until this year he 
said 
the changes in the show are aimed at higher ratings but he said 
the effort to clean up the lifestyles of his characters came from 
his desire to reflect changing values in america and he insists 
that television shows can affect the way viewers live 
he recalled that once in a scene of a television sitcom a 
character in a car made passing mention of fastening seatbelts 
for four or five days afterward police departments noticed a 
distinct drop in fatalities and serious injuries he said it 
was a very humbling experience that showed that although were not 
out to preach there are subtle things you can do

lying on the floor in his north london apartment 
jonathan speelman shook his head smiled and parried the 
suggestion he might become the wests first chess millionaire 
on aug 23 the 31yearold grandmaster became the first player 
to reach the semifinals of the world chess championship which puts 
him only two victories away from a 1990 title match with the 
reigning world champion garri kasparov of the soviet union 
he will not know his semifinals opponent until the three 
remaining quarterfinals matches are played in january 
no british player has ever reached such an advanced stage of 
this competition ten years ago britain had no chess grandmasters 
and chess was far from a bigmoney competition 
but corporate sponsors and paying spectators have put top 
players in the financial big leagues 
the loser of the 1990 world championship duel will be guaranteed 
threeeighths of the expected 2 million prize fund the 1987 world 
faceoff between kasparov and anatoly karpov in seville spain had 
a winners pot totaling 185 million 
as an added incentive the west german computer company mephisto 
will give 1 million swiss francs 637000 to the first westerner 
to challenge kasparov 
but the 6foot 3inches tall speelman said in an interview that 
money is not my major consideration 
for speelman chess is an intellectual pursuit and he remains 
determined not to own a car or television 
his 3to1 victory in the quarterfinals over fellow briton 
nigel short 23 the worlds third ranked player and prematch 
favorite netted speelman a 21250 prize his biggest ever 
but critics fear his disarmingly peaceful disposition and 
noncompetitive approach arent winning ingredients 
hes got to become less modest said jonathan tisdall an 
american international master who lives in norway and served as an 
adviser to speelman in the quarterfinals 
speelman admits feeling sorry for his opponents 
of course i always want to win but i dont want my opponent 
to lose he said 
in contrast to short who left school at 16 and once played in a 
rockgroup called the urge or the flamboyant kasparov who 
employs a western business manager speelman appears as the 
stereotype intellectual chess player 
bearded and bespectacled he studied mathematics at oxford 
university and after earning his grandmaster title in 1980 took a 
years break from the game to learn russian 
speelman writes poetry and enjoys word games competing in 
canada this year he was delighted when a friend in london sent him 
the times of london crossword by facsimile 
he has also been involved in political battles 
in may 1986 he took part in a demonstration outside londons 
prince edward theater on the opening night of the musical chess 
to lend support to boris gulko a leading soviet grandmaster in 
his campaign to gain exit visas to israel for his family 
gulko who once went on a 40day hunger strike received his 
emigration papers several months later and now lives in boston 
last year speelman jointly hosted a simultaneous chess 
exhibition to raise money for medical supplies for nicaraguas 
sandinista government 
speelman has spent up to six months a year abroad and his 
knowledge of russian has helped build friendships 
international master bob wade of britain said speelmans 
creativity makes him the most difficult of opponents to predict 
he first learned the chess moves at age 6 at 13 he won the 
british under14 championship and since then his career has been 
marked by a gradual but consistent improvement 
in 1986 in dubai on the persian gulf he was ranked fifth among 
britains grandmasters and played for the england team that won the 
silver medal in the biennial chess olympiad 
in the last two years however speelman said a a quantum 
jump took him to fifth ranked player in the world he said he 
doesnt know what happened he just got better 
chess is basically scientific but there is also a strong 
psychological and artistic side he said because its so 
intense you can reach parts of yourself which you wouldnt very 
often a higher state of mind perhaps 
on his way to meet short speelman overwhelmed the top us 
player yasser seirawan by a score of 41 in a sixgame match

on his visit to this kingdom 
surrounded by south africa pope john paul ii will come here to a 
sacred mountain where a french missionary helped native people 
threatened by white men more than 100 years ago 
later on during his stop in lesotho on his fivenation tour of 
southern africa sept 1019 the pontiff will beatify the roman 
catholic missionary the rev joseph gerard 
at thaba bosiu on sept 14 the pontiff will meet king 
moshoeshoe ii on the same spot where king moshoeshoe i in 1862 
first welcomed christian missionaries to his land torn by internal 
violence and threatened by the surrounding white boers the 
settlers of what today is south africa 
gerard was one of the missionaries who traveled through the 
mountains on horseback wrapped in wool blankets as the basotho the 
people of lesotho still do 
gerard climbed the rocky natural fortress of thaba bosiu 
the mountain of the night in the local language several times 
during the 186568 conflict with the white boers sneaking past 
them to bring food and encouragement to the thousands of basotho 
crowded onto the top of the 600foothigh plateau 
the missionaries persuaded moshoeshoe i to seek protection from 
britains queen victoria as a result basutoland as the area was 
called became a british protectorate and was saved from annexation 
into what was later to become south africa 
basutoland became independent lesotho in 1966 
the 12134squaremile kingdom about half the size of west 
virginia has almost no industry only onethird of its land is 
arable and it relies heavily on the earnings of 140000 basotho 
men who work in south africa which is not on the popes itinerary 
the pope will beatify gerard during a mass at a racetrack near 
here on sept 15 before departing next day for swaziland 
the pontiff will not go to the summit of thaba bosiu the royal 
burial ground where residents say a large dune of fine red sand 
at the summit contains the spirit of the first king and like him 
never leaves the mountaintop when the dune approaches the edge 
upward drafts of wind blow it back 
king moshoeshoe i discovered the mountain refuge in 1824 and 
gathered feuding destitute and some cannibalistic tribes together 
to found the basotho nation he welcomed the missionaries and 
spent his last years trying to choose whether to become a catholic 
or a protestant when he died without making a decision gerard 
wrote i have never felt such great sorrow in my life 
the present king is catholic as are 70000 other basotho 
ninety percent of the population of 1443853 are christian the 
rest are animists 
gerard died in 1914 after working for 52 years among the 
basotho establishing schools a hospital and a church supervising 
the printing of books in the sesotho language and converting 
basotho to catholicism 
his mission at roma is now run by a french canadian the rev 
gilles jalbert who gave up horseback riding a few years ago he 
supervised construction of a chapel over gerards grave chopped 
down trees and prepared rest quarters for the popes entourage he 
hopes electricity will reach roma by the time the pope does so the 
mass at the nearby sports ground can be amplified 
the pope will visit gerards grave from which local people have 
been taking dirt for decades to sprinkle on their crops homes and 
children to bring good fortune 
gerard is being beatified the first step toward sainthood 
because of the healing of a 6yearold blind girl in 1928 14 years 
after his death doctors couldnt cure florina phakela so a priest 
at the roma mission had a bag of soil from gerards grave tied 
around her neck and told her mother to pray for nine days 
the girl who died in 1982 told vatican investigators she was 
visited in the night by a priest who told her she was cured when 
she woke in the morning her sight restored she went to the 
mission to thank the priest but couldnt find him 
she identified a picture of gerard as the one who had visited 
her

human rights leaders and jews are 
hailing a new law that imposes fines or jail sentences on anyone 
convicted of discrimination based on race religion or sex 
they call it a significant advance in the protection of civil 
liberties in argentina 
we think the law has extraordinary social and political 
significance for argentine society said david goldberg 
president of the delegation of argentine israelite associations 
there was a gap in previous legislation in that there was no 
penalty for those who did discriminate said goldberg a medical 
doctor whose organization is the largest of several that represent 
the estimated 400000 jews in this south american country 
simon lazara a socialist congressman and a leader of the 
permanent assembly for human rights said the law is not solely 
aimed at antisemitism but also at discrimination based on color 
or creed or against the native indian communities 
the legislation was introduced early in 1984 by president raul 
alfonsin who cofounded and ran the permanent assembly for human 
rights before he was elected to office in october 1983 his 
inauguration seven weeks later ended a harsh nearly eightyear 
military dictatorship 
as reworked and finally approved by congress in august the new 
law penalizes anyone who arbitrarily blocks obstructs or 
restricts the full exercise of fundamental rights and 
guarantees 
argentinas constitution of 1853 as amended protects the right 
to assembly universal suffrage and freedom of speech and worship 
although roman catholicism is the countrys official religion and 
only catholics can hold the nations presidency and vice presidency 
the law punishes by jail up to three years anyone convicted of 
belonging to an organization that promotes the superiority of one 
race or color or creed over another 
anyone convicted of a crime or offense committed in 
persecution or hatred of a race religion or nationality or with 
the intent to destroy a national ethnic racial or religious 
group could be sentenced to additional fines or prison 
the law also requires restitution in cases of property damage 
overall the new law constitutes a vision of the new democracy 
in argentina reflecting the conditions that have existed since the 
end of the last military dictatorship lazara said 
argentinas centuryold tradition of democracy has been 
tarnished by six military interventions since 1930 including coups 
that ousted gen juan d peron in 1955 two civilian presidents in 
the 1960s and perons wife isabel in 1976 
more than 9000 argentines most of them sons and daughters of 
the middle class disappeared and are presumed dead following 
their arrests in the late 1970s by security forces trying to crush 
the montonero urban guerrillas and leftist political opposition in 
general 
discrimination usually is not overt but it is pervasive darker 
skinned argentines of indian descent while not barred from 
whitecollar jobs more commonly are manual laborers very few jews 
are in the army women are paid less than men for doing the same 
job 
antisemitism in recent years has been reflected by the knocking 
over of jewish tombstones in cemeteries the painting of 
antisemitic graffitti on walls and very infrequently but always 
intimidating the setting off of small bombs in the doorways of 
synagogues 
we dont have a very serious problem of discrimination based 
on religion or race but there is in the background among certain 
sectors some antisemitism said jose ignacio lopez alfonsins 
press secretary 
angel grushka leader of the leftist federation of jewish 
cultural entities said the new law is helpful but he added tha 
the wished the acts of discrimination that would invoke the 
penalties were more precisely spelled out 
we still have to work very hard on the judicial level to make 
sure that antisemitic actions are punished grushka said 
antidiscrimination legislation in argentine law dates to 1949 
in 1964 similar legislation that penalized those convicted of 
discrimination was implemented but that legislation was revoked by 
the military government that came to power two years later

an internationally renowned roman 
catholic scholar the rev godfrey diekmann says the church should 
admit women to ordination as priests 
diekmann 80 a benedictine authority on liturgy who helped 
draft the worship reforms of the 196265 second vatican council 
says the failure of the church to ordain women was based on custom 
not tradition 
referring to arguments that priests must image a male 
christ he told a symposium our consistent and really authentic 
tradition about imaging christ finds that image first of all not 
in bodily similarity but in spiritual affinity 
diekmann who teaches patristics writings of the early church 
fathers at st johns university cited past ordination of women 
as deaconesses to perform liturgical functions and said 
pastoral experience in fact desperate liturgical needs 
similarly cry out for women priests today

in the year since he lost his legs trying 
to block a trainload of munitions s brian willson has become a 
symbol of inspiration in the movement for peace in central america 
hundreds have been stirred to maintain roundtheclock protests 
at the concord naval weapons station since last sept 1 the day 
the slowmoving navy train under orders not to stop rolled over 
willson as he sat on the tracks the demonstrators surrounded by 
picket signs sleeping bags and american flags stand by as trains 
and trucks carry weapons across port chicago highway which cuts 
through the base 
because of what i chose to do and what the navy chose to do 
im a symbol and that can be used for good i think willson 47 
said this week in an interview at the san franciscobased institute 
for the practice of nonviolence which he founded with his wife 
holly rauen 
the softspoken willson a vietnam veteran born on the fourth of 
july and raised in a conservative politically inactive family in 
ashville ny said hes more convinced than ever of the need to 
campaign for peace and a halt to weapons shipments to central 
american nations 
i dont think it was a mistake and i dont regret what i did 
im sorry the train ran over me and that i lost my legs its a 
drag he said i feel more liberated than ever to speak the 
truth so i dont have any desire or wish to back off he said 
in the past year willson has spoken across the country at the 
scene of the accident 40 miles east of san francisco 
demonstrations prayers rallies and civil disobedience still 
elicit headlines thanks to highprofile protesters such as the 
rev jesse jackson joan baez martin sheen author alice walker 
and peace activist daniel ellsberg 
an ecumenical service will be held at the weapons station 
thursday to mark the anniversary of willsons maiming 
it will be the first time since june 10 that willson has visited 
the spot where he inspires protesters but riles many of the 450 
people in the adjacent town of clyde who have grown weary of the 
sight and sound of demonstrators on their doorstep 
when demonstrators posted a handmade sign reading brian 
made to look like the town sign of clyde across the road from 
the base gates residents were outraged the sign came down after a 
session with a county mediator 
don elam is typical of most townspeople today he complains the 
protest site is an eyesore and demonstrators are leftwing 
radicals who sympathize with communist governments 
the protesters meet with a wide range of responses earlier this 
week 19yearold spaulding brook of vermont was leaning on the 
base fence near a sign reading wage peace when a man drove 
past blared boo through a megaphone and gestured obscenely a 
carload of men yelled go home others driving by flash peace 
signs 
the county has spent about 335000 for patrols of contra costa 
sheriffs deputies who have arrested some 325 people since last 
sept 1 according to sgt doug sizemore 
tired of the marathon protest and concerned about safe 
transportation of explosives across a 200foot intersection the 
navy wants to build a 10 million overpass to takes vehicles over 
the highway said base spokesman dan tikalsky 
while the navy seeks funding from the defense department others 
have turned to the courts 
county prosecutors have failed to convict any protesters 
willson has sued the navy and the crew of the train that refused to 
stop and the crew has countersued 
the northern california chapter of the american civil liberties 
union sued to stop use of a painful choke hold on protesters being 
arrested a federal court rejected a county request for permission 
to remove protesters tables chairs and picket signs from the edge 
of the highway 
so the demonstrators remain suffering occasional attacks with 
eggs bottles and obscenities 
chuck goodmacher of the mount diablo peace center in nearby 
walnut creek which helps coordinate the protests says the local 
antagonism is ironic because in 1986 voters only narrowly 
rejected a measure urging the government to halt arms shipments 
through the county until there was a regional peace settlement in 
central america 
sandy hillard is one of the few locals who have joined the 
protests her car has been painted with swastikas pelted with eggs 
and had its tires flattened 
i wish they protest opponents could get to know us better 
before making a judgment hillard said its unfortunate to 
live in a community with fears of getting your house burned down

how many times have the rumors 
spread through some nightspot bob dylans supposed to show up 
this time its no rumor dylan is due here soon for a very rare 
interview 
the site of this event is il cielo a lovely italian restaurant 
the violin music is soothing but it doesnt block out memories 
of dont look back the 1967 documentary that included dylans 
razortongued evisceration of a hapless magazine reporter or the 
more recent snippet in the rolling stone 20th anniversary tv 
special that showed dylan bitterly complaining about fans who dare 
to approach him because his songs have touched them that has 
nothin to do with me he griped 
dylan doesnt make an entrance he materializes slipping in 
through a back entrance he is polite subdued nervous about doing 
an interview after settling in a chair he checks all around him 
like a skittish colt suddenly released into an unfamiliar corral 
he puts the ubiquitous sunglasses on the table quietly 
dismisses mineral water accepts white wine asks will it bother 
you if i smoke invited to go ahead he takes out a pack of 
salems he says he quits occasionally he sits forward and answers 
questions earnestly looking directly at the interviewer with his 
big blue eyes 
dylan looks fit at 47 and he isnt slowing down hes on his 
third tour in as many years just released down in the groove 
his seventh lp in eight years and is already thinking of another 
for next year when he also hopes to tour the soviet union hes 
also planning to launch a movie and tv production company 
he has just completed three highenergy sellout performances 
at los angeles greek theatre since going on the road in june 
dylan is proving that far from being over the hill hes at the 
top of his form 
the tour has drawn critical raves and has been extended at least 
through oct 1619 when hell do a fournight stand at new yorks 
radio city music hall his first performance at the legendary 
theater 
backed by a tight threepiece rock band led by guitarist ge 
smith of saturday night live renown dylan has rejuvenated his 
classic material resurrecting such timeless gems as boots of 
spanish leather times they are achangin and masters of 
war 
when im singin my songs it never occurs to me that i wrote 
them dylan says 
if i didnt have a song like masters of war id find a song 
like masters of war to sing same thing with times they are 
achangin if i didnt have a song like that id go out and look 
around and id search around until i found one like that you 
know 
theres a line in masters of war about being afraid to bring 
children into the world dylan now divorced has five 
i dont sing that line he jokes i love children i was 
always taught that if you were blessed to have them you just had 
more of them theyre protection from the world 
his eldest daughter just married suggesting a possible new 
phase in his life the rebel voice of the 1960s is after all 
nearing 50 
i wouldnt mind being a grandfather or a greatgrandfather 
for that matter he says but i dont know if that has anything 
to do with age i know people in their 30s who are grandparents i 
dont know how old i am i mean people tell me how old i am but i 
have no way of knowing if theyre tellin me the truth or not 
when his children were young he moved them from new york to 
malibu calif to protect them from the effects of fame and so 
they could grow up in a little more country environment at least 
hear the birds singing 
theres just something instinctive that tells me that a man 
must support his family no matter what as it is im doing what i 
do because ive been given to do it he says 
but most of the people who work 9 to 5 have got to support 
families and theres a tremendous disregard for that you dont 
see much of that being heralded with heroic words and fancy awards 
but thats what makes the world either rise or fall that 
commitment to family 
the lead song on down in the groove the wilbert harrison 
blues song lets stick together echoes that sentiment it 
might be tough for a while you might consider the child cannot be 
happy without his mom and his pappy lets stick together 
the album surprised some critics because it is mostly covers of 
other composers songs there are only two dylan originals plus 
two collaborations with grateful dead songwriter robert hunter 
including the single silvio 
dylan said he picked the other material because he liked it 
down in the groove establishes dylan as a recording artist with 
the strength of style to transcend the source of the material 
theres no rule that claims that anyone must write their own 
songs he says and i do i write a lot of songs but so what 
you know you could take another song somebody else has written and 
you can make it yours im not saying i made a definitive version 
of anything with this last record but i liked the songs every so 
often youve gotta sing songs thatre out there you just have to 
just to keep yourself straight 
the other reason for the others is inevitable he didnt have 
enough material of his own for an album 
writing is like such an isolated thing youre in such an 
isolated frame of mind he says you have to get into or be in 
that place in the old days i could get to it real quick i cant 
get to it like that no more its not that simple 
i mean just being able to shut yourself off for long periods 
of time where youre so isolated no one can get to you mentally 
or physically you know you need to be able to do that in order to 
come up with that kind of stuff 
youre always capable of it in your youth and especially if 
youre an unknown and nobody cares like if youre an anonymous 
person but once that all ends then you have to create not only 
what you want to do but you have to create the environment to do 
it in which is doublehard

i dont write about things he says i write from inside 
of something and i sing and play the same way its never about 
that something hoping to touch it its rather from the inside 
of it reaching out 
dylan said he does have five or six songs for a new album and 
hes part of an incognito group the willburys that includes 
george harrison roy orbison and tom petty and has an album coming 
out later this year 
in the past few years hes concentrated on touring with the 
grateful dead tom petty and the heartbreakers now with this 
pareddown band that has dylan alone out front most of the time 
performing selections from the vast catalog of an almost 30year 
career nobody would blame him for just putting his feet up for a 
while 
i really dont have anyplace to put my feet up he laughs 
well we want to play cause we want to play why tour its 
just that you get accustomed to it over the years the people 
themselves will tell you when to stop touring 
this tour has brought dylan the critical praise that seems 
tougher for him to come by than it is for other artists he seems 
to be held up to a higher standard because of his own 
biggerthanlife image and that irritates him 
its irritating its real irritating he says its not 
that somebody cant come and not like what youre doing thats ok 
but ive done tours before where people got real personal with 
their reviews in a real early time when we were on the road and 
for some reason all the towns that we were about to play theyd 
like to pick these things up so it was like intentionally telling 
people to stay away 
i dont know i go through a lot of that and then even when 
youre not doing what they say youre doing people expect to see 
that its like when we were playing after being booed in newport 
or something in 1965 he brought an electric band to the folk 
festival i mean for the next six months people want to see that 
same show that got booed and they want to boo too 
he is interrupted does he have a request for the restaurants 
violinist sure he says love me or leave me 
dylans unexpected tastes and perspectives often perplex his 
public though he insists he is not as frequently described 
enigmatic 
i dont know what that word means he protests 
i would like to think that i couldnt be categorized who 
wants to be categorized that happens because of all the stuff i 
do not because of who i am or anything and i dont even know if 
thats a true fact because thats nothing much to concern me you 
cant make it too long on being an enigma 
if his critics cant categorize him they certainly cant accuse 
him of playing it safe he seems to depend on literary and 
spiritual references that keep him constantly searching for new 
influences 
he stunned the public in 1979 when he came out with the 
emotional gospel lp slow train coming the lead song gotta 
serve somebody won him his only grammy an honor he considers 
an accident the album was one of dylans strongest ever and 
went platinum 1 million copies sold 
gospel music is about the love of god and commercial music is 
about the love of sex dylan says 
after following up with saved and shot of love dylan 
who was born jewish seemed to drift away from the christian 
message though themes of redemption tinged infidels and 
empire burlesque 
his current religious leanings are the object of speculation 
religion has nothing to do with faith is all hell say 
publicly on the subject but another of his gospel songs death 
is not the end turned up on down in the groove 
so did the tin pan alley tune when did you leave heaven and 
at a recent concert he delighted the crowd by bursting into im 
in the mood for love 
last year he appeared on a pbs tribute to george gershwin he 
was surprised when the producers invited him to participate i 
said are you sure you sure there might not be another bob 
dylan 
dylan has always been intrigued by gershwins music he says 
cause it sounds like sophisticated city stuff but theres a 
country backwood alley cat element to it that for some reason he 
was able to capture 
there are smells and tastes in those songs for some reason 
and i was used to hearing nina simone sing a lot of george gershwin 
songs a few years back and they were very close to the folk songs 
that i was singing 
folk songs have an honored place in dylans current repertoire 
a purposeful homage to his roots he plays the standards barbara 
allen and golden vanities on stage and included his own 
arrangement of shenandoah on down in the groove 
earlier this year he was inducted into the rock n roll hall 
of fame and played like a rolling stone the anthem of the rock 
generation at the ceremony but folk music is in his heart he 
contributed a cut to the recent lp honoring leadbelly and woody 
guthrie 
born robert zimmerman in minnesota he later legally changed 
his name dylan migrated to new york in part to visit guthrie in 
the hospital he soon became a sensation playing his songs of 
biting social commentary in greenwich village coffee houses but he 
infuriated folk purists when he took up the electric guitar by the 
mid60s ironically dylan is now in a better position than the 
purists to champion folk music in the 80s 
people dont know folk songs anymore he says i mean 
hardly anybody sings them anymore and people think that people who 
play the acoustic guitar and write their own songs are folk 
singers but thats not necessarily true theyre writing their own 
songs but theyre not really based on anything so i thought 
well if im going around again im going to sing folk songs 
because first of all i love em and the lyrics in them are i 
mean theyre incredible stories and thats where i got a lot of 
my stuff from in the early years and still do folk songs are 
still better even though theyre not commercial theyre still 
better than 90 percent of the stuff you hear on the radio 
have you ever seen a shakespeare play i mean its like the 
english language at its peak where one line will come out like a 
stick of dynamite and youll be so whatwasthat but then the 
other stuff is rolling on so fast you cant even think and then 
you have to struggle to catch up to where you are in the present 
and folk songs are pretty much like the same way 
of course nobody writes like shakespeare either he said 
but you know it dont matter those things can still be 
performed they dont have to be written just like folk songs

it takes less kansas wheat to buy a barrel of 
mideast oil this year but dont bet the farm that this will last 
forever or even to the turn of the century 
according to the worldwatch institute about 43 bushels of 
wheat are required to buy a barrel of oil a little more than half 
of the grain that was needed just three years ago 
but over the long haul says institute president lester r 
brown the odds seem certain to favor the oil exporters because 
they are dealing in a nonrenewable commodity compared with wheat 
which can be planted every year 
another surge in oil prices is likely sometime during the 
early 90s brown said when it comes it will throw the terms 
of trade decidedly in favor of oil exporters 
in his view countries that sell grain and import oil should be 
investing in automobile fuel efficiency and seeking alternatives to 
the car and petroleumbased fuel 
for the united states basic policy measures such as the 
imposition of a gasoline tax and the extension of auto 
fuelefficiency standards will help minimize the effect of the next 
major shift in the wheatoil exchange rate brown said 
worldwatch institute which is based in washington is a 
private nonprofit research organization which studies global 
problems often focusing on agriculture and the food supply 
browns comments about wheat and oil were in the current issue of 
world watch magazine 
the economic fortunes of nations rise and fall with shifts in 
the exchange rate between two widely traded commodities grain and 
oil brown said 
grain directly supplies half of the calories the worlds people 
consume and indirectly supplies part of the remainder in the form 
of grainfed meat milk and eggs oil accounts for more than 40 
percent of commercial energy use 
exports of these dominant commodities are concentrated in a 
handful of countries with grain coming mostly from north america 
and oil from the middle east 
the united states which dominates grain exports even more 
than saudi arabia does oil is both the worlds leading grain 
exporter and oil importer brown said and ironically all 13 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec 
are grain importers 
several trends have converged to boost grain prices he said 
millions of acres of us farmland have been abandoned or retired 
under federal programs to protect highly erodible soil worldwide 
the area planted in grain is shrinking at a time when food demands 
are rising 
drought also has been a factor across much of the united states 
this year and in 1987 in the indian subcontinent grain prices 
have risen sharply 
oil prices meanwhile have remained stable despite opec 
attempts to raise them by urging nonmember oil exporting countries 
to also curb production brown said as a result the wheatoil 
exchange rate has been falling somewhat during 1988 
in the near term he said the advantage to grain exporters is 
providing a modest redress for the losses they suffered in the 
volatile oil market of the 70s 
brown said the 1970s upset the remarkably stable rate of 
exchange that had existed between grain and oil during the third 
quarter of the 20th century 
in economic terms anyone with a bushel of wheat during that 
time could exchange it for a barrel of oil in the world market 
he said 
in 1950 brown said wheat was 191 a bushel and oil at 171 a 
barrel meaning that a bushel of wheat could be traded for 11 
barrels of oil in 1972 just a year before the first oil price 
hike a bushel of wheat and a barrel of oil were both worth exactly 
191 
according to browns report the world price of wheat in 1975 
averaged 406 per bushel and oil 1072 per barrel meaning that 
it took 26 bushels of wheat to buy a barrel of oil 
by 1979 the year of the second oil price hike the strength 
of oil had pushed the exchange rate to roughtly 7to1 brown 
said this steep rise in grainpurchasing power oil led to one of 
the greatest international transfers of wealth ever recorded 
brown added the coffers of major oil exporters such as saudi 
arabia began to overflow with dollars as those of many 
oilimporting countries were being emptied 
by 1985 oil had edged to more than 30 a barrel with the world 
price of wheat at 370 per bushel it took 81 bushels to buy a 
barrel of oil 
in 15 years the terms of trade for oilexporting countries 
that import wheat had improved eightfold brown said for 
countries that export grain to pay for oil it was an impoverishing

oil prices dropped by more than half from 1985 to 1986 to 1460

during the early 70s us grain exports easily paid the

failure to wean itself from heavy dependence on this increasingly 
costly commodity contributed to soaring outlays for imports a

this will be an easy quiz 
two television newscasts both inspired by newspapers make 
their debut monday one show is based on usa today the other on 
the christian science monitor one show will cover international 
politics the other will decide how we really feel about our bodies 
made the match 
even before they hit the air its obvious that world monitor 
tv and usa today the television show will take dramatically 
different approaches to television news 
like the paper from which it springs usa today the 
television show will be divided into four segments news money 
sports and life each block will have its own anchor and the 
emphasis throughout will be decidedly soft 
although the news philosophy of world monitor tv is 
clearly more traditional it looks to be the more problematic show 
in an age where entertainment tonight succeeds as journalism 
and tv guide is among the mostread magazines straightforward 
reporting has come to be something of a gamble 
still the makers of world monitor tv are hopeful 
audiences the shows creators suspect may need a hardnews fix 
people now who are addicted to information feel uninformed 
said john hart the former nbc reporter who will serve as world 
monitor tvs anchor i want to know whats true about things 
and i think most people do too if you leave people with a sense 
that the world is made up of unrelated fragments i think you miss 
something its unbalanced 
world monitor tv will be broadcast weeknights at 4 pm and 
10 pm pdt on cable televisions alldocumentary discovery 
channel the fastestgrowing cable network with 32 million 
subscriber homes 
i think the discovery channels audience is very compatible 
with the kind of news program we want to produce said daniel 
wilson executive producer of world monitor tv 
the halfhour newscast produced near the christian science 
monitors headquarters in boston will focus on only three or four 
stories each night and may remind viewers of public tvs 
macneillehrer newshour which uses a similar format 
the program will not hart said make any effort to declare 
thats the way it is 
we have the luxury of not pretending to be a broadcast of 
record hart said were not going to chase every wisp of 
smoke we are in the context business thats our job we can 
tell you what the news means we can make connections relate 
history we can do the things you cant do when youre trying to 
hit all the bases 
well use reporters and foreign correspondents who know the 
language and know the culture 
while world monitor tv will not be a video version of its 
newspaper cousin the newscast will be supported by the christian 
science monitors 22 international and domestic news bureaus each 
broadcast will also include satellitefed contributions from 
world monitor tvs news desks in london tokyo and washington 
hodding carter iii will be the programs regular commentator 
dont look for world monitor tv to break news stories on a 
daily basis thats not part of the plan and the newscast doesnt 
have the resources to support an investigative unit we might do 
a story on day care wilson said and what we would do is look 
at the issue in europe the far east and america and then we would 
make comparisons were going to try to do things in depth 
it is such thoroughness that drew hart a 28year network news 
veteran to world monitor tv 
at the networks the commercial considerations are first 
hart said hart a peabody awardwinning reporter has also served 
as host of nbc saturday night news and nbc sunday night 
news 
this place is a relief hart continued here we wont 
make editorial decisions solely to garner an audience these 
people are interested in journalism and thats it theyre not 
caught in the struggle between journalism and marketing theres 
nothing wrong with marketing but it pulls in the opposite 
direction toward fantasy and not toward reality heres a 
show where we can deal with ideas for a change 
hart calls world monitor tv a modest proposal hes 
right while usa today the television show has firstyear 
startup costs of 40 million and a staff of 160 world monitor 
tv has been given 20 million for each of its first five years 
and has just more than 100 employees network news budgets for 
contrast averaged 275 million last year 
usa today the television show meanwhile is banking that 
us viewers want entertaining information as the newscast is 
characterized by its producer steve friedman formerly of nbcs 
today 
friedmans show will be broadcast through syndication appearing 
on more than 150 stations across the country 
usa today the television show and world monitor tv do 
have one thing in common neither will try to be a headline 
service each will try to complement not compete with the network 
newscasts 
after that however all similarities between the two shows end 
thus if you see world monitor looking at the developing 
black middle class in zimbabwe expect usa today the television 
show to explain how mens and womens opinions of love differ 
which show will be a hit thats hard to say usa today the 
newspaper has 54 million readers the christian science monitors 
circulation on the other hand is less than 200000 
sometimes though good things come in small packages

gerald tsai jr and sanford i weill 
two longtime friends known as brilliant businessmen and ambitious 
dealmakers have forged a highstakes alliance affecting both of 
their companies and both of their futures 
tsai the former wildly successful money manager who now is 
chairman of primerica corp and weill former president of 
american express co and current chairman of commercial credit 
group inc said monday that commercial credit had agreed to 
acquire primerica in a cashandstock deal valued at 165 billion 
the merger could create financial services company and help 
primerica which has had problems with its 1987 acquisition of the 
struggling brokerage firm smith barney harris upham amp co 
it also presents a challenge to weill who has a reputation for 
going into tough situations and turning them around 
what is unclear is what role tsai will play in the new company 
tsai will be the new companys largest individual shareholder 
with about 15 percent of its stock as well as a director and 
chairman of the boards executive committee weill will be 
chairman chief executive officer and president of the combined 
company 
both men shrugged off the role issue in a telephone interview on 
monday 
when asked who will run the show tsai said he weill 
doesi feel fine about that 
they are a terrific team this is going to be an absolute 
powerhouse company said primerica director joseph a califano 
jr former us secretary of health education and welfare 
califano said it was clear that weill would run the company 
even though tsai wasnt stepping back 
gerry tsai is only beginning his career califano said 
hes a man with 1000 ideas 
some analysts unsure of tsais role in the new company 
one conclusion is that commercial credit will be the owner 
sandy weill knows the brokerage business and financial services 
and he will be the one to run the show said dudley heer an 
analyst with the brokerage firm duff amp phelps in chicago 
tsai is a dealmaker heer said i dont know if he has 
mellowed out or what in the investment business there is no 
retirement restrictionand he is a very vibrant individual 
tsai 59 who has been chairman of greenwichbased primerica for 
just 19 months has surprised people before he earned a reputation 
as an investment wizard with some of his stock plays in the 1960s 
he became involved with primerica then called american can co 
in 1982 when he sold it associated madison which he had acquired 
earlier 
tsai became vice chairman in 1983 and was named chairman in 
january 1987 helping shepherd the company through transformation 
from a manufacturing operation to a financial services concern 
under tsais direction primerica embarked on a strategy of 
simplifying its operations and strengthening its financial position 
tsai said he hoped to spend a lot of time on longrange planning 
and working with weill 
sandy is somebody i have known for well over 25 years he is a 
terrific business manager im very excited about this and i think 
the stockholders will be very happy down the road tsai said 
weill 55 a founder of what now is the giant investment firm 
shearson lehman hutton inc also talked about his friendship with 
tsai 
i think we have always gotten along well i dont think well 
have any problems weill said 
weill also is not worried about the problems at smith barney 
which primerica acquired last year for 750 million 
primerica attributed its flat secondquarter earnings to the 
weak performance by smith barney which suffered from lower trading 
volume underwriting and commission revenues in the wake of the 
stock market crash 
i think there is a really excellent opportunity for smith 
barney to grow and prosper even in difficult economic 
environments weill said 
he and tsai also denied that smith barney would be sold weill 
said the firm was an important ingredient of primerica 
anthony pearcebatten an analyst with legg mason wood walker 
inc in baltimore also said he did not believe smith barney would 
be sold 
he has built a reputation as a strong manager who is able to 
turn companies around pearcebatten said commercial credit 
appears to be in the early stages of another success and primerica 
is the next quantum leap forward 
weill has a good eye for a bargain very strong management 
capabilities streamling organizations and making them more 
efficent and at the same time reducing expenses pearcebatten 
said 
weill left american express in 1985 after failing to become 
chief executive officer he gained control of baltimorebased 
commercial credit two years ago and last november was edged out by 
his former firm shearson lehman brothers in an attempt to buy 
ef hutton group inc 
under terms of an agreement approved by both companies boards 
primerica shareholders would receive one share of commercial credit 
common stock plus 7 cash for each share of primerica 
commercial credits stock fell 75 cents a share to close at 
2450 on the new york stock exchange monday primerica lost 62 
cents a share to close at 2950 on the nyse

prime minister brian mulroney has signaled the 
likelihood of a fall election to decide the fate of both the 
canadaus free trade agreement and his progressive conservative 
government 
in a heated threeway race the landmark vote on canadas 
economic future would offer the nation a clear choice between 
conservatives liberals and socialists 
mulroney said in a canadian broadcasting corp interview sunday 
night after keeping the country guessing for weeks that he saw no 
reason to remain in office much longer than the traditional four 
years without a new election 
those four years end on sept 17 
ive always believed that while the constitution allows for a 
fiveyear term that the custom of going about four years give or 
take a couple of months is a sound one and its one that should 
be respected he said 
an election call sept 17 would mean a midnovember election 
canadian campaigns normally last about eight weeks 
if mulroney wins the worlds two largest trading partners will 
proceed with plans to create a north american free trade zone on 
jan 1 eliminating all tariffs over 10 years and dismantling 
barriers to investment and competition 
if he loses both the main opposition liberal party and the 
socialist new democratic party say they will tear up the complex 
trade deal hailed by president reagan as only a beginning in a 
global free flow of trade 
mulroney 49 a former corporate lawyer who became leader of his 
party in 1983 and scored a landslide victory a year later has been 
waiting for good omens before calling an election 
but liberal leader john turner forced mulroneys hand by asking 
the liberal majority in the unelected senate to stall freetrade 
legislation indefinitely 
turner and new democratic party leader ed broadbent claim the 
deal jeopardizes canadian sovereignty we have put in potential 
jeopardy our cultural programs and our social programs and our 
ability to assist our less developed regions said turner 
the elected house of commons began its final debate on the trade 
deal monday with conservatives holding 207 of the 282 seats the 
bill should pass easily on wednesday the liberals have 38 seats 
new democrats 32 with 2 independents 1 liberalindependent and 2 
vacancies 
the deal must then be passed by the senate before becoming law 
the government hopes that pressure from profree traders such as 
quebecs liberal premier robert bourassa and the western provinces 
will soften the senates stand especially amid calls for reform or 
abolition of the chamber 
all players will be watching the sept 6 provincial election in 
nova scotia to see if conservative premier john buchanan wins 
another term a conservative loss could be the one event that 
could force plans for an election to be put on hold said 
pollster angus reid 
a national reid poll last friday gave the conservatives 36 
percent of the vote liberals 32 percent and new democrats 30 
percent the latest gallup poll showed the liberals with 35 
percent conservatives 34 percent and new democrats 30 percent 
small parties and independents took up the remainder 
such a tight race could result in a minority conservative 
government lacking the votes to pass free trade 
historians compare the contest to the milestone election of 1911 
when liberal prime minister sir wilfrid laurier offered free trade 
but lost to conservative robert borden who pledged no truck nor 
trade with the yankees 
despite presiding over a healthy economy and negotiating an 
accord to bring quebec back into the constitution mulroney has 
struggled with a credibility problem referred to in the press as 
the sleaze factor 
he lost eight cabinet members in scandals ranging from tainted 
tuna to criminal charges liberals gloated this month when a 
disgruntled former cabinet member from quebec suzanne 
blaisgrenier alleged the mulroney government was operating a 
network of patronage and kickbacks 
she gave no proof but the controversy swelled when two other 
quebec conservatives spoke of crumbs from the procurement table 
and information that could put a dozen people in jail again 
without hard evidence 
the other parties have their problems too 
polls show turner the most unpopular party leader with only 15 
percent voter approval he has struggled for two years to even hold 
onto his job in a divided party and is embarrassed by bourassas 
close links with mulroney whose government has pumped money into 
quebec 
nearly twothirds of voters say they like ed broadbent a former 
university teacher who claims to speak for ordinary canadians 
but his popularity may not translate into support for a leftwing 
party that has never governed canada and is committed to nato 
withdrawal and protectionism

one of the five pesticides the united farm 
workers union wants banned from table grapes is already outlawed 
and the federal environmental protection agency is keeping a wary 
eye on three others 
but state officials say the fifth chemical on the list is safe 
on crops although it has killed people when used to fumigate 
houses 
the thrust of the unions message during leader cesar chavezs 
36day fast centered on alleged dangers the five pesticides pose 
for table grape workers including risks of cancer but the union 
also contends they threaten consumers and the environment 
chavez was reported monday recuperating with no sign of 
longterm ill effects from the fast he ended aug 21 other 
activists have continued the fast for three days at a time the 
latest was actor martin sheen 
union board member arturo rodriguez claimed some grocers removed 
table grapes from their shelves as word of the fast spread but 
several growers and chain grocers said the fast had no noticeable 
effect on overall sales of the crop 
the chemicals he chavez is talking about on that list are 
not very valid in terms of farm worker hazards said jim wells 
chief of pesticide enforcement for the state department of food and 
agriculture 
the chemicals are dinoseb a weed killer captan used to 
control mold and fungus methyl bromide used to kill soil insects 
and worms and phosdrin and parathion both used to kill insects 
california banned dinoseb in 1986 because it has caused birth 
defects sterility and other disorders in test animals the union 
started its campaign against the chemicals before the state action 
and never removed dinoseb from its list 
the epa has captan posdrin and parathion under special review 
because of possible danger 
captan has been banned in west germany and canada has greatly 
restricted residue levels allowed on imported produce said dr 
keith maddy chief state food and agriculture toxicologist 
parathion has been banned in a number of countries including 
japan 
but methyl bromide seems to be a different story 
ufw consultant dr marion moses told a reporter that there 
have been more worker deaths occupational deaths related to 
methyl bromide than any other single pesticide 
but wells said all methyl bromide deaths he was aware of 
involved people entering houses under fumigation he said there 
have been no farm worker or applicator deaths and grape pickers do 
not come in contact with methyl bromide because its used to 
fumigate soil before grapevines are planted 
a small amount can cause lung liver or kidney damage or it 
can kill you if you get a strong enough whiff of it said al 
heier an environmental protection agency spokesman in washington 
more than 10 million pounds of the pesticide were used in 
california in 1986 but over half was used to fumigate buildings 
according to state records 
there are concerns about captan a fungicide under special 
review by the epa since 1980 it doesnt cause immediate sickness 
but is being studied as a longterm threat wells said 
it causes tumors in animals and we have proposed to ban all 
uses because of dietary exposure said heier of the epa 
captan residue has been found on 32 of 344 samples of produce 
tested for that pesticide by the state food and agriculture 
department the residues were well below federal tolerance levels 
designed to protect consumers but the natural resources defense 
council claims any captan residue is a potential threat because it 
is carcinogenic 
maddy the state toxicologist said federal tests give animals 
such high doses of pesticides that most chemicals show a positive 
cancer response 
banning captan could allow certain fungi to thrive on produce 
which in turn could be toxic or cancercausing to consumers maddy 
said 
maddy said phosdrin is under special epa review for its acute 
toxicity or potential to rapidly cause sickness 
we have very little chronic health effects data on 
phosdrin said heier the state reported 273874 pounds of 
phosdrin also known as mevinphos were used in 1986 
he said epa has parathion under special review because of 
possible nerve damage and eye damage to test animals 
rex magee a food and agriculture spokesman said that to his 
knowledge no farm workers in california have died because of 
pesticides a statement the union strongly disputes 
state records show that from 1982 to 1986 there were 90 cases 
of systemic or internal poisonings from all uses of parathion 58 
phosdrin cases and 32 methyl bromide cases during the same period 
grape pickers suffered 36 cases of topical poisonings such as a 
rash from captan when used with other chemicals

the government said today its chief 
forecasting gauge of future economic activity dropped 08 percent 
in july the sharpest decline in eight months 
economists said the drop in the commerce departments index of 
leading economic indicators may be a signal of a pause in what has 
been booming economic growth this year but they cautioned against 
reading too much into a single months figures 
the july decline was the biggest since last november when the 
index dropped 10 percent in the wake of the october stock market 
crash 
the latest drop was likely to be seen as good news by the stock 
and bond markets which have faltered in recent weeks on fears that 
inflation is heating up 
but the dip follows a 14 percent jump in the index in june the 
biggest increase in 18 months the commerce department revised its 
estimate for may calculating now that the indicators were off by 
07 percent instead of the previously reported 08 percent 
the government said last week that the us economy as measured 
by the gross national product grew at an annual rate of 33 
percent in the apriljune quarter following a 34 percent 
expansion pace in the first three months of the year 
this strong growth has raised concern at the federal reserve 
board which is charged with keeping inflation under control 
the fed has been pusing up shortterm interest rates since late 
march in an attempt to slow growth to a sustainable 
noninflationary pace on aug 9 it took its most dramatic 
inflationfighting move by raising the discount rate its key bank 
lending rate by a half percentage point 
since then analysts have been watching government economic 
statistics closely for indications of whether the fed has tigtened 
enough 
in july the weakness in the leading indicators was widespread 
with seven of the available nine components registering declines 
the biggest drain came from an 113 percent jump in unemployment 
claims that was followed in order of severity by a drop in new 
orders for consumer goods a decline in building permits a speedup 
in business deliveries considered a sign of slackening demand a 
drop in the standard amp poors index of 500 stocks a contraction of 
the money supply and a drop in plant and equipment orders 
one indicator a rise in prices for raw materials was read as a 
sign of economic strength the length of the average workweek was 
unchanged in july 
the 08 percent overall decline left the index at 1921 percent 
of its 1967 base of 100

michael evans a private economic forecaster in washington said 
he expected gnp growth likely will slow to an annual rate of 25 
percent in the second half closer to what the federal reserve 
considers sustainable without quickening inflaton 
he said growth in us exports and increases in investment 
spending by businesses likely would slow from the torrid pace 
earlier this year also higher interest rates are already 
beginning to pinch the housing industry 
however david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co 
a government securities dealer in new york said the momentum of 
the economy will keep growth strong until at least the second half 
of next year 
i really think well see just a temporary slowing my own 
feeling is economic growth in the second half will continue at 
about the same pace as the first half he said 
my own guess is that there will have to be some more fed 
tightening and still higher interest rates but most of that upward 
pressure will come after the election and well see a pause for a 
while he said 
economists cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from the 
leading index until a clear pattern emerges over three months 
since it was created in 1948 the index has fallen three months 
in a row a total of 12 times in eight of those instances a 
recession followed the other four times economic growth slowed 
but there was no recession 
the index last declined three consecutive months from june 
through august in 1984 there was no recession but the economy did 
enter a twoyear period of slow growth 
also initial estimates of the index are frequently revised 
substantially in later months 
for instance within the last year there were preliminary 
reports of declines for five consecutive months from september 
through january however later revisions wiped out all but two of 
those drops in november and january

the government said today its chief forecasting gauge of future 
economic activity dropped 08 percent in july the sharpest decline 
in eight months while orders to us factories fell a steep 35 
percent 
economists said the drop in the commerce departments index of 
leading economic indicators may be a signal of a pause in what has 
been booming economic growth this year but they cautioned against 
reading too much into a single months figures 
the july decline was the biggest since last november when the 
index dropped 10 percent in the wake of the october stock market 
crash 
orders for manufactured goods which registered their steepest 
decrease in 18 months were dragged down by a sharp decline in 
military orders the department said 
orders for both durable and nondurable goods fell 79 billion 
last month to 2202 billion but the decline the worst since a 
36 percent drop in january 1987 had been anticipated 
in a revision of the previous months figure the government 
said orders rose 54 percent in june the largest monthly increase 
in more than 17 years 
both the stock and bond markets reacted cooly to the latest 
hints that the economy may be slowing the treasurys long bond was 
little changed while trading was mixed on wall street 
separately a government report released monday showed a big 
drop in newhome sales last month in the face of higher mortgage 
rates 
the departments of commerce and housing and urban development 
said sales of new singlefamily homes fell 47 percent in july to a 
seasonallyadjusted annual rate of 686000 units it was the 
biggest decline since a 62 percent decline in december 
the government also reduced estimates for june and may showing 
less housing strength than previously believed 
fixedrate mortgages have risen by almost a point since march to 
their highest levels of the year boosting the monthly payment on a 
new 100000 mortgage by about 65 
but the housing report was well received by traders in the bond 
market which has been languishing because of fears of inflation 
and higher interest rates 
bond prices posted the biggest gain in nearly four weeks 
although trading was light brokers said lower commodity prices and 
a highervalued dollar also played roles in the rally 
the treasurys key 30year bond climbed nearly 10 per 1000 
face amount its biggest oneday gain since aug 2 its yield 
which moves in the opposite direction from price fell to 933 
percent from 943 percent late friday 
the bond rally also helped wall street which has been sensitive 
to rising interest rates the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
which had bounced around last week to post a net gain of 143 
points rose 2400 to 204143

multimillionaire commodities trader richard j 
dennis a legend whose luck turned sour after last octobers stock 
market collapse says he is leaving the futures business to 
concentrate on his other passion politics 
dennis 39 known as the prince of the pit at chicagos 
boisterous commodities exchanges said monday he was closing his 
accounts and selling his exchange seats so he could devote his 
energies to public policy and political endeavors 
there is only so much satisfaction and utility to the making 
of money dennis said in a prepared statement 
he said he would use his personal fortune reportedly around 
200 million as a launching pad for his new career 
i am fortunate to have enough assets and opportunities to try 
to make a significant impact on our political lives as i approach 
40 years of age i believe it is time for me to take on this new 
set of challenges the statement read 
dennis said he would concentrate on writing speaking and 
active involvement with voters and candidates 
he was national cochairman for the unsuccessful democratic 
presidential campaign of former arizona gov bruce babbitt he also 
has made sizable contributions to several other democratic 
campaigns since 1980 including the 1984 presidential bid of former 
vice president walter mondale and the 1986 illinois gubernatorial 
campaign of adlai stevenson 
dennis said he now supports the presidential bid of democratic 
nominee michael dukakis and has contributed 100000 to his 
campaign 
babbitt believes dennis could have a large and lasting impact on 
the democratic party 
his primary concern is the power of ideas babbitt said 
he wants to force the democratic party to rethink its agenda he 
has a passion for economic reform 
dennis also donated 10 million to establish the roosevelt 
center a liberal thinktank with offices in washington and 
chicago and is a leading financial backer of people for the 
american way a liberal group formed as a counterpoint to the 
conservative moral majority 
dennis a native of chicagos south side began his financial 
career at age 17 as a 160anhour brokerage house runner at the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
after graduating from depaul university with a degree in 
philosophy he bought his first exchange seat on the tiny 
midamerica commodity exchange at age 21 
dennis owns seats on every major commodity exchange and runs two 
companies campd commodities a futures trading partnership of which 
he is managing partner and richard j dennis amp co an advising 
firm for managed futures funds and accounts 
his uncanny success as a trader earned him the nickname prince 
of the pit on the floors of the chicago board of trade and 
chicago mercantile exchange but his fortune seemed to sour after 
last octobers markets collapse in which campd commodities 
reportedly lost 10 million 
two public commodity funds dennis launched last year in 
conjunction with drexel burnham lambert inc also fell on hard 
times after they lost more than 50 percent of their 115 million 
combined initial value dennis suspended trading last april in the 
funds 
both funds resumed trading on aug 3 following a vote of 
confidence by investors and each had lost about 35 percent when 
trading was halted for good on friday said mark walsh a dennis amp 
co spokeman 
walsh blamed the losses on choppy markets the worst markets 
weve seen in 10 years 
he said dennis decision to quit trading was not related to the 
funds losses 
several veteran traders on the floor of the chicago board of 
trade said dennis exit from the futures business had been expected 
i know that for the last several years his main interest in 
life has been politics not trading said victor lespinasse a 
trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
he is certainly one of biggest most successful traders 
ever lespinasse said over the past year he supposedly had 
some rough times but overall he made a lot of money and was very 
very succesful 
i personally was surprised he stayed around so long added 
jerry zusel manager of cbot floor operations for balfour maclaine 
corp 
with the fact that hes made so much money i couldnt 
understand why hed want to keep risking capital zusel said 
as one guy said to me this morning hes made more money than he 
could spend in 10 lifetimes

winstonsalem nc ap a new smokeless cigarette developed 
by rj reynolds tobacco co will be testmarketed in st louis 
phoenix and tucson ariz beginning oct 1 company officials said 
today 
the new cigarettes called premier will be odorless and will 
generate only a trace of ash or smoke that could irritate people 
nearby the officials said 
company officials said the new cigarettes contain a hightech 
packet of tobacco extracts which is heated but not burned 
the price per pack will be about 30 cents higher than other 
cigarettes said betsy annese director of public relations for the 
winstonsalembased company 
the company will use a variety of advertising messages to sell 
the new cigarettes she said one advertising approach will tout 
the new product as premier the cleaner smoke 
but the company is not making any health or safety claims 
were not claiming this is a safe or safer cigarette she 
said 
a health claim would invite regulation by the federal food and 
drug administration 
if a product is sold with claims to make cigarettes safer it 
is a medical device subject to fda approval said william grigg 
an fda spokesman 
antismoking groups are pressing the fda to regulate the new 
cigarettes as a drug because they maintain reynolds is making 
implied health claims for its product in addition the 
antismoking groups say the new cigarettes could appeal to 
teenagers thereby gaining a new generation of smokers as 
customers 
analysts said reynolds selected the test markets in particular 
the arizona cities because they have numerous older sophisticated 
smokers who may be trying to quit smoking or are seeking an 
alternative

congressional investigators have uncovered 
evidence suggesting that up to 30 wall street firms unwittingly 
participated in an insider trading scheme conducted via a swiss 
brokerage an industry publication says 
the aug 29 edition of investment dealers digest says the house 
energy and commerce committees oversight and investigations 
subcommittee will hold a hearing sept 8 and reveal the findings 
which indicate the wall street firms failed to detect suspicious 
trades coming from the ellis ag brokerage 
the weekly publication said the questionable trades covered as 
many as 100 takeover deals from 1982 to 1985 
under swiss bank secrecy laws trades executed by a swiss 
banking firm through other entities such as us investment firms 
dont have to be identified this means someone holding an account 
through a swiss firm can trade through the us markets without 
fear of detection 
the investment dealers digest quoted unidentified congressional 
aides as saying that in some cases large trades from ag ellis 
were spread out over a range of wall street firms in order to make 
the transactions less obvious 
it said the repeated pattern of stock trades up to and during a 
takeover attempt however prompted congressional suspicion of 
insider trading the misuse of confidential information such as 
impending takeovers to profit in the securities markets 
the subcommittee has been looking for evidence that the 
surveillance systems of wall street firms are inadequate which 
some lawmakers say justify legislation that would increase firm 
liability in insider trading cases 
ellis has been the focus of us and swiss law enforcement 
investigations for months though no action has been brought so far 
and the sources behind the questionable trades havent been 
determined 
the congressional probe was prompted partly by testimony from 
convicted insider trader dennis b levine who traded through bank 
leu a swiss bank as a way to hide his activities

rawson food stores inc and its owner 
have been awarded 236 million in damages in a civil suit accusing 
prudentialbache securities inc of issuing bad advice on rawsons 
1985 purchase of part of the pantry pride supermaket chain 
a circuit court jury of five women and one man deliberated for 
three hours monday before awarding owner john v rawson jr 2 
million in compensatory and punitive damages and the company 216 
million 
the lawsuit alleged that prudentialbache had recklessly advised 
rawson and his company to buy 43 northeast florida and southeast 
georgia stores from pantry pride enterprises inc for 40 million 
prudentialbache charged 1 million for its services 
the lawsuit said the real value of the stores was much less than 
what prudentialbache claimed it was 
rawson food services filed for protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in february 1986 the 
45store chain claimed assets of 446 million and liabilities of 
51 million 
we are obviously very pleased with the verdict because it 
means the remaining creditors of the estate can be repaid said 
steve busey an attorney representing raswon 
the day it filed for reorganization rawson agreed to sell 33 of 
its minneapolisbased super valu stores for 312 million super 
valu then sold the stores to winndixie stores inc 
the remaining stores were sold to other companies but it left 
rawson 15 million too short to pay off its creditors 
prudentialbache had argued it was not liable for damages 
because its advise was based largely on information from rawsons 
management team 
attorney mattox hair who represented prudentialbache was out 
of the office tuesday and was unavailable for comment

the flight attendants union at trans world 
airlines inc charged today that twas future and the safety of the 
flying public are jeopardized by financier carl icahns proposal to 
take the airline private 
the flight attendants asked the department of transportation to 
investigate icahns fitness to continue operating twa 
twa is being managed today not as an air carrier but as an 
unsupervised mutual fund benefiting mr icahn vicki frankovich 
president of the independent federation of flight attendants told 
a news conference 
the iffa represents about 9000 flight attendants at twa 
the union charged that since icahn took control of twa two years 
ago he has milked the airlines cash reserves and sold off 
assets to finance his stock market and takeover ventures instead 
of buying new airplanes and safety equipment for the twa fleet the 
airlines fleet is one of the oldest in the us industry with 
planes averaging 133 years old 
twa plans to spend just over 1 percent of its budget this year 
on new planes while most other major airlines usually invest about 
15 percent or 20 percent in new equipment according to union 
lawyer david aronofsky 
this the union says contributes to high maintenance costs and 
twas accident and incident rate which according to the federal 
aviation administration is the worst among major us carriers 
icahn is asking twa shareholders at a meeting sept 7 to sell 
their stock to him the purchase would be financed by the sale of 
speculative highyield bonds which the union says would raise 
twas annual interest payments to 466 million almost double the 
airlines 1987 operating earnings of 240 million 
twa referred all questions to bob allen senior vice president 
for employee relations he declined immediate comment saying he 
had not had time to study the news release 
the union also has asked the department of transportation to 
freeze twas assets while it investigates icahns management 
the twa machinists union which also opposes the privatization 
and filed suit in federal court last week in an effort to stop it 
is being asked to join the iffa petition but has not yet had time 
to study it frankovich said 
we couldnt wait she said adding that she expects the 
machinists to join the flight attendants in asking the dot to stop 
icahns privatization effort 
unions at eastern airlines made a similar request to the dot 
last year in its findings the dot said acrimonious relations 
between labor and management could lead to operational problems 
and a former secretary of labor was appointed to act as a mediator

3 billion truck division at navistar international corp with the 
job of making a good operation better 
roberts 49 is bringing to north americas leading maker of 
medium and heavyduty trucks his reputation as a very dynamic 
leader accepted within all ranks said spokesman john d 
mcdonald 
were happy to have him mcdonald said of roberts who 
joined navistar aug 8 he has a strong background in 
manufacturing and certainly with people he has some very 
strong leadership capabilities and a competitive spirit 
navistar declined to make roberts available for comment until 
he gets his feet on the ground said spokesman bill greenhill 
as he departed roberts got an official blessing from gm 
roy roberts has been a valued executive and an outstanding 
contributor in every assignment throughout his general motors 
career said roger b smith gm chairman and chief executive 
officer we wish him the best in his new position at navistar 
with 4 billion in annual sales navistar is enjoying its third 
straight profitable year after six moneylosers stemming from 
recession labor troubles and the farm crisis of the early 1980s 
the companys truck division is the leader in north america and 
roberts job will be to expand or strengthen that leadership 
position mcdonald said he is not taking over in a back 
position 
navistar plucked roberts from possible contention as gms first 
minority chief operating officer luring him with cash and stock 
valued at about 400000 plus an annual salary estimated at nearly 
440000 mcdonald ackowledged 
roberts who was vice president of personnel administration and 
development for gm is in charge of engineering manufacturing and 
marketing of medium and heavyduty trucks for navistar formerly 
international harvester 
his record for inspiring loyalty among employees while keeping 
operations competitive is among his chief assets mcdonald said 
roberts faced perhaps his greatest challenge at gm when he had 
to lay off 40000 whitecollar workers 25 percent of the companys 
salaried employees 
if anyone thinks its fun to ask anyone to leave general 
motors its not fun its not fun roberts told usa today 
recently 
it was employee loyalty to roberts that caught the eye of a 
superior and served as a catalyst to his meteoric rise according 
to a recent interview in the chicago tribune 
elmer johnson then a gm executive vice president said he was 
inspecting the plant that roberts managed in tarrytown ny when 
roberts introduced him to about 70 employees the newspaper 
reported 
i looked at the faces of the employees as he spoke and you 
could tell that they loved him and that they loved working for 
him johnson was quoted as saying 
at tarrytown roberts is credited with saving the plant from 
shutdown by winning the nod to build gms plasticbody minivan 
hes a very inspirational man full of warmth and humor i was 
moved by his abilities said johnson who remembered roberts a 
year later when the post of vice president of personnel fell vacant 
john e jacob president of the national urban league said 
roberts is the ideal role model for young people of all races 
not only has he shown steady growth throughout his career he has 
evidenced that hard work has its rewards 
he has further shown that one can be aggressive and committed 
to civil rights and still succeed in corporate america jacob

a pinheadsized aphid is giving new meaning 
to the words russian menace as midwestern farmers scout their 
fields for the insect 
leroy brooks a kansas state university entomologist says the 
russian wheat aphid is a crop pest that has been spreading since 
its discovery in russia around 1900 it was in south africa in 
1978 mexico by the early 1980s and crossed into the united states 
in texas in 1985 or 1986 
its relatively rare to find a pest that is a completely new 
pest to the united states or in this case the western 
hemisphere brooks said 
kansas fields first were infested in april 1986 during 1988 at 
least 49 central and western counties were affected as of july 
the insect had spread almost to the candian border and had been 
spotted in 14 states including california and washington 
entomologists estimate the russian wheat aphid has cost us 
small grains growers more than 100 million in insecticides and 
lost yields 
figures for the 1988 crop arent yet available nor are 
projections estimating the aphid problems the new crop might face 
but in 1987 about 38 percent or about 4 million acres of kansas 
wheat crop was affected brooks said 
infestation levels were even higher elsewhere new mexico and 
colorado officials said all of their small grains crops were 
infested to varying degrees during 1987 in nebraska infestation 
was 64 percent and in texas 56 percent 
in some cases the aphids are present in enough numbers to kill 
plants he said usually their impact is on yields turning 
potentially high yield fields into riskier ventures 
the aphid also helps provide shelter for another pest the 
greenbug when russian heat aphids attack wheat plant leaves the 
leaves roll up greenbugs like the protection this affords and 
appear to use it for development allowing them to attack in higher 
numbers he said 
greenbugs and russian wheat aphids are similar in appearance 
brooks said the aphids have a more spindlelike body and dont 
carry the dark stripe common to greenbugs the aphid also doesnt 
have the visible cornicles or tailpipes the greenbug has he said 
the first signs of russian wheat aphid trouble come when plants 
begin to show a green and white streaked appearance on the upper 
side of their leaves brooks said damaged plants have a pink or 
purple cast to the undersides of their leaves he said 
driving by a field isnt a good way to survey it for the aphids 
nor is just checking the edges only 
it is only when you get down on your hands and knees a ways 
into a field and start looking plant by plant and tiller by tiller 
that you can detect these early signs brooks said 
he recommends checking about 20 consecutive plants and then 
doing the same at about five other spots in the field 
sometimes wheat streak mosaic and other diseases or pests may 
mask the presence of the aphids he said 
potential yields have to be taken into account when deciding 
whether to hire an aerial sprayer to apply insecticide for around 
8 an acre 
volunteer wheat which often sprouts after a harvest and 
natural grasses make good hosts for the pests before they can prey 
on young planted wheat in early fall and early spring brooks said 
volunteer which also can spread other pests and diseases should 
be controlled to help eliminate problems 
some experts are recommending latefall planting because 
earlyplanted wheat and small grains seem to suffer the worst aphid 
infestations 
we really dont have any good documented evidence on just how 
important that is right now brooks said 
entomologists fear the aphids could develop a tolerance to some 
of the insecticides now being used 
just a slight increase in tolerance could mean the difference 
between successful control and not being able to get control at 
all brooks said 
insecticide manufacturers are developing new chemicals that can 
replace those currently used if tolerance becomes a problem 
also the us department of agriculture is conducting a study 
involving the importation of beneficial insects to control the 
aphid insects are being transported from russia and afghanistan 
for the research work

when he was just barely a teenager gary 
e hoover decided he wanted to add a chapter to the book of 
retailing 
by 1982 armed with an economics degree and experience as a wall 
street analyst and department store executive he was ready to 
start writing 
hoover then 31 opened his first bookstop store in the texas 
capital modeling it loosely on the successful toys r us design 
big selection and discount prices a book superstore he called 
it 
six years later the bookstop chain has grown to 17 stores 
with three more scheduled to open by years end in texas florida 
and louisiana and the bookstop founder and chairman says 
confidently that there will be more to the story 
i decided when i was like 13 years old that someday i was 
going to start a chain of stores everything ive done since then 
was toward that goal he said 
but if your idea of a bookstore is a small musty darkpaneled 
place awash in pipe smoke bookstop stores might come as a shock 
the company says its average store covers 9500 square feet and 
stocks 35000 titles in 300 subject areas 
hoover is an architecture buff and the stores have moved into 
some unusual sites including houstons artdeco alabama movie 
theater the store being opened in new orleans will be located in a 
100yearold cotton warehouse 
weve got the flexibility to do those things old cafeterias 
old rollerskating rinks old theaters he said id love to be 
in an old bank too 
bookstops are open 12 hours a day or more some closing only two 
days a year they offer discounts of 10 percent on most titles 25 
percent on bestsellers and up to 40 percent for customers who 
annually purchase readers choice cards the company counts more 
than 200000 cardholders 
bookstop has centralized distribution so books arriving at the 
austin headquarters from publishers can be inventoried labeled 
with the chains own price tags and shipped to stores the stores 
transmit their sales results nightly by computer making them 
available the next morning so bookstops four buyers can see whats 
selling 
with a superstore like ours to break even our annual sales 
volumes got to be three four times the sales of the average 
bookstore its a much harder thing to do to carry that big a 
selection we need an advanced computer system real sophisticated 
inventory control systems and yet we try to do it all at a 
discount hoover said adding that bookstop moved 45 million 
volumes through its distribution center last year 
retailings always been an intensely competitive business but 
its becoming a much more technological business our survival 
depends much more on research on understanding the customer on 
computerized controls he said 
the privately held company doesnt make public sales figures 
although hoover has said in the past that 1986 sales were 26 
million in 1985 the chain grew from six stores to 12 in 105 days 
the companys founder got his start with an economics degree 
from the university of chicago he was a retailing analyst with 
citibank in new york and worked for department store companies in 
dallas and st louis he says he spent seven years working on his 
bookstop business plan before raising the money to open the first 
store 
hoover readily credits the toys r us stores with the concept he 
voices a strong belief that discount specialty stores will be among 
retailings big winners between now and the end of the century he 
cites such companies as drug emporium inc sound warehouse and 
new superstores in office supplies and sporting goods 
books is one of the fastestgrowing categories of retailing 
that demand ties to the baby boom because baby boomers are 
getting richer every day their incomes are rising as a group and 
theyre really oriented toward buying books continuing 
selfeducation and now buying their children books hoover said 
although other bookstore chains already were major national 
forces hoover said he didnt encounter too much skepticism when he 
approached investors with his idea of another 
books have survived the introduction of radio the 
introduction of television the introduction of phonograph records 
and movies books are a way of transmitting information and 
compared with other ways of transmitting information they are 
still cheap portable compact and readily available were trying 
to do our part to make them more readily available he said

southeast asias role in the world economy will 
expand through the year 2000 while japanese markets will become 
more competitive and us output will decline a think tank 
predicted tuesday 
the research institute on the national economy said in a 
longrange forecast that asias gross national product or its 
total output of goods and services will rise steadily over the 
next decade while those of europe and the united states will shrink 
through the turn of the century southeast asias gnp will rise 
54 points while gnp in the european community and north america 
will decline 29 and 25 points respectively the institute 
predicted 
meanwhile japans economy will grow at an average 
inflationadjusted pace of 47 percent through the year 2000 the 
institute said 
we have to be aware that the japanese market will become 
increasingly competitive the report said this is because 
imports will continue to rise because of the yens appreciation 
the japanese economy will be considered an extremely large 
market and direct investment by foreign companies will increase 
it added 
the institute said it based its prediction for the economic 
growth of southeast asia on the recent fast rise in trade among the 
countries in the region including the socalled newly 
industrialized economies like south korea taiwan hong kong and 
singapore as well as among members of the association of southeast 
asian nations including thailand indonesia and malaysia 
steady development in the division of industrial production 
between southeast asian countries and japan will help avoid serious 
competition among themselves the report said 
economic growth of north america and the european community has 
come primarily from the effects of policies set in motion the 
report said but the development of the southeast asian economy has 
drawn its strength from autonomous economic dynamism itself 
the report forecast that japans economic growth will be powered 
by personal spending and privatesector capital investment 
in addition investment profits will surge in japan with the 
outstanding balance of investments in 2000 reaching 1100 trillion 
and profits totaling at least 80 billion a year the institute 
said 
a characteristic of the japanese economy toward the year 2000 
will be clearly reflected in the countrys international balance of 
payments according to the think tank 
japans trade surplus will shrink to 600 million from 943 
billion in fiscal 1987 ended last march almost attaining 
equilibrium it said exports will increase an average 72 percent 
in each of the years but imports will register an 116 percent rise 
due in part to stronger internal demand for manufactured goods the 
institute said 
however japan wont become a net debtor according to the 
institute 
the institute said the us economy has the potential to attain 
growth exceeding 3 percent a year after inflation is taken into 
account 
already its trade deficit has been shrinking as a result of 
economic expansion led by exports it said 
the us budget deficit also will dwindle because of high tax 
revenues it predicted by the mid1990s the socalled twin 
deficts will largely disappear it said

every year a new crop of youngsters enters the 
world of adult finance the first requirement of which is access to 
credit in their own names 
this is a credit society and those who dont have it who in 
fact might disdain it in favor of paying everything in cash very 
often find themselves in perplexing situations 
in fact it has been argued from time to time that credit is a 
right since the possibilities of existing or advancing in a credit 
society are greatly lessened for those who pay in cash or are 
denied access to the system 
having credit is in a sense a persons identity in the 
marketplace often being necessary to rent a car or reserve a hotel 
room an absolutely creditfree record might be admired in some 
places but not in the marketplace 
it is odd therefore that there is no smooth formal 
recognized accepted institutionalized way of entering the world 
of credit you must so to speak walk through the wall there is 
no door there isnt even a key 
at most there are a few tips says the consumer credit 
institute to wit 
if you havent already done so open a checking account and a 
savings account at a financial institution you may then use the 
institution as a credit reference assuming you keep your checkbook 
correctly posted 
after a couple of months ask that institution for a visa or 
mastercard line of credit some might offer these cards even before 
you apply if so take them and never miss a payment 
investigate affinity group credit this is credit made 
available to members of a particular group including alumni of 
colleges such groups sometimes offer widely accept credit cards 
check on the prospect of using your savings account as 
collateral for a loan generally such loans also carry very low 
interest rates 
apply for a local retailers charge card small stores tend to 
judge you at face value rather than through credit history they 
want your business if you obtain credit pay your bills promptly 
you want them as a reference 
even if youre successful in all these possibilities you still 
might be forced into having a cosigner for bigticket items such 
as an automobiles cosigners often are parents 
most of these suggestions are from the institute a division of 
the american financial services association which represents 
companies that lend to consumers and small businesses but such 
suggestion are only the beginning 
that is once credit is established it must be built a process 
that new creditusers have always sought to speed up it can be 
done although it might cost a small amount of money 
the technique used over the years by many entrepreneurs is to 
borrow money and then simply use it and a bit more to repay the 
loan ahead of the scheduled repayment date prepayment impresses 
lenders 
on the next visit to the lender you make use of your good 
record you apply for a somewhat larger amount and because of your 
good repayment record you might get it 
tyler hicks a business executive and author of more than 50 
books on grassroots financing describes a once popular technique 
in which borrowers obtained three times as much money as their 
financial situation would suggest 
the technique was simple knowing they faced a turndown if they 
applied for 15000 they applied instead for five 5000 loans at 
five banks in the same day 
to the question do you owe money to any other lender they 
would answer no it was an honest answer since they really had 
no big debts outstanding 
if the person was lucky and appeared to be reliable and 
responsible perhaps three banks would respond with 5000 each 
the trick then was to find an investment that would make the 
15000 grow larger 
the more conservative of these borrowers would refrain from 
using the entire 15000 but instead would invest 10000 in an 
incomeproducing property and keep 5000 in reserve to service the 
three loans 
it was a desperate procedure but many real estate investors got 
started with this or similar techniques 
they agree it was dangerous to their financial health but as 
they saw it it was even unhealthier to attempt getting along 
without sufficient credit in a creditbased society

as part of a wave of liberalization in japans 
financial markets the tokyo and osaka stock exchanges are to 
launch stock index futures trading starting saturday 
exchange officials say the index futures market is likely to 
exceed the size of the regular stock market within a few years and 
affect the investment patterns of japanese institutional investors 
they also say it is an ideal opportunity for foreign investment 
firms which are more experienced in futures trading than their 
japanese counterparts to penetrate japanese financial markets 
we are hoping the new index futures trading will also promote 
the growth of the equity market as the futures market attracts more 
money to stock markets said keiichi okada head of the tokyo 
stock exchanges futures trading department i expect the index 
futures market will exceed the size of the cash market within a few 
years 
index futures contracts allow speculative investors to bet on 
the direction of an entire set of stocks rather than putting their 
money into stocks of individual companies more cautious investors 
can use index futures contracts as hedges to offset positions in 
the stock market 
index futures contracts would also permit various forms of 
program trading including index arbitrage which some critics 
blame for exacerbating the instability of prices on wall street 
both exchanges said they will allow foreign nonmember 
securities firms to participate in index futures trading 
foreign securities companies are more experienced in futures 
trading than their japanese counterparts said okada they will 
have an edge over their japanese competitors at the same time 
japanese securities companies can learn from them 
the inauguration of index futures trading in japan has been long 
awaited by investors eager to hedge against possible fluctuations 
of share prices in the equity markets while major stock exchanges 
around the world offer a broad range of financial futures trading 
japan has offered only 10year government bond futures trading in 
them began in 1985 
as pressure mounts to make the japanese money market more open 
and internationalized japanese exchanges and the securities 
industry have been gradually launching new services to keep up with 
rapidly changing and diversifying demands 
the tokyo exchange will use the tokyo stock exchange price 
index or topix an index of all 1100 shares on the exchanges 
first section weighted toward the bigger companies while the 
osakas futures market will be based on the more popular nikkei 
stock average of 225 selected issues a simple average of 225 
leading stocks 
analysts and exchange officials say topix is a more accurate 
indicator of overall market trends but the nikkei index is more 
responsive to the mood of the market 
topix is not as vulnerable to the fluctuation of high priced 
smallcapital shares like the nikkei index is but nikkei is by far 
the bestknown index said okada 
institutional investors generally welcome the new system which 
can protect them from daytoday price fluctuations in their 
stocks but some are concerned that the index futures market may 
have a negative impact on the equity market 
when the futures market is on a downturn most investors will 
assume the spot market also will be heading downward shortly and 
withdraw their funds from the spot market said a securities 
dealer at a major brokerage in tokyo speaking on condition of 
anonymity it will cause a further decline in share prices

the federal environmental protection agency 
is suing chevron usa inc charging cancercausing benzene is 
leaking from its refinery in south philadelphia the company 
announced tuesday 
the epa filed suit in us district court here monday accusing 
the gasoline giant of consistently failing over the past four years 
to monitor and repair the equipment that handles benzene at the 
refinery 
jack galloway spokesman for chevrons east coast operations 
said the company was in compliance with epa regulations galloway 
said the company would cooperate with the epa on any problems that 
might have occurred 
the suit seeks an injunction requiring the san franciscobased 
corporation to comply with the federal clean air act 
unless enjoined by an order of this court the lawsuit says 
these violations will continue 
for each of the 19 alleged violations of the federal law the 
suit seeks penalties of up to 25000 a day neither the lawsuit 
nor government spokesmen gave a total dollar amount of possible 
fines 
benzene constitutes a serious health threat when released into 
the air it is epa policy to take whatever steps are necessary 
to ensure compliance with applicable emission standards james m 
seif regional epa administrator said in a press release 
announcing the suit 
special assistant us attorney robert j smolski said it was 
unclear how much benzene had escaped from the refinery system 
because of the alleged violations different leaks have been 
occurring since 1984 he said 
galloway said that of 338 workers checked for benzene exposure 
in 1987 983 percent were under epa limits he noted that the 
refinery is about 1 miles from any homes

the government said today its chief 
forecasting gauge of future economic activity dropped 08 percent 
in july the sharpest decline in eight months 
economists said the drop in the commerce departments index of 
leading economic indicators may be a signal of a pause in what has 
been booming economic growth this year but they cautioned against 
reading too much into a single months figures 
the july decline was the biggest since last november when the 
index dropped 10 percent in the wake of the october stock market 
crash 
the latest drop was likely to be seen as good news by the stock 
and bond markets which have faltered in recent weeks on fears that 
inflation is heating up 
but the dip follows a 14 percent jump in the index in june the 
biggest increase in 18 months the commerce department revised its 
estimate for may calculating now that the indicators were off by 
07 percent instead of the previously reported 08 percent 
white house spokesman b jay cooper said the data suggest 
continued economic growth in the months ahead although at a more 
moderate pace than in the first half of the year cooper was in 
santa barbara calif with the vacationing president reagan 
the government said last week that the us economy as measured 
by the gross national product grew at an annual rate of 33 
percent in the apriljune quarter following a 34 percent 
expansion pace in the first three months of the year 
this strong growth has raised concern at the federal reserve 
board which is charged with keeping inflation under control 
the fed has been pusing up shortterm interest rates since late 
march in an attempt to slow growth to a sustainable 
noninflationary pace on aug 9 it took its most dramatic 
inflationfighting move by raising the discount rate its key bank 
lending rate by a half percentage point 
since then analysts have been watching government economic 
statistics closely for indications of whether the fed has tigtened 
enough 
in july the weakness in the leading indicators was widespread 
with seven of the available nine components registering declines 
the biggest drain came from an 113 percent jump in unemployment 
claims that was followed in order of severity by a drop in new 
orders for consumer goods a decline in building permits a speedup 
in business deliveries considered a sign of slackening demand a 
drop in the standard amp poors index of 500 stocks a contraction of 
the money supply and a drop in plant and equipment orders 
one indicator a rise in prices for raw materials was read as a 
sign of economic strength the length of the average workweek was 
unchanged in july 
the 08 percent overall decline left the index at 1921 percent 
of its 1967 base of 100

michael evans a private economic forecaster in washington said 
he expected gnp growth likely will slow to an annual rate of 25 
percent in the second half closer to what the federal reserve 
considers sustainable without quickening inflaton 
he said growth in us exports and increases in investment 
spending by businesses likely would slow from the torrid pace 
earlier this year also higher interest rates are already 
beginning to pinch the housing industry 
however david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co 
a government securities dealer in new york said the momentum of 
the economy will keep growth strong until at least the second half 
of next year 
i really think well see just a temporary slowing my own 
feeling is economic growth in the second half will continue at 
about the same pace as the first half he said 
my own guess is that there will have to be some more fed 
tightening and still higher interest rates but most of that upward 
pressure will come after the election and well see a pause for a 
while he said 
economists cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from the 
leading index until a clear pattern emerges over three months 
since it was created in 1948 the index has fallen three months 
in a row a total of 12 times in eight of those instances a 
recession followed the other four times economic growth slowed 
but there was no recession 
the index last declined three consecutive months from june 
through august in 1984 there was no recession but the economy did 
enter a twoyear period of slow growth 
also initial estimates of the index are frequently revised 
substantially in later months 
for instance within the last year there were preliminary 
reports of declines for five consecutive months from september 
through january however later revisions wiped out all but two of 
those drops in november and january

the government said tuesday its chief 
forecasting gauge of future economic activity suffered the steepest 
drop in eight months in july but few analysts expect a substantial 
slackening in growth anytime soon 
the 08 percent decline in the commerce departments index of 
leading economic indicators was the biggest since last november 
when the index dropped 10 percent in the aftermath of the october 
stock market crash 
however economists noted that the index posted an exceptionally 
strong increase in june and cautioned against reading too much into 
a onemonth downturn 
in a separate report the commerce department said orders to 
us factories for manufactured goods plunged 35 percent in july 
the worst decline in 18 months but that drop followed a very 
strong showing in june and was heavily influenced by a wide swing 
in orders for military equipment 
despite the declines were not going to have any slowing in 
the imminent future said bruce steinberg an economist with 
merrill lynch in new york 
the economy as measured by the gross national product grew at 
a 33 percent annual rate in the three months ended in june and at 
a 34 percent pace in the first quarter 
steinberg said this strong growth which surprised many 
economists who had been anticipating a recession after the stock 
market crash likely would continue through the julyseptember 
quarter 
white house spokesman b jay cooper in california with the 
vacationing president reagan said the data suggest continued 
economic growth in the months ahead although at a more moderate 
pace than in the first half of the year 
barring something unforeseen the economy could turn in its 
strongest performance since 1984 that would be good news for vice 
president george bush who is counting on a feeling of economic 
optimism among voters to bolster his chances of beatwk 
quayle measures up 
in eight years in the senate quayle has been known mostly f agans 
strategic defense initiative his 
battle for the controversial federal court appointment of daniel 
manion and a losing fight against the 60day notification for plant 
closings 
i dont remember anything in particular bentsen said when 
asked if he had squared off against quayle on any other issues 
and he makes repeated subtle references to quayles youth 
i certainly dont think hes too young but certainly youve 
got to have some maturity to be a heartbeat away from the 
presidency he said at one kentucky stop when reporters goaded 
bentsen with questions on whether quayle would still be on the 
ticket nov 8 the texan finally couldnt resist 
i hope so he said 
but away from the public eye bentsen and his top aides are 
concerned about going into debate against quayle 
bentsen is younger than president reagan was when he won the 
white house but his face looks older especially on television 
the campaign has signed him up for coaching and ollo he wont appear wooden

and holding his own might be good enough to be declared the 
winner given the low expectations accorded the indiana senator 
were on the wrong end of the expectations game as far as the 
vice presidential debate is concerned because everyone expects 
sen bentsen to do so well said linda peek a longtime senate 
democratic strategist who is now a private consultant in washington 
other democrats already are defending bentsen in advance of a 
debate that may never come off 
the senator is concerned about a debate because his style as a 
senator is to get things done and he doesnt engage in a lot of 
sparring on the floor national party spokesman mike mccurry 
said on the other hand its easy to envision dan quayle as a tv 
talk show host 
bentsen also must be careful not to bludgeon quayle and win him 
a backlash of sympathy among voters as has occurred in the recent 
controversy over quayles national guard record 
norman ornstein who studies politics at the american enterprise 
institute says the democrats have reason to worry about quayle 
he is not a dummy ornstein said in past debates such as 
when he defeated incumbent birch bayh to win the senate in 1980 
quayle showed when he was prepared wellbriefed and focused he 
could do all right 
bentsen meanwhile has the difficult task of not wanting to 
help the republicans in their expectations game and also not 
wanting to speak well of quayle 
it isnt in bentsens interest to talk about quayle 
ornstein said 
so while he clearly sees quayle as a lesser opponent bentsen 
must focus his attacks away from the man and back to the issues and 
quayles conservative voting record 
i dont want to get into his personal life that i dont want 
to do bentsen says 
then bentsen hints about which republican would have been a 
worthy opponent 
i thought it would be bob dole frankly he says its a 
real gamble picking quayle and i think its going to be proven 
that way

opec secretarygeneral subroto said 
tuesday that ending the iraniraq war will strengthen the oil 
cartel but he gave no clue whether iran has agreed to let its foe 
have an oil production quota equal to its own 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia said subroto indonesias former energy minister made the 
comments after a meeting with president ali khamenei in tehran 
subroto arrived monday from kuwait seeking to persuade iran to 
agree to allow iraq an opec quota of at least 239 million barrels 
a day 
iraq has refused to accept a quota of 15 million barrels a day 
about half its current output and insists on parity with iran 
the deadlock with iraq pumping an estimated 25 million barrels 
a day to boost its revenue and repair its wardamaged economy has 
worsened the problem of overproduction by some opec member states 
the middle east economic survey a respected oil industry weekly 
published in nicosia said monday the output by the 13member 
cartel this month was around 20 million barrels a day 
thats about 35 million barrels a day over opecs overall 
production quota and was seen as a key factor in depressing world 
oil prices 
irna quoted khamenei as saying opec members should strictly 
adhere to their quotas but he too made no direct mention of the 
issue of iraqs quota 
but he did note that among irans prime concerns were opec unity 
and resolving the organizations problems 
subroto was expected to fly to baghdad iraqs capital through 
kuwait wednesday 
he had talks monday with irans oil minister gholamreza 
aqazadeh irna said subroto briefed aqazadeh on his earlier visits 
to venezuela ecuador saudi arabia mexico and kuwait on the 
overproduction issue but it gave no details 
opec overcame a major stumbling block to its efforts to impose 
production discipline earlier this month after venezuela dropped 
its veto against giving iraq a quota equal to irans 
eleven of the opec states now agree to that iran is now the 
only holdout 
with the united nationssponsored aug20 ceasefire apparently 
holding iraq and iran have both started repairing oil facilities 
damaged in the nearly eight years of fighting 
oil industry sources believe that iraq will be able to install 
makeshift oil loading terminals in the northern gulf within a few 
months allowing it to boost its export capacity by 1 million 
barrels a day 
iraq is also expanding its export pipeline network which would 
increase its production capacity to more than 3 million barrels a 
day by the end of the decade 
the iranians are repairing the heavily bombed kharg island 
terminal which accounts for 90 percent of their oil exports 
irans deputy oil minister khazempour ardebili said earlier 
this month that tehrans longterm target is to boost production to 
around 45 million barrels a day its prewar level 
but the middle east economic survey noted that in the short 
term production will likely only increase to around 28 million 
barrels a day

a federal judge said today that eastern 
airlines may curtail service but must return to the bargaining 
table and negotiate over the proposed layoffs of 4000 employees 
eastern said it would file an emergency appeal although it 
expressed satisfaction that the ruling would allow it to carry 
through with plans to drop some routes 
us district judge barrington d parker said eastern had shown 
through testimony that it has the right to change schedules reduce 
flights and close its hub at kansas city as the airline has 
proposed without first bargaining with the plaintiffs 
the plaintiffs are three unions fighting easterns plans to fire 
4000 workers eastern announced july 22 that it would close its 
kansas city hub and eliminate 140 of its 1225 flights daily 
testimony also supports the conclusion that the proposed 
operational changes are motivated by sound financial reasons the 
judge wrote in a 50page opinion even plaintiffs experts agreed 
that eastern has legitimate and compelling business reasons to 
withdraw from the kansas city hub 
the judge wrote however that just because the cutbacks are 
necessary economically does not mean eastern can bypass bargaining 
with its unions 
massive layoffs are not and shall never be business as 
usual he wrote the railway labor act requires eastern to 
bargain with its unions before taking unilateral action to 
eliminate 12 percent of its worforce 
included among those employees are 1000 flight attendants 
1000 machinists and 500 pilots 
eastern president phil bakes in a prepared statement from miami 
corporate headquarters said eastern was pleased its fall schedule 
has been left intact but would file an emergency appeal and request 
for stay because the order is gravely wrong 
eastern like any american business must be allowed to prune 
moneylosing operations he said we must be able to take 
prudent although sometimes painful measures in the best interests 
of the company and our employees 
bakes called parkers ruling a fundamental misreading of the 
railway labor act that could profoundly disrupt the entire 
airline industry and undermine the very essence of deregulation 
union leaders in miami said they wanted to study the ruling 
before commenting 
easterns lawyers had no comment after a brief hearing in 
parkers court involving the bond that eastern is seeking from the 
three union plaintiffs such a bond protects a defendant for losses 
suffered if he should win on appeal 
parker had issued a temporary restraining order against the 
furloughs on aug 4 and extended it last friday 
parker cited a supreme court ruling that many business decisions 
are subject to bargaining including management actions taken to 
eliminate wasteful practices 
the labor agreements eastern made with its unions provide no 
justification for a wholesale restructuring of the air line 
workforce he wrote employers subject to the rla railway 
labor act must bargain with their unions even over fundamental 
decisions affecting the very scope and direction of their 
employers enterprise

carl icahn is using twa as his personal cash cow 
to the detriment of the airline and public safety the flight 
attendants union charged tuesday 
the union asked the us department of transportation to block 
icahns plan to take trans world airlines inc private and to 
freeze twa assets while it investigates his fitness to continue 
managing the airline 
vicki frankovich president of the independent federation of 
flight attendants charged that since icahn took control of twa a 
little more than two years ago he has milked the airlines 
cash reserves and sold off assets to finance his stock market and 
takeover ventures rather than buy new airplanes and other safety 
equipment needed to assure twas future 
through spokesman bob allen icahn called iffas allegations 
spurious malicious and erroneous and designed to embarrass 
the airline 
today twa has more planes serves more airports and carries 
more passengers than in 1986 allen said in a formal statement 
still twas fleet remains the oldest in the industry the 
average plane is 146 years old the union said a twa boeing 727 
that landed on its belly saturday in chicago when its landing gear 
failed to descend was 24 years old according to the national 
transportation safety board which still is investigating the cause 
of that incident 
the union criticized twas plans to spend just 1 percent of the 
gross value of its fleet on new equipment this year while other 
airlines are spending about 15 or 20 percent on new fuelefficient 
planes 
this the union says contributes to high maintenance costs and 
the airlines accident and incident rate which according to the 
federal aviation administration is the worst among the top 10 
american airlines 
old airplanes also cost more to maintain than new ones and twa 
will have to spend more and more to keep its planes safe the union 
says 
this would require a healthy cash flow frankovich said 
but according to disclosures in icahns own filings before the 
securities and exchange commission twas cash flow is not expected 
to be sufficient to repay the increased debt to be incurred under 
his privatization plan 
icahn who owns 75 percent of twas stock will ask minority 
shareholders at a meeting sept 7 to sell their stock to him 
payments would be financed by the sale of 250 million in 
speculative highyield bonds 
this would raise twas annual interest payments to 466 million 
almost double the airlines 1987 operating earnings of 240 
million according to iffas analysis 
in addition for his twa stock icahn would receive 400 million 
in twa assets including a big chunk of texaco stock the union 
said 
twa is being managed today not as an air carrier but as an 
unsupervised mutual fund benefiting mr icahn frankovich said 
unless the dot acts now to stop him carl icahn and his 
companies will take 650 million out of an already weakened twa and 
leave the flying public his creditors and his longsuffering 
employees to reap the sad and perhaps tragic consequences she 
added 
icahn in his statement said i have no doubt that twa 
employees the traveling public and the appropriate government 
officials will see through iffas meritless charges and understand 
iffas motivation 
twas machinists union which also opposes the privatization and 
filed suit in federal court last week to stop it is being asked to 
join the iffa petition but has not yet had time to study it 
frankovich said 
unions at eastern airlines made a similar request to the dot 
last year in its findings the dot said acrimonious relations 
between labor and management could lead to operational problems and 
a former us secretary of labor was appointed to act as a mediator

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods fell sharply in july pulled down by the biggest drop in 
defense orders in more than four years the government said tuesday 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable goods slipped 35 percent to 2202 billion last month 
it was the worst drop since january 1987 when orders fell 36 
percent 
but economists were not concerned about the decrease because it 
was heavily influenced by the volatile military goods category and 
came one month after the strongest increase in total orders in more 
than 17 years 
the orders numbers were down because of some fluctuations in 
some very volatile categories theyll be up again in august 
said bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch in new york 
in july defense orders plummeted 466 percent to 74 billion 
reversing a 683 percent gain a month earlier last months drop in 
this category was the steepest since april 1984 the june increase 
had been the biggest since december 1982 
excluding the defense category orders were down 07 percent in 
july following a healthy 29 percent gain in june 
us manufacturing which languished earlier in the decade 
because of the strong dollar has rebounded the weaker dollar has 
fueled a resurgence in sales of american goods overseas and 
businesses have responded by spending more to upgrade and replace 
outmoded plant and equipment 
but demand for us goods has been so strong that some analysts 
are concerned that factory capacity will be strained pushing 
prices higher 
samuel d kahan an economist with kleinwort benson government 
securities inc in chicago said that despite the overall drop in 
factory orders in july there is very little evidence yet that 
the manufacturing sector is moderating 
a particular sign of strength he said is the category of 
nondefense capital goods which is considered a good indication of 
business expansion plans it was up 09 percent to 358 billion 
following a 125 percent increase in june 
that i think is the more telling story despite the 
fact that last months number was a strong increase we were still 
able to scratch out a further increase this month kahan said 
the overall july decline followed a 54 percent surge in june 
the biggest since december 1970 orders were down 03 percent in 
may 
the commerce department offered these details of july activity 
total orders for durable goods big ticket items expected 
to last three or more years were off 71 percent in july following 
an 87 percent gain in june 
orders for transportation equipment both military and 
nonmilitary were off 220 percent after soaring 333 percent a 
month earlier 
nonelectrical machinery was down 42 percent while electrical 
machinery jumped 41 percent 
orders for nondurable goods rose 10 percent after increasing 
16 percent a month earlier 
shipments of manufactured goods fell 09 percent to 2169 
billion after rising 14 percent in june

a federal judge tuesday sentenced two former bank 
officers to prison for contributing to the nearcollapse of 
continental illinois national bank amp trust co in the early 1980s 
us district judge milton shadur sentenced john r lytle 53 a 
former continental vice president to 3 years in prison 
william g patterson former head of energy lending at penn 
square bank of oklahoma city was sentenced to a 2year term 
lytle 53 and patterson 38 had pleaded guilty june 30 to 
criminal charges in an alleged scheme that involved risky loans and 
kickbacks 
penn square failed in 1982 and continental came close to 
collapse two years later after the largest run on desposits in 
banking history 
they were scheduled to report to prison authorities on oct 11 
testifying before his sentencing tuesday lytle said he accepted 
responsibility for his actions he asked the judge to sentence him 
to no more than six months in jail and then put him on probation 
and allow him to work with the poor on chicagos west side 
i wish desperately that i could reverse the events of the 
1980s lytle told shadur in various ways and in increasing 
amounts i have a desire to redeem myself 
working with poor children is an area where im experienced 
where i have great love and where i have a track record please 
your honor give me an opportunity to give service lytle pleaded 
patterson who held his head and cried as he spoke said he was 
sorry for his actions and was concerned about his family 
im sorry for the people in chicago and oklahoma he said 
i think of that a lot 
but prosecutor joe duffy said the two men must be punished 
because they had abused a special trust 
societys rights and needs must take precedence over the 
defendants and their family duffy told the judge anything 
less would send a confusing message to the american people 
lytle pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank funds and 
patterson pleaded guilty to charges that he aided and abetted 
lytle the pleas came two months after the trial of the two men 
ended with a deadlocked jury 
prosecutors charged that patterson had manipulated lytle and a 
third man oklahoma drilling contractor jere sturgis in schemes to 
save his own failing bank sturgis was acquitted of wire fraud 
charges 
the government accused lytle caught in spiraling personal debt 
to finance a luxurious lifestyle of accepting kickbacks from 
patterson in exchange for buying risky energy loans from penn 
square for continental 
defense attorneys contended continental which was kept afloat 
by a 45 billion government bailout was saddled with the 
troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive lending policy

on the chicago mercantile exchange amid signs of an expected 
seasonal upturn in hog slaughters 
on other markets grain and soybean futures rose sharply 
precious metals drifted lower energy futures advanced and

a recent pickup in hog slaughters suggests last springs 
unusually large pig crop is beginning to come to market at least

frozen porkbelly futures finished down nearly the

the market is jittery because were going into the fall season 
with an 87 percent increase in frozen pork stocks from last year 
he said 
expectations of the seasonal slaughter increase were offset last 
week by a strong cattle futures market which kept prices in the 
adjacent pork pits from falling sharply levitt said 
but meatpackers now have all the cattle they need to meet the 
labor day weekend demand so cattle prices weakened tuesday

court papers unsealed tuesday show federal agents 
are trying to determine if georgia power co avoided paying 
millions of dollars in federal taxes through the way it accounted 
for spare parts 
besides georgia power one of the nations richest utilities 
the investigation includes its parent the southern co and the 
big eight accounting firm of arthur andersen amp co 
the papers raise the question of whether the companies and their 
accountants sought to hide about 61 million in spare parts to 
avoid paying 50 million in federal taxes interest and penalties 
the complicated arrangement deals with whether parts are classified 
as being emergency spare parts or for maintenance and when they 
become expenses to the company 
the papers also raise the question of georgia powers accounting 
for the sale of 5 percent of plant vogtle nuclear power plant to 
the municipal electric authority of georgia in the documents 
officials say the deal was treated as a sale of 5 percent of the 
887 billion plant for book value purposes but as 135 percent 
for tax purposes saving the company between 10 million and 12 
million 
the papers include excerpts of taped conversations in which 
southern cos tax chief agrees with a confidential informant that 
the company misled the irs over the tax accounting of the spare 
parts but adds dont ever say that 
the investigation which dates from 1982 is based largely on 
information contained in taped conversations between utility and 
andersen officials and the informant who is being paid for his 
participation and been exempted from prosecution according to the 
court papers 
us attorney robert barr confirmed the investigation but 
refused to provide details beyond what was contained in the papers 
because a grand jury is involved 
he said the investigation which is continuing involves 
possible criminal wrongdoing including violations of the us tax 
code 
although the court papers unsealed tuesday focus on georgia 
power southern co and arthur andersen barr said other companies 
or individuals may be involved the affidavit says southern 
subsidiaries mississippi power co and gulf power co used proper 
accounting procedures for spare parts 
the atlanta constitution reported the investigation last week 
after internal revenue service agents executed search warrants at 
the downtown atlanta headquarters of georgia power as well as the 
home of tim fallaw southern cos director of taxes 
the constitution said other companies being investigated include 
oglethorpe power co which provides electricity to electric 
cooperatives in the state 
in a tuesday afternoon news conference georgia power chairman 
robert w scherer said the allegations if true are shocking to 
me personally and im sure to the employees of georgia power 
scherer said i want to state as plainly as i can to you that 
i will not tolerate wrongdoing and i will not tolerate the coverup 
of wrongdoing at georgia power co and i personally will get to the 
bottom of this matter 
scherer said the accounting for spare parts is one of those 
complex areas in the tax law that is open to legitimate 
disagreement among reputable accountants 
the chairman refused to take questions 
southern co spokesman gale clappa said the holding company 
would have nothing further to add to scherers statement officials 
at arthur andersens atlanta office had no immediate comment on the 
material

the federal home loan mortgage corp on 
tuesday approved a 4for1 stock swap as part of its plan to open 
up ownership of its preferred stock to public investors and bring a 
more than 1 billion windfall to the savings and loan industry 
the corporation known as freddie mac is a congressionally 
created entity that buys home mortgages from savings institutions 
and other lenders and packages them into securities for resale to 
investors making more money available for home buyers 
ownership of freddie macs 15 million preferred shares is 
currently restricted to the 2500 savings institutions who are 
members of the federal home loan bank system 
as part of an effort to bring new capital to the ailing 
industry federal regulators in july voted in principle to lift 
restrictions on ownership of the preferred stock which has no 
voting power 
the price of the stock which was 60 a share in early june has 
soared after tuesdays announcment spelling out details of how 
the ownership restrictions will be lifted the stock rose 650 a 
share to 145 in trading on the new york stock exchange 
members of congress led by sen william proxmire dwis 
chairman of the senate banking committee had been pressing federal 
regulators to funnel some of the windfall into the federal savings 
and loan insurance corp the financially strapped fund that backs 
deposits in savings institutions 
trade groups have opposed that arguing it is important to bring 
new capital to the healthy segment of the industry which owns most 
of the freddie mac stock 
m danny wall the top federal sampl regulator and chairman of 
freddie macs board repeated that regulators have decided 
proxmires plan is clearly not going to be done 
freddie mac said it will offer four new shares of preferred 
stock for each old share between oct 17 and nov 30 public 
investors would not be permitted to purchase the stock until after 
jan 1 
the corporation said it has retained the right to rescind the 
entire exchange offer if fewer than twothirds of the shares are 
turned in however it approved two provisions designed to 
encourage the exchange 
each new share will be guaranteed at least a fourth of the 
dividends paid to an old share but could receive more also old 
shares not exchanged before nov 30 could later be swapped for only 
35 new shares

the federal government is scheduled to open 
wednesday 371 bids made by oil companies hoping to snap up 270 
tracts of bargainpriced oil properties in the western gulf of 
mexico 
it will be the third gulf lease sale since the interior 
department dropped the minimum peracre price on the property from 
150 to 25 and its the second time western gulf tracts are up 
for bids 
interest appeared high with 93 companies qualifiying to bid 
eightyfour qualified for the central gulf sale last march 
however when the number of bids actually was totaled tuesday 
afternoon it was far below the 931 bids received last march for 
the central gulf properties 
eileen angelico spokeswoman for the interior departments 
minerals management service said the number was down for two 
reasons 
first the central gulf waters are considered to be better oil 
properties second the western gulf tracts were up for bids a year 
ago shortly after the minimum bids were lowered to 25 per acre 
almost 520 bids were received on the tracts then 
the lower price is still seen as a means of boosting interest in 
the offshore tracts angelico said we see it as an incentive to 
the smaller companies she said 
the western gulf territory covers about 5080 underwater blocks 
covering about 279 million acres mostly off the texas coast but 
some in deep waters off the louisiana shore 
louisiana and texas are both suffering economically from the 
domestic oil industrys depression and renewed interest in offshore 
leases was hailed as good news by industry representatives at the 
march sale 
but a spokesman for one company cautions that the sale of more 
leases wont necessarily be followed by more drilling 
thats driven more by other things said billy vehnekamp 
public affairs manager for shells new orleans office 
the government gives the lease purchasers several years the 
number varies according to the type and location of the tract to 
exercise drilling rights vehnekamp said 
drilling costs prices for the product and numerous other market 
factors come into play he said 
bids will be opened beginning at 9 am wednesday at the 
marriott hotel in downtown new orleans

a federal judge on tuesday stopped eastern 
airlines from firing 4000 employees but allowed the financially 
strapped carrier to go ahead with cutting back service to 14 cities 
on wednesday as planned 
eastern said it will go ahead with the cuts its hub in kansas 
city will be eliminated and flights will be cut from 53 to 6 said 
spokeswoman paula musto 
massive layoffs are not and shall never be business as 
usual us district judge barrington parker said in a 50page 
opinion the railway labor act requires eastern to bargain with 
its unions before taking unilateral action to eliminate 12 percent 
of its workforce 
he signed a preliminary injunction that bars eastern from 
altering in any way the status quo working condition of easterns 
pilots machinists and flight attendants a trial in the matter 
will be scheduled later 
eastern president phil bakes called the decision gravely 
wrong and said the carrier would file an emergency appeal 
eastern like any american business must be allowed to prune 
moneylosing operations bakes said in a statement released at 
easterns headquarters in miami we must be able to take prudent 
although sometimes painful measures in the best interests of the 
company and our employees 
lawyers for the three unions that brought the court action 
against eastern submitted financial statements and parker ordered 
bonds of 25000 each to indemnify the airline if the decision is 
reversed 
meantime the airline said easterns basic fall schedule 
remains intact travel agents and pasengers can continue to book 
flights with full confidence that the schedule will be as 
announced 
this is a case of protecting work and protecting jobs said 
james linsey an attorney for air line pilots association he said 
the decision doesnt secondguess the business decisions of 
eastern airlines to fly from point a to point b or to limit service 
in particular cities 
asked what eastern might do with thousands of employees it 
claims not to need linsey replied they get transferred like 
any company transfers employees from one plant to another 
parker wrote that texas air corp which bought eastern in 1986 
has exerted every effort to curb union influence at eastern and 
to reduce wage rates and economic benefits previously obtained 
he said there were many indications of antiunion bias and 
that frank lorenzo chairman of texas air had expressed that view 
on many occasions 
since the acquisition of eastern by texas air easterns 
management has contributed to easterns financial instability 
the judge wrote through a series of business decisions 
management has led the company into a number of questionable loans 
and questionable ventures which have drained off cash reserves and 
other assets 
the centerpiece of the opinion was that eastern could not 
proceed with the mass firings parker did not dwell on the 
airlines plans to close its kansas city hub and cut service to 14 
cities 
the airline claimed it would save 50 million by the service 
terminations and 7 million in payroll it would cut 140 of its 
1225 daily flights and sell between 33 and 41 airplanes 
the cities eastern targeted to cut are albuquerque nm fort 
de france martinique las vegas nev minneapolisst paul 
oklahoma city omaha neb dallas pointeapitre guadeloupe 
reno nev san antonio texas san diego st lucia west indies 
tucson ariz and tulsa okla 
parker wrote that eastern has shown through testimony that it 
has the right to change schedules reduce flights and close its 
kansas city hub as proposed without first bargaining with the 
plaintiffs he said there is no question that the cutbacks are 
motivated by sound financial reasons 
bill scheri airline coordinator for the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers told reporters 
this tells us one thing that unionbuster mr frank lorenzo 
is not above the law of the land mr lorenzo and his 
handpicked lieutenants cannot lay off 4000 employees 
scheri said the seven days of hearings that resulted in the 
judges ruling exposed that mr lorenzo and company were not 
really trying to keep eastern air lines in business but to 
dismantle it and transfer assets and destroy three labor unions 
parker wrote however that just because the cutbacks are 
necessary economically does not mean eastern can bypass bargaining 
with its unions 
while it is true that the collective bargaining agreements 
contain furlough provisions they provide no justification for a 
wholesale restructuring of the airline work force he said 
among the employees eastern wanted for lay off are 1000 flight 
attendants 1000 machinists and 500 pilots the ruling said the 
other workers affected by the order were not specified the flight 
attendants are represented by the transport workers union of 
america which joined alpa and the machinists union in the suit 
parker had issued a temporary restraining order against the 
furloughs on aug 4 and extended it last friday 
in his ruling tuesday he cited a supreme court ruling that many 
business decisions are subject to bargaining including management 
actions taken to eliminate wasteful practices 
the labor agreements eastern made with its unions provide no 
justification for a wholesale restructuring of the airline 
workforce parker wrote 
employers subject to the rla railway labor act must bargain 
with their unions even over fundamental decisions affecting the 
very scope and direction of their employers enterprise 
the unions brought their suit under the railway labor act which 
requires carriers and the bargaining representatives of labor to 
preserve and maintain working conditions that exist before a labor 
dispute

public service company of new mexico 
laid off 656 employees tuesday or 159 percent of its workforce 
in the latest cutbacks under a major costcutting program 
the states largest utility had 4126 fulltime positions before 
the job eliminations tuesdays cuts boosted job eliminations to 
194 percent of its workforce and followed the layoffs of 129 
union workers from pnms electrical operations and the elimination 
of all 14 jobs in its aviation department 
our goal is to have earnings such that we can continue 
dividends and regain our financial health said jerry geist pnm 
president and chairman 
geist said jobs were cut from operations across the state and 
from all levels of the company including 30 percent reductions in 
the corporate office 
he said the job cuts would save 284 million in salaries wages 
and benefits a year and that nonlabor costcutting measures would 
save 154 million 
pnm officials also announced construction expenses were cut by 
19 million in 1988 and 336 million in budgeted 1989 levels 
geist said pnm dropped its employee stock purchase plan and 
imposed an acrosstheboard salary freeze until the middle of next 
year executive salaries and benefits were cut in january so the 
latest salary freeze is an extended freeze for pnm officials he 
said 
geist said tuesday actions would not affect the reliability or 
safety of electrical or gas service but would slow the utilitys 
response time for things such as requests for new service 
the utilitys financial problems over the past year are largely 
due to a huge excess generating capacity its share of costs of the 
palo verde nuclear generating station in arizona and a unit of the 
coalfired san juan generating station near farmington are not 
included in its rates 
earnings dropped 38 percent between 1986 and 1987 and have 
continued dropping this year geist said shareholder dividends 
have been cut by nearly 50 percent he said 
pnms stock which climbed to a high of 39 in early 1987 rose 
125 to 1375 a share tuesday on the new york stock exchange
