soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze and foreign secretary raul manglapus on thursday 
discussed offers to reduce soviet troop strength in asia and ways to 
improve bilateral relations 
shevardnadze who was to meet president corazon aquino later 
thursday described the talks as very interesting and very 
substantive 
shevardnadze arrived wednesday from tokyo and was to depart later 
thursday for communist ally north korea he is the highestranking 
soviet official ever to visit this former american colony 
during his visit to japan the soviet foreign minister 
reestablished dialogue on a peace treaty although japanese 
officials said the two sides are still far apart over a territorial 
dispute 
that shevardnadze agreed at all to discuss the dispute over a 
cluster of islands marked progress japanese officials said 
kazuhiko togo head of the japanese foreign ministrys soviet 
union division said the positions taken by both sides differed 
completely on a cluster of islands in the kuril islands that japan 
calls its northern territories 
the fact that both sides presented their views in a fairly 
comprehensive manner and also the fact that it was reflected in the 
communique we evaluate as a positive phenomenon he added 
in a joint communique the two nations allude to the islands as 
difficulties existing in their bilateral relations 
the soviet union seized the islands off the northern coast of 
hokkaido in the final days of world war ii and later stationed some 
10000 troops there japan insists its claim to the islands must be 
settled before the two sides conclude a peace treaty formally ending 
that war 
japan and the soviet union have agreed meanwhile to form a 
permanent working group in order to further promote the 
negotiations on the conclusion of a peace treaty the communique 
said 
shevardnadze told a news conference before his departure that 
while he and japanese foreign minister sousuke uno fell short of 
forging a major agreement they succeeded in laying a basis for 
further talks 
we have attained a degree of mutual understanding that allows 
us to speak of a new chapter in japansoviet relations with 
good prospects for sovietjapanese political dialogue and for a 
practical development of our relations said shevardnadze who 
first visited japan in 1986 
shevardnadze also told his news conference that the two sides 
agreed to prepare for a summit between soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev and japanese prime minister noboru takeshita 
he said he will meet uno in paris in early january while 
attending a conference on chemical weapons and that uno will visit 
moscow in the spring to prepare a concrete summit timetable and 
agenda 
uno later told reporters that by taking up the issue of the 
islands historic talks were made possible 
he described the soviet position regarding the islands as just 
as severe as before but he added that we agreed on talks to 
conclude a peace treaty 
takeshita commenting on the first japansoviet foreign ministers 
meeting in three years said the talks marked a major first step 
in furthering bilateral relations according to japanese news 
reports

after nearly four years without a 
brandbybrand analysis american cigarette devotees are once again 
confronted by the list 
the list which itemizes tar nicotine and carbon monoxide 
content in cigarette smoke is back released tuesday by the 
federal trade commission for the first time since january 1985 
the new compilation based on tobaccoindustry tests of 272 
varieties of cigarettes showed that varieties of carlton and now 
scored lowest in all three categories exactly where they ranked in 
the 1985 list 
at the other end of the spectrum old gold straights produced the 
highest amounts of tar and nicotine and varieties of century 25s 
more 120s and tall 120s produced the most carbon monoxide in the 
tests the consumer agency said 
the list was formerly done annually with the testing done by an 
ftc laboratory after the release of the 1985 list the agency 
halted the testing program it began in 1966 in the wake of the us 
surgeon generals finding that cigarettes are dangerous to human 
health 
in dropping its tests the ftc cited budgetary constraints and 
said such scientific sampling was not consistent with the chief 
functions of an agency dominated by lawyers and economists 
the new test results were produced by the industrysupported 
tobacco industry testing laboratory under ftc oversight and using 
the same procedures previously employed by the agency according to 
judith wilkenfeld of the ftcs bureau of consumer affairs 
she said that harold pillsbury former director of the ftc 
laboratory worked under contract to the agency to monitor the 
industry testing procedures and review its data 
we feel very confident the results are consistent with the 
results we were generating when we did the tests ms wilkenfeld 
said 
an ftc statement said the 272 varieties of cigarettes were 
obtained by a company hired by the industry laboratory it said the 
company purchased two packages of each variety in 50 different 
locations around the nation 
the tests measured each varietys smoke content of tar which is 
particulate matter exclusive of nicotine of nicotine an addictive 
substance and of carbon monoxide a toxic gas 
lowest in all three categories were carltons and nows filter 
kings marketed in hard packs each produced tar nicotine and carbon 
monoxide readings below the measurement sensitivity of the test 
equipment 
the lowest measurable readings in the three categories were also 
produced by these two brands carlton filter king regular and 
menthol in soft packs 100s in regular and menthol in hard packs and 
100s in soft packs and now filter kings regular and menthol in 
soft packs and 100s regular and menthol in soft packs 
their tar readings ranged from 1 to 3 milligrams per cigarette 
with nicotine ranging from 01 milligram to 03 milligram and carbon 
monoxide ranging from 1 milligram to 4 milligrams 
among hightar cigarettes old gold straights and philip morris 
commanders each produced 27 milligrams the old golds also had the 
highest nicotine reading 19 milligrams trailed by english ovals 
with 18 milligrams 
the highest carbon monoxide results came from century 25 100s in 
the soft pack more 120s regular and menthol in soft packs and 
tall 120 filters in the soft pack each produced 21 milligrams per 
cigarette 
the latest list showed that americans have a choice of 184 
varieties of cigarettes producing less than 15 milligrams of tar up 
from 152 in the list released in 1985 there were 190 varieties with 
1 milligram or less of nicotine up from 159 in 1985 
but they are finding less choice in the cigarette racks when it 
comes to varieties with less than 10 milligrams of carbon monoxide 
in 1985 there were 80 varieties in this category but the latest 
list has only 49

israels relationship with the united states is 
in for a bumpy ride in the months ahead and the sudden resignation 
of one of its chief lobbyists in washington is not helping any 
douglas bloomfield the legislative director of the american 
israel public affairs committee resigned several days ago after 
nine years at one of the best organized and most influential lobbies 
in washington 
in keeping with their dislike of publicity aipac officials 
including bloomfield declined to discuss his departure publicly 
privately some contended that it was prompted by personality 
clashes rather than policy disagreements 
but congressional supporters of aipac as well as some jewish 
leaders warned that bloomfields departure reflects a dangerous 
crack in the traditionally close relationship between congress and 
the powerful lobby 
its the worst possible timing said morris amitay a lawyer 
who served as aipacs executive director from 1974 to 1980 amitay 
whose office directly overlooks aipacs and who still acts as a 
father confessor to some of its staffers said bloomfields 
departure reflects a shift in the groups lobbying tactics 
the organization which until recent years concentrated all its 
efforts on lobbying capitol hill has in recent years also reached 
out to the administration too much so said amitay 
they feel erroneously that they can lobby the administration 
the same way as congress and get what they want thats not very 
sophisticated he said 
rep lawrence smith dfla who has fought strenuously against 
administration requests for arms sales to arab countries said he 
has worked closely with aipac in the past but if this trend goes 
on im going to have a problem with them 
they have to understand that the real bedrock of support for 
israel is the congress administrations come and go were pretty 
constant and reliable smith said 
aipacs reputation as one of washingtons most powerful lobbies 
is due in large part to the 3 billion in annual us aid to israel 
the most received by any nation the organization also has fought 
successfully against arms sales to moderate arab states 
several new arms sale proposals are likely to surface in the 
coming months and add to the strains in usisraeli ties 
israel and the united states already are at odds over last weeks 
decision by president reagan to reverse a 13year ban on us talks 
with the palestine liberation organization which israel views as an 
enemy committed to its destruction 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and his top lieutenants 
expressed a sense of betrayal and shock over the decision israels 
former un envoy binyamin netanyahu said the decision had eroded 
us credibility in israels eyes 
but presidentelect bush has indicated he plans to continue the 
dialogue with the plo in an effort to advance peace talks in the 
middle east officials on his transition team also have indicated 
they will consider a new saudi arabian weapons shopping list worth 
millions of dollars 
the saudis weary of fighting congress over previous arms 
requests recently signed 30 billion worth of weapons contracts 
with british companies defense secretary frank carlucci chastised 
various interest groups and many in congress for costing the 
united states the lucrative deal 
unrest within aipac and the strains with congress also appear due 
in part to a perception that the organizations leadership is 
prorepublican 
this does not sit well with the predominantly democratic congress 
nor with some in the jewish community which traditionally has 
tended to vote democratic 
the partisanship that is perceived as creeping into aipacs 
decisionmaking will hurt them in the long run said smith they 
cant afford to be seen as siding with one side or another they 
need support on both sides of the aisle for israel 
aipac which prefers to keep a low profile and work behind the 
scenes also was hit by news reports earlier this year saying that 
it had begun actively supporting specific candidates in violation 
of its mandate 
the lobbying group denied the allegations some of which were 
based on memos leaked by disaffected employees

if the millions of holiday travelers who will go 
through ohare international airport fly before noon the neighbors 
of the nations busiest airport may be able for once to hear 
christmas eve carols 
the roar of arriving and departing airliners has grated on the 
residents nerves for years but a federal court decision last week 
permitting them to sue the city of chicago which operates ohare 
for damages may help 
the noise problem is especially intense at christmas time the 
busiest travel period of the year at ohare 
from friday through jan 2 26 million people are expected to 
fly through ohare said cynthiaval jones a spokeswoman for the 
chicago department of aviation 
departing jets passing overhead disrupt conversations 
televisions and radios and generally force everyday life to stop 
momentarily residents say 
its called the bensenville pause everything comes to a 
halt said glenn hahn who has lived for five years in 
bensenville a northwest chicago suburb located under an ohare 
takeoff pattern 
the decision by the 7th us circuit court of appeals returned a 
lawsuit over ohare noise and air pollution to dupage county circuit 
court where it may be consolidated with similar cases said joseph 
karaganis attorney for plaintiff lawrence c bieneman 
the court ruling is another one of the issues that has made 
ohare a symbol of troubles in the nations crowded skies 
after a startling 150 percent increase in the number of errors by 
air traffic controllers this year the federal aviation 
administration in october ordered the airport to cut the number of 
arrivals from 96 per hour to 80 during peaktravel times from 445 
pm to 915 pm 
just after thanksgiving the restriction was eased to 85 arrivals 
an hour said fred farrar a spokesman for the agency in washington 
the faa limitations were imposed after the number of controller 
errors reached 30 including four in one week there were 12 errors 
in all of 1987 and to date there have been 35 in 1988 said donald 
zochert an faa spokesman in chicago 
if youre flying in the morning there probably wont be much 
trouble but people should expect delays farrar said if you 
get a snowy day its going to be worse if its a good weather day 
it might not be as bad 
the faa restrictions should mean 15minute to 30minute delays 
over the christmas weekend said tom stack spokesman for american 
airlines second largest carrier at ohare 
were projecting handling 218500 people through ohare on the 
friday before christmas and on the monday afterward it gets ugly 
again with 215600 ms jones said 
normally 120000 people go through the airport on a daily basis 
she said 
ohare handled 203494 people dec 23 1987 and 152292 fliers 
the day after christmas last year she said on jan 2 1988 
147574 traveled through the airport 
the three dates are the heaviest travel dates of the year at 
ohare she said 
were not operating any more flights than we normally do were 
just putting more people on each plane said charles novak a 
spokesman for united airlines the largest carrier at ohare 
judy hoffenkamp who is cochairwoman of the bensenville 
environmental protection coalition a grass roots organization 
battling noise from ohare urged holiday travelers to fly in the 
morning 
if they do that and the airport cuts the number of evening 
flights i might be able to hear christmas carols and even be able 
to watch the news on tv and hear it she said

bogus valve parts are the latest counterfeit 
equipment problem to strike the nuclear power industry which 
earlier was hit with faulty bolts and circuit breakers 
the utility that discovered what the nuclear regulatory 
commission called counterfeit valve parts says they were found and 
weeded out before being put to use 
the parts were meant for valves controlling the steam supply to 
the turbines at the palisades plant of consumers power co near 
south haven mich said brian grimes of the commissions office of 
nuclear reactor regulation 
palisades is currently shut down to repair steam generator leaks 
but consumers hopes to restart it before the end of the year 
some of the questionable valve parts were installed after they 
passed special tests that showed they met specifications said paul 
knopick a company spokesman in jackson mich 
a bad parts failure might cause a valve to remain shut or open 
not responding to commands and that might cause an automatic 
reactor shutdown but would not mean a nuclear accident said grimes 
the commission staff last week issued a special notice to 
utilities asking them to be on the lookout for bogus valve parts of 
all kinds this could be difficult because a large nuclear plant 
might have 40000 valves 10 times as many as a coal plant of the 
same power 
valves are quite frequently refurbished said grimes 
the notice said counterfeiting may extend to other 
manufacturers besides the company whose parts were misrepresented 
masoneilandresser co 
consumers power discovered the faulty parts when a repaired valve 
leaked grimes said some of the parts they had procured turned 
out to be misrepresented and counterfeit and an investigation by 
the manufacturer concluded there appeared to be a counterfeit 
market he said 
knopick would not go as far as grimes and say the parts had been 
misrepresented its too early to conclude that thats still 
under investigation 
counterfeit bolts and other fasteners were found in several 
places two years ago the commission staff has concluded that there 
is enough margin for error in plant designs so that no safety 
problem should arise more bolts than necessary are used and they 
are not stressed to the limit the commission staff says 
following the discovery of counterfeit circuit breakers in 
california earlier this year the commission staff ordered utilities 
to inspect breakers replacing those that didnt meet 
specifications with reports of findings by march utilities would 
have to justify retaining any that couldnt be inspected 
some instances of counterfeiting appear to be the relabeling of 
normal commercial equipment as having been manufactured under the 
stricter controls that are supposed to apply to items meant for 
nuclear plants officials said 
grimes said tuesday a different form of counterfeiting was 
recently found at the quad cities plant of commonwealth edison co 
in illinois a bigger circuit breaker than those involved in 
california had been put through a substandard refurbishment in 
which parts were used that were nongenuine and nonconforming 
dimensionally grimes said 
a number of activities are under way to identify the source of 
the refurbishment he said 
victor stello executive director for operations at the nrc said 
the staff expects to propose new regulations that would tighten 
requirements for inspection of equipment when it arrives from 
suppliers

depending on your outlook its a nineletter word for either 
frustration or fun the crossword puzzle which turned 75 today 
thrives because of those elements experts say 
it can be frustrating for instance to ponder what fourletter 
word matches the clue weddingcake artisan but fun to find that 
icer fits perfectly 
most of the problems we have in everyday life dont have 
clearcut solutions said will shortz editor of games magazine 
crossword puzzles have definitive answers and when you get that 
answer its a very satisfying feeling 
surveys show that 27 million people across and down the 
country do crosswords regularly and more than twice that many do 
them occasionally 
crosswords are descended from the ancient word square game 
elementary forms appeared in childrens books in england during the 
19th century but the modern crossword was invented out of 
necessity by arthur wynne editor of the fun supplement of the 
new york world 
it was the sunday before christmas and he had a page to 
fill shortz said the diamondshaped 31clue wordcross 
puzzle ran on dec 21 1913 and was an immediate hit 
a typesetter transposed the words four weeks later and the name 
crossword stuck a crossword cult formed among readers of the world 
other papers began running puzzles and by 1924 it was a 
fullfledged craze 
the blackandwhite crossword design showed up in jewelry and on 
dresses trains carried dictionaries and printed crosswords on the 
backs of menus the new york graphic magazine ran a contest with 
25000 in prize money 
simon amp schusters first publication was a book of crossword 
puzzles that sold half a million copies in a single year 
more and more newspapers printed puzzles with the notable 
exception of the new york times which dismissed them as a 
primitive sort of mental exercise that would soon fade 
the craze faded but the puzzles persisted by 1942 even the 
times had relented hiring simon amp schuster editor margaret 
petherbridge farrar to edit its crossword puzzle the influential 
grand lady of crosswords as shortz calls her stayed in that 
position until 1969 
mrs farrar helped bring themes humor and modern playfulness 
to crosswords shortz said currently a new school of puzzle makers 
favors even more puns jokes fresh definitions or clues pop 
culture references and the living language or nondictionary 
phrases shortz said 
virtually all of the puzzles printed today are written by about 
200 writers or constructors according to shortz with another 
1000 or 2000 people doing it occasionally 
it takes a lot of patience said maura jacobson who got her 
start under mrs farrars tutelage and now creates puzzles for new 
york magazine 
mrs jacobson a former kindergarten teacher onetime 
jeopardy contestant and trivia nut said it takes her about 
25 hours to write a typical puzzle somewhat longer than other 
constructors she said 
mrs jacobson starts with her theme then lists themerelated 
words two of each length a true crossword is symmetrical then 
she crosses the theme words puts a black square where they end and 
fills in the rest 
sometimes you get to the point where you have a great corner 
everything crossing nicely and you find theres no such word 
said mrs jacobson who lives in hartsdale then you have to start 
over 
i go through more erasers than pencils she said with a laugh 
her 25 hours of work can be polished off in mere minutes by a 
worldclass solver like doug hoylman 45 an actuary from chevy 
chase md who won the american crossword puzzle tournament in 
august he does the washington post daily puzzle in about five 
minutes the new york times puzzle takes maybe 10 
i prefer to use pencils he said i make mistakes like 
everyone else and i have no need to impress anybody 
good solvers hoylman said have a broad range of knowledge and 
of course are good with words 
it takes the kind of mind more oriented to print than speech 
someone who thinks of a word as a group of letters rather than a 
sound he said 
rebecca kornbluh a 38yearold weaver who lives in mundelein 
ill won the us open crossword championship for three straight 
years but has retired from competition the brooklyn native still 
buys the new york times on sunday however 
theres not too much of a challenge anymore she said its 
only how fast you can do it and thats a way to miss the fun and 
subtlety of modernday crosswords the puns the wordplay the 
offthewall definitions 
according to these experts the most challenging puzzles can be 
found in games magazine the dell champion series and the 
sunday puzzles of newsday the san francisco examiner the boston 
globe the washington post and the new york times 
crosswords are popular because of the appeal of playing with 
words the humor in the clues and themes and because of the 
aesthetic appeal of the black and white squares shortz said 
theres something very attractive about those empty squares they 
just beg to be filled in

the federal aviation administration should 
quickly require commuter airlines to upgrade their passenger seats 
a sister government agency says 
the national transportation safety board made the recommendation 
on tuesday as part of its final report on last years fatal crash of 
a ryan air service plane in homer alaska that killed 18 people 
the report said the accident was partially survivable but 
found that none of the passenger seats withstood impact when the 
beech 1900c twinengine turboprop skidded to the ground just short 
of the homer airport runway there were only three survivors 
although the seats on the ryan air flight met current faa 
standards ntsb staff investigators and board members said there 
could have been fewer casualties if the aircrafts seats were 
designed better for years board member jim burnett said the ntsb 
has been urging the faa to adopt the tougher standards 
adding to the severity of the accident was the failure of the 
faa to adopt adequate standards for seat design burnett said 
the faa already requires new commuter airliners to have improved 
passenger seats and is considering a rule that would require 
existing commuter planes to have older seats replaced with the 
better models faa spokeswoman theresa greco said 
the ntsb blamed the nov 23 1987 crash on the flight crews 
inadequate supervision of cargo loading before takeoff the 2100 
pounds of cargo was loaded too far to the aircrafts rear causing 
the pilot to lose control when he attempted to land the board said 
the captain should have known said acting ntsb chairman 
james l kolstad 
the boards report concluded that the crew members who were 
killed employed improper procedures to determine the airplanes 
weight and balance 
te plane had a crew of two and 19 passengers many of them 
hunters traveling with guns and boxes of frozen venison when it 
plummeted to the ground short of the runway 
investigators had believed that ice on the plane may have caused 
the crash but the board said the ice did not cause but may have 
exacerbated the loss of control 
ryan air had served more than 80 communities in alaska making it 
the states biggest commuter airliner but the carrier has suffered 
10 accidents in the last eight years including four fatal crashes 
and was facing fines from the faa for poor recordkeeping and other 
deficiencies 
the airline has sought protection from creditors under chapter 11 
of federal bankruptcy laws and in january its planes were grounded 
as part of a consent agreement with the faa it resumed flying in 
july with 11 planes serving 36 cities 
the staff report was adopted on a 41 vote with burnett voting 
no because he first wanted to see changes in wording that were 
agreed to in the boards meeting

when sam lieberman was a boy in minneapolis he 
spent many nightmarish nights crying at the bedside of his mother as 
she recounted the horrors of the auschwitz death camp 
i really had no choice but to listen because my father 
wouldnt said lieberman one of more than 300 people from 15 
countries attending the sixday first international jerusalem 
conference of children of holocaust survivors 
the gathering which ends friday offered lectures on issues such 
as the pursuit of nazi war criminals and creative responses to the 
holocaust as well as tours of the yad vashem holocaust memorial and 
the western wall judaisms holiest site 
lieberman 40 said he attended the gathering to hear what 
others are doing with the baggage their parents left them 
his own childhood lieberman said was overshadowed by the 
suffering of his late mother fraida who spent nearly four years in 
auschwitz a death camp in nazioccupied poland 
when i heard my mother crying at night i would wake up and cry 
along with her she unloaded everything on me i was 8 when i first 
heard about auschwitz lieberman said holding back tears several 
times during an interview tuesday 
whenever a siren sounded in the neighborhood his polishborn 
mother would jump up and drag her children into the basement 
thinking it was an air raid said lieberman who works for a 
brokerage firm 
he and other children of holocaust survivors felt isolated from 
the rest of the jewish community because our parents were just so 
peculiar and crazy he said 
the feeling is shared by many of the about 900000 children of 
the worlds 15 million holocaust survivors said rabbi abraham 
cooper an associate dean of the simon wiesenthal center in los 
angeles one of the cosponsors of the conference 
in the past decade support groups have sprung up in the united 
states helping about 2500 people cooper said 
cooper noted that liebermans case was not typical because the 
vast majority of holocaust survivors would not talk to their 
children about their experiences 
most children of survivors dont know a lot about their 
parents said dulce moche 39 of san francisco we never asked 
questions because it generated too much pain 
ms moches parents were raised in the greek city of salonika 
where 95 percent of the 60000 jewish residents were killed by the 
nazis most of her parents relatives were killed 
her mother lena was sent to a prisoner of war camp instead of a 
death camp because she held an american passport 
my mother was a romantic person and for her the relatives 
never died she needed to maintain that illusion said ms moche 
an employee at a jewish community center 
the parents suffering had a profound effect on her ms moche 
said they made me feel that the world is a precarious and 
unstable place their fear shaped every aspect of their lives for 
example my parents were terrified of authority she said 
the refusal to confront the past is not only common among 
survivors but also among jewish communities overseas and in israel 
said yehuda bauer a professor of holocaust studies at the hebrew 
university of jerusalem 
those who came to israel after the holocaust were suppressed by 
those who already lived there bauer told the conference the 
israeli public couldnt comprehend what happened 
he argued that even though the holocaust is frequently at the 
center of state commemorations and public speeches it is usually 
misinterpreted to avoid painful questions 
our society is suffering from a collective trauma he said 
the only way to get out of this is to confront these problems 
bauer also said the holocaust is often used for political 
purposes every politician today is using the holocaust to back 
his political agenda bauer said 
he cited as examples claims by rightwingers that the plo is a 
nazi organization and charges by leftwingers that israeli troops 
crushing the palestinian uprising behave like nazis

last year imported food accounted for the first 
time for more than half the calories consumed by japanese people 
the agriculture forestry and fisheries ministry says in an annual 
report 
the report says the countrys food selfsufficiency rate dropped 
2 percentage points to 49 percent on a calorie basis during the 
fiscal year that ended in march japanese newspapers said today 
it was the largest oneyear drop in the rate since 1973 when it 
also declined 2 percent the report said 
the ministry attributed the drop to rising consumption of dairy 
products meat and other imported goods accompanied by a gradual 
decline in the amount of rice in the japanese diet 
the united states and other trading partners have pressured japan 
to open its market wider to agricultural imports particularly rice 
japan has maintained a policy of selfsufficiency in that grain 
which it says is necessary for national security as a basic 
foodstuff 
japan is the biggest importer of agricultural products among 
developed nations and the largest purchaser of us farm products

the environmental protection agency says it is 
powerless to stop sharon steel corp from operating a coke 
production plant without required antipollution controls 
we dont have epa troops we cant go out there and surround 
the place said lee blackburn of epas regional office in 
philadelphia 
blackburn said in interviews this week that sharon steel is 
risking possible fines by operating its monessen pa plant without 
antisulfur emission controls that are required by a federal court 
consent decree 
each day the plant continues to run without the controls exposes 
it to possible fines of up to 50000 a maximum of 25000 per day

state on nov 14 even though a required inspection of the plant had 
not yet taken place the inspection by state and epa officials

was a procedural thing the plant had already been in operation 
before said susan woods a spokeswoman for the pennsylvania 
department of environmental resources

without the pollution equipment regardless of what the state agency 
did

the navy has made gains against racial bias but 
it still discriminates against blacks and other minorities in 
recruitment and other areas an internal navy report says 
minorities are succeeding in the navy but in spite of this 
progress and the realization of significant growth in career 
opportunity shortfalls continue for minorities in accessions 
promotions advancements and distribution the report said 
the navy must strongly reinforce its continuing commitment to 
equal opportunity programs and efforts the report said much 
remains to be done 
the inchthick report which summarizes a special internal 
analysis of navy personnel policies ordered by the chief of naval 
operations was released earlier this week the study was performed 
by a naval group of 24 men and women and offers some candid advice 
to adm carlisle ah trost the chief of naval operations 
the panel recommended 75 different changes or new initiatives to 
trost and the navys top admiral has accepted all 75 the service 
said tuesday 
the study group reported that black and hispanic sailors and 
officers are more likely to receive lower marks on their evaluation 
reports that a majority of sailors say they have heard racial 
jokes or slurs at their commands and that the navy has not done 
enough to educate officers on their responsibility to promote racial 
equality 
the navy also has failed to direct its recruiting advertisements 
to minority neighborhoods and to direct minorities into the 
technical specialities or ratings where they have the best shot at 
promotion the group found 
the group recommended more funds for recruiting minority 
officers and new initiatives at navy training centers around the 
country to guide minorities into technical ratings 
and it also concluded that all officers on the way to executive 
officer or commanding officer assignments receive training 
covering the navys equal opportunity goals significant minority

a 46yearold transient was arrested tuesday in 
connection with a womans strangulation the latest of 40 slayings 
under investigation by a task force trying to determine if the 
deaths are linked 
alan michael stevens was taken into custody tuesday morning by 
members of the metropolitan homicide task force in his van in san 
marcos 38 miles north of san diego said san diego sheriffs sgt 
liz foster 
stevens who was living in the van was arrested for 
investigation of the murder of cynthia lou mcvey 26 of livermore 
calif whose nude body was found dumped nov 29 near a highway in 
northern san diego county 
the task force will look at him to see if theres any 
possibility hes linked to any other cases said foster 
a connection between the deaths of the 40 slain women remains 
under investigation as does a possible connection to the 40 green 
river serial killings and eight disappearances in the pacific 
northwest 
there are similarities between the killings in san diego and in 
washington and oregon most of the victims were strangled and their 
bodies dumped outside cities and the killer or killers targeted 
prostitutes or street people 
but lt dan nolan of the kings county police department in 
seattle wash told the timesadvocate of escondido calif that 
there was apparently no connection between stevens and the green 
river killings 
nolan said investigators were given stevens name some time ago 
by san diego investigators and do not believe he is the person they 
are seeking 
foster said stevens arrest was the result of evidence obtained 
after the discovery of mcveys body but couldnt release details 
the sergeant did not know stevens occupation or hometown 
mcveys death was caused by asphyxiation due to strangulation 
according to the coroners report she was a transient from the san 
francisco area and according to her husband she was a drug user

we cant do that in america justice john mowbray said 
tuesday of sheens january 1987 protest although a ruling wasnt 
issued immediately two other justices on the fivemember court also 
spoke in favor of sheen 
the actor was arrested as he arrived at the nuclear test site 65 
miles northwest of las vegas for a protest after stating on good 
morning america that he would hopefully commit civil 
disobedience 
justice of the peace bill sullivan gave sheen 48 hours to post a

a criminal act is enough to require the bond

statements could be construed as a threat of imminent criminal 
behavior 
this is a tremendous victory for all of us who speak out 
against the arms race sheen said adding that he plans to

said dick tepp committee chairman it would only help us 
he said no other city could match seymours research of the 
origins of the hamburger the group even has asked the daughter of 
the supposed hamburgerfounder charles r nagreen to help 
nagreens sole survivor violet gauerke of appleton said her 
father was 15 years old when he coined the name of the hamburger to 
refer to the fried ground beef patties served at the outagamie

pipes in the savannah river nuclear material 
production plants cooling system may have been cracked when they 
were installed 30 years ago a federal energy official says 
richard starostecki the energy departments deputy assistant 
secretary for safety health and quality assurance said tuesday a 
team of department and private industry experts has been formed to 
determine the cause of the cracks and when they occurred 
the pipes may have been cracked when many of them arrived at the 
plant to be installed during the 1950s he said however he also 
said they may have been damaged during the installation itself or 
later during plant operations 
all three savannah river reactors have been shut down since 
summer for safety upgrades and maintenance they are the nations 
only source of tritium a radioactive gas used to boost the power of 
nuclear weapons 
officials at the du pont co operators of the plant have said 
they hope to have at least one of the reactors operating by late 
spring or summer the 300squaremile facility is near aiken sc 
the energy department learned dec 8 of cracks in a main cooling 
line that had been found months earlier by engineers for du pont 
the cracks were found in a section of pipe removed last year 
another crack was found friday in the auxiliary cooling line of 
another savannah river reactor 
pipes in the plants cooling systems are periodically replaced as 
needed following inspections starostecki said 
du pont officials were quoted in wednesdays editions of the 
augusta ga chronicle as saying the defective material wasnt 
pipe but components such as cast stainless steel nozzles or parts 
of valves used to join cooling pipe to the reactor vessel 
starostecki was quoted by the georgia newspaper as saying that an 
internal du pont memo dated april 19 indicated that stainless steel 
replacement pipe was found to contain cracks which du pont 
employees tried to mend themselves 
dr joseph spencer du pont program manager for reactor 
technology and scientific computations told the newspaper yes 
there were cracks in plant components but they were carefully 
examined and repaired before being put in there is no safety hazard 
to the reactor 
several of the components had surface cracks that were 
formed during the manufacturing process spencer told the 
newspaper these cracks have been continually monitored and no 
growth has occurred 
the cracks may not have been there when they were installed 
but the problem may be the things that were done in the 
installation or water chemistry control starostecki said 
another problem may have been du ponts timing in notifying 
federal officials starostecki said adding that the plants 
operators knew in march about the cracks that were reported to the 
energy department in december 
starostecki said he did not know how soon the team would present 
its findings

bathroom and eat it there 
after a judge said gray could be sent to a foster home ms gray 
enlisted the care of diet expert dick gregory of plymouth and in 
june the two joined 11 others under gregorys care 
they told us when we first got here that within seven days our 
appetite would be gone gray said monday i had a lot of doubts 
about that because i ate a lot of food then came the third day 
and my appetite was totally gone 
ms gray whose weight complicated her respiratory problems said 
she has gone from using a wheelchair to walking for three hours 
every day 
the grays who live in duxbury are leaving gregorys supervised 
care six months early so that joseph can return to school but they 
dont expect to revert to their old habits 
i know its going to be different gray said i used to

by the end of a 13day trade fair soviet 
officials found the american business world a bit baffling but the 
more than 300 million worth of contracts signed at the exhibition 
left them eager to learn more 
and along with the contracts they believe the fair made a great 
advance in reducing misconceptions about soviet goods 
there was a myth that us tariffs should not be reduced 
because the soviets didnt have anything worth selling the myth is 
dead said vladimir n cheklin senior vice president of the 
usussr trade and economic council 
the contracts signed at the fair which ended tuesday included 
exportimport and joint venture agreements for products ranging from 
chemical equipment to sweatshirts said bagrat arutyunov foreign 
exhibitions chief of the soviet chamber of commerce but the soviets 
admitted there were some segments of the market they had misjudged 
they had expected americans love of home appliances to spark 
strong interest in their highfidelity equipment and proudly 
displayed their best turntables however cheklin said they found 
out that phonographs are losing ground to cassette and compactdisc 
players 
now we know better where to concentrate our efforts he said 
and computer software teaching high school chemistry was designed 
with the assumption that american students have a better grounding 
in sciences than they actually do said alexy botcharov of the 
soviet academy of sciences 
the fair which opened on the day soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev cut short his new york visit was the first in which the 
cost was borne entirely by the soviet companies involved rather 
than relying in part on government support it also was a departure 
from previous exhibitions in terms of style 
there was little political or nationalist propaganda just a few 
flags a slide show and a photograph of gorbachev aside from some 
displays of books and art objects the products on display showed 
few overt indications of where they were made few trade names were 
in the cyrillic alphabet 
such westernizing of soviet products was seen as a paradox by 
some people at the fair on one hand it may be necessary to 
overcome soviet goods reputation of shoddiness said greg rohn of 
canadas winchester co which distributes soviet products there 
but he added it seems that russian products are starting to 
become almost trendy as relations with the west improve 
the soviet simvol cooperative hopes to capitalize on that aspect 
with its line of tshirts and sweatshirts emblazoned with russian 
slogans and the logo of moscow state university john odoxta of 
sanctuary music a us company involved in a joint venture with the 
cooperative said the shirts were popular souvenirs among fair 
visitors 
that was a heartening sign for future business but current us 
tariffs plus manufacturing costs meant that selling the shirts at 
us market prices brought him a 20pershirt loss 
arutyunov said one of the most important aspects of the contracts 
signed at the fair was the guidance that western firms would be able 
to provide in marketing and advertising because communism had long 
eschewed such capitalist techniques 
i can honestly say were in the stone age in advertising he 
said

york international was broadcasting on an unassigned am frequency 
the fcc was violating first amendment rights to free speech 
mcnaught rejected those arguments noting that the government 
said numerous stations could be subject to interference if the sarah 
broadcast 
the first amendment does not guarantee anyone the right to 
broadcast by radio the judge wrote 
the judge also said international agreements ban the 
establishment of radio stations aboard ships outside national 
territories 
weiner maintained that the sarah is an international ship because 
it is registered in sealand a selfproclaimed principality in the 
north sea off the coast of britain but prosecutors argued that 
britain does not recognize sealand 
the fccs licensing requirements guarantee orderly use of the 
airwaves the defendants cannot hope to evade these requirements by 
taking to the ocean waves us attorney frank mcnamara said after 
the judges decision issued dec 13 
gutman said he is studying the ruling and probably will file an 
appeal 
the sarah has broadcast only twice from more than three miles 
off shore in july 1987 radio new york international operated off 
long island for about four days before agents of the fcc and the 
coast guard boarded the ship and stopped broadcasts 
this fall the sarah was registered as a maine pleasure boat and 
headed back to the waters off long island broadcasting for another 
four days before the temporary restraining order was issued 
weiner has since sold the ship to a british company but has a 
fiveyear option to repurchase

vendors in the souvenir 
stalls around the church of the nativity are keeping their christmas 
lights and ornaments in packing boxes this year 
in honor of the palestinian uprising city officials are refusing 
to sponsor holiday celebrations in the birthplace of christ 
israeli soldiers stood guard tuesday as israeli civilians 
employed by the army built a platform for a choir concert to 
entertain the hundreds of pilgrims who officials hope will come to 
worship in bethlehem on christmas eve 
but arab officials in this west bank city have decreed that there 
will be no municipal decorations this year and no traditional 
holiday reception for diplomats or boy scouts on parade 
it is a protest for those killed injured and detained said 
the towns palestinian christian mayor elias freij the people 
are not in a mood to celebrate or rejoice 
more than 330 palestinians have died in clashes with the israeli 
army since they launched their intefadeh or uprising against 
israels 21year occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
thirteen israelis also have died in the 12 months of unrest 
the underground leadership of the uprising has declared dec 24 
a national day of mourning calling a general strike to close 
shops and restaurants on the normally busy holiday eve 
for its part israels tourism ministry has tried to maintain 
some semblance of christmases past 
nothing has changed in the intrinsic meaning of christmas in 
bethlehem it said in a statement no secular municipal action 
will either dampen the religious fervor of pilgrims or mar their 
freedom of worship in bethlehem 
to this end the ministry is sponsoring christmas eve 
performances by choirs from switzerland spain and the shiloh 
baptist church in washington dc 
roman catholics anglicans and other christian denominations have 
put out pamphlets publicizing events ranging from the catholic 
patriarchs procession saturday afternoon to midnight masses in 
bethlehem chapels 
just how many pilgrims will travel to bethlehem for christmas 
rites is uncertain tourism for the year is down 14 percent and 
israel admits many potential visitors have been frightened away by 
the daily reports of clashes 
peace and joy were not part of the mood tuesday on manger square 
outside the church of the nativity which covers the grotto where 
the bible says christ was born 
israeli soldiers lounging near the undecorated municipal tree 
were pelted with stones by palestinian youths who then fled up a 
narrow street in the arab market street hawkers complained of bad 
business 
the holiday sadness extends deep into the palestinian community 
including among its christians 
there are an estimated 35000 christian arabs in the occupied 
territories and about 100000 within israeli borders according to 
geries s khoury director of the alliqa center for religious 
studies and chairman of the religion program at bethlehem university 
khoury a greek catholic says there will be no christmas 
presents for his wife and four children no festive dinner at his 
home 
the only present i would like to give them is the story of the 
suffering of my people khoury said 
nicholas canavati owner of a large bethlehem souvenir store 
said he and other businessmen were called in by israeli officials 
this week for what he described as a gentlemanly talk 
he said the officials asked if it wouldnt be better for business 
if stores got out their decorations 
i said yes canavati says but i told them there are more 
important things than business 
his store remains unadorned and he is unconvinced flashing 
lights and colored ornaments would be a lure 
why should anyone come to bethlehem when the town is full of 
arms and soldiers rather than peace which is the symbol after all 
of the man born here canavati said

the government released 281 political 
prisoners today as part of a sweeping amnesty and the freed 
dissidents vowed to topple president roh taewoo and drive us 
forces out of south korea 
roh ordered the amnesty involving 2015 politically motivated 
offenders as part of efforts to defuse nationwide furor over 
demands for the punishment of former president chun doohwan for 
human rights abuses and corruption under his authoritarian regime 
in addition to the releases the justice ministry said the civil 
rights of 1581 dissidents had been restored the sentences of 92 
people reduced and 61 fugitive radical students dropped from police 
wanted lists 
dissident leaders charged that 300 political prisoners remained 
in jail and dismissed the amnesty as a government trick to 
perpetuate its control 
released prisoners and supporters called for rohs fall and the 
expulsion of the 42000 us troops based in the country 
park sukyook a dissident freed from a prison in the southern 
city of kwangju told supporters all prisoners of conscience must 
be freed to realize democracy i will fight together with my 
comrades until the military dictatorship is terminated in this 
land 
drive out the yankees dozens of protesters chanted in 
chongju south of seoul as they greeted moon booshik who was 
serving a 20year sentence for his part in a 1982 attack on a us 
cultural center in the southern port of pusan 
kim hyunjang also involved in the pusan attack ridiculed the 
amnesty i am sorry to be released when many comrades are still 
held in prison he said 
one person died and three others were injured when the pusan 
center was set on fire in an antius protest dissidents contend 
washington supports authoritarian rule in south korea and demand the 
withdrawal of us forces based in the country under a defense 
treaty 
a government spokesman who declined to be named warned the 
released dissidents not to engage in violent antigovernment 
protests 
the government will deal sternly with radicals future actions 
which are seen as defying the nations free democratic system he 
said 
justice ministry officials said 224 antistate criminals 
remained in jail but said nearly all were communist north korean 
spies 
roh appealed to the nation last month to forgive chun and 
promised to free political prisoners as part of a series of measures 
to wipe out vestiges of the chun government 
many south koreans still identify roh with his predecessor 
although the new government has dismantled chuns authoritarian 
controls and helped introduce widespread political reforms 
chun a former general who took power with military backing in 
1980 went into voluntary internal exile last month after 
apologizing to the nation for abuses under his rule 
the opposition parties are demanding chun appear before a 
national assembly probe before the question of the pardon proposed 
by roh is addressed roh wants chun pardoned without further action 
dissidents and some mainline opposition leaders hope to use 
controversy over chun to generate opposition to roh a former 
general who won presidential elections last december dissidents 
have little public support but many koreans are angry about chun 
and want some kind of action 
prime minister kang younghoon said in a statement tuesday the 
amnesty is aimed at completely resolving the political controversy 
that has been going on for months over the question of politically 
motivated offenders 
among those having his civil rights restored was kim taekun a 
leading dissident who won the robert kennedy human rights award 
kim released in june drew five years in 1986 on charges of 
attempting to overthrow the government and spreading pronorth 
korean propaganda 
kim claims he was forced to make a false confession under torture

an elderly couple chose to die with 
dignity in a murdersuicide pact rather than face life in a nursing 
home according to a letter they wrote to a newspaper columnist 
before their deaths 
bernard and frances sheingold both in their 80s were found dead 
in their bedroom last week both were shot in the temple apparently 
with a pistol found between them said detective sgt tom weschler 
i have a choice of going into a living cemetery but i do not 
have a choice to be put to sleep peacefully as my pet has mrs 
sheingold wrote columnist charles whited of the miami herald why 
do we treat our pets better than we do our seniors 
whited wrote in the newspaper tuesday that he had never met the 
couple 
their letter apparently written just before their deaths told 
of the problems they faced as mrs steingolds cancer worsened and 
her husbands health deteriorated and of their fears of entering a 
nursing home 
i have been in one of the socalled best homes in miami and 
it was a horror she wrote all the seniors i have talked to opt 
for the pets solution 
she bitterly criticized the medical system for passing them 
around from specialist to specialist without being able to help them 
the doctors treat us as if we were money machines her letter 
complained 
sheingolds 55yearold son earl also received a letter saying 
the couple could not take the strain of living any more 
he described his parents as the above average intelligent 
allamerican people next door and said they had been together for 
60 years 
sheingold said the weekend before their deaths his father who 
had tended to his wifes health but refused to go to the doctor 
himself had begun speaking of an obituary 
some months earlier they had asked earl sheingold to buy a gun 
although he at first resisted he gave in knowing they would 
eventually buy it themselves he said 
they planned their deaths carefully laying out keys notes and 
special instructions he said 
they then got into bed and bernard sheingold apparently fired a 
shot into his wifes head 
i think he waited until she had dozed off the son said 
she looked like she was sleeping when it ended my father was in a 
halfsitting position very peaceful like somebody who was going to 
watch tv 
he said he did not hate his parents for what they did 
its hard to accept but i know theyre better off the son 
said i love them more now than i ever did

prime minister rajiv gandhi of india and chinese 
leader deng xiaoping agreed today to restore friendly ties between 
the worlds most populous countries despite a longstanding border 
dispute 
welcome my young friend the 84yearold senior chinese 
leader said to gandhi 44 as the two leaders met in the great hall 
of the people 
beginning with your visit we can restore our relationship as 
friends deng said the two countries leaders will become 
friends the countries will become friends the people will become 
friends 
i agree and would like to thank you for your warm welcome 
gandhi said 
deng said he knew gandhis grandfather jawaharlal nehru who 
came to china in 1954 the last indian prime minister to do so 
in the considerable period of time in between there was 
unpleasantness with each other deng said but let us forget it 
we should be looking forward 
later at a speech at presitigious qinghua university gandhi 
summed up the goal of his fiveday trip 
i have every hope that during this visit we will together with 
our chinese friends build a better political climate for the 
solution of the border issue he said 
in the past india has said it would only improve bilateral ties 
once progress was made on the border 
i am heartened that the chinese leadership is more than 
prepared to put behind us past rancor and past prejudices gandhi 
said i am heartened that we are both prepared not to be mired in 
the past 
chineseindian relations were good in the 1950s but a boundary 
dispute led the two countries into war in 1962 
china claims 36000 square miles of indian land india rejects 
the claim and demands china return the 15200 square miles it took 
in the 1962 war 
during gandhis visit china and india are expected to sign 
agreements on civil aviation border trade and science and 
technology consular offices in shanghai and bombay may also be 
established 
little progress is expected on the border 
gandhi arrived in beijing on monday and spent most of the day 
meeting with premier li peng his visit marked the first time indian 
and chinese leaders have met since 1960 when thenpremier chou 
enlai went to new delhi 
gandhi and li discussed the border problem and gandhi called for 
a renewal of friendship between the two nations 
it is now time to look beyond the past gandhi said at a 
banquet monday night it is now time to look forward to the 
future it is now time to restore the relationship between our two 
countries 
in the past india has said it would only improve bilateral ties 
once progress was made on the border 
gandhi also discussed tibet trade and the cambodian conflict 
with his chinese hosts in talks his official spokesman described as 
warm cordial and very friendly 
on tuesday gandhi met with chinas president yang shangkun and 
again talked about chinas troubled region of tibet 
gandhi said his country will not interfere in chinas internal 
affairs the issue is sensitive because tibets spiritual leader 
the dalai lama fled to india in 1959 after an abortive 
antichinese uprising 
gandhi was to meet tonight with zhao ziyang general secretary of 
the chinese communist party on thursday he is to fly to the 
ancient city of xian and friday he will go to shanghai 
india was one of the first nonsocialist countries to recognize 
communist china soon after beijings 1949 revolution in the early 
1960s relations deteriorated over the border question and political 
disagreements 
relations began to improve in the late 1979s but the border 
remains heavily guarded the two countries began border talks in 
1981 but have made little progress in eight rounds the last of 
which was held in november 1987 
china has more than 1 billion people india the worlds largest 
democracy has a population of about 800 million

us customs service agents using blowtorches spent 
30 hours ripping apart the belly of a panamanian freighter before 
finding their version of a white christmas 4792 pounds of cocaine 
hidden in a secret compartment 
the shipment which was destined for holiday consumers brought a 
fiveday total of cocaine seized on two arriving freighters to 6733 
pounds according to authorities who said the shipments were from 
the same organization 
the amount confiscated made it one of the largest cocaine busts 
in us history said authorities who estimated the drugs street 
value at 50 million 
we had a little christmas party customs spokesman michael 
sheehan said 
the latest bust came tuesday after customs agents acting on a 
tip spent the weekend staking out the panamanianregistered 
freighter santo domingo express authorities said the 300foot 
ship originating from northern colombia docked at the miami river 
sheehan said 
no one appeared to unload the vessel and agents boarded and 
seized the ship after the captain tried to leave port monday 
sheehan said 
agents were forced to open sealed compartments in the empty 
vessels hold where they found nothing then spent 30 hours cutting 
through a ballast tank holding the cocaine which was numbered 
marked and stuffed into duffel bags authorities said 
this shipment was designed to be brought in during the holiday 
season woodrow kirk a customs agent told nbc news 
initial evidence suggests the two shipments are related said 
sheehan who did not elaborate on the theory 
i dont care what anyone says if you take 7000 pounds out of 
any drug organization its going to make a big dent said sheehan 
the investigation was continuing authorities said 
the captain who was the only person aboard at the time of the 
seizure was arrested on smuggling charges his name was not 
immediately available said sheehan 
last thursday customs agents making a similar surveillance on 
the miami river boarded a haitian freighter and discovered 1941 
pounds of cocaine concealed inside a fuel tank 
three colombians seen driving away from the freighter cha cha 
were arrested as well as a colombian member of the ships crew 
sheehan said 
the customs services riverwatch initiative an intensive effort 
to slow the flow of drugs into miami ports has resulted in seven 
seizures totaling 10982 pounds during the past three months 
sheehan said 
cocaine has turned up in a shipment of kidney beans on a 
colombian freighter in a load of wicker furniture from chile and 
inside cans of glue from venezuela federal agents said 
the largest previous single cocaine seizure in the united states 
was 9230 pounds found inside a shipment of lumber at the port of 
tampa last april 28 previously the largest seizure was 8700 
pounds found stuffed inside hollowed wooden boards delivered to port 
everglades near fort lauderdale in november 1987

the us dollar reversed direction and finished 
lower against the japanese yen today while share prices rose 
sharply on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar finished at 12422 yen down 048 yen from tuesdays 
close of 12470 yen it opened at 12548 yen but then fell sharply 
moving in a wide range between 12410 and 12550 yen 
the currencys higher opening in tokyo after a 068yen gain on 
tuesday was attributed to similar trends on overseas markets but at 
the higher rates speculators and trading companies began selling 
dollars dealers said 
daiwa banks takamasa yamasaki said concerted dollarselling by 
speculative dealers and investment banks resulted in the currencys 
sharp drop from the mid125yen level in early trading 
but the majority of traders were sitting on the sidelines since 
the christmas holidays are approaching on overseas markets he 
said 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues a 9786point 
gainer tuesday added another 13025 points or 044 percent 
closing at 2968919 the index gained 4102 points in the morning 
session and rose sharply in the afternoon 
dealers said stock investors were in a cautious mood because of 
the fluctuation of the dollaryen rate in the currency market 
market players were wondering why the dollar was so high this 
morning but as it began falling participants uncertainties were 
erased which helped the nikkeis rise said a dealer with a major 
securities firm in tokyo 
the nikkeis afternoon gain also resulted from some foreign 
securities firms aggressively buying in the spot market and selling 
future issues priced higher in the simex market to make profits he 
said simex is a futures market in singapore where the nikkeis 225 
issues are listed wednesday was simexs settlement day for december

injured husband after a police officer called on his colleagues for 
help and they chipped in to pay for her bus ticket to south carolina 
its people like all of you that make life every day worth it 
have a merry christmas and thanks again samantha reed wrote in 
a tearstained letter she gave an officer before boarding the bus 
recently 
lt mike hibbs who was working offduty at the greyhound bus 
station was the first to notice mrs reed she looked like she 
had a problem he said 
mrs reed told police she was en route to nevada to visit her 
mother who has cancer when she learned that her husband had been 
seriously injured in an automobile accident back home in 
spartansburg sc 
but even after she turned in the unused portion of her ticket to 
nevada mrs reed did not have the 81 she needed to return to south 
carolina hibbs called local charities but couldnt find one open 
on the weekend 
sgt drew roberts took over when he relieved hibbs

roberts called his colleagues at the traffic division and asked 
that they donate 1 each to help the woman get home a dispatcher 
sent roberts message to patrol officers via the police mobile 
computer system

mir space station 
automated telemetry showed an overload in the computing 
complex soviet television said in a report from mission control 
a landing scheduled for 950 am moscow time 150 am est had 
been scrubbed and scientists were sending new commands to the 
computer in hopes of making a new landing attempt at 1 pm the

a moderate earthquake jolted kodiak island 
but there were no reports of damage or injury officials said 
the temblor which registered about 43 on the richter scale 
struck at 1049 pm tuesday and was centered about 10 miles north 
of the town of kodiak said alec medbery of the alaska tsunami 
warning center 
it was felt very strongly in kodiak but was not intense 
enough to knock objects from shelves he said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion in which every 
increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude thus a 
reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 
65 
an earthquake of 4 on the richter scale can cause moderate damage 
and 5 considerable damage the quake in which 131 people died in 
alaska in 1964 measured 84 on the richter scale

some national black leaders including the rev 
jesse jackson say its time the term black was replaced by 
africanamerican 
just as we were called colored but were not that and then 
negro but not that to be called black is just as baseless 
jackson said after mondays meeting of the black leaders 
the leaders met to discuss national goals and objectives and said 
they would meet in march to try to set a national black agenda 
jackson said 
to be called africanamericans has cultural integrity he 
said it puts us in our proper historical context every ethnic 
group in this country has a reference to some land base some 
historical cultural base africanamericans have hit that level of 
cultural maturity 
there are armenianamericans and jewishamericans and 
arabamericans and italianamericans jackson said and with a 
degree of accepted and reasonable pride they connect their heritage 
to their mother country and where they are now 
many of the leaders at the meeting including representatives of 
the national black republicans council the national black county 
officials and the national association for the advancement of 
colored people said the term africanamericans would be a

japan and the soviet union today agreed to resume 
talks on a peace treaty formally ending world war ii despite their 
failure to overcome a territorial dispute that has chilled relations 
for decades 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said the two sides 
had also agreed to prepare for a summit 
during the last summit meeting in october 1973 peace treaty 
negotiations stalled on a 43yearold dispute over a group of 
sovietheld islands that tokyo wants returned to japan 
tokyo and moscow have rival claims to the kuril islands off 
northern japan from which 17000 japanese residents were ousted by 
the soviets at the end of world war ii japan asserts a long 
historical right to the islands which now are fortified by 10000 
soviet troops 
shevardnadze gave an upbeat assessment of his two days of 
meetings with his japanese counterpart sousuke uno before flying on 
to manila today becoming the highestranking soviet official to 
visit the philippines since the two countries established diplomatic 
relations in 1976 
we have attained a degree of mutual understanding that allows 
us to speak of a new chapter in japansoviet relations said 
shevardnadze speaking russian that was translated into english 
an important step forward has been made that opens up good 
prospects for sovietjapanese political dialogue and for a practical 
development of our relations the soviet envoy said 
later however uno told a news conference there can be no 
peace treaty without a resolution of the territorial issue 
after shevardnadzes departure the two nations released a 
ninepage joint communique that made no direct reference to the 
territorial dispute but vaguely mentions difficulties existing in 
their bilateral relations 
citing the agreement on further meetings leading to a possible 
summit between soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and prime 
minister noboru takeshita shevardnadze said the talks had won a 
victory for reason for balance of interests and for a realistic 
policy 
he said he would meet uno in paris next month while attending a 
conference on chemical weapons and that uno would visit moscow in 
the spring 
japan has repeatedly invited gorbachev to visit this country but 
no date emerged from shevardnadzes visit 
asked about the territorial issue shevardnadze said the two 
sides had agreed to consider the historical and political aspects 
related to removal of difficulties pending in bilateral relations 
he did not directly mention the islands but did say the soviets 
had agreed on humanitarian grounds to consider increasing in 1989 
the number of locations where japanese can visit burial grounds of 
their relatives on soviet territory 
shevardnadze also said no concrete agreements had been reached on 
economic matters but we hope to promote economic cooperation 
he said the tentative agenda for a japansoviet summit would 
include agreements on protecting investments principles of economic 
cooperation and establishment of banking offices as well as treaty 
issues and other matters 
in 1987 twoway trade between tokyo and moscow totaled 49 
billion and accounted for just 18 percent of japans total trade 
it is expected to climb slightly to 498 billion this year 
shevardnadze who will visit north korea after the philippines 
said moscow had established trade and other unofficial relations 
with south korea but would not establish governmental relations with 
seoul an action that would further isolate its ally north korea

a us department of energy decision to 
negotiate a legally binding agreement with ohio to clean up a 
federal uranium refinery does not obligate the agency to do the same 
elsewhere a spokesman said 
the energy department decided tuesday to accept a consent decree 
that would enforce a 50 million federal agreement made nov 22 to 
clean up the portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant in piketon said 
spokesman doug elmets in washington 
a day earlier news reports indicating the energy department was 
backing away from a consent decree prompted state attorney general 
anthony celebrezze to insist that ohio had a commitment that federal 
officials should honor 
elmets said the department reached its decision after discussions 
with ohio officials and consultations with the justice department 
and the energy departments operations office in oak ridge tenn 
this decision was based on the same factors that influenced our 
decision on two earlier consent decrees in regard to fernald 
litigation elmets read from a statement 
he was referring to the announcement earlier this month of a 
courtapproved agreement that gave ohio authority to regulate the 
energy departments 1 billion cleanup of the feed materials 
production center a weaponsgrade uranium processing plant in 
fernald 20 miles northwest of cincinnati 
at that plant company documents released tuesday revealed that 
the former operator of fernald mistakenly donated a slightly 
contaminated dump truck to a local school board in 1950 
when officials at national lead of ohio realized the mistake 
they decided not to alert the school board because they didnt think 
the contamination level posed a health threat the documents 
indicate the whereabouts of the truck today is unknown 
the documents were released to the us house subcommittee on 
transportation tourism and hazardous materials which is 
investigating radioactive pollution at such plants for more than 
three decades 
elmets said the energy departments latest decision on the 
piketon cleanup does not mean the government will pursue similar 
agreements with other states that claim federal nuclear 
installations have polluted the environment 
the only precedential value to this decision is that we will 
continue to analyze lawsuits of this kind on a casebycase basis 
and if any state makes a similarly attractive and fair settlement 
we will give it the same serious consideration otherwise we will 
litigate elmets said 
ohio officials said they were satisified with the departments 
decision 
im happy were back at the negotiating table and are not going 
to waste our efforts on legal maneuvering celebrezze said adding 
that he would settle only for a consent decree because i want 
something thats enforceable in court ill settle for nothing 
less 
the piketon plant processes uranium for fuel for commercial 
nuclear power reactors it generates toxic wastes such as 
polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs solvents and metals as well as 
radioactive materials

three quebec cabinet ministers have resigned over 
their premiers defiance of a supreme court ruling that the 
predominantly frenchspeaking province allow the posting of signs in 
english 
the countrys highest court said last week that quebec may make 
sure that french predominates on outdoor signs but barred the 
province from preventing the use of other languages 
robert bourassa the provincial premier angered both english 
speakers and francophone militants on sunday with what he termed a 
compromise french must remain the only language on outdoor signs 
but other languages can be used indoors so long as french 
predominates 
environment minister clifford lincoln one of four english 
speakers in bourassas cabinet resigned tuesday and said he 
considered the socalled compromise a violation of individual rights 
in my beliefs rights are rights are rights there are no 
partial rights there are no indooroutdoor rights he said 
two of the other english speakers public security minister 
herbert marx and communications minister richard french quit later 
tuesday 
bourassa based his decision on a clause put into the constitution 
by western provinces as a protection against federal power that 
allows provinces or the national government to override a court 
decision 
the resumption of linguistic divisiveness in canada followed four 
years of general calm that made possible the 1987 meech lake 
constitutional agreement recognizing quebec as a distinct 
society 
only eight of the 10 provinces have ratified the accord named 
for the place in quebec where it was signed new brunswick and 
quebec have not 
premier gary filmon of manitoba described the quebec decision as 
a national tragedy and called for a national conference of 
provincial leaders to persuade the frenchspeaking province to 
accept the court decision 
which language can be used on signs is a volatile and symbolic 
issue quebecs french speakers 81 percent of the population 
consider essential to preserving their linguistic and cultural 
heritage 
bourassas plan prohibits languages other than french on signs 
both outdoors and in such places as shopping malls and interiors of 
public transportation facilities 
a crowd of 10000 attended a rally sunday in montreal demanding 
no changes in the language law which was passed in 1977 by the 
separatist parti quebecois government 
power in the province shifted from the englishspeaking minority 
to the french speakers in the 1970s separatist sentiment abated 
after the language law was passed and quebecs voters rejected 
sovereignty in a 1980 referendum

a federal audit found that the farmers home 
administration which makes loans to struggling farmers has 
accumulated losses of at least 36 billion a newspaper reported 
today 
the general accounting office said the agency would be unable 
to meet its outstanding debt obligations without additional 
borrowings or congressional appropriations according to the new 
york times 
people just dont realize how much money we are lending to 
farmers in this country said frederick d wolf director of the 
gaos accounting and financial management division congress is 
clearly going to have to deal with this problem next year 
the agency was created more than 40 years ago to provide 
lowinterest loans for farmers who have difficulty finding credit in 
the private sector 
the gao audit the first in the agencys history found that the 
agency had total liabilities of about 91 billion but the value of 
its outstanding loans was only about 55 billion leaving a 
shortfall of 36 billion 
the audit was for the fiscal year ended sept 30 1987 
weve seen nothing in the past year that would reverse the loss 
trend wolf said 
some of the loans are backed by land but others made to help 
farmers buy seed and equipment are not making recovery of those 
loans nearly impossible 
farmers who cant qualify for a bank loan or a loan from the 
federal farm credit system can come to the farmers home 
administration as a last resort 
by definition the borrowers are the least creditworthy and 
you better expect some losses wolf said 
farm loans under the program went from 60 billion in 1982 to 
almost 90 billion in 1987 due to the depression in the agriculture 
economy in 1987 losses grew by 22 billion 
last year congress approved a 4 billion bailout for the other 
major farmlending agency the farm credit system the government is 
under pressure to bail out insolvent savings and loan associations 
at a cost of about 50 billion

after tuesdays decision by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
biaggi who will remain free on bail did not attend the hearing 
a threejudge panel ruled unanimously in favor of biaggi who had 
been scheduled to start his sentence on jan 9 the 10term

mercy 
the elder biaggi who represented the bronx was convicted of 15 
counts of racketeering conspiracy extortion and receiving bribes 
for squeezing 18 million in stocks and cash from wedtech

judge constance baker motleys refusal to allow certain testimony by 
richard biaggis wife toni about a conversation in which she and 
richard agreed to give the elder biaggi a percentage of wedtech 
stock 
according to larossa toni biaggi had quoted her fatherinlaw as 
saying he would only take the stock if it was deemed to be within 
congressional ethical guidelines 
the eightyear term for biaggi is to run concurrently with the 
2year sentence imposed following his november 1987 conviction for 
taking an illegal gratuity and obstruction of justice in a case 
involving exbrooklyn democratic boss meade esposito

sen edward kennedy texas treasurer ann richards 
and other elected officials joined gay rights activists in attacking 
a state judge who said he gave a killer lighter punishment because 
his victims were homosexuals 
the recent actions of the state judge in dallas county violate 
the fundamental principal that everyone stands equal before the law 
the suggestion that those who kill homosexuals deserve shorter 
sentences is bigotry at its worst said a statement from kennedy 
dmass read at a tuesday night rally 
about 500 protesters many chanting no more hampton and 
others carrying signs that said bigot resign gathered at city 
hall to demand the resignation of district judge jack hampton 
dallas bears the shame for every day that he sits there and 
the world is watching william waybourn president of the dallas 
gay alliance told the protesters dallas cannot afford the image 
of hate for as long as he sits on the bench 
hampton told the dallas times herald in an interview published 
last week that he sentenced richard lee bednarski 18 to 30 years 
in prison instead of a maximum life sentence on nov 28 because in 
part the two men bednarski was convicted of killing were 
homosexuals 
these two guys that got killed wouldnt have been killed if 
they hadnt been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys 
judge hampton said i dont much care for queers cruising the 
streets picking up teenage boys ive got a teenage boy 
richards who gave the keynote address at the democratic national 
convention in atlanta last summer and is considered a likely 
gubernatorial candidate in 1990 also issued a statement that was 
read at the rally 
the constitution guarantees that when we come before our courts 
seeking justice our lives will not be given less or more value than 
the lives of others it said 
a statement from us rep john bryant dtexas said this 
manifestation of hatred in the midst of the christmas season cannot 
be met with silence it must be met with outrage 
hamptons remarks have mobilized the dallas gay community more 
than anything in years waybourn said before the rally 
the change is were not sitting on our hands were fighting

congressmen just returned from central american 
and caribbean countries said today the incoming bush administration 
should move quickly to take advantage of a new spirit of 
cooperation in the region to fight drug trafficking 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics said a 12day trip to 10 nations was 
highlighted by a breakthrough in cuba where president fidel 
castro offered to work in the effort the 10member congressional 
delegation returned tuesday 
rangel interviewed on nbctvs today said that political 
leaders in the region now see drug trafficking as a threat to 
their national security and theyre asking their friends in the 
united states to become partners in fighting against this drug 
epidemic 
there is an entirely different attitude weve seen in the 
leadership of these countries he said 
rangel said castro promised to provide the united states with 
intelligence on potential drug planes flying over cuba even if the 
aircraft do not land on that island country 
rep benjamin gilman rny also interviewed by nbc said the 
next step would be a summit meeting of regional leaders which was 
called for in a massive antidrug bill congress passed earlier this 
year 
we found there is a willingness and a desire to work 
cooperatively gilman said 
rangel said congressmen would meet with members of the new bush 
administration to help coordinate an antidrug policy 
were meeting republicans and democrats asking for a meeting 
with president bush the attorney general and the members of the 
cabinet to take advantage of this new spirit of cooperation he 
said 
in addition to cuba the congressional delegation visited mexico 
belize jamaica the dominican republican guyana trinidad and 
tobago meeting with heads of state at every stop 
if there is a common thread running through what we have 
learned at our various stops it is that there is a growing concern 
on the part of the various governments to come up with effective 
measures to fight the drug problem said rangel chairman of the 
house select committee on narcotics abuse and control 
the 1988 antidrug abuse legislation urges the assistant 
secretary of state for international narcotics matters to seek 
establishment of a regional antinarcotics center in the caribbean 
such a center would go a long way in helping to more 
effectively combat narcotics trafficking and drug abuse in the 
region said gilman 
rangel said the countries visited were willing to attend a 
hemispheric summit on drug trafficking and narcotics abuse but 
there was no indication when such a summit might take place 
the delegation also made these points 
mexicos newly installed president carlos salinas de gortari 
promised to make life miserable for the drug traffickers rangel 
said 
officials in belize revealed that crack cocaine had been 
introduced into the country 
trinidad and tobago authorities said they wanted to launch a 
national antidrug initiative while officials in guyana and the 
dominican republic pointed out that those countries recently passed 
antidrug legislation 
rangel and rep guy vander jagt rmich said they hoped the 
delegation could discuss their findings with presidentelect bush 
but there was no scheduled meeting yet 
in addition to rangel gilman and vander jagt the other members 
of the delegation were reps frank j guarini dnj william j 
hughes dnj solomon p ortiz dtexas george w crockett jr 
dmich kweisi mfume dmd and delegates walter e fauntroy

ballots 
during the news conference she waved about 700 blank ballots she 
claimed were found outside a police station

a defense department audit says the navy may 
have paid as much as 272 million more than necessary during 
198586 to its prime contractors for the phoenix airtoair missiles 
the audit also warns that the navy is set to award a contract to 
a second manufacturer without prior testing of its version of the 
missile it also says the service could save about 354 million in 
the next three years if it directly purchased 10 of the missile 
components it now buys through subcontractors 
the aug 22 audit performed by the defense departments 
independent inspector general and bearing the lowlevel security 
classification for official use only was disclosed tuesday by 
the project on military procurement a defense watchdog group based 
in washington 
the document focuses on contracts worth 684 million awarded 
between march 1985 and july 1987 for phoenix missiles the navys 
premiere missile for aerial dogfighting 
the latest model of the longrange supersonic missile is known 
as the aim54c and is carried by the navys f14 tomcat jet fighters 
the hughes aircraft co developed the missile and is the prime 
contractor but in 1984 the navy decided to bring on a second 
producer and competitor for hughes the raytheon co the second 
contractor is now fighting for annual production work 
according to the audit the navy overpaid hughes between 181 
million and 272 million in fiscal 1985 and fiscal 1986 by allowing 
the companys production line workers to take more than triple the 
amount of time hughes own internal labor efficiency standards would 
have allowed to fabricate each missile 
even if industry averages were used for labor efficiency instead 
of internal hughes standards hughes was given about twice as much 
time to build each missile as would normally be the case suggesting 
much inefficiency the audit says 
because the audit focuses on the navys handling of the contract 
rather than the companys performance hughes spokeswoman fran 
slimmer said the company would had no comment 
hughes a division of general motors corp designed the phoenix 
at its missile systems group headquarters in the los angeles suburb 
of canoga park and builds it in tucson ariz 
before awarding any more contracts the document suggests that 
the navy examine hughes assembly line labor efficiency but the 
navy refused in a written response saying such an analysis wasnt 
needed because future contracts would be based on competitive 
bidding 
the auditors countered that the navy really wasnt in the proper 
position to begin significant competitive bidding between hughes and 
raytheon because it hasnt conducted verification testing of 
raytheons missile to demonstrate its operational suitability

a jobscenter director who claimed that he was 
a priest and generated public sympathy after he offered to sell 
valuable lithographs to pay the centers bills admits he faked some 
of his credentials 
the man john daecheck also acknowledged he has had some brushes 
with authorities including an investigation of his publishing 
company by the us postal service and the state attorney general 
but daecheck 42 who also claimed to have led a congregation 
said he remains committed to helping the unemployed through his 
nonprofit new times service center in suburban glassport 
neal holmes owner of allied security of pittsburgh said monday

credentials 
in addition jack katona manager of union national bank in 
glassport said tuesday he would close the account daecheck opened 
monday with 500 he received from the sale of a lithograph 
katona initially agreed to daechecks request that the bank 
manager oversee all transactions in the account but decided to 
sever any connections with daecheck 
daecheck generated sympathy when he placed a classified ad to 
sell two 19thcentury lithographs saying he needed the money to pay 
an overdue phone bill at the center dozens of people offered to buy 
the lithographs or contribute to the center 
daecheck had told the associated press he was the pastor of an 
independent russian orthodox church called st pauls in washington 
pa and said the job center was a mission of the church 
but when pressed for details monday daecheck said he doesnt 
have a congregation or conduct services he further explained that 
st pauls church is actually st pauls mission part of allfaith 
church mission inc in washington founded by the revs harry and 
helen harrington

people based on the applicants knowledge of the bible and their 
belief in god

bible college but neither could remember which college

savanarolo theological seminary in scranton he said he was ordained 
in washington dc in 1981 by bishop james miller of the orthodox 
church of america that church was based in anderson sc and is 
separate from the more commonly known orthodox church in america 
daecheck said 
but the rector of the scranton seminary the very rev edward 
brzostowski said monday he had no records of daechecks attendance 
directory assistance in anderson sc had no listing for the 
church or miller 
caren mariani a deputy state attorney general said daechecks 
publishing company failed to publish manuscripts make refunds on 
time or register itself as a business with the state 
in june 1985 daecheck agreed to reimburse seven authors a total 
of 5354 to be paid over a 20month period the agreement does not 
constitute an admission of guilt mariani said records indicate 
daecheck has not completed the payments 
the postal service investigated daecheck but never charged him 
with any crime said postal inspector bruce stutzman

presidentelect bushs transition aides are 
soliciting advice from professional headhunters in determining 
how best to recruit people for hundreds of highranking jobs 
transition personnel director chase untermeyer said tuesday that 
employees of leading executive search firms have advised bush aides 
on things such as finding sources finding references and 
interviewing 
untermeyers office is charged with sifting through thousands of 
resumes that have been submitted for jobs in the new administration 
he said it is easy to learn the recruiting techniques used by 
private industry recruiters who are commonly called headhunters 
but while government and industry both aim to fill jobs with the 
most qualified people he said bushs nominees also must have a 
feel for te politics of the situation what the presidents 
programs are what the mandate of the election was 
the no 1 priority so far has been choosing cabinet members who 
will have a say in filling the subcabinet jobs untermeyer said 
several cabinet vacancies remain including the secretaries of health 
and human services transportation energy interior and labor 
key subcabinet jobs number several hundred they include the 
assistant secretaries and undersecretaries at the agencies 
commission members ambassadorships and judgeships 
the new administration will have about 4300 fulltime patronage 
jobs out of a federal bureaucracy of about 3 million untermeyer 
said 
in selecting nominees to high positions that require senate 
confirmation untermeyer said he and his six assistants pore over 
resumes and perform preliminary background checks before selecting a 
good grouping of about three people for each job 
those people will be interviewed by john sununu the designated 
white house chief of staff 
when he is satisfied that we have a good package off it will 
go to what will be a regular meeting with the president 
untermeyer said bush who will be inaugurated on jan 20 will make 
the selections he said 
those selected will be subject to various congressional and fbi 
examinations and will have to provide financial information before 
the president submits the nominations to the senate an appointment 
is final only after senate confirmation 
untermeyer made his comments at a briefing on the transition 
sponsored by the national press foundation 
john trattner of the nonprofit center for excellence in 
government approved of using management techniques similar to those 
employed by business in recruiting 
he said that by using such methods the bush administration 
should cut down on inappropriate hirings based solely on friendships 
and other nonprofessional criteria

president corazon aquino today 
declared a unilateral ceasefire with communist rebels for christmas 
and new years and called for a peaceful solution to the nearly 
20yearold insurgency 
mrs aquino said in a statement that government forces will 
suspend offensive military operations from midnight friday until 
midnight sunday christmas day and again from midnight dec 30 
until midnight jan 1 
all military and police forces shall maintain a state of 
readiness for security action and hot pursuit in the event of any 
attack or breach of the peace by any hostile group she said 
let this gesture be seen for what it is an earnest sign of 
our sincere desire for peace throughout our land not only in this 
gentle season but throughout the year that is coming and hopefully 
for all times 
defense secretary fidel ramos said the decision had been endorsed 
by chief of staff gen renato de villa and the department of 
national defense 
mrs aquino also said the government remains committed to the 
search for a peaceful resolution of the insurgency problem despite 
the breakdown of peace talks with the rebels last year 
we remain convinced that in the reformation of society and 
the improvement of the economy there is a congruence of objectives 
between the government and those rebels who are sincere about 
helping our people she said 
she blamed terrorist elements in the insurgency for the 
continued fighting but added that her government remained 
committed to the eventual reconciliation of all filipinos and the 
attainment of permanent peace throughout our country 
there was no immediate response from the 24000strong new 
peoples army the armed wing of the outlawed communist party of the 
philippines 
in a statement to news organizations last week the new peoples 
army said it traditionally observed a unilateral christmas 
ceasefire in areas where the fascist afp armed forces of the 
philippines does not attack the revolutionary forces and the 
masses 
the rebels said government offers of unilateral ceasefires were 
a hollow call devoid of sincerity because of stepped up military 
operations against them

the state court of appeals has struck down 
an ordinance adopted three years ago by voters in an overwhelmingly 
white detroit suburb that barred nonresidents from using city parks 
we are grateful this very racially divisive conflict may be 
brought to an end as we approach the season of peace said 
howard simon executive director of the american civil liberties 
union in michigan 
the ruling made public tuesday agreed with the aclu and the 
national association for the advancement of colored people that the 
ordinance adopted by voters in the detroit suburb of dearborn in 
november 1985 singled out blacks 
dearborn city attorney william hultgren said city officials are 
studying the ruling and probably wont decide whether to appeal for 
a couple of months 
there have been comments in the past by elected officials that 
it would be carried to the highest court hultgren said 
the ball is in the citys court because it could appeal but it 
would be my hope they would put this behind them and realize the 
interdependence of southeastern michigan simon said no 
community is going to be able to build walls around itself we are 
all interdependent and intertwined 
arthur johnson president of the detroit branch of the naacp 
said he was elated at the decision 
the decision upheld a wayne county circuit court ruling 
overturning the ordinance nonresidents have been free to use 
dearborn parks since the court fight began 
we really havent had any major problems we really had fewer 
problems after the court decision opened up the parks than before 
the court decision said doyne jackson director of citizen 
resources for dearborn 
the ordinance was approved after residents of dearborn complained 
that parks swimming pools and ball diamonds along the citys border 
with detroit were being used by nonresidents 
about twothirds of detroits 11 million residents are black 
fewer than 100 of dearborns 90000 residents are black 
besides restricting use of parks to dearborn residents the 
ordinance required park users to produce drivers licenses or other 
identification proving their residency if stopped by police 
banning nonresidents the appeals court said violated a 
provision in the michigan constitution prohibiting discrimination on 
the basis of race 
the court said in order to be discriminatory under that part of 
the constitution an ordinance need only have a negative effect on 
members of one race whether city officials intended to discriminate 
was irrelevant the court said 
the provision allowing police to stop park users violated 
portions of both the state and us constitutions barring 
unreasonable search and seizure because it gave police unfettered 
discretion the ruling said

plo chairman yasser arafat accused 
israel today of undermining the very positive talks between the 
united states and the palestine liberation organization 
israel is using all available means to undermine the 
dialogue arafat told a news conference during a oneday trip to 
yugoslavia 
no doubt that the dialogue with the us is very important and 
we are hoping that in the future it will have constructive results 
its initial results are very positive he said 
arafats explicit recognition of israels right to exist and his 
renunciation of terrorism led the united states to open talks with 
the plo in tunisia on friday for the first time since the united 
states banned plo contacts 13 years ago 
arafat said that israel is using ironfist policies and 
charged it is preparing largescale retaliation against palestinians 
in the israelioccupied territories where palestinians have been 
staging an uprising 
it is not by chance that on the day of the dialogue with the 
us the israelis staged a massacre in nablus arafat said five 
arab demonstrators were shot and killed by israeli troops in the 
west bank town on friday and a sixth wounded protester died today 
the agreement between likud and labor to form a coalition 
government in israel represents an agreement for war and not 
peace arafat said 
the coalition agreement between the two main israeli political 
parties bars peace talks with the plo and the establishment of a 
palestinian state it calls instead for negotiations with jordan and 
the palestinians on the basis of the usbrokered camp david 
accords signed in 1978 
the coalition agreement also calls for the expansion of jewish 
settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
arafat said the accord between the two israeli parties does not 
provide for an international peace conference on the middle east 
does not recognize independent palestinian state and envisages no 
negotiations with the plo 
arafats visit to yugoslavia one of a series that followed 
washingtons decision to open the dialogue with the plo comes as 
part of an apparent campaign to drum up support for an international 
middle east conference under united nations auspices 
his trip follows visits to east germany romania and austria in 
the past week arafat is to meet premier ciriaco de mita in rome on 
friday de mitas office said today 
the italian news agency agi also reported that arafat has 
requested a meeting with pope john paul ii arafat last met with the 
pope in 1982 vatican spokesmen could not be immediately reached to 
comment on the report

parliamentary debate on a tax reform plan that would 
give japan a sales tax turned into a raucous shouting match today 
when the governing party pushed the measures through a key committee 
session 
opposition legislators stormed from their seats after the upper 
house tax system committee chairman matazo kajiki interrupted nine 
hours of deliberations to call a vote 
the bills which would cut corporate and income taxes while 
introducing the new 3 percent sales tax already have been approved 
by the majority liberal democrats in the lower house passage in the 
upper house where the governing party also holds a commanding 
majority is expected friday 
the voting was carried live on national television 
viewers saw orderly rows of liberal democrats standing at their 
desks in a stoic yes vote while opposition members swarmed 
around kajikis podium roaring their disapproval 
committee members stood on nearby desks and grabbed at kajikis 
collar before security guards escorted the chairman out of the room 
earlier today opposition parties business groups and labor 
unions rallied in tokyos hibiya park to denounce the sales tax 
which would go into effect on april 1 police said 7000 people took 
part but estimates on news reports ran as high as 12000 
we have fought our hardest to get the tax bills withdrawn 
said takako doi chairwoman of the largest opposition japan 
socialist party we will continue to fight alongside you until the 
last 
news reports said opposition legislators would introduce 
noconfidence motions against prime minister noboru takeshita and 
other leaders before the upper house votes on the bills friday 
todays approval in the committee session was a key step toward 
effecting the first major overhaul of japans postwar tax system 
tax reform a top goal of takeshitas administration has eluded 
previous governments 
boycotts by a stubborn opposition derailed parliamentary debate 
on the measures after disclosures last summer that liberal 
democratic politicians including takeshita and former finance 
minister kiichi miyazawa profited from questionable stock dealings 
the scandal resulted in amendments to introduce taxes on capital 
gains a large source of political funds the government also is 
considering opposition demands to boost aid to japans growing 
elderly population 
the current extraordinary session of parliament ends next week 
the shimouma consumers cooperative association a tokyo

second day without a verdict 
the us district court jury which on monday began deliberating 
the conspiracy case asked tuesday to rehear sukhreet gabels 
testimony about a secret june 1986 meeting with miss myerson the 
jury also asked to rehear judge john keenans instructions on the 
law governing circumstantial evidence 
the jurors then returned to their deliberations recessing for 
the night they resumed deliberations this morning 
miss myerson who was miss america in 1945 her lover carl 
andy capasso 43 and former state supreme court justice 
hortense gabel 76 are charged with plotting to cut capassos 
temporary support payments to his estranged wife 
the three were charged with conspiracy mail fraud and aiding the 
violation of state bribery laws miss myerson 64 also was charged 
with obstruction of justice 
if convicted on all counts miss myerson could be sentenced to 30 
years in prison and fined 513000 her codefendants up to 25 years 
in prison and 263000 in fines

accused of giving a 19000ayear city job to mrs gabels 
daughter sukhreet to influence the judge who was making interim 
rulings in capassos bitter divorce from his wife nancy

walk around the block that you could be dangerous and that she 
should keep your mouth shut 
the prosecutions case against miss myerson capasso and mrs 
gabel consisted of mainly circumstantial evidence because there were 
no witnesses to the alleged bribe scheme 
the government presented more than 30 witnesses and 100 pieces of 
evidence to back up what they claimed were the illegal links between 
the two undisputed facts in the case ms gabel was hired as miss 
myersons special assistant in august 1983 and a few weeks later

the labor party today approved joining a 
coalition with the rival likud bloc virtually assuring the 
formation of a national unity government to run israel for the next 
four years 
earlier today the rightwing likud voted to approve the 
government after an overnight session marked by shouting and heated 
debate israel army radio said the two parties would formally sign 
their agreement thursday morning and the new government could be 
installed by parliament immediately 
at a meeting of the centerleft labors 1275member central 
committee party head foreign minister shimon peres urged the 
delegates to vote for the accord saying it was the only chance to 
stem israels growing isolation and conflict with its western allies 
the delegates voted yes by an overwhelming show of hands 
if a joint government with likud and labor had not been 
established this process of isolation and conflict with the world 
would have persisted peres said by building such a government 
such a process will be halted 
although peres was expected to win approval to join a likudled 
cabinet younger legislators argued heatedly against the proposed 
government saying it would be deadlocked over the peace process 
you once called likuds prime minister yitzhak shamir the 
murderer of peace now he has three lawyers on his team so he can 
murder it again legislator chaim ramon was quoted by israel radio 
as saying 
peres also said the joint government was needed to curtail the 
influence of ultraorthodox religious parties and would effectively 
bar passage of a controversial who is a jew amendment 
we didnt understand the extent of sensitivity among us jews 
about the law of return i believe that now this law will remain as 
it is peres said 
he referred to anger by american jews most of whom are 
nonorthodox over the proposal to accept only orthodox conversions 
to judaism 
peres also vowed that although he would become finance minister 
in the new government he would continue to work toward reviving 
peace talks with arab states the flag of the peace process 
remains in our hands it has nothing to do with a ministry he said 
the daily haaretz reported today that although peres will be 
finance minister a secret addition to the coalition agreement 
requires that he be consulted on all sensitive defense and foreign 
policy decisions 
the new cabinet expected to number between 23 and 25 ministers 
could be installed by a vote of confidence in a special meeting of 
parliament as early as thursday israel radio reported 
the government will resemble the current broadbased coalition 
that has ruled israel since 1984 one major difference is that 
shamir will be prime minister for all four years instead of 
switching after two years with peres 
it was unclear how many of the four religious parties would join 
the new government two of the parties shas and degel hatorah have 
said they would not join the agudat israel and national religious 
party also threatened to remain outside none of the extremist 
rightwing factions were expected to join the coalition 
the new coalition agreement a text of which was published by 
haaretz also bars both large parties from pulling out and forming a 
narrow coalition with smaller factions in the event of disagreements 
new elections would have to be held if the government is toppled 
by a noconfidence vote the newspaper said 
the coalition agreement bars peace talks with the plo and the 
establishment of a palestinian state it calls instead for 
negotiations with jordan and the palestinians on the basis of the 
usbrokered camp david accords signed in 1978 
the agreement also calls for the expansion of jewish settlements 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip and for the building of 
five to eight new settlements in the next year us officials have 
called such settlements an obstacle to peace 
likuds approval of the accord came just after 2 am in secret 
balloting by 1445 party central committee members after a 4hour 
meeting in which opponents fiercely denounced the agreement 
some 796 delegates or 551 percent voted for the accord with 
642 delegates or 444 percent voting against and three abstaining 
at the meeting many members questioned whether joining a 
government with labor would not blur likuds rightwing ideological 
stance 
shamir declared that a unity government had a common enemy to 
fight the ploproclaimed independent palestinian state 
despite the differences we must be united against the danger 
of a palestinian stateand the international effort to push us 
back to the illfamed 1967 borders shamir shouted israel 
captured the west bank and gaza in 1967 
hecklers interrupted his speech with shouts of boo and 
former defense minister ariel sharon led the opposition in demanding 
a government without labor 
we need a government in which one party has a majority 
sharon said labor is a danger to israels future and security

a judge convicted of tax evasion has become the 
15th judge from the cook county circuit court to be convicted or 
plead guilty on charges stemming from the operation greylord probe 
a us district court jury found judge john j mcdonnell guilty 
tuesday on three counts of tax evasion but could not reach a 
verdict on two counts of extortion and one count apiece of 
racketeering and obstructing justice 
us district judge james h alesia declared a mistrial on those 
counts and us attorney anton valukas said he would seek a retrial 
at a brief news conference after the verdict was announced 
valukas said he was convinced his staff had enough evidence to 
obtain mcdonnells conviction on the remaining charges 
valukas personally prosecuted mcdonnell with the aid of 
assistant us attorney tom durkin 
there is no question in my mind said valukas when asked if 
he thought it was worth prosecuting mcdonnell again 
the jurors deliberated one hour monday and most of the day 
tuesday before returning the verdict against mcdonnell 53 a former 
federal prosecutor 
mcdonnell who was appointed to the bench in 1971 faces a 
maximum sentence of nine years in prison on the three tax evasion 
counts 
since his indictment nine months ago mcdonnell has not sat as a 
judge but has received his full judicial salary 
mcdonnell was indicted by a federal grand jury march 16 along 
with retired cook county circuit court judge francis j maher sr 
the indictment accused the two of taking cash bribes to fix minor 
traffic drugs and weapons cases and of having steered such cases 
to certain lawyers 
mcdonnell was also accused of extorting bribes from attorneys and 
telling them not to disclose the extortion to authorities as well 
as of failing to report the alleged bribe money in his income tax 
returns 
defense attorney patrick tuite said after the verdict that the 
government built its case on the testimony of three admitted 
bribepaying former attorneys whom he called sleazebags 
the three bernard mann cyrus yonan and karl canavan have all 
pleaded guilty to paying bribes to judges 
operation greylord an undercover investigation of alleged 
corruption in the cook county court system was first made public by 
federal authorities in december 1983

residents near the polluted rocky 
mountain arsenal claim the cleanup of a chemical dumping pond has 
caused respiratory ailments and other health problems and they want 
the state to evacuate them 
gov roy romer on tuesday promised medical examinations for 
families worried about their health but said the evidence so far 
from the army the environmental protection agency and the state 
health department does not justify an evacuation 
he said the army under the cleanup begun last spring will put a 
footthick clay cap over contaminated soil by dec 30 to prevent 
blowing dust and fumes 
the group poisoned arsenal neighborhood of irondale community 
claims residents of a sixmile area suffer from ailments caused by 
chemicals stirred up during the cleanup at the site situated in a 
sparsely populated rural area 
if somebody brought me information at 4 pm today that those 
citizens are in danger id order an evacuation immediately romer 
said 
twice this month the army has evacuated workers during the 45 
million cleanup of basin f because of fumes from the 93acre dumping 
pond which was used by the army and shell oil for more than 30 
years to dispose of pesticides and byproducts from the manufacture 
of nerve gas 
the army did not notify the state or nearby residents of the 
evacuations saying monitors indicated the contamination did not 
reach residential areas 
more than 80 residents on the arsenals western border have 
signed a petition asking the state to buy their homes so they can 
move said ira daigle owner of a 95resident trailer park about a 
mile from the basin 
nobody complained about being sick before april and may he 
said when you talk to your neighbors and they say ive been 
sick ive been rundown and tired pretty soon we just got two and 
two together and we thought this smell must be doing something 
documents released under the federal superfund cleanup process 
say 150 chemicals were dumped in basin f 
adrienne anderson western director of the citizens group 
national toxic campaign said at least half the 80 chemicals she has 
analyzed are known or suspected carcinogens and the bulk are toxic 
if inhaled 
i have worked with evacuationlevel situations before and this 
certainly is one of the most serious situations i have seen it is 
certainly my opinion these people are being poisoned said 
anderson we have the position that the agents there are so 
dangerous that the governor should evacuate them as a precautionary 
measure 
symptoms reported by residents include headaches nausea 
dizziness severe skin irritation spitting up blood and severe 
upper respiratory tract irritation anderson said 
the symptoms residents are reporting correlate perfectly with 
the cheicals that have been identified by the army at the site 
anderson said

the county planning commission has 
nullified a permit allowing two oil companies to begin pumping crude 
oil and natural gas from three recently completed offshore platforms 
the commission invalidated the permit because the companies 
chevron usa and texaco inc underestimated concentrations of 
poisonous hydrogen sulfide in the natural gas county officials said 
tuesdays decision could delay production from the offshore oil 
platforms for as long as a year assuming a new permit is issued 
the oil companies will appeal the commissions ruling to the 
county board of supervisors chevron lawyer ralph mayo said a 
chevron official estimated each days delay in opening the platforms 
could cost both companies a combined 500000 
chevron and texaco have invested a combined 2 billion on the 
platforms pipelines leading onshore near point conception and oil 
and gas processing plants at nearby gaviota 
at the processing plants impurities would be removed from the 
crude oil and hydrogen sulfide would be removed from the natural gas 
before shipment to a refinery 
two of the platforms were to be operated by chevron and one by 
texaco 
the permit for pumping oil and gas was issued in 1985 based on 
findings that average concentrations of hydrogen sulfide in the gas 
would run about 7000 parts per million 
but it was later determined that the actual number is closer to 
15000 parts per million that finding led to tuesdays 50 vote by 
the planning commission to nullify the permit 
the finding means a considerably larger area would be exposed to 
lethal levels of the gas during a leak according to diane guzman 
director of the countys resource management department 
the companies had planned to process eventually up to 200000 
barrels of crude oil a day and 120 million standard cubic feet of 
natural gas

a crackdown on furloughs for inmates 
convicted of violent crimes means fewer texas prisoners will be 
allowed to go home for christmas 
texas department of corrections officials said they will release 
only 45 inmates for sevenday christmas furloughs compared with 160 
freed for the holiday last year 
of the 160 37 were convicted either of murder or involuntary 
manslaughter others included prisoners serving time for aggravated 
assault on a peace officer 
the furlough crackdown began after the presidential candidates 
this year traded accusations about violent prisoners given prison 
leave 
presidentelect george bush criticized his democratic challenger 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis for allowing violent 
prisoners in massachusetts to be released on furlough including 
willie horton a murderer who was charged with raping a woman after 
he failed to return from a weekend leave 
texas gov bill clements a republican joined in the criticism 
until he was forced to admit that similar policies were in effect in 
his state nearly 900 prisoners including 500 murderers were 
granted furloughs during clements administration 
the texas board of correction responded by narrowing the 
eligibility for furlough among those excluded were inmates with 
histories of sex offenses and those convicted of capital murder 
prison board chairman charles terrell said tuesday it was the 
boards intention to tighten up but not destroy the furlough 
program

president raul alfonsin today 
called for unity among soldiers and civilians after the armed forces 
chief and two generals resigned in an apparent concession to leaders 
of a military revolt 
gen jose dante caridi the army chief of staff and gens miguel 
abbate and enrique bianchi requested retirement tuesday for 
undisclosed reasons 
their ouster had been demanded by officers who led a fourday 
rebellion early this month the third army insurrection in 20 months 
gen francisco gassino 57 was named to replace caridi gassino 
has been loyal to alfonsin during military insurrections in april 
1987 january 1988 and dec 14 
in his address to congress this morning alfonsin made no direct 
references to the resignations or to allegations that the government 
struck a deal with the rebels but he made indirect references to 
the rebellion and called for unity among civilians and the military 
we are trying nothing more and nothing less to consolidate 
the transition of a united people toward dignity may god illuminate 
the way to do that alfonsin said during a 35minute speech to a 
packed special session of congress 
sen eduardo menem leader of the opposition peronist party bloc 
criticized alfonsin for not dealing directly with the cause of the 
insurrection and what the government did to end it 
the message of dr alfonsin contains a declaration of 
principles in which we all coincide but nothing was said about what 
happened he said 
the military ceded power to alfonsins elected government in 
1983 and there have been four different armed forces chiefs since 
alfonsins press secretary jose ignacio lopez said the 
president would meet after the speech with caridi and gassino 
it was unclear if alfonsin had demanded the resignations or 
intended to promote gassino to replace caridi 
the public view of alfonsins handling of the restive military 
could affect his partys chances in the presidential elections set 
for may 14 
the insurrection began dec 1 and was declared over by alfonsin 
on dec 4 but loyalist troops were reluctant to fight the 
estimated 800 rebels who had occupied part of a suburban army base 
the rebels were not immediately disarmed and most mutineers were 
allowed to return to their units 
in addition to the ouster of caridi and other top generals the 
rebels had demanded an increased military budget including pay 
increases and an end to the prosecution of officers for human rights 
abuses during the eight years of military rule that ended in 1983 
the opposition accused alfonsin of cutting a deal with the 
rebels who were led by col mohamed ali seineldin 
alfonsin denied making any deal nevertheless a 20 percent pay 
increase was granted to soldiers along with a 100 bonus 
the rebels insisted they had no intention of toppling the 
government but politicians and labor and business leaders said that 
by so severely undermining it that would be the result 
on saturday defense minister horacio jaunarena said in a speech 
that the socalled dirty war against leftist subversion in the 
late 1970s was necessary effectively endorsing the armys position 
and infuriating human rights groups 
at least 9000 suspected leftist subversives were abducted during 
the dirty war by argentine security forces and vanished without 
a trace according to a government panel 
caridis predecessor gen hector rios erenu departed after the 
first insurrection of alfonsins term in april 1987 that revolt 
was also touched off by the trials of officers for rights abuses 
the selection of caridis successor has political overtones if 
he is replaced by an open supporter of seineldin that would damage 
the credibility of alfonsin and of the governments claim the 
military is subordinate to it 
in a television interview friday caridi acknowledged he made a 
deal with seineldin saying the insurrection ended when both 
realized that our aspirations coincided and so the question 
why confront one another to produce bloodshed if what they rebels 
were asking the army was also trying to achieve 
caridi warned too that if rebels demands were not met there 
might soon be another insurrection

an armored car company offered a 
70000 reward for a gunwielding santa claus and helper who robbed 
two guards of more than 700000 the fbi said today 
police and the fbi said the straightfaced santa took two sacks 
of cash from dunbar armored security inc guards outside a united 
bank branch in a shopping plaza tuesday morning 
no shots were fired and neither guard was injured police said 
one guard was apparently inside the bank while the other was 
carrying the sacks to a van 
this is not a joke get up against the wall give me the bags 
of money the robber between 35 and 40 years old told the 
guards according to detective capt russell hughes 
the whitebearded robber dressed in a santa hat and trench coat 
and bearing a silver revolver hopped into a car with a male 
accomplice and drove off hughes said 
authorities suspect that the robbers tailed the armored car to 
the bank said terry shumard an fbi spokesman he said the two bags 
held more than 700000 in cash 
shumard said dunbar has authorized a 70000 reward for 
information leading to the arrests of the robbers 
its too bad people have to use santa claus like that because 
kids look up to him said a teller at the bank who would only 
identify herself as miss mroz this was really strange 
a farmington resident who witnessed the robbery followed the 
suspects car in his van for about a mile on interstate 84 and 
provided investigators with descriptions of the robbers lt anthony 
duffy said 
employees and the two or three customers inside the bank at the 
time were unaware the theft was taking place according to teller 
jane e neveu 
it was the third robbery of an armored car company in five years 
in the suburban hartford community of 60000 including the 1983 
theft of 71 million from a wells fargo depot the secondlargest

the government confirmed today that it 
thwarted an attempt to overthrow prime minister sadek mahdi last 
week and arrested 25 civilians and retired soldiers 
defense minister abdulmaguid khalil told reporters that the 
situation has been brought under control he gave no other details 
khalil was confirming a report in the newspaper alsiyassa 
the independent paper reported that security men had crushed an 
attempted coup on saturday and arrested 25 retired military officers 
and civilian officials from the former government of president 
gaafar nimeiri who was ousted in an april 6 1985 coup it was the 
third newspaper report of an attempted coup in sudan in the past two 
weeks 
after the alsiyassa report appeared today about 300 
demonstrators defied an emergency order and gathered in khartoums 
liberty square to demand government approval of a tentative 
agreement to stop sudans civil war 
the demonstrators in khartoums liberty square also ignored a 
decision by rally organizers to call off the protest because mahdis 
government declared a special emergency in the khartoum area 
mohammed osman mirghani spiritual leader of the democratic 
unionist party and the negotiator of the peace agreement with rebel 
leader john garang reportedly urged that the peace march be 
postponed 
garang head of the sudan peoples liberation army began his 
civil rebellion in early 1983 to press demands for what he considers 
fairer economic political and administrative treatment for southern 
sudan 
mirghani told demonstration organizers that new developments in 
the picture made a postponement of the rally necessary in the 
interests of peace the independent newspaper alayam reported 
riot police and plainclothes security men ringed the square as 
protestors chanted no no to war and yes yes to peace 
witnesses said police confiscated several placards before the 
demonstration began but did not intervene at the gathering itself 
an officer told the gathering through a bullhorn that the 
demonstration was called off and that people should disperse 
the crowd finally broke up only after they were asked to leave by 
abbas awad a member of the organizing committee representing 54 
political parties and labor groups supporting the peace agreement 
we have specific information about plots aimed at jeopardizing 
democracy in the country and that the demonstration of today would 
have been used as a springboard for this purpose abbas told the 
crowd 
interviewed later he said the democratic unionists canceled the 
demonstration because a group was planning to counter it to 
spread chaos so that the army would intervene 
the nov 16 agreement calls for a ceasefire a conference to 
negotiate a permanent peace and to draft a new constitution and a 
freeze on implementing sudans islambased legal code 
it has caused deep splits in mahdis government mirghanis 
party junior partner in the coalition behind the premiers umma 
wants the government officially to approve the pact mahdi refuses 
to submit it for discussion partly because to do so would drive out 
the coalitions third major party the fundamentalist national 
islamic front

eleven red cross officials who were 
evacuated from lebanon after they received death threats arrived in 
cyprus today on their way home to switzerland 
the international committee for the red cross said in geneva on 
tuesday that it was suspending its humanitarian operations in 
lebanon because of serious threats against its delegates on 
mission in lebanon placing their lives in acute danger 
the evacuees eight men and three women left five hours later 
for zurich six red cross officials remained in lebanon and were due 
to leave today 
were disappointed said francis junot deputy chief of the 
red cross delegation in lebanon we received a communication from 
geneva and were ordered to leave i cant comment on the nature 
of the threat 
this has never happened before he said we expect the 
situation wont last and well be able to return after studying the 
situation we hope to return 
junot who has served in lebanon on five separate icrc missions 
since 1981 said he had not felt in danger 
later today the two largest moslem militias in south lebanon 
appealed to the red cross to return blaming a spate of terrorist 
attacks on humanitarian workers on a criminal minority 
the appeals came in separate statements by the sunni moslem 
nasserite leftist militia that governs the southern port city of 
sidon and the mainstream shiite moslem amal militia in tyre 
both factions called for concerted action against terrorist 
groups in south lebanon in order to guarantee the safety of foreign 
humanitarian agencies 
the suspension of operations in lebanon torn by civil war and 
factional violence for 13 years was the first time the red cross 
has withdrawn its workers from any country in its 125year history 
because of death threats 
i came to lebanon one year ago i didnt feel threatened and 
im ready to go back anytime said one of the evacuees who refused 
to identify himself 
the announcement tuesday came four days after the release of 
peter winkler a red cross delegate who was held hostage for nearly 
a month 
after winkler was kidnapped nov 17 in the southern port city of 
sidon the red coss withdrew 10 of its 27 workers in lebanon 
swiss authorities said winklers kidnappers believed to be 
proiranian shiite moslems sought a more lenient sentence for a 
lebanese shiite hussein hariri who goes on trial in switzerland 
soon on charges of hijacking an air afrique airliner in june and 
killing a french passenger 
the swiss were the largest western community remaining in west 
beirut after waves of kidnappings assassinations and civil war had 
forced tens of thousands of foreigners to flee lebanon in the last 
13 years 
the red cross workers were doing humanitarian work including 
fitting artificial limbs and visiting palestinian and lebanese 
prisoners in jails in the israelicontrolled section of south 
lebanon 
about 150 lebanese employees of the red cross have been told to 
go home for a week and await further word from geneva on whether 
a total shutdown will be ordered 
the icrc operates in about 80 countries providing food and 
medical relief to civilians trapped in wars conflicts and disasters 
fifteen foreigners are currently being held in lebanon including 
nine americans three britons an irishman an italian and a belgian 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was abducted march 16 
1985

a man shouldnt have been convicted of a 
crime and sentenced to 32 years in prison after he tried to get a 
refund for an electric razor for which he didnt have a receipt the 
indiana supreme court ruled 
the court tuesday struck down the attempted theft and habitual 
criminal convictions of richard allen smith and ordered the 
49yearold indianapolis man discharged from prison 
in 1985 smith received a 2year sentence on the theft conviction 
and 30 years for the habitual offender charge which was supported 
by earlier auto theft and drug convictions 
its the kind of case that could happen to anybody said me 
tuke the public defender who handled smiths appeal 
smiths problem began in november 1978 when he took a 4296 
remington razor to a hooks drug store in mooresville and later to 
another outlet of the chain in martinsville to get a refund the 
package he presented had a hooks price tag on it but employees 
refused to give smith a refund citing store policy requiring a 
receipt for a refund 
he then went to a danners department store in martinsville and 
presented the razor without a price tag for a refund hooks 
employees suspicious about smiths behavior had alerted danners 
employees of his earlier attempt to get a refund 
danners employees called police when smith showed up and stalled 
until police arrived to arrest smith court records show 
the long gap betwen his arrest and sentencing occurred because 
smith left the courtroom during his trial and remained at large for 
four years according to court records 
prosecutors argued at his trial that smith attempted to exert 
unauthorized control over danners profit margin by creating the 
false impression he had purchased the razor at the store 
however the supreme court concluded that to prove smith was 
trying to create a false impression the state needed to prove smith 
hadnt purchased the razor at danners there was no evidence to 
demonstrate where the razor was purchased the court said 
without that crucial element of proof every citizen engaging 
in a simple refund transaction would risk criminal penalties 
chief justice randall t shepard wrote for the court some 
citizens such as those seeking to return gifts simply do not know 
where the item was originally purchased

a couple who wrote columnist ann landers 
saying theyve kept their teenage daughter chained in their 
basement for several months should seek help the states top social 
services official said 
social services director patrick babcock appealed on tuesday to 
the unidentified couple to call a state child abuse hotline for 
help saying the states first objective would be to help the 
family not prosecute them 
state officials tried to determine the identity of the couple 
after reading the letter tuesday in the landers advice column which 
is syndicated and carried by 1200 newspapers but found it 
impossible to determine whether the letter is authentic or a prank 
babcock said 
im not sure we will ever be able to trace it back he said 
ann landers was on vacation but an assistant in her chicago 
office laurie solomon said today the anonymous letter was received 
about two months ago miss landers is about six to eight weeks ahead 
on her column ms solomon said 
all we had was a detroit postmark she said 
miss landers did not question the authenticity of the letter 
ms solomon said shes been doing this for so long she generally 
can tell when a letter is a fake letter 
the column doesnt always appear on the same day in every 
paper but this letter ran the day it was scheduled to appear she 
said 
ms solomon said the office has not heard from anyone claiming to 
be the man who wrote the letter but was contacted by michigan 
officials for help in tracking down the family 
the letter was from a man who said he and his wife had punished 
their 17yearold daughter for her drug and alcohol abuse by 
chaining her to a bed frame in the basement of their detroit home 
initially for 24hour periods 
our daughter has been chained to her bed frame in our basement 
for three months now and we are afraid to let her out for fear of 
getting into trouble with the law said the letter 
the man said the daughter was becoming hostile and had cut her 
arm badly when she broke a bathroom window during her onceaweek 
shower he said he feared the arm might be infected but he was 
afraid to seek medical attention for her for fear of arousing 
suspicion 
the writer did not identify himself signing the letter needing 
guidance in detroit 
landers advised the writer to unchain his daughter and take her 
to a hospital emergency room and to seek legal help

immigration officials say they want the justice 
department to eliminate a unit that may be contributing to the large 
numbers of asylum applications they receive each day from nicaraguan 
and other central american immigrants 
a memo obtained by the associated press shows that immigration 
commissioner alan nelson has asked attorney general dick thornburgh 
to dismantle the asylum policy and review unit in the justice 
department 
the dec 13 memo says the unit has cost too much 750000 and 
that its reviews of asylum rejections are just plain financially 
wasteful 
the review unit has persuaded ins to reconsider denials in 35 
cases and has referred another 35 cases to justice department 
officials who then directed reversals said department sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
nelsons memo also asked thornburgh to modify a regulatory 
proposal that would set up a centralized system of skilled officers 
who consider asylum applications 
the commissioner wants the asylum officers placed under the 
control of district immigration directors around the country 
several advocacy groups have denounced new ins policies that 
require asylum cases which are mostly from nicaraguans to be 
handled more aggressively 
because it acts as a law enforcement agency ins promotes 
immigration restriction said arthur helton an attorney for the 
lawyers committee for human rights asylum is a humanitarian act 
that is fundamentally incompatible with this law enforcement 
mentality 
ins spokesman duke austin said tuesday that 200 asylum 
applications were handled in just three days in south texas more 
aggressive handling of applicants has also been implemented in miami 
and los angeles where huge backlogs had built up 
some 150 nicaraguans were among the group whose applications were 
processed thursday friday and monday in harlingen texas according 
to the ins 
the central americans are no longer being granted work permits 
during a 30day period in which decisions are to be made on whether 
to approve or reject their asylum requests said austin 
following a directive from thenattorney general edwin meese iii 
in july 1987 work authorization had been virtually automatic for 
nicaraguans once they presented themselves to immigration officials 
saying they feared persecution from their countrys leftist 
sandinista government 
the meese directive was in line with the reagan administrations 
overall opposition to the sandinista regime but ins now is facing a 
nearly threefold increase in the number of central americans pouring 
across the border illegally in south texas and then seeking asylum 
some 60700 people applied for asylum in fiscal 1988 up from 
26100 the previous year 
ins has begun assigning additional personnel in an effort to 
handle asylum applications more quickly and clear up an extensive 
backlog 
those whose claims are found by ins to fall short of the standard 
of wellfounded fear of persecution may demand hearings before 
immigration judges but if ins declares their claims to be 
frivolous they wont be eligible for work permits while they await 
a final decision if their claims are rejected by the judges they 
could face deportation if they refuse to leave the country 
ins wants additional steps taken that could make it more 
difficult for asylumseekers to have their applications approved

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout 
the nation 
dec 18 
the pressenterprise riverside calif on federal pay raises 
its said by those urging federal pay increases that the 
current congressional salary of 89500 may sound like a lot to the 
average citizen but the average citizen doesnt understand the 
problem 
a member of congress for instance often has to support two 
households on a salary that has lost purchasing power over the 
years that and the high cost of dc living is cited by the 
advisory commission urging a raise in senate and house salaries to 
135000 
then again average citizens may have trouble getting into one 
home and the average family 30200 a year sustains its 
purchasing power by relying on two incomes 
all of which is to say that if its sympathy the members of 
congress are looking for they arent going to get it except from 
their own of course 
a case can be made that considering their responsibilities that 
salaries can go up a turn or two perhaps to the 100000 level 
as long as it is tied to a ban on outside honoraria but most 
members of congress still wont think theyre getting what they 
deserve few people do

portland maine press herald on the federal budget deficit 
bringing the governments annual deficits under control remains 
our biggest domestic challenge one of the easiest ways of raising 
money for deficit reduction would be to increase the gasoline tax 
 
the advantages of a boost in the present 9centagallon federal 
tax are numerous analysts estimate that each penny increase would 
generate 1 billion a year in additional revenue 
a couple of arguments make it difficult first the united 
states is virtually without any mass transportation for much of the 
public 
second a gasoline tax increase would fall more heavily upon 
lowerincome groups than on the weathly and the regressive nature 
of the gasoline tax would be magnified since many of the nations 
poorer families operate older less fuelefficient cars 
nevertheless america confronts the coming new year one year 
older and deeper in debt the federal deficits simply have to be 
reduced significantly an increase in the gasoline tax offers a 
partial solution no one should reject it out of hand

fort lauderdale fla sunsentinel on john tower as defense 
secretary 
john tower may have been the best friend the pentagon ever had 
during his days as chairman of the senate armed services committee 
but the diminutive texan is going to have to trade his sword for a 
scissors as george bushs secretary of defense 
his old committee now chaired by democrat sam nunn of georgia 
should make certain in confirmation hearings that towers conversion 
from screeching hawk to eagleeyed overseer is genuine 
the senate which tends to handle alumni such as tower with 
excessive courtesy during confirmation hearings should put aside 
the kid gloves in its inquiry into towers fitness to head the 
defense department 
only the most vigorous personal and philosophical investigation 
of towers credentials is in order when the position is so important 
and the candidate is so controversial

the evening sun baltimore on jack kemp as hud secretary 
the appointment of rep jack kemp to be secretary of housing 
and urban development in the bush administration strikes us as an 
imaginative choice 
that may sound surprising coming from a newspaper which has 
criticized the kemproth supplyside economic theories which have 
brought the nation to grief during the past eight years 
rest assured if kemp had been appointed treasury secretary or 
chairman of the economic advisers it would have been time to sound 
the sirens throughout the land 
but as hud secretary kemp will not be applying his crackpot 
economic theories rather he will be putting his considerable 
energy and determination behind revitalization of americas cities 
throughout the reagan administration urban policy has been based 
on a fantasy called enterprise zones to encourage inner city 
development through tax relief the policy wasnt thought out 
clearly to begin with and was administered with such cavalier 
indifference that the general accounting office only last week 
pronounced the enterprise zones program in maryland a waste of time 
and money 
now kemp will have a chance to make the promise good if it can 
be done

st louis postdispatch on bushs cabinet choices 
presidentelect george bush has made two disappointing choices in 
naming sen john tower defense secretary and settling on rep 
jack kemp as secretary of housing and urban development 
bush apparently was trying to mollify the partys right wing but 
there was no need to any debt he owed the far right was paid when 
he selected j danforth quayle as his running mate 
towers selection as defense secretary could cause the new 
president serious political problems the former texas senator has 
pledged that he will work to control the pentagons budget and to 
reform the militarys wasteful and fraudridden procurement system 
but to do so tower will have to go completely against his own 
hawkish track record 
while in the senate he fought hard for every useless or 
overpriced pentagon program that came along and he resisted 
procurement reform proposals in a deficittight era with the 
pentagon facing unavoidable cuts tower is the wrong man by 
picking him bush is practically guaranteeing confrontation with 
congress over military spending 
kemp is well known for his strong ideological commitment to 
supplyside economics and a return to the gold standard he can be 
expected to advocate a laissezfaire approach to housing for the 
poor that wont meet their needs

the times trenton nj on federal pay raises 
some citizens will look at the 50 percent pay raises recommended 
for members of congress and recoil in horror 
senators and representatives already receive 89500 a year how 
can another 45000 possibly be justified 
well read the fine print 
the congressional raises would be linked to a ban on honoraria 
fees paid to members of congress by special interest groups for 
giving a speech or writing a blurb or just showing up at an event 
getting rid of that kind of hidden payola would constitute an 
investment in good government 
and as common cause president fred wertheimer warns make sure 
that the door is also closed on other roundabout ways by which 
special interest might provide financial benefits to members of 
congress not doing this as wertheimer says will only lead 
to the honoraria problem surfacing in new forms

statesmanjournal salem ore on federal pay raises 
after we get over the initial shock of a 50 percent increase in 
pay for our congressmen federal judges and top government 
officials the raise will look like a good deal for them and for us 
 
we get what we pay for if we dont pay senators and 
representatives enough to maintain a home in washington dc and 
afford the normal duties of a federal lawmaker then the average man 
and woman wont be able to serve in congress 
when the dentist bill or the tuition payment comes due a 
congressman who is supporting one household at home and another in 
dc may do what he has to he or she will accept money from special 
interest groups the payment is called an honorarium 
the proposed pay increase would abolish the honorarium 
the average pay for all of us should be higher the effort 
should be on giving the lowpaid a decent salary not on denying pay 
that is adequate for men and women filling our most important public 
offices

the morning news tribune tacoma wash on usplo talks 
the difference between what yasser arafat said in english at a 
news conference dec 14 and what he said in arabic before the 
united nations dec 13 in geneva was so small as to be almost 
invisible to the naked eye 
but it was important enough to matter and to pave the way for 
the first direct talks in 13 years between the us and palestine 
liberation organization 
arafat and the state department thought they had worked out 
precisely what arafat had to say in geneva to meet the three 
conditions the us has set for dealing with the plo on the 
palestinian issue but his speech came up short in the us 
estimation and again the us declared arafat had not gone far 
enough 
in his press conference arafat specifically renounced without 
qualification all forms of terrorism he also dropped the 
qualifiers he had previously attached to the plos acceptance of 
un resolutions outlining israels right to exist 
that was enough now the us has properly shifted the onus to 
israel which must demonstrate it is serious about pursuing 
realistic options for a settlement it cannot pretend theres a 
solution to the palestinian question that does not involve the plo

less the entire arab world and he is notorius for changing his 
position to suit his circumstances 
israel doesnt believe either arafat or the plo has changed and 
wants nothing to do with them 
it may be no coincidence that this initiative was taken by an 
outgoing administration at a time when the political fallout can be 
minimized presidentelect bush was undoubtedly involved in the

daily journal fergus falls minn on federal pay raises 
underpaid is not generally a term used to describe those who 
earn 89500 a year so its hard for most people to feel much 
sympathy for members of congress 
thus americans are not likely to passionately embrace the 
idea of raising lawmakers salaries by 50 percent yet its true 
that a pay raise for congress is in order 
a presidential advisory commission recommended that members of 
congress along with federal judges and other top government 
officials receive pay raises of 50 percent the panel attached one 
stipulation to its recommendation though and that is the reason 
this pay raise should be adopted members said members of congress 
should get the raise if they could no longer collect speaking fees 
its those speaking fees that leave americans with the impression 
that their lawmakers are being bought and sold by the monied 
interests of the nation 
no one is suggesting that government officials should get rich 
off their public service but it isnt unreasonable for the 
government to pay enough so that public service isnt an enormous 
financial sacrifice if thats the case only the rich can afford to 
run for office and in the end its the country that ends up 
poorer

the janesville wis gazette on the shortage of registered 
nurses 
a federal commission studying ways to resolve the nationwide 
shortage of registered nurses called for higher pay 
thats no surprise but the panel said attention also must be 
given to increasing professional representation of nurses on 
policymaking the latter may hold just as much a key to the solution 
as the pay 
the 19member commission convened by the department of health and 
human services noted that with increasing frequency nurses provide 
services that should be carried out by other health care workers 
in the past five years the commission said the nations 
hospitals had laid off 100000 staff employees and added their 
duties to those of other nurses 
the panel also reported that nurses were being asked to render 
more care typically performed by such higherpriced personnel as 
respiratory and physical therapists 
giving employees increased input on policymaking matters has 
become more common in many lines of work in the past decade as 
companies seek ways to improve quality increase competitiveness and 
contain costs nurses on the front lines of the exploding medical 
care field should have plenty to offer in that continued search for 
excellence

the decatur ill herald and review on recruiting violations 
nevadalas vegas basketball coach jerry tarkaniana case against 
ncaa investigators has been winding its way through the courts for 
more than a decade 
when it began the nevada supreme court and a us district court 
agreed that ncaa probers had exceeded the bounds of procedural good 
taste during an investigation of recruiting improprieties at 
nevadalas vegas under tarkanian from 1975 to 1977 
at the time courts were inclined to protect individuals from the 
wrath of private as well as governmental bodies insisting that 
private investigative bodies follow proper rules of due process 
tarkanian might well have won his dispute had his lawyers gotten 
to the supreme court by the mid1980s 
alas in the late 1980s the courts following the lead of the 
reagan administration seem more than willing to let private bodies 
act in ways that would bring sharp censure to government bodies 
in effect the court argued in a 54 decision that the ncaa 
being a nongovernment had no obligation to observe constitutional 
decorum during its probe of tarkanian

max robinson who became the first black to 
anchor a us network news show but soon was beset with personal and 
career problems has died at 49 
robinson succumbed to complications of aids said tonya swanson 
a spokeswoman for howard university hospital a family spokesman 
roger wilkins said robinson had been ill for more than a year and 
had been bedridden for a month 
robinson had hoped that his death would highlight the urgency of 
the aids problem wilkins said in a statement issued tuesday on 
behalf of the family 
during his battle with the disease mr robinson expressed the 
desire that his death be the occasion for emphasizing the 
importance particularly to the black community of education about 
aids and methods of its prevention the statement said 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections the chief victims of the incurable disease have been 
homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers health officials 
estimate that heterosexual contact is responsible for 4 percent of 
cases 
robinson in 1978 left washington television station wtop where 
he had won top ratings as an anchorman for a decade to join abc as 
the first black to anchor a network news show he coanchored the 
abc evening news from chicago with peter jennings in london and 
frank reynolds in washington 
he made an important contribution to abc news for which we will 
always be grateful roone arledge president of abc news in new 
york said in a statement it is tragic to see his life end at 
such a young age 
ronald townsend president and general manager of wusatv 
successor to wtop said broadcast journalism has lost a strong 
voice for fairness equality and human rights 
he had great presence on the air said james snyder vice 
president for news for postnewsweek stations who worked with 
robinson 
snyder and others said pressures on robinson a moody man as a 
pioneer worked against him 
when max went to the network he was not as successful as he 
was here said snyder he had a lot of pressure pressure from 
his friends but he had the opportunity to be the first black 
network anchorma he had to take it 
there were personal demons he was wrestling with said gordon 
peterson his former coanchor here i kind of wish he had stayed 
here i dont think it working at the network worked well for 
him 
robinson spoke out frequently on behalf of better treatment and 
more visibilty for blacks in the media 
in february 1981 he told an audience at smith college in 
northampton mass that the news media was a crooked mirror 
through which white america views itself he said that only by 
talking about racism by taking a professinal risk will i take 
myself out of the mean racist trap all black americans find 
themselves in later he said he did not mean to single out abc 
for critcism 
carl bernstein abcs washington bureau chief in 1980 and 1981 
said robinson was deliberately excluded from any decisionmaking 
related to the newscast 
there are those i believe in the industry who were either 
jealous or had problems with max agreed dwight ellis head of the 
national association of broadcasters he was a really outspoken 
man 
a frustrated robinson often complained publicly about the network 
and charged it with racism in a speech at smith college in february 
1981 
after reynolds death in 1983 jennings was made sole anchor of 
the newscasts and robinson was relegated to weekend anchor stints 
and news briefs 
in 1984 he joined chicago television station wmaq the following 
june he entered a hospital specializing in alcohol rehabilitation 
suffering from emotional and physical exhaustion according to 
nick aronson director of communications for wmaq he never returned 
to the station and did sporadic freelance work after that 
i think one of my basic flaws has been the lack of esteem not 
really feeling great about myself always feeling like i had to do 
more robinson said in an interview with the washington post last 
may 
robinson started his broadcasting career as a disc jockey in his 
hometown of richmond va he moved to washington in 1965 
he is survived by his mother doris robinson griffin and 
stepfather the rev james griffin of norfolk va four children 
mark maureen michael and malik robinson two sisters and a 
brother robinsons marriages to eleanor booker and beverly hamilton 
ended in divorce and a third marriage was annulled

us district judge gerhard a gesell today set 
jan 31 as the starting date for the trial of former national 
security council aide oliver north in the irancontra affair 
gesells decision came at the end of an hourlong hearing in 
which one of norths lawyers barry simon pressed the judge to set 
a trial date 
simon said the defense would like to get subpoenas out to a 
number of people including some in the reagan administration who 
will be leaving government next month for the four corners of the 
earth 
we certainly hope we can meet that date john keker who will 
head the prosecution team appointed by independent counsel lawrence 
walsh said after the hearing 
during the hearing keker revealed that the government is trying 
to obtain notebooks which north compiled while he was the nsc 
portions of the notebooks were disclosed at congressional hearings 
last year which looked into the sale of arms to iran and the 
transfer of profits to nicaraguan rebels 
during the hearing simon who has clashed repeatedly with 
gesell complained that norths lawyers should be told which 
portions are classified among some 30000 pages of documents it has 
in its possession simon has said the documents are relevant to the 
defense of the former white house aide and that in some cases 
perhaps only a single word or sentence in a document of several 
pages is classified 
prosecutors said it would take several weeks to identify which 
portions of all the documents are classified 
norths lawyers have until jan 3 to identify 300 classified 
documents they plan to use at trial 
there are legal obstacles that could scuttle a trial of north 
before it gets started particularly the question of using 
classified documents 
experts from the us intelligence community are meeting with 
aides to walsh in sessions dealing with deletions of sensitive 
information from classified documents 
gesell ruled dec 12 that too much material relevant to the case 
had been excised from some classified documents walsh wants to use 
as evidence at trial 
material had been blacked out from portions of 300 classified 
documents he is planning to use at trial gesell said that while the 
documents had all been properly classified too much had been held 
back especially if a jury was to understand the facts of the case 
gesell said that all references to eight countries involved in 
the irancontra affair must be restored and made public at trial 
the countries included israel iran and nicaragua 
the judge also said that the text of information obtained by 
intelligence must for the most part be presented verbatim he said 
however the methods and techniques used to obtain intelligence 
reports should remain secret

a soyuz space capsule carrying two soviets who set 
a oneyear space endurance record and a frenchman landed safely 
today after a threehour reentry delay caused by an overloaded 
computer tass said 
the official soviet news agency said the craft which separated 
on schedule from the mir space station earlier today touched down 
at 1257 pm moscow time 60 miles from the baikonur space center in 
soviet central asia 
vladimir titov and and musa manarov were joined for the descent 
by a french astronaut jeanloup chretien of france who spent 
nearly a month on mir 
immediate medical checkups showed the cosmonauts are feeling 
well radio moscow said 
the landing ended mankinds longest space mission titov and 
manarov had been in space for 365 days 22 hours and 39 minutes 
the cosmonauts left the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan at 218 
pm on dec 21 1987 
radio moscow said titov and manarov were undergoing tests to 
determine how well they had endured their lengthy flight soviet 
officials have said the ability of cosmonauts to endure long periods 
in space is a key to a manned flight to mars they hope will take 
place shortly after the turn of the century 
titov and manarov replaced a crew including cosmonaut yuri 
romanenko last december and went on to break romanenkos record of 
326 days in space 
the official tass news agency said the crew switched to a backup 
computer program after a fault developed in the operation of the 
onboard computer the main engine fired to slow the capsule at 
1208 pm and the living quarters and instrument module were 
jetisoned tass said 
as expected radio contact with the craft was lost between a 
height of 90 miles to 50 miles because the craft was enveloped by a 
plasma cloud the capsules parachutes opened at a height of about 
six miles 
soviet television reported before todays touchdwon that 
automated telementry showed an overload in the computing 
complex of a system aboard the soyuz tm6 capsule it provided no 
details 
it was not clear whether reentry was computerguided or if the 
cosmonauts switched over to manual control to guide the ship to 
earth as tass had said they might there also was no immediate word 
on the exact function of the computer or the nature of the overload 
on sept 7 equipment and human error delayed by a full day the 
landing of another soyuz capsule that had separated from mir in 
that incident veteran cosmonaut vladimir lyakhov and afghan abdul 
ahad mohmand ran dangerously low on food and air before landing 
safely 
at the time soviet media reported the capsules lifesupport 
system could hold out for two days but space officials said the 
cosmonauts could make it stretch to a week but todays mission 
carried three cosmonauts instead of the two on board the september 
mission 
the us mark for the longest manned mission is 84 days set in 
1973 by astronauts gerald carr edward gibson and william pogue 
aboard the skylab space station 
chretien rocketed into space nov 26 along with cosmonauts 
alexander volkov and sergei krikalev who remained aboard the space 
station valery polyakov sent to the mir orbiting complex in the 
fall to monitor the health of titov and manarov also remained 
behind 
while aboard the space station chretien and volkov made a space 
walk to deploy an experimental framework to help plan the 
construction of scientific equipment they also conducted a series 
of medical and biologial experiments

americans personal income declined 02 percent 
in november falling from unusually high october levels caused by 
bonuses to auto workers and a surge in farm subsidy payments the 
government said today 
the commerce department said income fell 82 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 418 trillion last month 
following a gain of 17 percent in october which had been the 
largest in a year novembers decline was the first since january 
when incomes dropped 04 percent 
excluding the distorting effects of the two special factors 
personal income rose 06 percent in november and 08 percent in 
october both fairly strong gains 
meanwhile personal consumption spending which includes 
everything except interest payments on debt rose 06 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 332 trillion last month after a 
robust 10 percent gain a month earlier 
the biggest increase in spending last month was for durable goods 
big ticket items expected to last three or more years the 
category rose 15 percent followed by a 06 percent increase for 
nondurable goods and a 03 percent rise in spending for services 
with spending rising faster than income in november the personal 
savings rate savings as a percentage of aftertax income was 43 
percent down from 52 percent in october

04 percent to 252 trillion in november following a large 15 
percent increase caused by bonuses to auto workers manufacturing 
salaries edged down 05 percent after a 22 percent increase a month 
earlier 
farm income usually a volatile category plunged 646 percent to

a prosecutor said today that two 
west german companies are being investigated in connection with the 
suspected illegal sale to pakistan of material that can be used in 
the production of atomic weapons 
the prosecutor also said officials have evidence that atomic 
reactor equipment was illegally sold to pakistan india and south 
africa 
state prosecutor albert farwick said the investigation began in 
midnovember with a search at the neue technologie gmbh company in 
gelnhausen 15 miles east of frankfurt 
the offices of ntgs sister company physikalisch technische 
beratung in ortenberg 25 miles northeast of frankfurt also were 
searched farwick said in a telephone interview 
records at both companies were confiscated he said 
farwick said the companies are under investigation for possible 
violation of west german laws governing the export of nuclear 
industry equipment he would not comment on whether the 
international nuclear nonproliferation treaty might have been 
violated 
pakistan has not signed the treaty and reportedly has invested 
vast sums of money in development of its own nuclear bomb 
prime minister benazir bhutto of pakistan said in an interview 
sunday that pakistan has no plans to make nuclear weapons but wont 
sign the nonproliferation treaty unless india does 
in a statement released to the news media farwick said ntg 
officials have admitted delivering technical equipment to pakistan 
as recently as the summer 
we know that they delivered equipment for processing tritium 
and that they delivered tritium gas he said atomic experts say 
tritium gas is used to boost the effectiveness of atomic weapons 
further investigation revealed that technical nuclear items 
were also delivered to india and south africa he said 
farwick said those items included reflector material and 
cadmium pipes for india and a test device to measure burn elements 
for south africa 
a west german atomic expert jens scheer said the nuclear 
equipment in question is crucial in the construction of 
conventional reactors but is not ideal for military ends 
according to farwick ntgs firing of a former technical manager 
for misuse of company funds without pressing charges against him led 
to officials opening the investigation 
the company apparently decided not to press charges or demand 
return of the money from the former manager in an attempt to cover 
up the alleged illegal nuclear deals said farwick 
farwick said the investigation thus far indicates that the former 
ntg manager and a manager from ptb had close contact with 
representatives of pakistani nuclear officials since 1982 
the prosecutor also said the former technical manager of ntg who 
was initially arrested in connection with the case has since been 
released pending further investigation 
farwick declined to identify by name the company officials under 
investigation in the case

a bottlenose dolphin today eluded 
rescuers who tried four times to snare it and move it to warmer 
waters for the winter 
by late morning the rescuers suspended their efforts to try to 
decide what to do next 
as many as nine boats and about 30 people were involved in the 
risky rescue attempt that began this morning about 8 am on broad 
bay but the animal swam away after each attempt 
the rescuers also were faced with a leaking inflatable boat and a 
strong current that at one point wrapped a net around one boats 
propeller 
after one attempt to snare the dolphin one radio transmission 
called out hold off hold off he got through us 
the effort was coordinated by a dolphin expert from new jersey 
and was authorized monday by the national marine fisheries service 
the male dolphin nicknamed rascal failed to migrate south for 
the winter rescuers hoped to capture the mammal in nets and fly it 
to north carolinas outer banks 
the dolphins plight rallied residents of this coastal community 
anything we can do to help we want to help said josiah 
woodington a resident assisting in the rescue effort i think 
that its great that we can come together and catch this fish 
the virginia institute of marine science in gloucester point had 
opposed an attempt to capture the dolphin saying it could drown in 
the net or take in water and develop pneumonia 
robert schoelkopf director of the marine mammal stranding center 
in brigantine nj who was to coordinate the rescue agreed it was 
risky 
you weigh that against the ultimate fate of the animal if 
nothings done he said that animal would die in the area if we 
didnt do anything 
the dolphin was in broad bay on tuesday said kathy read a 
diving instructor who worked on the rescue plans 
he still circles the boat and stays right with you hopefully 
hell be ready to move south she said 
residents had been lobbying for the rescue since the dolphin was 
noticed in the bay in early october since then it has become thin 
and slowed down probably because of a lack of food ms read said 
water temperature in the bay has dipped to 42 degrees 
residents believe the dolphin stayed in the bay because it was 
frightened of bridge construction in a narrow channel that links the 
bay and open water

a jewish leader said today that roman catholic 
officials have renewed their pledge to move a convent of carmelite 
sisters out of auschwitz the former nazi concentration camp where 
millions died 
the monastery was established by a dozen nuns in 1984 setting 
off protests by european jews who believe the death camp should 
remain an undisturbed memorial to its victims 
jewish leaders met tuesday in paris with four roman catholic 
cardinals to discuss progress toward moving the convent to another 
location by feb 22 1989 a deadline set in previous meetings 
theo klein president of the council of french jewish 
institutions denied that jewish leaders were dissatisfied with the 
talks 
reports in the french and us press quoted elan steinberg 
executive director of the world jewish congress as saying after 
the carmelite affair and pope john pauls visit with austrian 
president kurt waldheim we are questioning the vaticans attitude 
toward the holocaust 
klein said steinberg had not attended any of the meetings and was 
uninformed he said there was no problem between christians and jews 
but rather between the vatican and the polish catholics many of 
whom wish the convent to remain at the polish concentration camp 
in 1987 the polish government officially agreed to move the 
convent over objections by the nuns 
delegations of jews and catholics were to meet again in late 
january to evaluate progress

a judge today dismissed charges against 13 
civil rights leaders arrested during a protest of the citys housing 
program after prosecutors reduced the charges and all 13 pleaded no 
contest 
the city prosecutor called the arrangement a compromise an 
attorney for the defendants said city officials agreed to meet with 
them next month to try to resolve differences 
the 13 were arrested for trying to block a city council meeting 
in june they were protesting the firing of a black community 
development official the reassignment of another the retirement of 
a third and the resignation of a fourth because of alleged 
mismanagement of the housing program 
jury selection in a trial for five of the 13 was scheduled to 
resume today in municipal court but judge john patterson dismissed 
the jury pool and went into his chambers with defense attorneys and 
prosecutors 
while the case only involved a seconddegree misdemeanor there 
were other important issues involved but they were not a matter for 
this court patterson said 
patterson had warned the defendants that he would not allow the 
trial to be used as a forum on problems between the city 
administration and blacks 
the revs issac johnson rudolph may reece barbour ronald 
barnett and john reese each were charged with one count of 
obstructing official business a seconddegree misdemeanor the 
charge carries a maximum sentence of three months in jail and a 750 
fine 
under the agreement the city reduced the charge to failure to 
disperse the ministers pleaded no contest the judge dismissed the 
case and ordered their records expunged 
a trial for the eight other defendants was scheduled for next 
month but the charges of obstructing official business were dropped 
under the agreement in addition two faced charges of resisting 
arrest that also were dismissed 
city prosecutor john madigan who called the agreement a 
compromise said sometimes it takes a court trial to figure out 
this isnt the way to go 
jay b simmons an attorney for the ministers said the city 
extended a fair offer city officials he said agreed to meet 
with the ministers by the second week in january in an attempt to 
resolve their differences 
at this point major differences have not been resolved they 
city officials must learn to consult with us before taking action 
or they will continue to have problems he said 
the 13 ministers and civil rights leaders were arrested after 
they refused to leave city council chambers during a protest of the 
citys handling of problems in its community development department 
the management shuffle in the department followed an 
investigation by the us department of housing and urban 
development that said the citys housing rehabilitation program was 
deficient 
the civil rights leaders wanted to know why the men were 
reprimanded without being consulted about problems in the 
department they also asked for a public hearing into the 
allegations 
city officials rejected their requests sparking months of 
protests by civil rights leaders who claim there is a conspiracy 
against black officials in toledo 
racial tensions were heightened in july when police chief martin 
felker ordered police to randomly stop and question groups of black 
teenagers in an attempt to end racial violence in the citys old 
west end felker rescinded the order in august after protests 
blacks comprise about 17 percent of toledos 340000 residents

as the new hebrides achieved independence from france and britain 
he tried to form an interim government on sunday headed by his 
nephew barak sope in the hope of calling new elections in february 
he said he took the action because of the failing economy and 
outbreaks of violence during a yearlong power struggle between lini 
and sope 
earlier this week the vanuatu supreme court ruled the 
presidents action was unlawful and unconstitutional 
australian news reports said both the prosecution and defense 
counsels suggested the possibility of house arrest but cooke said 
the seriousness of the charges gave him no alternative but to deny 
bail 
public prosecuter john baxterwright told the court the charge of 
inciting mutiny related to the alleged drafting and distribution of 
an open letter to vanautus police and paramilitary forces late on 
sunday after the president swore in sope and four others as an 
interim government 
baxterwright said the letter urged members of the security 
forces to switch their loyalty from lini to the sope administration 
or risk losing their jobs it also allegedly said military 
intervention could be used in vanuatu to disarm and dismantle the 
police force and the vanuatu mobile force 
baxterwright likened this to an act of treason 
in his ruling cooke said it was a sad day for him to have to 
deal with a case against the president the judge said the charges 
were among the most serious possible in vanautu i cannot flinch 
from doing my duty otherwise i should not be here 
the rebel politicians also have been ordered held in police 
custody for the next two weeks the parliament on tuesday moved to 
dismiss sokomanu as head of state accusing him of gross misconduct 
vanuatu has a population of 130000 and is 1200 miles northeast 
of brisbane australia

pregnant women with diabetes can reduce their high 
risk of miscarriages by keeping their blood sugar levels under 
control a study shows 
the study tried to settle a longrunning debate over whether 
diabetes increases a womans risk of miscarriage 
it found that the higher the blood sugar level in diabetic women 
the higher the risk of miscarriage however women who keep their 
sugar levels in the normal range have no higher risk of this than 
women without diabetes 
diabetic women can be reassured that if they achieve reasonably 
good metabolic control during pregnancy the researchers wrote 
their risk of spontaneous abortion is no higher than that among 
nondiabetic women 
the study was based on a comparison of 386 pregnant women who 
took insulin for diabetes and 432 without diabetes overall 16 
percent of the women in both groups had pregnancy losses however 
blood sugar levels were higher in the diabetic women who had 
miscarriages 
the study was directed by dr james l mills of the national 
institute of child health and human development it was published in 
thursdays new england journal of medicine 
in an accompanying editorial dr donald r coustan of brown 
university said counseling diabetic women who want to have babies is 
the single most important thing doctors can do to prevent 
miscarriages and birth defects 
diabetic women must be made aware that the time to prevent 
birth defects and spontaneous abortion is before conception and 
contraceptive advice should be offered so that every pregnancy can 
be planned in advance he wrote rarely do we encounter such a 
simple and compelling opportunity to prevent human suffering

two cosmonauts ended historys longest space flight 
wednesday after a year in orbit returning to earth three hours 
later than planned because of a problem with an overloaded computer 
chip soviet media said 
riding with recordsetting cosmonauts vladimir titov and musa 
manarov was frenchman jeanloup chretien who has been in space less 
than a month 
their soyuz tm6 capsule parachuted safely to soviet central asia 
at 1257 pm moscow time 457 am est the soviets had blasted 
off at 218 pm on dec 21 1987 
doctors met the cosmonauts at the landing site and they were 
flown to the star city space training center north of moscow where 
titov and manarov will undergo rehabilitation from the effects of 
nearly a year in weightlessness the official tass news agency 
reported 
immediate medical checkups showed the cosmonauts are feeling 
well radio moscow said 
the flight by titov and manarov lasted 365 days 22 hours and 39 
minutes breaking the 326day endurance mark set by fellow soviet 
spaceman yuri romanenko in 1987 titov and manarov had replaced a 
crew including romanenko aboard the mir 
the us mark for the longest manned mission is 84 days set in 
1973 by astronauts gerald carr edward gibson and william pogue 
aboard the skylab space station 
the mission by manarov and titov gave the soviets valuable 
experience as they prepare for a threeyear journey to mars soviet 
officials have said a manned mission to mars will be launched around 
the turn of the century 
the foulup that delayed the soyuz capsules landing a computer 
chip whose memory overloaded was the second major problem in the 
soviet manned space program this year in september equipment 
malfunctions and crew error delayed the landing of a soviet and an 
afghan spaceman as they ran dangerously low on food and air 
its nothing boys you flew for a year so you can wait 
another two orbits flight director valery ryumin had told titov 
and manarov after the first landing attempt was aborted let 
jeanloup look at paris from above one more time 
the problem began shortly after the soyuz tm6 separated from the 
mir orbiting complex where titov and manarov spent most of their 
time in space 
an onboard computer that controls landing signaled that its 
memory was overloaded and automatically stopped preparations for 
descent 
the mission control center decided to take a timeout to 
figure out the situation the newspaper izvestia said 
tass said the computers memory became overloaded because of new 
software installed to prevent a repetition of the problems that 
plagued the afghansoviet mission 
the problem was traced to the faulty interaction of some of the 
new software with the old package of programs tass said 
paraphrasing deputy flight director viktor blagov 
the new computer programs were designed to ensure smooth 
operation of an infrared sensor that orients the capsule for its 
return to earth on sept 7 veteran cosmonaut vladimir lyakhov and 
afghan space rookie abdul ahad mohmand delayed their landing a full 
day because the infrared sensor did not lock onto the proper target 
after wednesdays failure the crew switched to a backup computer 
program the main engine fired to slow the capsule and the living 
quarters and instrument module were jettisoned tass said 
manarov titov and chretien had been scheduled to land near 
arkalyk in soviet kazakhstan but because of the delay the 
trajectory was changed and they touched down about 110 miles 
southeast of the kazakhstan city of dzhezkazgan where the 
temperature was 3 degrees fahrenheit 
izvestia said manarov 37 and titov 40 exercised twice a day 
aboard mir to keep in shape and wore a special spacesuit that forced 
blood to concentrate in the lower part of their bodies simulating 
the effects of gravity they ran on a treadmill and rode an exercise 
bicycle according to flight medical director od anashkin 
the strategy was not allowing the cosmonauts to become too 
accustomed to weightlessness izvestia said 
the vigorous exercise limited calcium loss common on long space 
flights but the cosmonauts shins shrank 15 percent sovietskaya 
rossiya reported in the days before their return to earths 
gravity titov and manarov took vitamin supplements to increase 
blood circulation the paper said 
chretien rocketed into space nov 26 along with cosmonauts 
alexander volkov and sergei krikalev who are still aboard mir dr 
valery polyakov who was sent to the space station in the fall to 
monitor the health of titov and manarov also remained behind 
in a postflight tradition soviet officials awarded titov 
manarov and chretien medals for courage and heroism tass said 
in paris defense minister jeanpierre chevenement praised 
chretien who also took part in a 1982 space mission with the 
soviets 
your scientific and technical competence your intellectual and 
physical mastery the endeavors you have undertaken and 
accomplished inspire in each of us the greatest respect the 
minister said 
tass had reported titov and manarov had completed one year in 
orbit on tuesday but the news agencys editors said wednesday they 
had received incorrect information from mission control about the 
length of the flight

a colombian judge who said he was kidnapped shot 
at and threatened with death for prosecuting members of the 
countrys powerful drug cartels has been granted political asylum in 
the united states after a threeyear struggle 
in a case that suggested that narcotraficantes or drug 
traffickers are controlling colombias judicial system through 
intimidation the judge last month received asylum after maintaining 
he would be killed if he returned 
state department officials said they could not recall another 
case in which a judge from an american ally was granted political 
asylum in the united states 
any judge that has come into contact with anything having to do 
with drugs is in danger the judge said in an interview granted on 
condition that his name his whereabouts and specifics about his 
past not be disclosed he now is working at unskilled jobs in part 
to keep his whereabouts a secret 
in the last seven years drug traffickers in the south american 
nation have killed more than 50 judges including a dozen supreme 
court justices as well as a justice minister an attorney general 
several journalists and scores of police officers and soldiers 
the reprisals against those who challenge the drug barons led by 
the infamous medellin cartel believed responsible for most of the 
cocaine brought into the united states have hamstrung the justice 
system the judge said 
few drug cases are prosecuted he said and colombias supreme 
court last year ruled that a 1979 extradition treaty with the united 
states could no longer be applied many judges and lawyers have 
resigned and fled 
two things could be happening either magistrates are too 
afraid or they are being bought off he said through a translator 
theres no question but that the narcotraficantes have tried to 
bring the judicial system to a halt over the years through 
intimidation and assassination said a state department official 
speaking on condition of anonymity judges newspapermen its a 
broadspectrum campaign to try to step on anyone who tries to crank 
the society against narcotics 
the judge who handled cases in various cities as a roving 
magistrate with power to investigate prosecute and adjudicate 
crimes said he was hounded and threatened from his first drug 
prosecution in medellin 
he said he was shot at twice received repeated telephone death 
threats and was abducted by a terrorist group at one point he 
received government protection but suspected his bodyguards had 
connections to drug traffickers 
according to documents from his asylum proceedings the judge 
contacted the us consulate in bogota the colombian capital and 
came to the united states in early 1986 
the immigration and naturalization service rejected his initial 
application for political asylum under the 1980 refugee act because 
he failed to demonstrate persecution based on politics religion 
ethnicity membership in a social group nationality or race 
but in deportation hearings a us immigration judge ruled that 
the colombian judge was in danger from two leftist guerrilla 
movements including m19 with ties to drug traffickers m19 has 
been linked to a 1985 attack on the palace of justice in which more 
than 100 people including 11 supreme court justices were killed 
he also ruled that the judge was persecuted as a member of a 
social group namely judges who prosecute drug cases and granted 
asylum 
the government cant protect its own citizens from its own 
people said fernando colon directing attorney of the harvard law 
school student practice clinic who handled the case what it says 
is drug traffickers are in control 
at least this says this is a political issue and judges are 
politically persecuted for abiding by the law colon said 
the judge said he guards his identity for fear of colombian drug 
agents in this country 
according to the state department several colombian judges 
witnesses and their families who have been involved in drug cases 
have been paroled into the united states meaning they have special 
admission that can be revoked at any time 
but government officials said most of the thousands of cases of 
refugees seeking asylum because of alleged threats to their safety 
many from central american nations such as el salvador are denied 
all these things are matters of evidence the state 
department official said otherwise everybody who ever wanted to 
shortcircuit the normal immigration process would be able to get in 
under political asylum claims

a judge has barred attorneys in a malpractice 
lawsuit from questioning a doctor they allege was a member of 
germanys nazi party about his world war ii activities 
cook county circuit judge dean sodaro ruled tuesday that lawyers 
for the plaintiff rahman sheriff may not ask dr karl siedentop 
69 about his activities before 1952 
he sodaro just didnt believe it was relevant to the case 
said david novoselsky one of the attorneys for sheriff 
its a reasoned ruling said neil quinn the attorney for 
siedentop the judge made the right decision 
last week while sodaro was on vacation another judge issued a 
gag order barring lawyers from talking about the case and sealed the 
court record after sheriffs chief lawyer david de jong accused 
siedentop of being a nazi 
weve learned dr siedentop joined the hitler youth movement in 
1931 and joined the nazi party in 1939 and in his petition for 
naturalization as an american citizen did not disclose he was a 
nazi de jong said before the gag order was imposed 
de jong said attorneys should be allowed to question siedentop 
about his past because the doctors credibility was at issue in the 
case 
the lawsuit filed by sheriff contends an experimental drug used 
by siedentop during an ear operation in november 1985 caused the 
patient to have a series of strokes that left him virtually unable 
to function 
the lawsuit seeks damages in excess of 15000 de jong said 
under court rules sodaros decision may not be appealed unless 
the judge grants his permission novoselsky said 
the judge tuesday denied permission to appeal the ruling

educator louis sullivan a leading candidate to 
head the department of health and human services met today with 
conservative republican congressmen who said their concerns about 
his views on abortion had been calmed 
minnesota rep vin weber said after the threehour meeting at 
bushs transition office that sullivan still appeared to be in line 
for the post the possibility of the nomination has been 
controversial since sullivan made comments in a newspaper interview 
in favor of a womans right to an abortion comments not in line 
with presidentelect bushs stated views 
hes not used to dealing with the press and he stumbled 
badly weber told reporters he said he was sure sullivan could 
win the support of antiabortion groups 
bush was said by transition aides to be determined to move ahead 
with the appointment although no announcements were scheduled today 
bush advisers told chicago transit official samuel skinner to 
return home because announcement of his nomination as transportation 
secretary was being delayed yet again while decisions on prospects 
for other posts were being made 
sullivan met with utah sen orrin hatch weber and new jersey 
rep christopher h smith all outspoken abortion opponents as well 
as transition codirectors robert teeter and craig fuller 
smith a member of the congressional pro life caucus said that 
he was favorably impressed by sullivan 
we do have a man here who has said on the record that he 
believes life begins at conception that the taking of a human life 
is wrong and he also made the point significantly that he 
supports a human life amendement that to the prolife community is 
the most significant issue smith said 
the session was part of a damage control operation mounted by the 
bush team to salvage the nomination of the man who would be the 
first black named to the incoming bush cabinet 
sullivan and bushs top aides spent much of tuesday in talks with 
antiabortion leaders assuring them that the medical educators 
views were in line with those held by the presidentelect 
bush opposes abortions except in cases of incest or rape or when 
the life of the mother would be endangered by a fullterm pregnancy 
and he opposes federal funding for abortions 
sullivan was quoted in a newspaper interview several days ago as 
saying he supports the right of a woman to seek an abortion a 
position at odds with bushs but opposes the use of federal funds 
to pay for it 
the article set off an instant protest by abortion foes but 
transition officials indicated on tuesday night they thought the 
nomination was back on track 
moreover a transition source noted that sullivan has strong 
backing from bushs wife barbara a friend of sullivan and a member 
of the board of morehouse college where he is medical school 
president 
meanwhile congressional sources said they had been told that 
texas air executive fred mcclure would be the new administrations 
chief lobbyist in congress mcclure worked in the white house 
liaison office earlier in the reagan administration 
skinner chairman of the northeastern illinois mass transit 
authority was called to washington last week for an expected 
announcement that was then postponed by bush he returned to chicago 
for the weekend then was summoned back on monday then told by 
transition officials his appointment would come on tuesday 
transition staffers were privately joking that skinners trips 
back and forth were giving him loads of experience with problems in 
the airline industry plus paying a dividend of frequentflyer 
mileage 
amid the controversy over sullivan bush canceled a planned 
afternoon appearance for personnel announcements avoiding questions 
from reporters about the abortion dispute 
instead he issued a written statement saying he was putting 
former nevada sen paul laxalt and former ohio rep thomas ashley on 
the national economic commission a panel created by congress to 
find a bipartisan strategy for cutting the huge budget deficit 
the appointments put the commission at its full strength of 14 
people bush emphasized tuesday his opposition to raising taxes to 
erase the red ink 
in another development a reagan administration source said 
patricia diaz dennis a member of the federal communications 
commission appeared to be emerging as the no 1 contender for the 
job of labor secretary 
with a selfimposed christmas deadline for naming his cabinet 
bush has filled eight seats and still has six to go if he is 
selected sullivan would be the first black in bushs cabinet 
bush has yet to name a woman to a cabinet post although he has 
nominated carla hills to be chief trade negotiator a job that 
carries cabinet rank 
while bushs aides insisted that sullivan was still the top 
candidate for health and human services antiabortion leaders 
worked furiously to derail his expected nomination 
rep bob dornan rcalif said bush will rue the day he 
picks sullivan gary bauer a conservative leader who was president 
reagans domestic policy adviser said the appointment of sullivan 
would be politically stupid because it would alienate a bloc of 
voters that had supported bush 
one antiabortion group the ad hoc committee in defense of life 
issued a statement saying sullivans appointment would be a slap 
in the face 
sullivans congressional supporters on tuesday were circulating a 
letter in which he said i am opposed to abortion except in cases 
of rape incest and where the life of the mother is threatened 
my position on abortion is entirely consistent with presidentelect 
bushs position

a doctor who illegally placed a 2dayold boy in 
the home of joel steinberg accused of murdering another illegally 
adopted child was sentenced wednesday to 100 hours of community 
service fined 1000 and put on probation for three years 
peter sarosi 35 pleaded guilty to unlawfully placing out a 
child for adoption and was sentenced by manhattan criminal court 
judge john stackhouse who could have jailed him for a year 
sarosi an obstetrician and gynecologist was arrested may 31 
shortly afterward he admitted that in june 1986 he arranged to have 
a boy born to an unwed teenager placed with steinberg and his 
companion hedda nussbaum 
police found the boy tied to a playpen and drinking spoiled milk 
in steinbergs apartment nov 2 1987 they had gone there after an 
emergency call to help an unconscious 6yearold girl lisa 
steinberg who died of head injuries three days later 
steinberg a 47yearold disbarred lawyer was charged with 
seconddegree murder for allegedly beating lisa to death he denied 
he hit her but ms nussbaum has testified at his trial that he told 
her he knocked lisa down and she didnt want to get up 
the boy called mitchell by steinberg was returned to his 
biological mother nicole smigiel and was renamed travis christian 
smigiel 
graceann smigiel nicoles mother called the sentence 
ridiculous 
they should put him in a cell with joel so they can renew their 
friendship mrs smigiel said 
stackhouse noted in his decision that the court received two 
probation reports on sarosi one recommended jail time and the other 
suggested a sentence split between jail and probation even though 
both reports predicted that sarosi was unlikely to be involved in 
crime again 
paul schechtman counsel to manhattan district attorney robert 
morgenthau said his office had agreed to take no position on 
sarosis sentencing but he indicated later that prosecutors were 
unhappy when sarosi ms nussbaums physician and a friend and 
client of steinbergs refused to cooperate in steinbergs 
prosecution

pakistan has no plans to make nuclear 
weapons but wont sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty unless 
india does prime minister benazir bhutto said 
negotiations are under way with india on an agreement not to 
attack each others nuclear facilities she said the two countries 
have fought three wars since independence in 1947 india has tested 
nuclear explosives and pakistan is believed capable of producing 
them 
ending corruption and tax evasion and increasing foreign 
investment are domestic priorities the first woman to lead a moslem 
nation in modern times said in an interview sunday night she spoke 
while traveling to her home in rawalpindi from islamabad where she 
attended a parliamentary committee meeting 
in west germany a prosecutor said today that two companies in 
that country are being investigated in connection with the suspected 
illegal sale to pakistan of material that can be used in the 
production of atomic weapons 
the prosecutor also said officials have evidence that atomic 
reactor equipment was illegally sold to pakistan india and south 
africa 
the prosecutor albert farwick said the companies officials 
have admitted delivering technical equipment to pakistan as recently 
as the summer 
we know that they delivered equipment for processing tritium 
and that they delivered tritium gas he said atomic experts say 
tritium gas is used to boost the effectiveness of atomic weapons 
until ms bhuttos populist pakistan peoples party won the 
election last month pakistanis had been unable to choose their 
government since 1977 
the 1977 election kept prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto her 
father in power by a landslide gen mohammed zia ulhaq overthrew 
him soon afterward bhutto was convicted in a murder conspiracy and 
hanged in 1979 
zia a staunch us ally died in a plane crash aug 17 after 
setting the election date after winning that election ms bhutto 
said she will continue good relations with washington 
on dec 29 ms bhutto and prime minister rajiv gandhi of india 
will meet at a summit in islamabad of the south asian association 
for regional cooperation we have certain talks going on with 
india whereby an agreement can be brought up on nonattack on each 
others nuclear facilities she said 
pakistan will not sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty thus 
opening its nuclear facilities to inspection unless india also 
accepts the document she said some of pakistans facilities are 
believed to be producing weaponsgrade enriched uranium 
particularly the kahuta uranium enrichment plant 20 miles east of 
islamabad 
ms bhutto said pakistan does not have a nuclear device has 
no intention of making a nuclear device and thats what i can tell 
you categorically 
india rejected several previous pakistani offers of comprehensive 
nuclear agreements but ms bhutto said the situation is changing 
i think were looking toward in general an expression worldwide 
of a yearning for a rest she said pakistan and india are both 
a part of the world the people of both our countries would prefer 
to have an honorable peace 
serious economic problems beset pakistan including a 125 
billion foreign debt and hard terms from the international monetary 
fund for help in reducing it low foreign exchange reserves and 
rampant tax evasion 
at the moment we want to concentrate on economic growth 
ms bhutto said wed like to get other countries interested in 
our economic growth 
the imf agreement provides 1 billion of new money over three 
years but requires austerity measures to reduce the foreign debt 
military spending takes 39 percent of the budget and ms bhutto 
has promised no defense cuts so options are limited 
imf loans will help pay immediate bills and the government will 
try to renegotiate terms of the other debt said va jafarey the 
prime ministers financial adviser

deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk said delvalle 
was to meet with reagan and bush on thursday he was to arrive later 
today for a meeting with shultz 
popadiuk said the meeting at the white house was designed to 
show visibly the us support for the delvalle government and for 
the people of panama delvalle has been living in hiding in panama 
since he was ousted by supporters of military strongman manuel 
antonio noriega and replaced by manuel solis palma in february 
reagan asked by a reporter if he foresaw any change in the 
noriega government before his term ends jan 20 said i dont 
have an answer to that there is only a limited time left and its 
quite a problem as you all know so i dont know it would be nice 
if it could happen 
asked if anything could push noriega out reagan grinned at bush 
who was sitting across the table from him at a cabinet meeting and 
joked you said bush noriega out 
when he was asked what the united states would do to help 
panamanians facing confiscation of their property by the noriega 
regime the president replied all i can tell you is that we 
continue to be involved in that problem and to try to find answers 
for the things that are happening and i cant go beyond that 
popadiuk said he did not know who initiated thursdays meeting 
the spokesman was asked about reports that panamanians working 
for united states companies in panama were disgruntled over us 
economic sanctions designed to end the noriega regime 
we regret any hardship imposed on these longterm loyal 
employes he said noriegas actions demonstrate the great 
lengths he is willing to go to find money to shore up his illegal 
regime 
the united states sanctions remain in place popadiuk said 
they were undertaken in response to the call by the delvalle 
government for economic pressure against noriega the sanctions will 
remain in place until the panamanian people enjoy the full benefits 
of democracy 
panamas economic problems preceded the economic sanctions 
he said the panamanian economy was already deteriorating due to 
the noriega regimes policies 
when asked whether delvalle was considering resigning popadiuk 
said that is not my understanding of it we support his efforts 
to achieve democracy in panama and those efforts will be 
continuing 
we expect president delvalle to come to the white house some 
time tomorrow and we expect that he will have a brief meeting with 
the president he said 
he said the meeting would probably take place during the 
presidents regular morning briefing by his national security 
adviser lt gen colin l powell and bush would attend 
he said that as far as he knew it would be the first meeting 
between reagan and delvalle 
popadiuk declined to characterize efforts that we may or may 
not be undertaking to bring about noriegas ouster but asserted 
that our policy remains intact and that policy will continue 
the sanctions were modified on june 15 to authorize payment of 
taxes and fees for health maternity and retirement benefits for 
panamanians employed by us companies and uscontrolled 
panamanian companies 
on aug 24 another amendment authorized payment of import duties 
and port fees to facilitate us exports to panama 
popadiuk said he did not foresee any further exceptions 
he said that as far as he was aware delvalle was not bringing any 
new proposals 
the us sanctions have been in effect since february 
noriega has been indicted on drug trafficking charges by two 
federal grand juries in florida

a prosecutor said today that authorities have 
dropped an investigation of two suspects in the 1986 bombing of 
nightclub that killed two us soldiers and led to an american 
retaliatory strike against libya 
the us soldiers were among three people killed and more than 
200 injured in the april 5 1986 attack at the la belle discotheque 
a popular haunt of american soldiers in west berlina turkish woman 
also was killed 
detlev achamer west berlin justice ministry spokesman said the 
investigation of christiane endrigkeit and ahmed nawaf hasi was 
dropped because of lack of evidence the participation of the 
suspects in the bombing could not be determined with sufficient 
certainty achamer said 
at the time of ther arrests endrigkeit 28 and hasi 38 were 
considered prime suspects in the bombing 
the united states charged that libya was behind the attack ten 
days afterward us warplanes bombed tripoli and benghazi in libya 
in a retaliatory raid western diplomats say killed 100 people 
prosecutors originally said they suspected endrigkeit and an 
accomplice had planted the bomb at the disco for hasi hasi a 
palestinian is serving a 14year sentence for another terrorist 
attack in west berlin 
achamer said the investigation showed that endrigkeit was in the 
vicinity of where the bomb was planted shortly before it went off 
but he said authorities could not establish conclusive links betwen 
her and hasi 
achamer said he did not know if endrigkeit would be freed soon 
court records indicate she faces other unrelated charges 
achamer said police suspected hasi because the explosives used in 
the la belle attack were similar to those he used to bomb the 
germanarab friendship society in west berlin in 1985 and in a 
failed attack against an israeli jetliner in london in 1986 
hasis brother was convicted in the london incident 
some west german authorities had raised the possibility that 
syria had been behind the attack at la belle

north korea on wednesday urged south 
korea to hold talks on sending a team made up of athletes from both 
countries to the 1990 asian games in beijing 
the proposal came a day after north korea called for talks with 
the south and the united states on ending confrontation on the 
divided korean peninsula 
kim jongha the president of the south korean olympic committee 
said the proposal was outlined in a letter wednesday from his north 
korean counterpart kim yu sun 
north korea called for talks in the truce village of panmunjom in 
february to discuss forming a joint team for the asian games 
scheduled for september 1990 
the people of north korea ardently want to see both koreas 
participate together as a single team in the games which are 
intended to promote peace and goodwill among various asian 
peoples the letter said 
south korean officials said they were studying the proposal and 
had no immediate response but indicated they had favored such ideas 
in the past 
the two koreas are bitter foes with hundreds of thousands of 
troops stationed along their border 
north korea boycotted the 1988 olympics in seoul because its 
demand to be a cohost was rejected the communist nation also 
boycotted the 1986 asian games in seoul on the grounds that seoul 
refused to form a joint team 
talks on clearing the way for joint parliamentary sessions to 
negotiate a nonaggression pact are to resume dec 29 
us and soviet forces divided the korean peninsula when they 
ended the japanese occupation at the end of world war ii in 1945 
the north invaded the south in 1950 beginning the threeyear korean 
war 
the united states which supported the south has about 42000 
troops stationed in the country under a mutual defense treaty north 
korea is seeking the withdrawal of us forces as part of its 
proposals

a record 596 firms were barred in fiscal 1988 
from doing business with the military and more than 4000 people 
most in uniform were convicted of contracting misdeeds in just the 
last half of the year according to the pentagons inspector general 
the semiannual report ordered by congress suggests the defense 
departments auditors are becoming increasing effective at rooting 
out waste fraud and mismanagement saving billions in tax dollars 
but it also indicates that industry wrongdoing remains a pervasive 
boggling problem 
inspector general june gibbs brown said the fiscal year saw 
improved performance in every category by auditors and 
investigators 
in the last half of the year according to the report 
pentagon and us army corps of engineers auditors saved the 
government an estimated 66 billion by challenging contracts or 
plans overall in 35000 new reports they initiated challenges of 
127 billion in contract costs but many of those disputes wont be 
resolved until later 
an additional 913 million was saved through followup 
investigations of previous cases where managers had balked at 
auditors recommendations 
investigations led to the recovery of 1956 million in 
overcharges plus 505 million in fines and penalties and 642 
million in civil settlements and judgments 
nearly 3400 people were indicted including 464 by the justice 
department on the pentagons behalf 236 by local state or foreign 
authorities and 2664 via recommendations for courtsmartial 
within the military there were 4014 convictions counting cases 
where charges were lodged earlier and 3294 were through 
courtsmartial 
also during the sixmonth period the pentagon stripped a record 
312 contractors of their opportunity to bid for defense work the 
terms of such debarments though set on a casebycase basis 
typically last a minimum of three years coupled with the 284 
debarments in the first half of the year the 1988 total of 596 is 
the most since the independent inspector generals post was 
established in 1983 
in addition the bidding rights of another 259 contractors were 
suspended temporarily in the last half of the year 
among the more significant actions cited during the period were 
the conviction of former rep mario biaggi dny in the wedtech 
contract and bribery scandal a mischarging case involving todd 
pacific shipyards that resulted in a 5 million recovery and 
defective pricing cases against the mcdonnell douglas electronics 
co and the ford aerospace corp that resulted in settlements of 
36 million and 7 million respectively 
the report also noted a defective pricing and theft case 
involving the aero corp that ended with fines and restitution 
totaling 473740 and the recovery of property worth 25 million 
the pentagons fraud hotline meantime fielded 5381 reports 
during the period about the same as during the first half of the 
year of the total received 2118 were judged to be substantive 
complaints and were referred for investigation or other followup 
action an increase over the first six months the report states 
the inspector general by law maintains a staff of auditors and 
investigators who operate independently outside the control of top 
pentagon executives the latest report is dated nov 29 but was not 
released until wednesday

pandering to the weird obsession of an obscenely rich woman 
by allowing tobacco heiress doris duke to keep pet camels at her 
estate 
i am outraged by the special treatment accorded this wealthy 
family councilman neil abercrombie said in a letter tuesday to 
john whalen the director of the city department of land utilization 
last week the state board of agriculture unanimously agreed to 
allow duke 75 and her adopted daughter charlene gail chandi 
heffner 35 bring pet camels from new jersey to hawaii for the 
winter the twohump camels would live at dukes oceanfront estate 
the camels would not be subject to the 120day state quarantine 
for household pets but would be treated as cattle allowing duke to 
keep them under a 65day provisional quarantine officials said 
abercrombie said he was especially angry because as a state 
legislator he had lobbied to have guide dogs for the blind be exempt 
from hawaiis quarantine laws but the agriculture board rejected 
that 
something like that they fight but now theyre pandering to 
the weird obsession of this obscenely rich woman he said 
whalen said he would look into abercrombies complaints 
ronald leong dukes attorney said he was not familiar with

the illinois supreme court on wednesday 
upheld the murder convictions of david hendricks a former back 
brace salesman sentenced to life in prison for the ax and knife 
slayings of his wife and three children 
hendricks parents said they have private investigators working 
on the case to find the real killer 
were going to continue to do all in our power to prove davids 
innocence said hendricks father charles hendricks of 
allendale we know hes innocent 
in a 42 decision the supreme court rejected hendricks 
arguments that he was wrongly convicted in 1984 because jurors were 
prejudiced by testimony about his membership in a fundamentalist 
christian religion and sexual promiscuity 
justice william clark issued a strong dissent asserting the 
testimony should not have been allowed and a new trial should have 
been ordered the case against hendricks was circumstantial no 
direct evidence linked the defendant in any way to the crime 
clark wrote 
justice joseph cunningham writing for the majority said 
however the admission of evidence about hendricks character or 
likelihood to commit illegal or immoral acts was proper to 
establish a motive 
cunningham added that testimony about hendricks membership in 
the plymouth brethren religious group strengthened the evidence 
against him implying he had a motive to murder his family because 
divorce was not easily acceptable to his religion 
hendricks 34 was convicted in november 1984 after a 10week 
trial that included gruesome testimony about the killings of his 
wife susan 30 and their children rebekah 9 grace 7 and 
benjamin 5 in their bloomington home 
hendricks trial moved to rockford because of media coverage in 
the bloomingtonnormal area included two night sessions held so 
jurors could not watch fatal vision a television movie about a 
similar case 
much of the trial testimony centered on hendricks alleged sexual 
advances toward models he hired for advertising brochures for his 
braces some models testified that hendricks asked them to disrobe 
unnecessarily fondled them and made other advances 
the prosecution contended hendricks real target was his wife 
and that he killed his children and tried to create the appearance 
of a burglary to conceal his role in the crime 
presiding judge richard baner declined to impose a death 
sentence saying he wasnt convinced hendricks had been proved 
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
the supreme court ruling came just a day after hendricks married 
pat miller at the menard correctional center the new mrs 
hendricks 37 of toledo ohio said she met her husband last year 
through the mother of another prisoner 
among those at the wedding was susan hendricks mother nadine 
palmer 55 of delavan who also believes in hendricks innocence 
well do whatever we can to work on his release and show his 
innocence she said after hearing of the high courts decision 
the whole thing is a travesty of the justice system

the firm selected by the pentagon to 
demonstrate a model for overhauling the militarys troubled health 
insurance system is itself having problems and is in danger of 
seeing its contract canceled officials say 
the foundation health corp of sacramento calif has received 
two formal deficiency and cure notices the most recent dated 
dec 13 and been given a deadline of jan 3 to convince the 
pentagon it can correct its problems officials say 
defense department health officials say they remain hopeful the 
program can be salvaged they express frustration because the 
contractors difficulties can be traced to plain old claims 
processing and not to the innovative changes we made 
the contractor is having trouble processing the claims of 
doctors and health professionals on a timely basis adds david 
newhall the pentagons principal deputy assistant secretary for 
health affairs 
phone calls to dr james schubert the head of foundation were 
not returned on either tuesday or wednesday 
newhall said the innovative changes appear to be working were 
seeing strong doctor acceptance strong beneficiary acceptance and 
early evidence that we can save money but weve got to correct this 
other problem 
the award of the health contract to foundation was announced with 
great ballyhoo last january both because of its potential size and 
the sweeping nature of its terms 
the contract was described as being worth up to 3 billion over 
the next five years and as representing the best hope yet of 
reforming champus the civilian health and medical program of the 
uniformed services 
champus is an insurance plan that covers military dependents and 
retirees when they turn to the civilian sector for care either 
because they want to use a private physician or because space is not 
available in military hospitals 
the cost of champus has been skyrocketing in recent years and now 
approaches 25 billion a year to rein in those costs the pentagon 
asked foundation to set up a demonstration project in california and 
hawaii to prove that dependents and retirees would take advantage of 
a health maintenance organization or hmo if it were available 
there are roughly 125000 military dependents and retirees living 
in the two states who use champus each year in return for agreeing 
to use the doctors and hospitals specified by foundation those 
retirees and dependents are being offered additional medical 
services at lower cost 
at the same time the defense department expects to save millions 
because foundation has signed fixedprice contracts for the delivery 
of care with groups of doctors instead of continuing to pay 
whatever bills are submitted by private doctors 
newhall says there has been much interest in the new program 
champus prime enrollment exceeds expectations by 50 percent 
there are over 18000 enrollees and growing he says 
unfortunately however about 40 percent of the total claims 
from providers are more than a month old and when your doctors 
dont get paid on time you have a problem 
according to the latest cure notice the pentagon views the 
companys lack of responsiveness as an extremely grave 
situation for the government 
in other words you have not provided the government concrete 
or adequate evidence that you can deliver a technical solution to 
correcting your contract deficiencies we believe it is 
imperative that real measureable and verifiable progress be made 
this simply means that the existing claims backlog must be 
reduced and processing improved your failure to adequately respond 
to this letter by jan 3 1989 could result in the termination of 
this contract for default 
it is fair to say we think the contractor understands the 
seriousness of the pentagons stance newhall said 
and the contractor appears to be moving in directions that 
suggest the possibility of a continuing relationship although that 
is still by no means certain 
newhall declined to speculate on what the pentagon would do if it 
ended up canceling foundations contract 
every attempt would be made given the substantial successes in 
all areas except claims processing to protect the reform 
initiative he said but its still unclear exactly how the 
department would proceed

israeli troops shot and wounded at least seven 
palestinians on wednesday during a strike by residents of the 
occupied territories demanding more support from their israeli arab 
brethren 
the roman catholic patriarch in jerusalem called for nine days of

veterinarians at the new york aquarium said 
wednesday that a baby female pilot whale found stranded in shallow 
water near a marina has little chance of surviving 
aquarium spokesman rick miller said the animal which may be as 
young as 2 weeks was under constant care and being fed a rich 
mixture of infant formula heavy cream cottage cheese and vitamins 
he said aquarium officials knew of no baby longfinned pilot 
whale surviving after being separated from its mother the mammals 
often nurse for 14 to 16 months meaning veterinarians must force 
feed the young whale through a tube 
in this case the newborn whale is showing signs of pneumonia 
and weight loss said aquarium director louis garibaldi 
should the whale survive and recover miller said experts would 
try to return it to the ocean 
the young animal was found tuesday morning stranded in shallow 
water at the barren island marina in marine park in brooklyn about 
a mile from the open ocean 
marina owner ted sunday who waded into the kneedeep cold water 
to help the whale said it was making a very very sad sound like 
a weeping like a whining sound thats what prodded me to stay in 
the water a little longer 
sunday said he urged the whale into slightly deeper water and 
stayed with it until an aquarium crew arrived 
whale experts at the aquarium had no way of knowing what happened 
to the whales mother but speculated she may have rejected her 
offspring or perhaps gotten sick and died it was also possible the 
baby whale had become ill and was unable to keep up with other 
whales 
pilot whales are common along the east coast and range as far 
north as greenland and south to north carolina miller said the 
young whale found tuesday was about 6 feet long but fully grown 
females grow to as much as 20 feet a fully grown male may reach 28 
feet in length miller said

prime minister ranasinghe premadasa 
facing two rebellions at home and an uneasy relationship with 
regional superpower india will be an embattled president from the 
moment he takes office on jan 2 
opposition accusations that he won the presidency by fraud could 
make his task to reunify a nation split by deep political and ethnic 
rivalries even more difficult 
if the opposition gets its way the election will be nullified 
former prime minister sirimavo bandaranaike who won 449 percent 
of the vote compared with 504 percent for premadasa claimed she 
was denied the presidency by government fraud 
i would have been the winner if it would have been done fair 
she said adding that her party would challenge the results in the 
supreme court 
but premadasas main task will be to end the ethnic bloodshed 
that has killed nearly 10000 people on this tropical indian ocean 
island since 1983 when tamil minority extremists began an 
insurgency to win independence from the majority sinhalese 
sinhalese extremists belonging to the peoples liberation front 
have since launched their own violent campaign to undermine the 
government 
they abhor the 1987 accord with new delhi that provides limited 
autonomy to tamils and places 47000 indian peacekeeping troops on 
sri lankan soil 
premadasa the candidate of the ruling united national party won 
mondays election with 504 percent of the vote he immediately 
appealed to the front to join the democratic process by contesting 
february parliamentary elections the first in 11 years 
he had laid the groundwork for such an appeal during the 
campaign when he took pains not to blame the front for violence 
widely attributed to the group 
if the extremists decline the new president could decide a 
relentless crackdown is the only solution hoping the bulk of sri 
lankas 16 million people would support such a move as the best 
alternative to restore law and order 
a rebuff of the overture by the extremists said one western 
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity would make people 
more likely to back him if he decides to go out and do some 
bashing 
the front which nearly toppled the government in november with a 
boycott that has since lost steam has given no indication of its 
next move 
it remains to be seen whether the fronts power was diminished by 
the presidential elections which the group had vowed to undermine 
the insurgency of tamil separatists in the northeast meanwhile 
has yet to be quelled despite the positioning of indian troops to 
enforce the 1987 accord that grants some autonomy to the minority 
group that comprises 18 percent of the population 
premadasa says he wants the indian soldiers out of his country 
but reality might require they stay 
india which has become more active as regional superpower under 
prime minister rajiv gandhi remains dedicated to keeping its troops 
in place until the separatist insurgency is quashed 
and if the indian troops were to withdraw from the north while 
sinhalese extremists remained active in the south the sri lankan 
armed forces would be drawn impossibly thin to deal with both 
uprisings 
one possible solution would be a token withdrawal of some indian 
troops that premadasa could use as proof of progress on his pledge 
quelling the insurgencies could help premadasa tackle the other 
huge problem he faces a national economy in shambles 
the fighting not only has devastated the islands crucial tourism 
industry but has cut into agricultural production as well 
in 1987 for example adverse weather and civil disturbances were 
largely responsible for an 11 percent decline in rubber production 
and 25 percent drop in coconut production the two top crops after 
tea 
premadasa comes from a humble background and has vowed to better 
living standards in this impoverished country where the annual per 
capita income is 360 
he has proposed a welfare program under which many sri lankan 
families would qualify for 75 monthly in benefits for two years 
where the government would come up with the money however he 
has not outlined 
still the presidentelects populist pitch upcoming 
parliamentary elections that many political parties have long 
demanded and the widespread desire for law and order all could work 
in premadasas favor as he grapples with the daunting task of 
resurrecting sri lanka

president daniel ortega on wednesday 
handed out thousands of christmas toys to poor children in 
shantytowns 
in the neighborhood of acalhualinca some 2000 children many of 
them in tattered shorts and barefoot waited in long lines on a dirt 
field for the gifts the girls received dolls or a plastic tea set 
while the boys grabbed for plastic rifles and trucks 
the 1 million in toys came from profits from governmentrun hard 
currency stores officials said the 14 stores nationwide sell goods 
ranging from basic foods to stereos for dollars only most items 
sold are rarely found in the common markets 
the toys wrapped in plastic with writing in english were made 
in taiwan a country that does not maintain diplomatic relations 
with nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
the sandinistas who came to power almost a decade ago have been 
making a push this year to show there is no contradiction between 
leftist revolution and christianity 
the opposition newspaper la prensa on tuesday printed a headline 
saying sad christmas cardinal asks for faith 
the nicaraguan economy has never been worse private estimates 
put the annual inflation at more than 20000 percent highest in the 
world ortega recently acknowledged that figure could be correct 
new economic measures were expected to be announced in the next 
two weeks a series of plans designed to right the situation failed 
to pull the bankrupt nation out the mire 
despite up to 500 million in soviet bloc aid the average worker 
earns only about 10 a month a christmas dinner of chicken and rice 
for a family would be a days pay 
the government blames the economic crisis on the sevenyear war 
with usbacked contra rebels little is said about corruption and 
mismanagement 
the war activity diminished substantially after the march 23 
ceasefire talks but fighting continues in the countryside 
until we solve the political problems we cant solve the 
economic ones francisco taboada a leader of the social christian 
party said in an interview tuesday night people need guarantees 
their land wont be confiscated theres no confidence 
taboada a neurologlist said christmas would be sad for the tens 
of thousands of nicarguans whose families fled to the united states 
no matter how much money they send back home that cant 
compensate for the saddness he said 
on wednesday few of the children receiving gifts appeared to 
think about such sadness about 14500 were to be handed presents by 
ortega who wore a green military uniform 
this is so nice said lester enrique lopez eyeing his new 
plastic rifle 
socorro mejia 27 held her 2yearold son and walked with her 
five other children all carrying toys 
this is happiness for the children she said 
blanca rosa cuba dias held her gift of doll dishes tightly and

mother teresa said wednesday she will send eight 
nuns to moscow and armenia to care for earthquake victims in a 
country where charitable work by religious organizations has been 
illegal for about 60 years 
the nuns will work with victims of the dec 7 armenian earthquake 
and other severely injured hospital patients under a sixmonth trial 
agreement under which they will keep their religious services to 
themselves 
if all goes well i hope we shall be able to prolong the 
agreement said genrikh borovik president of the soviet peace 
commitee which along with the ministry of health concluded an 
agreement with mother teresa the 1979 nobel peace prize winner 
the 78yearold roman catholic nun told a moscow news conference 
that her yearold offer to send her sisters to the soviet union was 
suddenly accepted wednesday when an emissary from president mikhail 
s gorbachev showed up on her doorstep 
she was in the soviet capital on her way back from visiting 
earthquake victims in armenia 
we have no gold and silver to give said mother teresa 
referring to the more than 100 million in international aid that 
has poured into the soviet union since the quake killed an estimated 
55000 people 
but we are very happy to give tender love and care to the 
people to the sick the dying the lonely to anybody who needs 
love said the nun who has spent her life serving the destitute 
of calcutta 
the russian orthodox church which has been banned from 
charitable work for decades has in the past year begun reaching 
out financing a rehabilitation hospital for soviet veterans of the 
war in afghanistan the few orthodox nuns in the soviet union have 
been limited to working with other nuns and priests 
religious organizations have been banned from charitable 
activities in the soviet union since strict rules were imposed under 
josef stalin in 1929 officials have been saying for more than a 
year they are rewriting laws to make religion freer but the new 
legislation has not yet been published 
four of mother teresas nuns will be given three rooms at the 
institute of neurosurgery in moscow where they will live and work 
with victims of spinal injuries and other severe trauma who need 
both physical rehabilitation and spiritual assistance said arkady 
v lifshitz a professor with the institute 
we have agreed that any religious services would be for 
themselves and not for the patients or the public he said 
the other four nuns will work with quake victims in armenia no 
more specific location was given 
mother teresa offered her orders services to the soviet union in 
august 1987 when she was visiting victims of the chernobyl nuclear 
power plant accident she said the soviet peace committee has been 
working on the idea since that time 
borovik said mother teresas offer was treated cautiously at 
first because it was a new idea there had never been anything like 
that before the nuns role first had to be explained to doctors 
at the hospital he said but he added that the radical changes 
sweeping through the soviet union also played a role 
this society is growing increasingly open and that has had some 
effect borovik said 
mother teresa heads the missionaries of charity a worldwide 
order of 3000 nuns of 35 nationalities with houses in 87 
countries she said the eight nuns coming to the soviet union were 
from india yugoslavia poland and italy and she would welcome any 
young soviet women who would like to join her order 
the nun said she already has nuns working in cuba yugoslavia 
east germany and poland and she has discussed the idea with 
officials in china 
while in beijing she said she was asked what is a communist 
to you and she replied a child of god 
soon newspapers were headlining mother teresa says communists 
are children of god she said smiling 
the nun said the suffering she saw in armenia was very 
terrible but she was surprised to see that despite the suffering 
every victim was able to smile back at her 
i think it helped a lot that the whole world is sharing and 
helping she said

anyone who helps prevent terrorist acts against 
american citizens or property abroad will be eligible for payments 
of up to 500000 under an expanded rewards program announced 
wednesday by the state department 
since 1984 the state department has offered rewards for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of perpetrators of 
specific terrorist acts 
the expanded program includes payment for information that leads 
to the prevention frustration or favorable resolution of 
terrorist acts against american citizens or property overseas state 
department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
she said the department is distributing to all us diplomatic 
missions overseas posters advertising the program the posters are 
printed in english french german spanish and arabic 
anyone with terrorism information should notify the nearest us 
embassy or consulate mrs oakley said information received will be 
handled confidentially and the identities of informants will be 
protected 
rewards have been offered for information on six terrorist 
incidents since the program began but no payments have been made 
we hope that the broader approach to the program will produce 
more information and more potential rewards recipients mrs 
oakley said 
offers of rewards have been made for information on two airline 
hijackings and one involving a ship the bombing of a twa flight and 
the assassinations of americans in greece and el salvador 
the largest reward offer 500000 was made concerning the 
assassination of us navy capt william nordeen last june 28 in 
greece 
mrs oakley emphasized that no money under the rewards program is 
payable for the release of american hostages 
actual payment under this program would only be made after the 
arrest of those responsible for the taking or holding of hostages or 
if the information is provided subsequent to the arrest that 
contributes to a successful prosecution after their conviction 
she said 
she said the rewards program is one of the several tools used to 
prevent and investigate incidents of terrorism 
publicity surrounding awards for terrorism information is 
designed to create uncertainty among the terrorists increase 
mistrust among their ranks and emphasize to them and to the public 
that they are personally at risk she said 
she said the expansion of the program is not the result of any 
particular event

president reagan on wednesday ordered a 
steppedup schedule of reductions in import duties on western red 
cedar shingles and shakes saying recent market trends have impaired 
the effectiveness of the import relief he put into effect 2 years 
ago 
reagan imposed import duties on june 6 1986 on a schedule 
calling for their gradual reduction over five years with a review 
after 30 months 
the international trade commission meanwhile was directed to 
study what would be the probable economic effect on the domestic 
industry if the import relief were terminated at the end of the 
30month period 
reagan said the commission was equally divided on whether 
continuing the duties would spur adjustments that would make the 
domestic industry more competitive 
on the basis of the advice that i have received i have 
determined that the industry has undertaken positive adjustment 
efforts to improve competitiveness during the 30month period of 
relief he said however the additional duties have burdened 
consumers and have encouraged substitution of alternative nonwood 
roofing materials 
i have determined that recent market trends have impaired the 
effectiveness of import relief provided to the domestic industry 
he said accordingly i have determined that is is in the national 
interest to accelerate the reduction of import duties 
reagans order means the duties will remain in effect but will 
be reduced more rapidly than the original schedule called for the 
new schedule is effective jan 1

field trials this year proved the safety of a 
new biological product that would enable corn to grow its own 
pesticide its developer said wednesday 
the bioinsecticide or cxcbt was developed by crop genetics 
international corp of hanover md and is aimed at controlling the 
european corn borer a pest estimated to cost 400 million in losses 
annually to the nations corn crop 
a series of tests was performed in maryland this year and crop 
genetics said it will seek further approval from the agriculture 
department and the environmental protection agency to carry out 
additional field trials in 1989 at various locations including 
major corn areas of the midwest 
the scientific data from our field trials in maryland confirms 
the environmental safety of our bioinsecticide said peter s 
carlson chief scientist and cofounder of the company 
some environmentalists had feared the bioinsecticide might spread 
to other plants or to humans and other animal species 
but crop genetics said the maryland tests showed that cxcbt does 
not multiply or survive outside its host plant the cxc part of the 
vaccine was described as a naturally occurring microorganism 
which can live only inside a plants vascular system 
the bt part is lethal to the borer but harmless to humans 
animals birds and nontarget insects the company said the 
product which the firm calls incide is inserted in corn seed and 
then enables corn plants to grow their own biopesticide against the 
borer 
company officials said the 1989 field tests will include yield 
and production information to see how well the biopesticide performs

the rightwing likud bloc and the centerleft 
labor party voted at separate meetings wednesday to approve a joint 
coalition assuring a new national unity government after seven 
weeks of interparty haggling 
both likuds prime minister yitzhak shamir and labors foreign 
minister shimon peres faced opposition from within their parties 
before winning approval for the accord shamirs opponents accused 
him of selling out israels security and some labor members told 
peres he was dealing a death blow to the peace process 
both leaders told their parties that a unity government was 
crucial to withstand the challenges facing israel especially the 
plos recent declaration of an independent palestinian state and the 
us decision to open a dialogue with the organization 
if a joint government with likud and labor had not been 
established this process of isolation and conflict with the world 
would have persisted peres told his supporters by building 
such a government such a process will be halted 
the government announced a special session on thursday of the 
knesset or parliament for installation of the new government the 
two parties will formally sign the pact before the ceremony likud 
officials said 
three of israels four religious parties the orthodox agudat 
israel the torah flag and the national religious party said late 
wednesday they would join the new government but they will be 
secondary to the major parties and will lack the influence they 
sought and thought they had won in a narrow coalition with likud 
under the new agreement worked out after seven weeks of haggling 
among all parties who won votes in nov 1 elections shamir will 
retain his post for the next four years peres the current foreign 
minister will serve as finance minister 
moshe arens a close shamir ally and former defense minister as 
well as former ambassador in washington will be foreign minister 
other key portfolios will remain the same including labors 
yitzhak rabin as defense minister and likuds ariel sharon as 
industry minister 
each of the two large parties will have 11 ministers but the 
cabinet could number up to 25 if the religious parties join 
labor and likud have ruled israel in an uneasy coalition since 
1984 when stalemated elections gave neither party a mandate a 
similar stalemate resulted from the latest elections but likud 
gained a slight edge winning 40 seats to labors 39 the rest of 
the votes were split among smaller parties 
in a decision certain to create friction with washington the two 
parties agreed specifically to ban contacts with the palestine 
liberation organization which israel views as a terrorist group 
israeli leaders were stunned last week when the united states 
reversed a 13year ban on talking to the group 
other government policies are expected to resemble those of the 
old coalition as well 
the labor partys 1275member central committee voted by an 
overwhelming show of hands in favor of the coalition at a meeting in 
the tel aviv suburb of givatayim 
peres vowed he would try to revive the middle east peace process 
although he would no longer be foreign minister 
the flag of the peace process remains in our hands it has 
nothing to do with a ministry peres said he indicated he would 
strive for a territorial compromise with palestinians in the 
occupied lands which israel captured in the 1967 middle east war 
likud strongly opposes trading land for peace 
the labor party prefers a jewish majority to territories he 
said we prefer peace 
younger legislators countered that labor in its weakened 
position would be unnable to overcome likuds objections to its 
peace initiatives 
you once called yitzhak shamir the murderer of peace now he 
has three lawyers on his team so he can murder it again labor 
legislator chaim ramon was quoted by israel radio as saying 
the haaretz newspaper said that according to the pact peres 
would have to be consulted on all major foreign policy issues 
likud approved the new pact in secret balloting at an allnight 
meeting in tel aviv the party said 551 percent of 1445 party 
delegates voted for the agreement 
leading the opposition in likud was sharon who argued that 
israel needed a tougher government to quell the yearlong uprising 
by palestinians in the occupied territories in which more than 330 
palestinians and 13 israelis have been killed 
sharon argued that labors conciliatory policies were a danger 
to israels future and security 
the new coalition agreement as published by the haaretz daily 
newspaper contains a new feature that would bar either labor of 
likud from pulling out and forming a narrow coaliton with smaller 
factions 
new elections would have to be held if the government were 
toppled by a noconfidence motion in parliament the paper quoted 
the agreement as saying 
shamir said on israel television that the includes a secret 
amendment regulating the relations between two party heads but 
would not elaborate 
likud officials have accused peres of acting behind shamirs back 
in the outgoing government to push his own peace proposals

moslem extremists fighting for strict 
adherence to islamic laws were responsible for more than 100 violent 
attacks recently the interior minister said wednesday 
the minister zaki badr said the religious extremists have 
desecrated mosques by using them as arms depots and centers of drug 
trafficking according to the staterun middle east new agency 
police in cairo killed three extremists in a shootout monday 
including the suspected assassin of a police officer in cairos ein 
shams district earlier this month 
at a mosque in ein shams security sources said 32 bottles of 
incendiary materials were found last week there also have been 
reports of firecracker explosions at two coptic christian churches 
in cairo 
the security apparatus has monitored more than 100 attacks by 
religious extremists throughout the republic the agency quoted 
badr as saying he said they set fire to shops pharmacies and cars 
and attacked moslem and christian houses of worship the interior 
minister gave no dates for the attacks 
badrs remarks followed a recent crackdown on moslem extremists 
in ein shams where two police officers and three civilians have 
been killed since august in unrest linked to the fundamentalists 
since then more than 300 extremists have been detained 
the government said most were affiliated with the jihad 
underground group blamed for the assassination of president anwar 
sadat on oct 6 1981 and a subsequent coup attempt 
badr said security forces are mopping up all criminal dens and 
have been able to clean the ein shams district of the extremists who 
tried to control it and to prevent wedding and death observances 
the moslem groups consider wedding festivities and traditional 
funeral ceremonies as antiislamic 
moslem extremists are using violence to demand the strict 
implementation of sharia islams legal and ethical code 
they have turned mosques into storehouses for arms and 
ammunition and used them for attacks and for trading in narcotics of 
all kinds for the benefit of those who use religion as a screen 
said badr 
in the southern city of assiut a center of fundamentalist 
activity clashes have been reported at mosques in recent months 
the assiut university campus has been the site of many clashes 
between police and fundamentalist students badr estimated there 
were more than 800 extremists among the more than 45000 students 
the extremists have turned some mosques no more than 25 out 
of 70000 mosques nationwide into dens from which to mount their 
crimes against the people badr said according to the news agency 
badr was quoted as saying he has the legal power to order the 
demolition of buildings used as centers of crime but he ruled out 
such action against mosques because we are a devout moslem 
nation 
mosques also have been used as battlegrounds between the 
extremists and moderate fundamentalists from the moslem brotherhood 
which has 35 seats in parliament and is using peaceful methods to 
insist on the observance of sharia the government says more than 90 
percent of egyptian laws already conform to sharia and the rest will 
be implemented gradually 
badr made his remarks in a speech to a committee of the shura 
council a consultative body of elders that works alongside the 
peoples assembly or parliament but has no legislative powers

one boy said his worst christmas present 
was a packet of cocaine and a bottle of jack daniels a second said 
he never received a christmas gift from his family 
the letters are often poignant sometimes disturbing when 
youngsters at boys town were asked to describe their best and worst 
christmases some recalled physical abuse alcoholism and turmoil 
while others reminisced about happy family holidays long past 
a teenage resident recalled the time he got an empty box a girl 
said that on her worst holiday all she got was bruises 
the rev val j peter executive director of boys town asked 
more than 500 students at the residential treatment center to 
describe their best and worst holidays as part of a religion class 
assignment 
my worst was when i got nothing because my mother had the money 
and she spent it on alcohol one high school girl wrote 
my saddest christmas was a few years ago on christmas eve 
because santa forgot to come another youngster said 
peter a roman catholic priest said the exercise was designed to 
help the youths get in touch with bad experiences and begin to look 
to a brighter future the letters were provided wednesday to the 
associated press on the condition that the youngsters names not be 
revealed 
christmas is the most difficult time of the year for our boys 
and girls because christmas is a family time and their families are 
in shambles peter said in an interview 
the letters express times of darkness tears and loneliness 
he said i think all the children in america ought to read these 
letters when they read them some gratitude ought to swell up in 
their hearts and they will say thank you lord for everything i 
have 
boys town founded in 1917 and made famous by the 1938 movie of 
the same name about the rev edward flanagans boys home provides 
treatment in a fosterhome setting to children sent by courts 
social service agencies and church leaders the 1300acre campus 
which is an incorporated community is located on the outskirts of 
omaha 
most of the 550 residents are victims of abuse neglect and 
abandonment said tom schuyler a boys town spokesman many have 
been in trouble with the law 
we call them throwaway kids nobody else wants them a lot of 
them are from failed foster home placements some have failed in 15 
or 20 previous placements he said 
not all of the letters were sad some expressed unhappiness over 
unwanted presents familiar to many households including a michael 
jackson doll three pair of wrangler bellbottom jeans and 
a plaid vneck sweater that mom insisted i wear 
but most students related tales of family turmoil abuse and 
alcoholism 
one boy said his saddest memory was when his father left the 
family on christmas eve 
here are some excerpts 
when i was real little my father was an alcoholic and beat my 
mother on christmas morning the police were called by the neighbors 
and my father was thrown in jail my mom was bloody and bruised 
the worst gift i ever got at christmas was cocaine and a 
fifth of jack daniels schuyler explained the boy received those 
gifts while trying to recover from drug and alcohol dependency 
my saddest christmas was in las vegas when i didnt get 
anything but bruises i was with my grandma and she was drunk on 
christmas so she beat on the kids saying we were bad 
my saddest christmas was last christmas because i lost my 
closest family member my dad he killed himself 
likewise the memories of happiest christmases focused almost 
exclusively on good experiences tied to family gatherings 
my happiest christmas was the christmas all of my family was 
getting along and everyone was all together 
my happiest was when my real dad came and saw all of us 
schuyler said he took the letters home and read them to his four 
children ages 8 to 16 he said they seemed to get a clue that 
getting three or four presents isnt the only thing in life 
kids wouldnt take their family life for granted if they read 
these letters he said

a noted expert on the soviet union george 
kennan said in an interview broadcast wednesday that mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms mark the greatest turning point in russia 
since the bolshevik revolution and are a big help to the united 
states 
i think it is greatly in our interest when he is doing all the 
things that we have always wanted someone to do in russia said 
kennan who as us ambassador to moscow was declared persona non 
grata in 1952 under kremlin strongman josef stalin 
in my opinion gorbachevs reforms in concept were sound and 
correct and if carried through will lead to a very important 
improvement in soviet life kennan said on the macneillehrer 
newshour 
kennan 84 called gorbachevs reforms the greatest turning 
point really not only since the second world war but since the 
russian revolution in 1917 
the ideological basis of soviet foreign policy he said has 
entirely disappeared no one in russia today dreams of trying to 
implement world revolution in our time or even to stage any 
communist revolutions in any of the western countries 
kennan said he hoped the bush administration would recognize that 
moscow was less threatening than in the past 
i would like to hope of course that the men around mr bush 
and mr bush himself saw things this way too and realized that the 
cold war is really has been left in the past he said 
gorbachevs reforms thus far have not improved living conditions 
for the soviet people and as a result the soviet leaders 
position today is very precarious because he has had hard luck and 
a lot of things have gone adversely and he is being blamed for 
them 
one of the biggest obstacles to successful reforms in russia 
said kennan was the moral damage inflicted on most soviet 
people during the stalinist years of terror and the period of 
stagnation under leonid i brezhnev 196482 
you have a deplorable and pathetic situation with these 
people for theyve lived all their lives under authoritarian 
discipline and control theyve been deprived of even the idea that 
they could ever change their situation by their own indiviual 
initiative and now while they are confronted with the possibility of 
what you might call freedom they have no ide how to take advantage 
of it 
kennan said he was unable to explain how such a daring leader as 
gorbachev rose through the ranks of the highly disciplined soviet 
communist party during the brezhnev years to carry out sweeping 
reforms of the system 
numbers of us who have known that country for a long time 
simply stand without explanation as to how a man with those 
qualities could have emerged from a provincial party apparatus 
kennan said 
the main impetus for change said kennan was the realization 
on the part of many intelligent people in the soviet union in these 
recent years of the fact that the whole system was going downhill 
that it was no longer competitive that the capitalist countries 
were going far beyond it 
the change after all has been a change inspired and carried 
out from the top from the upper reaches of the political society 
and not really from the bottom it is these people who saw how 
inadequate the system was and who have tried to take action to 
change it

the decision by israels two major parties to 
join a coalition has edged the ultraorthodox parties from a 
posiiton of influence and effectively killed the chances of the 
who is a jew law that incensed us jews 
although the religious parties emerged from nov 1 elections as 
kingmakers with control of a crucial bloc of parliament seats they 
drove themselves out of the market by setting too high a price for 
their support 
the price a package that included the legislation threatened 
to alienate jews abroad who are israels mainstay of support 
three of israels four religious parties decided to join the 
government led by the centerleft labor and the rightwing likud 
but experts said the new coalition essentially counts religious 
parties out of major policy decisions 
this is a revolution said shmuel sandler of the jerusalem 
center for public affairs 
likud won 40 members in the 120member parliament while labor 
won 39 the 18 seats won by the religious parties gave them a 
powerful swing vote 
in the seven weeks of squabbling following the stalemated 
elections the religious parties ran back and forth between the 
major blocs often arguing between themselves over the same 
government posts 
finally likud and labor settled their differences leaving room 
for the orthodox to join but not requiring their support 
the most controversial demand made by the religious parties was a 
change in the definition of who is eligible for automatic 
citizenship under israels unique law of return which opens the 
countrys doors to any jew 
the orthodox wanted to exclude any person who converted to the 
faith under a nonorthodox rabbi most us jews are not orthodox 
jews overseas launched what many called an unprecedented campaign 
to convey their anger to leaders of likud and labor who were wooing 
the religious parties with a promise to pass the law 
the pressure from the diaspora made political leaders in israel 
recognize that diaspora jews care deeply about what israel 
does said rabbi richard g hirsch executive director of the 
world union for progressive judaism 
it also made them recognize that there is no jewish people 
without the jewish state and no jewish state without the jewish 
people and the law of return is symbolic of that 
the turning point came when the united states reversed its 
position against talks with the palestine liberation organization 
which is banned in israel as a terrorist group 
analysts say prime minister yitzhak shamir realized he needed a 
broad and unified government to withstand international pressure to 
make concessions to the palestinians 
shamir couldnt wage a war on two fronts said prof menachem 
friedman a bar ilan university sociologist specializing in 
religious affairs it would not be smart to get into a fight or 
even cause tension with us jewry and reduce their motivation to 
support israel 
labor leader shimon peres said the new pact brings an end to 
the change in the law of return the new government will keep 
the jewish people united he said 
religious party leaders reacted with anger when they were 
informed likud would not keep its commitments because of the broad 
government with labor 
even the mafia keeps its promises rabbi yitzhak peretz of 
the orthodox shas party told the maariv newspaper 
some analysts said they hope labor and likud free of the 
religious parties will pass a bill reforming the countrys complex 
elections system that often leaves small parties in positions of 
power 
the religious parties already have expressed vehement opposition 
however and the tradition of their participation in the government 
may not disappear so easily

people scalp tickets all the time reasoned 
susan stein so why not scalp a place in class 
the graduate student at the university of nebraskalincoln did 
just that to get into a class she needed 
during early registration she discovered a seminars 12 positions 
were filled thats when she ran an advertisement in the daily 
nebraskan the university newspaper 
if you got in this class next semester the ad read ill 
buy your place 
state your price 
ms stein struck a deal with an unidentified person and shes in 
the class she didnt divulge details of the transaction 
while her ad raised a few eyebrows ms stein said she had heard 
that the practice went on at other colleges 
i think i took everybody off guard no one here had heard of 
paying for a class space before she said 
ted pfeiffer director of registration and records at the 
university said buying a spot isnt illegal and there isnt any 
regulation that prohibits it 
pfeifer said instructors usually set the size of a class and many 
times agree to add students particularly if the students need 
appears to be urgent 
i guess it says a lot about the power of advertising ms

the nuclear regulatory commission on wednesday 
cleared the way for the 57 billion seabrook nh plant to 
receive a lowpower testing license and ruled that the pilgrim 
reactor in massachusetts can resume operations after a shutdown of 
nearly three years 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis called the moves 
irrational and irresponsible on ground that communities 
surrounding the new england plants cannot be quickly evacuated in 
case of a nuclear accident 
the former democratic presidential nominee immediately filed suit 
in federal appeals court in boston in an effort to block the restart 
of pilgrim and the governor reiterated his pledge to fight a 
seabrook license in court if one is issued 
nrc chairman lando w zech jr said seabrook could get its 
lowpower license which permits testing at 5 percent power as 
early as jan 6 if it can set aside 721 million the nrc said the 
owners must have that money on hand for decommissioning costs in 
case seabrook receives the testing permit but never gets a 
fullpower commercial license 
seabrook also cannot receive the license which it has sought for 
more than two years until the atomic safety and licensing board 
rules on a request by massachusetts officials to review alleged 
problems with the operators response during a june exercise of the 
plants emergency plans 
but seabrook officials said the commissions staff has already 
recommended that the licensing board reject the states request and 
that they expected the issue to be resolved shortly 
ted g feigenbaum vice president at new hampshire yankee 
operator of the plant also said that while seabrook officials 
estimated possible decommissioning costs at 211 million he did 
not view the larger fund demanded by the nrc as a stumbling block 
he predicted lowpower testing would be under way next month 
the nrc also rejected unanimously an appeal by opponents to 
review the financial qualifications of seabrooks owners the 
plants lead owner public service company of new hampshire filed 
for bankruptcy reorganization in january in june the projects 
fourth largest shareholder the massachusetts municipal wholesale 
electric co withdrew from the project and halted its 2 million 
monthly payments 
in boston dukakis said that in the case of seabrook it is 
unconscionable that the nrc continues to discuss ways to advance 
lowpower testing because it is impossible to adequately evacuate 
the area 
the vote to restart the pilgrim plant which was shut down in 
april 1986 because of several management and safety problems also 
was unanimous 
zech said the commission was convinced that an estimated 35 
million in safety improvements and a sweeping management overhaul by 
boston edison co has made the 16yearold plant ready to resume 
operations 
but dukakis leads a legion of critics who point to a 1987 report 
by the federal emergency management agency which found that the 
plans to evacuate suburban residents around pilgrim were inadequate 
the plant is 40 miles south of boston in plymouth mass 
todays vote is an insult to the local officials and south 
shore residents who have shown convincingly that no emergency 
evacuation plan can safely protect the public said sen edward m 
kennedy dmass the nuclear regulatory commission has again 
demonstrated its disregard for public safety 
zech speaking to reporters after the brief votes said great 
improvements have been made on the emergency evacuation plans 
the commission has acted in a very difficult situation i think 
we have acted appropriately we are the one responsible for 
deciding whether or not the public will be protected in the remote 
possibility of a radiological accident he said 
zech said pilgrim officials will resume operations slowly and 
that nrc investigators must approve operations at each of six levels 
of power 
pilgrim officials said they expected the restart to take four 
months beginning before jan 1 
the states lawsuit calls the nrc action on pilgrim arbitrary 
and capricious and urges an immediate injunction to halt the plant 
from getting up to 25 percent power 
meanwhile zech said the commission will not rule until next year 
on whether the state and local governments in new york have legal 
standing in the licensing procedure for the shoreham nuclear plant 
on long island under fire for reasons similar to those cited by 
critics of seabrook

the general accounting office says the farmers 
home administration has built a 40year loss record of at least 36 
billion of which about 22 billion occurred last year 
an audit by gao an investigating agency of congress showed that 
since fmhas revolving credit accounts began in 1946 cumulative 
losses have amounted to about 59 billion of which congress 
reimbursed the agriculture department agency 23 billion 
frederick d wolf director of gaos accounting and financial 
management division said 
our opinion on fmhas statement of financial position reflects 
our concerns over the agencys inability to repay its borrowings and 
to meet its current operations without incurring additional debt and 
the magnitude of its accumulated 36 billion deficit which includes 
22 billion for losses recognized in fiscal year 1987 
fmha has its roots in the mid1930s during the depression and is 
often called the governments lender of last resort for hardpressed 
farmers who cannot get credit from banks and other commercial 
lenderers 
although farm loans are a key element of fmha operations rural 
housing and rural development also are involved 
the gao audit was for the fiscal year that ended on sept 30 
1987 and was the first in the agencys history it was submitted on 
tuesday to agriculture secretary richard e lyng who is required by 
law to respond to congress within 60 days 
marlyn aycock a spokesman for fmha said wednesday that as of 
sept 30 1988 the agency had total loans outstanding of about 62 
billion less than half 255 billion was owed under the farm 
lending programs the balance was loans for rural housing and 
community development 
of the total 62 billion in loans about 92 billion were 
delinquent the farm delinquencies represented 83 billion of that 
amount aycock said 
every loan we make is subsidized to one extent or another he 
said over half of 62 billion loans weve got are made at 
interest rates below 5 percent 
as to gaos finding that the agency lost 22 billion last year 
aycock said much of that was bookkeeping that the gao itself had 
insisted upon 
for example he said the fmha at the gaos insistence included a 
budget item for about 15 billion as a loss allowance whether 
the agency actually lost that much or not 
aycock said the entire 15 billion for 1987 was included as a 
loss by the auditors although the final accounting by fmha has not 
been done 
besides the loss allowance aycock said there was more than 6 
billion in interest subsidies in 1987 plus about 1 billion in 
grants and other items which added up to the 22 billion cited in 
the report 
farmers home was created by the congress to do specific 
things aycock said in an interview i dont think it was 
created to make a profit or else they wouldnt have said we have to 
lend to people who cant get money elsewhere 
the gao audit was first reported by the new york times in 
wednesday editions

a state prosecutor said wednesday 
he is investigating two west german companies for the alleged 
illegal sale to pakistan of material that can be used in the 
production of atomic weapons 
a nuclear expert said the deliveries may have violated the 
international nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
albert farwick a prosecutor for hesse state also said he was 
investigating possible illegal sales of nuclearrelated equipment to 
india and south africa 
farwick said the firms under investigation were the neue 
technologie gmbh ntg company of gelnhausen 15 miles east of 
frankfurt and its sister company physikalisch technische beratung 
ptb of ortenberg about 24 miles northeast of frankfurt 
we know that they delivered to pakistan equipment for 
processing tritium and that they also delivered tritium gas 
farwick told the associated press in a telephone interview 
experts say tritium gas can be used to enhance the effectiveness 
of an atomic bomb 
farwick said the investigation of the two companies began last 
month after ntg fired one of its technical managers for allegedly 
misusing company funds he said ntg aroused investigators 
suspicions after it decided not to press charges or demand return of 
the money from the former manager apparently in an attempt to cover 
up the illegal nuclear deals 
he said the investigation thus far indicated that the former ntg 
manager and a manager from ptb had close contact with 
representatives of pakistani nuclear officials since 1982 
pakistan has not signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and 
reportedly has invested vast sums of money in developing its own 
nuclear bomb west germany is a signatory of the treaty 
prime minister benazir bhutto of pakistan said in an interview 
sunday that pakistan has no plans to make nuclear weapons but wont 
sign the nonproliferation treaty unless india does 
farwick in a statement wednesday also said ntg company 
officials have admitted to providing technical equipment to pakistan 
as late as this past summer he did not say if the officials also 
admitted delivering the tritium gas or when it was provided 
the transactions were made without obtaining approval from the 
west german economics ministry which controls sales of technical 
material to foreign countries west german minister of environment 
klaus toepfer has ordered a check of records to determine if any 
requests for approval of the sales were pending 
farwick said the equipment in the alleged sales included 
components for building burn elements equipment for processing 
tritium tritium gas and transport and storage containers for 
uranium hexafloride 
he said other items were special hull pipes lead and zircaloy 
rods melting ovens and a pellet press 
the material allegedly delivered to india and south africa he 
said included reflector material and cadmium pipes for india and 
a test device to measure burn elements for south africa 
he said the former technical manager of ntg who was initially 
arrested in the case has since been released pending further 
investigation 
farwick declined to identify by name those company officials 
under investigation 
records from both companies have been confiscated he said 
jens scheer a nuclear physics expert in bremen said most of the 
equipment mentioned in the sales were only important for bringing 
into operation a nuclear power plant 
but i am alarmed when i hear that equipment for processing 
tritium and tritium gas were delivered scheer said in a telephone 
interview tritium is exactly what is needed by them countries 
trying to develop atomic weapons to enhance the effectiveness of 
the atomic bomb 
this would violate the spirit of the nonproliferation 
treaty he added

care and the junior chamber of commerce are 
boosting efforts to assist survivors of the earthquake that 
devastated soviet armenia the groups announced at the soviet 
embassy on wednesday 
by christmas day 30100 care packages will have reached 
earthquakeeffected areas said philip johnston executive 
director of care the relief agency has already shipped 20000 care 
packages to the soviet armenia and plans to send a total of 50000 
he said 
to help fund the care effort junior chamber international has 
asked its worldwide organization to raise 1 million with half that 
amount to come from its us affiliate known as the jaycees 
during the holidays almost 5000 jaycee chapters across 
america are running food toy and clothing drives to assist those 
less fortunate jaycee president andy tobin told the embassy news 
conference 
it is in the spirit of christmas cooperation not charity that 
im asking all jaycee chapters to donate a minumum of 90 to 150 
immediately to care he said 
soviet ambassador yuri dubinin said the soviet people are 
deeply moved by the assistance rendered by the americans i am 
sure a new kind of internationalism is being born 
the armenian earthquake has shown that it may be necessary to 
create an international organization to provide assistance to the 
victims of major disasters he said 
the soviet government plans to discuss such a new organization in 
bilateral talks with the united states and also in the united 
nations said dubinin but it is too early for me to specify what 
would be the concrete ideas 
in the past the soviets have played a minor role in providing 
aid to natural disaster victims but johnston who has spent 26 
years in care said that in recent years the soviets have helped 
provide famine relief in the african nations of ethiopia and chad 
dubinin denied accusations by some soviet newspapers that 
confusion in the armenian assistance effort showed that the kremlin 
learned little from relief efforts following the partial meltdown of 
a nuclear reactor at chernobyl in the ukraine in 1986 
i think that the differences between chernobyl and armenia 
are much more important than the similarities said dubinin 
us aid to victims of the earthquake has topped 10 million 
according to figures kept by the office of foreign disaster 
assistance in the agency for international development 
as of wednesday the us government had sent 1909451 worth of 
aid in the form of medicine rescue teams hard hats work gloves 
plastic sheeting tents and other goods said faye henderson a 
spokeswoman for ofda 
additionally american volunteer agencies had reported sending 
8249439 worth of goods and services she said estimating that 
the total would climb as further assistance is reported

a french auto parts maker is to 
set up operations in the former de lorean motor car co plant in 
what is the biggest foreign investment in northern ireland it was 
announced wednesday 
the french company montupet is to invest 164 million and 
create about 1000 jobs in the next five years at the west belfast 
plant which has been vacant since 1982 the industrial development 
board said 
montupet is to set up a stateoftheart aluminum casting 
operation in the 500000squarefoot factory the board said 
the investment is the biggest ever secured by the idb and the 
largest initial investment yet made by an overseas company in 
northern ireland said tony hopkins the boards chief executive 
the aluminum foundry is expected to come on line in 1990 and 
employ 920 workers the board said 
montupet also is to employ 110 workers at a tool room to be built 
at another site yet to be determined 
much of the production will be cylinder heads for ford motor co 
montupets major customer the board said 
montupet which had sales of 182 million in 1987 has plants in 
france canada and spain and also supplies european car makers 
the plant has been mothballed by the industrial board since 1982 
after us automaker john z de lorean a former general motors co 
executive encountered financial difficulties 
the de lorean car plant which was established in 1978 and built 
with backing from the british government turned out more than 8500 
gullwinged sports cars and it employed more than 2600 workers at 
its peak 
last month daewoo electronics ltd announced plans to establish 
a 33 million video cassette recorder plant 20 miles northwest of 
belfast 
the secretary of state for northern ireland tom king called it 
more good news for jobs in northern ireland at the end of a year 
that has seen a substantial fall in unemployment king said 
unemployment in northern ireland stands at 159 percent against 
an average for the whole of britain of 75 percent the higher 
figure in northern ireland is due partly to the irish republican 
armys bomb and bullet war to end british rule in the province 
the loss of the governments stake of about 140 million in the 
de lorean enterprise in northern ireland when it went broke in 1982 
prompted widespread criticism of the british officials responsible 
for overseeing the investment

a bottlenose dolphin slipped away from 
more than four dozen rescuers wednesday when they tried to snare the 
animal in a net and take it to warmer water 
rescuers in 13 boats foiled by the dolphin a halfdozen times in 
seven hours decided to wait until thursday to make another attempt 
robert schoelkopf who is heading the operation said rescuers 
were thwarted by strong currents and a frisky dolphin hes not 
weak at all hes very robust very spirited said schoelkopf 
director of the marine mammal stranding center in brigantine nj 
but he said the 6foot animal which weighs 200 pounds to 300 
pounds is still threatened by the chilly waters 
it apparently was upset by a net thrown in the water to catch it 
he said 
this is like a semisolid wall under water to this animal he 
said 
dozens of spectators watched the rescue effort from shore and 
others looked on from private boats despite the repeated failures 
the dolphin cooperatively swam among the rescue boats 
the rescue attempt took place on the picturesque broad bay in a 
narrow channel that is near the great neck bridge one of two 
bridges separating broad bay from the chesapeake bay the area is 
surrounded by luxury homes 
mayor meyera oberndorf watched from a boat four men in business 
suits watched from another boat while talking laughing and sipping 
drinks from plastic cups 
josiah woodington a broad bay resident assisting in the rescue 
effort said anything we can do to help we want to help i think 
that its great that we can come together and catch this fish 
the rescue effort which included about 50 people was authorized 
monday by the national marine fisheries service rescuers hope to 
capture the dolphin in the net and fly it to warmer waters off north 
carolinas outer banks 
residents have been lobbying for the rescue since the dolphin was 
first noticed in the bay in early october 
the dolphin nicknamed rascal by residents was spotted again 
in the bay dec 13 said kathy read a diving instructor who has 
worked on the rescue plans the dolphin failed to join other 
dolphins migrating south 
residents believe he stayed in the bay because he was frightened 
of bridge construction in a narrow channel that links the bay and 
open water 
schoelkopf said a rescue is risky but the dolphin is certain to 
die if left in the bay where the water temperature has dipped to 42 
degrees

the night sky rained fire over a scottish village 
wednesday after a pan am jumbo jet crashed with 258 people aboard 
setting buildings and cars ablaze 
there was a terrible explosion and the whole sky lit up and the 
sky was actually raining fire it was just like liquid said mike 
carnahan who was a few hundred yards from the scene 
witnesses said the plane hit a gasoline station 
all i could see was flames and fire carnahan told british 
broadcasting corp television in a telephone interview i could 
see several houses on the skyline whose roofs were totally off and 
all you could see was flaming timbers and what was left of the 
houses 
another eyewitness hotelier graham byerley told the bbc 
we initially heard a rumbling over the hotel we thought the 
roof was falling in and then we heard a tremendous shudder on the 
ground as though it were an earthquake and then we saw sparks and 
this enormous flame going 200 or 300 feet into the air there was 
debris flying everywhere 
rescue helicopters buzzed overhead and firefighters fought the 
flames 
police and rescue vehicles were held up by traffic as roads 
leading to the site became jammed with motorists trying to get a 
glimpse of the disaster 
theres a lot of rescue services trying to get to the area but 
the roads are blocked solid with cars and sightseers going over 
toward the scene of the crash cranahan said 
he said he believed the plane was on fire before it crashed 
because it was trailing flames when it went over the village 
witness john glasgow said the crash and explosion littered 
streets with debris 
the whole road was ablaze two houses were blazing the road 
was completely covered with masonry garden gates and apparently 
parts of the plane but not very big parts glasgow told 
independent radio news there was a lot of smoking debris on fire 
it looked as if the road as burning 
we tried to get near the plane but it was completely on fire 
there were no bodies about i dont think there would be any chance 
it went up in a fireball 
glasgow said the aircraft hit a road kept going for about 1500 
yards and then exploded 
the plane was bound from london to new york when it crashed

atlanta educator louis sullivan sought to mend 
fences with antiabortion activists wednesday in an effort to save 
his expected nomination as presidentelect bushs health and human 
services secretary 
in a threehour meeting with bush advisers and republican 
antiabortion leaders in congress sullivan said he was an abortion 
foe even favoring a constitutional amendment banning them rather 
than a supporter of womens right to choose abortion participants 
in the meeting said 
sullivans possible nomination drew protests from antiabortion 
groups after he was quoted last weekend in an interview with the 
atlanta journal and constitution as saying of abortion there 
should be that right 
but the senator and two congressmen he met with wednesday liked 
most of the answers he gave in their private meeting 
minnesota rep vin weber said he had asked sullivan about the 
interview and he simply said that he was not used to dealing with 
the press and he stumbled badly in his own words in handling that 
question but i am convinced of his sincerity on that issue 
sen orrin hatch of utah said in a statement that sullivan 
would make a fine secretary of health and human services if he is 
nominated i believe he was misunderstood concerning his views 
on abortion 
the third congressmen in the meeting rep christopher smith of 
new jersey said he was favorably impressed by sullivans answers 
but he added later im encouraged but not fully convinced 
he said for instance that sullivan did not seem ready to pledge 
that he would oppose the use of government funds to pay for research 
by the national institutes of health on fetal tissues 
he was not fully square with our position on that smith said 
bush transition aides privately said that sullivan remains the 
vice presidents top choice for the post 
the aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity said one 
reason bush has not been able to go ahead with an announcement on 
sullivan was that the fbi background check on him had not yet been 
completed 
transition spokeswoman sheila tate said sullivans position as 
he outlined it wednesday is entirely consistent with and 
compatible with that of the vice president on the issue of 
abortion 
sullivan president of the morehouse school of medicine would be 
the first black in bushs cabinet he left the meeting without 
speaking to reporters 
the vice president maintained a relatively low profile for the 
second day in a row 
he did meet with more than 40 prominent republican hispanics 
telling them there will be no radical shift in direction from 
reagan administration policies toward cuba and nicaragua 
marta san martin a member of new jerseys ethnic advisory 
council from union nj said bush told the group in private that 
he would not abandon the contras the usbacked rebels in 
nicaragua 
in his public remarks bush said the government in cuba should 
take a lesson from soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and start 
lightening up 
transition aides said bush is likely to name a group of cabinet 
officials in one batch either thursday or friday waiting until 
after christmas to complete the list he has named eight cabinet 
members and has six to go hhs transportation interior energy 
labor and veterans affairs 
meanwhile bush advisers told chicago transit official samuel 
skinner to return home because announcement of his nomination as 
transportation secretary was being delayed yet again while decisions 
on prospects for other posts were being made 
skinner has been back and forth between chicago and washington 
three times awaiting the formal announcement aides said his 
nomination was not hung up but that bush did not want to announce 
it separately 
skinner did draw fire from sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
concerning his conduct as a federal prosecutor in chicago in the 
late 1970s 
metzenbaum said in a statement that the senate should not vote to 
confirm skinner without investigating why he failed to pursue 
allegations of fraudulent testing of nutrasweet against gd 
searle co and later joined the law firm that defended searle in the 
case 
when metzenbaum first raised the issue in 1986 skinner was 
quoted as saying he had withdrawn from participating in the case 
shortly after his office received a formal food and drug 
administration request for a grand jury investigation of searle he 
said his actions were consistent with justice department 
conflictofinterest policies 
a transition source said patricia diaz dennis is a leading 
candidate for the labor post but that bush aides dont know her 
positions on various labor issues the source said members of the 
transition team have been speaking with those who have worked with 
her and will probably call her in australia where she is 
vacationing 
as for sullivan rep weber said i am convinced his position 
is fully consistent with vice president bushs that he believes 
life begins at conception that he is opposed to abortion except in 
cases of rape incest and where the mothers life in in danger and 
that he supports a human life amendment to overturn the roe vs wade 
decison 
it was that 1973 decision that prohibited states from banning 
abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy 
during the campaign bush said he supported a constitutional 
amendment to ban abortion except in cases of rape incest or to save 
the life of the mother 
bushs transition office also announced several top white house 
staff jobs on wednesday david demarest former labor department 
spokesman and bush campaign communications chief will serve as 
white house communications director texas air executive frederick 
mcclure who worked in the reagan congressional liaison office was 
named legislative affairs liaison retired air force col antonio 
lopez will serve as director of the white house military office and 
rose zamaria will be director of white house operations

presidentelect bush told a group of prominent 
hispanicamericans wednesday there would be no radical shift in 
direction as his new administration takes office 
bush in a meeting with more than 40 republicans of hispanic 
origin also said nicaragua continues to plague me one of the 
groups participants said bush promised that he would not abandon 
the nicaraguan contras the usbacked rebels seeking to overthrow 
the leftist government there 
the group cheered bush when he said he would place a lot of 
hispanicamericans in high office in the new administration so 
far education secretary lauro cavazos a holdover appointee is the 
only member of the ethnic group to be named to a toplevel job 
on foreign policy bush said there is no anticipated surprise 
there will not be under a bush administration a radical shift in 
direction in terms of one of our neighboring countries to the south 
that concerns many people in this room that was a reference to 
cuba 
taking a hard line bush said he wanted to have some solid 
proof not some rhetoric that cuba intends to promote democracy he 
called for an end to surrogacy by the soviet union 
cubas government should take a lesson from soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev and start lightening up bush said gorbachev 
has recently promoted policies of openness and restructuring in his 
country 
bush praised cuba for allowing human rights officials to visit 
the island recently but he said the country has a long way to 
go before the principles of democracy are in place 
marta san martin a member of new jerseys ethnic advisory 
council from union nj said bush told the group in private that 
he would not abandon the contras 
members of congress have hinted that james a baker iii the

democratic party activist ron brown pocketed 
endorsements wednesday from new york gov mario cuomo and new jersey 
sen bill bradley in his bid to become the partys next national 
chairman 
cuomo who once taught brown at st johns university law school 
said his former student would be superb as head of the 
democrats bradley said brown would bring evenhanded fair and 
strong leadership in the years ahead 
neither cuomo nor bradley has a vote in the election to choose a 
new party leader next february but both are influential with 
democratic national committee members from their own states and are 
wellknown nationally 
shortly after cuomo issued his endorsement new york democratic 
chairman laurence j kirwan an ally of the governor said he would 
vote for brown 
these endorsements and the support i have received from other 
leaders of the party also indicate that the next generation of 
democratic leaders see my candidacy as a commitment to the future of 
the party as well as to its traditional values brown said in a 
statement after getting backing from cuomo and bradley 
brown is one of five contenders in the race to replace outgoing 
party chairman paul kirk the others include michigan democratic 
chairman richard wiener and former reps jim jones of oklahoma mike 
barnes of maryland and jim stanton of ohio 
jones also announced several endorsements wednesday 
scott widmeyer aide to jones said he received the backing of 
reps john lewis of georgia and ike skelton of missouri and also 
louisiana gov buddy roemer 
brown is best known for serving as jesse jacksons top aide at 
last summers democratic national convention but he has also worked 
for sen edward m kennedy and was active in michael dukakis 
presidential campaign this fall after jackson was defeated for the 
nomination he served as deputy chairman of the democratic national 
committee from 1981 to 1985 
he earlier was endorsed by kennedy and former arizona gov bruce 
babbitt and his strategy of emphasizing support by prominent 
democrats is in contrast to the approach taken by wiener 
the michigan chairman has made public the names of party chairs 
and vice chairs from several states in the west and midwest who have 
endorsed him few if any of them are known outside their states but 
all will have a vote in the election to pick the next chairman and 
they reflect wieners natural base among state party leaders he is 
the head of the association of state democratic chairs 
the democratic national committee will meet on feb 910 to pick 
a successor to kirk

president reagans final budget would reduce 
the deficit to 925 billion for the next fiscal year even lower 
than the target set by law through a combination of spending cuts 
higher user fees and sales of government assets administration 
officials said wednesday 
officials said all of the decisions have now been made on the 
budget which the administration will send to congress on jan 9 
reagan and members of his cabinet including presidentelect 
bush were briefed on the budget details at the white house 
we are going to have a budget that we will be presenting to the 
congress very shortly and it will be in keeping with the 
grammrudman program for leading toward a balanced budget reagan 
told reporters as the meeting opened 
joseph wright head of the white house office of management and 
budget told reporters at a briefing that the administration had 
succeeded in trimming the deficit below the 100 billion target 
established by the grammrudman balanced budget law 
while wright would not reveal the actual deficit figure an 
administration source who spoke on condition that his name not be 
used said reagans final budget would show a deficit of 925 
billion 
this figure includes 6 billion in asset sales the source said 
these sales do not count toward meeting the grammrudman target 
however even with the asset sales discounted the administrations 
budget would still be below the 100 billion target 
in the past reagans budgets often have been labeled dead on 
arrival when they were submitted to congress because they proposed 
spending cuts that congress repeatedly had refused to accept in the 
past 
but wright defended the final reagan budget saying it would 
serve as a good starting point for the new bush administration in 
its negotiations with congress 
we did not have to do a slash and burn budget he said it 
is reasonable responsible and conservative 
the budget calls for spending 115 trillion an increase of 47 
percent over projected spending of 1097 trillion in the current 
fiscal year the administration is projecting that government 
revenues will increase by 82 billion in 1990 to 1056 trillion 
the administration unveiled new budget estimates that will make 
its job of reaching the deficit target a bit easier the 
administration had been forecasting a deficit of 135 billion if no 
changes were made from the current level of government services 
however wright told reporters that revised assumptions on how 
the economy will perform and various changes in spending projections 
had lowered that estimated deficit to 127 billion 
but wright said the administration would call for 26 billion in 
increased defense spending because of its insistence that the 
military be funded at 2 percent above the rate of inflation he said 
the administration also would seek 18 billion in higher spending 
for the national aeronautics and space administration in part for 
spending on the space station project and 5 billion in higher 
outlays for such programs as research on a cure for aids 
to achieve the increased spending will require the administration 
to make cuts in other programs of 38 billion 
it has been reported previously that the administration would 
seek to cut medicare by 5 billion by reducing payments to doctors 
and hospitals in addition the administration is seeking savings of 
2 billion in the medicaid program which pays the health costs of 
poor patients 
wright also has said other savings would be achieved through 
cutting farm subsidy payments and in reducing government pension 
benefits 
however the administration has insisted that social security 
the governments largest benefit program will not be touched in 
efforts to trim the budget deficit 
in addition to coming in lower than the grammrudman deficit 
target for 1990 the spending plan projects the deficit will decline 
significantly in coming years until it reaches a balance between 
spending and revenues in 1993 nine years later than the 1984 target 
for a balanced budget that reagan had promised to reach during his 
1980 campaign for the presidency 
bush has promised to begin immediate negotiations with congress 
over ways to reduce the budget deficit once he takes office on jan 
20 he has said he also will submit his own spending blueprint to 
congress although he has left open the question of whether he will 
submit a completely revised budget request or just make 
modifications to reagans 1990 budget

chicago transit official samuel skinner 
reported to be in line for transportation secretary is getting a 
closeup look at the nations air traffic system as he awaits formal 
announcement from presidentelect bush 
in less than two weeks skinner has been summoned three times to 
the nations capital by bush transition aides three times he has 
gone home emptyhanded though skinner has been told he has the job 
of running the transportation department sources said the official 
announcement from the presidentelect has not yet been made 
poor sam said one bush transition aide speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
sheila tate the transitions spokeswoman said wednesday she did 
not know when bush would made additional personnel announcements 
the latest snafu involving skinner occurred tuesday after 
transition aides had put out the word that bush would make an 
announcement which was expected to involve skinner 
skinner 50 a private attorney who worked in bushs presidential 
campaigns in 1980 and 1988 had been in the capital since monday 
awaiting a summons from bush 
a few hours before bush was expected to make an announcement it 
was cancelled transition aides said bush wanted to make a batch of 
appointments at the same time but his choice for secretary of 
health and human services was mired in a debate over his views on 
abortion 
so skinner flew back to chicago tuesday night emptyhanded 
again 
skinners spokesman in chicago ed murnane said his boss is 
unperturbed by the situation sam skinner is a very patient and 
understanding friend of presidentelect bushs he said 
another source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
situation has been somewhat anxietyproducing for skinner he 
hasnt had any chance to do any christmas shopping yet this 
person said 
but skinner has been assured he has the job the source said 
adding i dont think he is being towerized 
that was a reference to former sen john tower who was rumored to 
have the defense secretarys job but was left dangling for weeks 
while the fbi investigated allegations of drinking and womanizing 
bush finally appointed tower last friday 
skinner also traveled to washington on dec 8 to meet with 
transition aides and flew in for a facetoface session with bush 
on dec 14 
skinner is chairman of the regional transportation authority of 
northeastern illinois the nations second largest transportation 
system 
meanwhile skinners expected nomination drew fire from sen 
howard metzenbaum dohio concerning his conduct as a former 
federal prosecutor in chicago 
metzenbaum said in a statement that the senate should look into 
why the us attorneys office in chicago decided against 
prosecuting the maker of nutrasweet gd searle co for 
allegations of fraudulent testing skinner then the us 
attorney later joined the law firm that defended searle in the case 
metzenbaum who first raised the issue in 1986 said there were 
serious questions about mr skinners conduct of the case that 
must be answered at the time skinner said he withdrew from 
participating in the case after his office received the formal food 
and drug administration request for a grand jury because he was 
discussing a job with the law firm in question 
skinners office issued a statement saying he conducted himself 
in accordance with department of justice guidelines in the matter 
mentioned by senator metzenbaum skinner will be happy to answer 
any questions senators have about the case the statement said

a congressional panel on wednesday revealed it 
has launched a broad investigation into the multibilliondollar 
leveraged buyout of rjr nabisco inc 
rep john d dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee asked rjr nabisco president f ross johnson and 
nine members of the companys board of directors to supply documents 
and submit to interviews 
a management group headed by johnson lost out to the investment 
firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which bid a record 245 billion 
for rjr nabisco a diversified food and tobacco products firm 
dingell in letters dated wednesday asked for voluntary 
cooperation with the investigation into the leveraged buyout or 
lbo but said his oversight and investigations subcommittee could 
issue subpoenas 
the subcommittee is conducting an investigation into the 
application and adequacy of the federal securities laws in 
connection with the recent offers to purchase rjr nabisco inc 
dingell wrote 
he asked for information pertaining to any discussion 
consideration or analysis regarding a possible or actual offer 
from johnson and rjr nabisco management and regarding other 
alternatives for raising the value or market price of the companys 
stock 
he asked for copies of documents by jan 13 and requested that 
the executives travel to washington to be interviewed by 
congressional aides by feb 3 
dennis fitzgibbons a spokesman for dingell declined to discuss 
the subcommittees reasons for examining the transaction but said 
dingell has been concerned with lbos for quite some time this is 
part of an effort to find out what is going on not just with rjr 
nabisco but with lbos in general and what if anything congress 
can or should do about it 
in a leveraged buyout an investment group borrows heavily in 
order to buy out stockholders and take over the company often 
leveraged buyouts are proposed by managers seeking to thwart a 
hostile takeover from another firm 
the companys new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of 
the company to pay back the loans critics of the practice fear the 
high debt levels in an economic downturn would endanger both the 
company and the banks and investment firms making the loans they 
also say the transactions are unfair because they dilute the 
potential claims of existing bondholders 
meanwhile securities and exchange commission chairman david s 
ruder in a letter to the energy and commerce finance subcommittee 
chaired by rep edward j markey dmass said the sec has begun 
a broad fact gathering effort including a study of some of the 
largest leveraged buyouts of recent years 
in particular the staff will focus on the exposure of 
brokerdealers and investment banking firms providing bridge 
financing in leveraged acquisitions he said 
the agency also will examine the adequacy of its disclosure 
rules designed to warn existing bondholders and other investors of 
any risks in lbos 
ruder is scheduled to testify regarding lbos to markeys 
subcommittee on thursday

a judge who said he gave a killer a lesser sentence 
in part because the victims were homosexual has divided the citys 
religious leaders with one group wednesday demanding a retraction 
and another planning a rally of support 
ken coulter pastor of grace fellowship church and part of a 
coalition of leaders of churches with large numbers of gay 
congregants said they fear that state district judge jack hamptons 
remarks may mean open season on homosexuals 
meanwhile the rev don skelton pastor at fountain of the living 
word said at least seven pastors have agreed to take part in a 
rally in support of hampton on thursday outside the courthouse he 
said he expected 100 to 150 people 
were very much opposed to sodomy skelton said its 
against texas law for one thing and gods law for another thing 
sodomy carries up to a 200 fine the law was thrown out in 1982 but 
reinstated by a federal appeals court three years later 
hampton in an interview last week in the dallas times herald 
said he sentenced 18yearold richard lee bednarski to 30 years in 
prison instead of the maximum life sentence on nov 28 in part 
because the two murder victims were queers 
he was quoted as saying he put prostitutes and gays at about 
the same level and would be hard put to give somebody life for 
killing a prostitute 
the remarks have stirred the gay community and equal rights 
activists to protest and to seek hamptons removal from the bench 
on tuesday state treasurer ann richards and sen edward kennedy 
dmass criticized him in statements read at a rally 
the texas human rights foundation has filed an ethics complaint 
with the commission on judicial conduct the panel can among other 
things censure him or initiate a drawnout procedure that could 
result in his removal 
the church coalition deploring hamptons remarks on wednesday 
called on other religious leaders judges and lawyers to join them 
in criticizing the judge 
we deplore the mentality recently expressed by judge jack 
hampton in the press which suggest that all human beings are not of 
equal value and are not entitled to equal protection under the 
law said the rev howard tyas pastor of bethany presbyterian 
church reading from the groups statement 
the church leaders said they were asking him to retract his 
comments they said any further action would be up to the system 
if this is not what he means we are asking him to speak up and

secretary of state george p shultz told a 
delegation of american jewish leaders wednesday he believes the 
formation of a new coalition government in israel could provide 
momementum to the middle east peace process a participant in the 
meeting said 
reporting on the meeting morris abram chairman of the 
conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations 
said the secretary feels that the newly formed likudlabor coalition 
was better for the peace process than a narrowly based 
government 
much of the meeting which lasted more than an hour focused on 
shultzs decision last week to open a dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization 
abram said the meeting was held to express the very deep 
concerns of american jewish leaders about recent administration 
moves in the middle east 
he indicated that the delegation came away reassured by what 
shultz had to say 
abram said shultz told the delegation that the initial contacts 
last week with the plo did not constitute negotiations but a very 
low level dialogue 
he added that shultz is not pressing israel to undertake any 
dealings with the plo 
abram indicated he disagreed with suggestions by some state 
department officials that the statement last week by plo chairman 
yasser arafat recognizing israels right to exist in effect 
superceded the policy enshrined in the plo covenant calling for 
israels destruction 
abram said the only way the plo could legitimately retreat from 
that policy would be for the palestine national council to amend the 
charter 
shultz agreed abram said that he would like to see that 
done 
the secretary was extremely firm in his statement that nothing 
whatsoever had changed with respect to american policy with respect 
to the middle east and the state of israel abram said 
he reaffirmed the following this government does not want an 
independent palestinian state and he laid out the reasons saying 
that such a state would be unstable and would be a threat not only 
to israel but to the whole area 
he stated furthermore that the policy of the united states 
government remained very firm that jerusalem should remain a united 
city he spoke passionately of his abhorrence of terrorism and his 
determination that terrorism must cease

chief justice william h rehnquist on wednesday 
reinstated a contempt citation against a maryland woman jailed for 
refusing to disclose the whereabouts of her young son who 
prosecutors fear may be dead 
rehnquist acting on an emergency request by state prosecutors 
negated the effect of a ruling by marylands highest court that 
jacqueline bouknights jailing for contempt is unconstitutional 
but ms bouknight was destined to remain behind bars no matter 
what action rehnquist took 
prosecutors disclosed tuesday they had independent grounds for 
keeping ms bouknight incarcerated they told the chief justice she 
was convicted on nov 28 of theft and sentenced to 18 months in 
jail 
ms bouknight 21 was cited for contempt last april after 
refusing to tell social workers in baltimore where they could find 
her 27monthold son maurice 
a judge ordered her jailed until she was willing to provide that 
information 
the child earlier had been placed in foster care after being 
hospitalized for treatment of a broken leg and several partially 
healed fractures 
maurice was returned to ms bouknight who has a history of drug 
abuse after she agreed not to physically punish him and to undergo 
training in how to be a parent 
social workers say maurice has not been seen since september 1987 
the boys father has been killed 
the maryland court of appeals earlier this week ruled by a 52 
vote that ms bouknights jailing on the contempt citation violated 
her constitutional protection against selfincrimination 
the state readily acknowledges that bouknights risk of 
incriminating herself is a substantial one encompassing among other 
possible crimes the felony of child abuse or even murder the 
state court said 
prosecutors contend that protecting the child outweighs ms 
bouknights right against selfincrimination and that she should 
remain jailed until she cooperates with authorities 
rehnquist in an order accompanied by a fourpage opinion set 
aside the state court ruling pending full supreme court action on a 
formal appeal to be filed by maryland prosecutors 
the case is baltimore city department of social services vs

a terrified 8yearold girl who called a 
911 operator watched a burglar stab her father and initially refused 
to unlock the front door for police a tape recording of the 
conversation shows 
police said the 11minute conversation between dispatcher valerie 
nelson and the girl laura hollingsworth allowed the operator to 
get help to the family quickly 
laura who was taught in school to call 911 in an emergency 
spoke to mrs nelson as the family tried to fight off the 
knifewielding stranger dec 14 
she was very clear considering the emotional state she was 
in mrs nelson said she was not hysterical 
the intruder douglas spencer collins 19 died of a shot from a 
hunting rifle police said 
dale hollingsworth 36 lauras father was stabbed in the head 
arms and hands and was listed in good condition wednesday at 
arlington memorial hospital lauras 14yearold brother buddy was 
treated for stab wounds on a hand 
laura according to the tape played on monday told mrs nelson 
where she lived and that the intruder was demanding to know where to 
find a wallet 
according to the tape laura told mrs nelson the intruder just 
broke in with a gun apparently mistaking the knife for a gun 
when the child saw that her father was covered with blood 
her voice took on an additional urgency as she pleaded hurry im 
scared 
the tape continued 
mrs nelson ok i have an ambulance honey dont worry we 
have people on the way 
laura suddenly whispering i think hes got the guy 
mrs nelson whos got the guy 
the only response was screaming and sobbing in the background 
mrs nelson honey its ok whats going on 
laura hes got a knife 
mrs nelson who does your brother 
laura sobbing no the guy pleeeaaase oh god buddy 
the conversation was cut of by the sound of a rifle shot and 
then laura could be heard whispering oh oh he killed the guy 
mrs nelson ok who got shot your father got shot honey can 
you tell me who got shot 
laura he buddy shot the guy that came in here 
during several minutes of painstaking conversation mrs nelson 
confirmed that the intruder was dead or dying and that the childs 
father and buddy were injured mrs nelson also realized the 
children thought police officers outside the home were more burglars 
the exchange went on several more minutes with buddy and laura 
distrusting what they were being told because they could not see any 
police cars and because one officer had a youthful voice 
several minutes later though the officers were allowed into the 
house 
mrs nelson said she is used to handling dramatic situations but 
the exchange with laura was by far the most compelling

polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski made 
sweeping changes in the ruling politburo wednesday and communist 
authorities gave their clearest signal yet they are considering 
ending a sevenyear ban on solidarity 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski announced that the 
communist party will reevaluate its attitude toward the outlawed 
trade union federation 
rakowski told central committee members to return to local party 
units and poll members on the subject of solidarity and on its 
leader lech walesa 
members were ordered to return to warsaw in midjanuary with 
their answers at the next session of the 230member central 
committee 
we must decide together about what to do rakowski said 
your answer will decide about what we will do and what we do 
will decide the future of socialism in poland he said 
in the communist party shakeup jaruzelski removed six hardliners 
and veteran members from the politburo in favor of younger 
pragmatists 
among those promoted to full politburo membership was stanislaw 
ciosek a party activist known as a liberal who has been active in 
conducting talks with walesa ciosek was also given an important 
additional post of full party secretary where he was expected to 
assume responsibility for propaganda 
in all eight new politburo members were appointed to replace six 
who were removed increasing the politburos overall size from 15 to 
17 members four new party secretaries were named replacing four 
who were removed 
the plenum was capped by jaruzelskis plea to the opposition to 
accept the partys offer for talks 
referring to the oppositions formation on sunday of a citizens 
committee intended to gather mainstream antigovernment forces in 
one structure under walesas leadership jaruzelski said 
one can freely create governments in exile or shadow cabinets 
but the real reconcilation of poles is the cause of supreme 
importance our party opts for it decisively and honestly 
the offer for talks is unchangeably open he said 
walesa refuses to enter talks with the government until 
authorities clearly indicate they are willing to make solidarity 
legal again 
the labor movement was crushed when martial law was imposed here 
in 1981 and was later outlawed 
rakowski defended the idea of holding talks with walesa in his 
address to the plenum and said in an evident overture to 
solidarity that the party is willing to change the structure of 
trade unions when and under what terms must yet be negotiated 
he repeated calls for the opposition to begin talks without 
preconditions 
we are saying clearly that we desire to discuss the future 
model of the trade union movement different from the present 
together with the opzz official unions and moderate leaders of 
former solidarity he said 
the realization of union pluralism depends however on 
reaching agreement about its principles forms and time 
whether rakowskis statement would be enough to bring solidarity 
activists to the negotiating table was not clear no immediate 
reaction came from walesa whose telephone in gdansk was not being 
answered wednesday night 
ciosek the new politburo member met three times with walesa 
this year in failed attempts to launch formal roundtable talks with 
the opposition 
during solidaritys legal existence in 198081 he was the 
government minister in charge of cooperating with trade unions 
three people were named candidate members of the politburo in 
voting at the end of the plenum 
besides ciosek the new party secretaries were zygmunt czarzasty 
the slupsk province party chief who had developed a reputation as a 
strong advocate of pragmatic reforms leszek miller a young party 
chief from the province of skierniewice and marian stepien a 
highranking party ideologist 
ousted from the politburo were former prime minister zbigniew 
messner who had to resign from the government in september amid 
criticism of his handling of the economy gen jozef baryla an army 
colleague of jaruzelski jan glowczyk a former propaganda chief 
with a reputation as a hardliner and three lesser known politburo 
members tadeusz porebski zofia stepien and zygmunt muranski 
the new politburo members besides ciosek were gabriela rebisz 
kazimierz cypryniak iwona lubowska zdzidlaw swiatek viktor 
pyrkosz janusz reykowski and zbigniew michalek aside from ciosek 
the new appointees are little known and two of them pyrkosz and 
reykowski had not even been members of the central committee 
before 
but jaruzelski suggested they represented a new generation of 
activists 
life itself its needs and challenges dictate unavoidable and 
necessary changes he said 
jaruzelski had said personnel changes were necessary for the 
success of party reforms 
he said in opening the plenum tuesday that the party should be 
open to unconventional compromises with the opposition but it must 
remain polands key political force

president raul alfonsin appealed 
on wednesday for an end to the animosities between the military and 
the civilian government that underlay three insurrections in the 
last 20 months 
speaking forcefully and at times with passion alfonsin spoke 
before a packed special session of congress in a nationally 
broadcast speech 
the tensions between the armed forces and the powers of the 
state are a problem that had to be presented he said the 
military transition is everyones task 
later alfonsin named gen francisco gassino as army chief to 
replace lt gen jose dante caridi who resigned tuesday along with 
the next two ranking army generals miguel abbate and enrique 
bianchi 
gassinos promotion forced into retirement four generals who 
outranked him in seniority bringing to eight the number of generals 
who resigned or were retired after the latest military rebellion 
ended on dec 4 gassino 57 played a major role in quashing that 
uprising and strongly sided with alfonsin during the april 1987 and 
january 1988 garrison revolts 
alfonsin said militarycivilian stresses in argentine society 
stem largely from harsh actions to end terrorist subversion in the 
late 1970s and for that all society is to blame not just its 
soldiers 
however in a reference to the 197683 military dictatorship 
which ended with his inauguration in december 1983 alfonsin said 
that which neither the government nor the people are disposed to 
grant is the vindication of state terrorism 
both the governing radical civic union and the opposition 
peronist party have stressed that they would not propose or allow 
congress to pass amnesty legislation for crimes dating from the 
dirty war against subversion 
the president said argentines need to create a new democratic 
future not rehash violent incidents of the past toward that end 
citizens should accept the necessity of the armed forces and the 
military should accept their subordination to civilian rule 
he said the question of blame should be the task of 
historians 
alfonsin made little direct reference to the dec 14 
insurrection of up to 800 army troops to caridis departure or to 
charges that the government made a deal with rebels 
congressmen of various political parties described the speech as 
positive though some grumbled it failed to address such specific 
questions as how extensive was support among loyal troops for rebel 
demands and whether a deal was in fact struck to end the revolt 
the message contains a declaration of principles in which 
we all coincide but nothing was said about what happened 
complained sen eduardo menem the peronist leader in the upper 
house and brother of carlos menem the peronist presidential nominee 
in elections next may 
sen leopoldo bravo of the small conservative bloquista party 
who has publicly called for a military amnesty said alfonsin did 
not come up with solutions that would permit a vision of hope for 
the future 
rebels led by col mohamed ali seineldin demanded a halt to the 
prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed in the 
late 1970s during what they refer to as the civil war against 
subversion 
human rights groups say the arrest and presumed execution of at 
least 8900 argentines by government count amounted to organized 
murder other estimates put the number of disappeared at up to 
30000 
rebels also demanded a shakeup of the military high command 
including caridis ouster higher salaries and a bigger military 
budget 
alfonsin insists he made no deal nevertheless soldiers were 
granted a 20 percent pay increase this month and a 100 bonus 
eight generals have been ousted and high government officials 
have spoken publicly of the dirty war as necessary lending 
credence to military arguments that human rights trials should stop 
the trials in civilian court of about a dozen officers including 
former president and army commanderinchief leopoldo galtieri are 
due to resume soon after a lapse of about a year

a new yorkbound jumbo jet carrying 258 christmas 
travelers crashed in a scottish village wednesday night sending up 
a towering ball of flame and raining burning debris on houses and 
cars 
four hours after the pan am boeing 747 crashed at lockerbie in 
southwest scotland there was no word of survivors among the 
passengers some of them us servicemen according to unconfirmed 
reports 
we understand that there were no survivors from the aircraft 
said bill robson chief ambulance officer for greater glasgow the

nine or 10 bodies were recovered about two miles from the scene 
according to a reporter for the british news agency press

all local people injured when the plane plunged into the village of 
2500 
the cause of the crash was not immediately known the civil 
aviation authority said scottish air controllers talked to the 
cockpit minutes before the crash and got no indication of any 
problems 
pan am flight 103 took off from heathrow airport outside london 
at 125 pm est and disappeared off radar screens an hour later 
said pat coffey spokesman for the raf rescue coordination center 
near edinburgh 
one witness said the plane may have been on fire before it 
crashed and others said the plane hit a gas station and several 
houses in the southern scotland village which is 275 miles 
northwest of london 
independent television news said witnesses reported seeing two 
separate fireballs about three miles apart but there was no report 
from aviation authorities that another aircraft was involved in the 
crash 
there was a terrible explosion said mike carnahan who was a 
few hundred yards from the scene it was literally raining fire 
he told british broadcasting corp tv i dont think there is any 
chance of survivors the way it exploded was just beyond 
description 
coffey also said there were no reports of any survivors he 
estimated 15 raf helicopters with burn specialists were sent to the 
scene 
we tried to get near the plane but it was completely on fire 
witness john glasglow told independent radio news there were no 
bodies about i dont think there would be any chance of anyone 
getting out of it 
lef callaghan spokesman at dumfries hospital told cable news 
network there were 12 casualties on the ground 
wallace trail a bbc producer who was in the village when the 
plane crashed said it was in chaos at the moment all the roads 
in and out of the town are blocked and telephones are down and there 
are a string of burning houses along the south end of the town 
i counted at least seven and there is a large crater at the 
edge of the main dual carriageway the a74 the glasgowcarlisle 
road 
ian fisher a reporter for independent television news said 
the south side of the town near to the main road has been wiped 
out houses have been gutted there is a huge pall of smoke 
hanging over the sky which is lit from the burning houses below 
syracuse university officials confirmed an undetermined number of 
its studennts were on the flight a un spokesman said the un 
commissioner for namibia bernt carlsson of sweden 50 also was 
aboard 
tv networks broadcast emergency telephone numbers in london and 
new york for relatives inquiries the house of commons convened for 
a latenight emergency statement by transport secretary paul channon 
there is no speculation at this point in time as to the cause 
of the accident said pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon in new 
york who confirmed the crash and said that 243 people and 15 crew 
members were aboard 
she said no passenger list was immediately available for the 
flight which originated in frankfurt west germany and was due to 
arrive at john f kennedy international airport in new york at 919 
pm est 
another eyewitness hotelier graham byerley told the bbc 
we initially heard a rumbling over the hotel we thought the 
roof was falling in and then we heard a tremendous shudder on the 
ground as though it were an earthquake and then we saw sparks and 
this enormous flame going 200 or 300 feet into the air there was 
debris flying everywhere 
carnahan said all i could see was flames and fire i could see 
several houses on the skyline whose roofswere totally off and all 
you could see was flaming timbers and what was left of the houses 
cars could be seen burning on the road and traffic jams quickly 
developed slowing the rush of ambulances and police to the scene 
carnahan who lives two miles south of lockerbie said after 
getting home i was driving past the filling station when the 
plane crashed there was a terrible explosion the crash was very 
close to the center of the town in a residential area 
he said there was a terrible explosion and the whole sky lit 
up and the sky was actually raining fire it was just like liquid 
we have actually found an aluminum rivet embedded in the metal of my 
car 
theres a lot of rescue services trying to get to the area but 
the roads are blocked solid with cars and sightseers going over 
toward the scene of the crash he said carnahan said he believed 
the plane was on fire before it crashed because it was trailing 
flames when it went over the village 
flight 103 had taken off 25 minutes late many of its passengers 
laden with christmas gifts and was at 31000 feet when contact was 
lost the heathrow airport authority said the boeing 747 has 412 
passenger seats meaning that flight 103 was more than half full 
glasgow said the sky lit up when the jumbo crashed 
the whole road was ablaze two houses were blazing the road 
was completely covered with masonry garden gates and apparently 
parts of the plane but not very big parts he told independent 
radio news there was a lot of smoking debris on fire it looked 
as if the road as burning 
we tried to get near the plane but it was completely on fire 
there were no bodies about i dont think there would be any 
chance it went up in a fireball glasgow said the aircraft hit 
a road carried on for about 1500 yards and then exploded 
the last fatal boeing 747 accident occurred nov 28 1987 when a 
south african 747combi configured to carry both passengers and 
freight on the passenger level crashed in the indian ocean near 
mauritius with approximately 160 deaths according to boeing 
on aug 12 1985 a boeing 747 flown by japan air lines crashed 
into a mountain on a domestic flight killing 520 people 
the japan air lines crash was the worst singleplane aircraft 
accident in history boeing later admitted its faulty repairs were 
one of the causes of the crash which was attributed to a crack in 
the rear cabin wall that caused a sudden loss of pressure the force 
of the air tore the planes tail apart 
the federal aviation administration in 1986 ordered a 
modification of all boeing 747s as a result of that crash 
david jimenez of boeing commercial airplanes in seattle said the 
jet was a a 747100 he said it was the 15th 747 ever built and that 
it was delivered to pan am in february 1970 
it had approximately 33000 cycles with one cycle representing a 
takeoff and landing even though the jet was relatively old in terms 
of 747s that is not considered a high number of cycles he said a 
high number is 50000plus

the american red cross president said wednesday 
that soviet authorities were unprepared for the devastation caused 
by the armenian earthquake but are doing their best to properly use 
100 million in foreign aid for the victims 
im satisified that every attempt is being made to properly 
utilize the assistance and to provide accountability for it 
richard schubert said in a telephone interview after returning to 
moscow from armenia 
the dec 7 earthquake leveled cities and up to 100 rural 
settlements in northwest armenia and official soviet sources have 
put the death toll as high as 55000 
the quake prompted an outpouring of government and private aid 
from 77 countries that the soviets say has totaled at least 100 
million 
schubert who arrived in the soviet union saturday said the 
american red cross contributed 4 million in aid in kind from 
syringes and bags for storing blood to ultrasound and dialysis 
machines 
he said the soviets abandoned their customary restraint on 
foreign entries to let quake aid be flown into armenia which may 
have contributed to chaos 
the logistics of all this stuff coming in at the same time 
without the right prioritization from the owners has made it 
difficult for them he said 
the soviet red cross never included planning for domestic 
disasters in its program he said 
one of the problems was that they were totally open to people 
coming in and bringing things and didnt organize it into a proper 
pipeline he said 
he said such an earthquake would have posed a challenge even in 
the united states where there have long been contingency plans for 
disasters 
here neither the government nor private organizations had 
experience in dealing with the logistics of anything like this he 
said 
schubert said the soviets are committed to tracking down every 
piece of equipment thats been donated if its not needed because 
they already have it theyll offer to return it 
he said his organization had also received at least 1 million in 
cash donations for victims and that he and soviet red cross 
officials discussed how to spend the money he said suggestions 
include building a plant to make artificial limbs for people who 
lost arms or legs a hospital center for paraplegics and drawing up 
a disaster preparedness plan for armenia 
well take the projects home and discuss them said schubert 
who plans to return home thursday 
on wednesday night he visited the vishnevsky surgical institute 
in moscow to meet with badly injured earthquake victims and with 
institute director vladimir fedorov

secretary of state george p shultz met 
wednesday with ousted panamanian president eric arturo delvalle as 
part of a highlevel show of support for a leader whom the united 
states continues to regard as panamas legitimate authority 
neither shultz nor delvalle spoke after their late afternoon 
meeting but state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley had 
reaffirmed earlier that us backing for delvalle remains unchanged 
10 months after his ouster by forces loyal to gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
mrs oakley appeared to rule out us use of force to depose 
noriega saying that panamas political crisis can be resolved 
only by panamanians 
delvalle will meet thursday with president reagan who said 
wednesday that it would be nice if there were a change in 
government in panama before he leaves office next month but doesnt 
know if there will be one 
panamas ambassador juan b sosa a delvalle loyalist said the 
deposed president is here to discuss several options with 
administration officials and his supporters here 
sosa said the panamanian opposition must decide whether to 
contest presidential elections set for may 
he said one option is to boycott the election on grounds that 
noriega is likely to rig the outcome alternatively he said the 
antinoriega forces could field a candidate whose entry into the 
race would demonstrate beyond doubt the breadth of the opposition to 
the military leader 
delvalle has been living in hiding in panama since he was deposed 
and was flown to the united states aboard a us military aircraft 
deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk said the 
thursday meeting at the white house was designed to show visibly 
the us support for the delvalle government and for the people of 
panama 
the spokesman was asked about reports that panamanians working 
for united states companies in panama were disgruntled over us 
economic sanctions designed to end the noriega regime 
we regret any hardship imposed on these longterm loyal 
employes he said noriegas actions demonstrate the great 
lengths he is willing to go to find money to shore up his illegal 
regime 
the united states sanctions remain in place popadiuk said 
they were undertaken in response to the call by the delvalle 
government for economic pressure against noriega the sanctions will 
remain in place until the panamanian people enjoy the full benefits 
of democracy 
panamas economic problems preceded the economic sanctions 
he said the panamanian economy was already deteriorating due to 
the noriega regimes policies

a senior state department official said 
wednesday the united states wont give diplomatic recognition to 
angola unless it holds peace talks with rebels fighting to topple 
the marxist government 
angolas deputy foreign minister told reporters his country 
absolutely refuses to talk with the us and south africanbacked 
unita rebels led by jonas savimbi 
with or without savimbi we will not talk with unita said 
the angolan venancio de moura 
taken together the comments indicated no peace is imminent 
between angola and unita despite the conclusion of a peace 
settlement for southwest africa 
the foreign ministers of cuba angola and south africa were 
scheduled to sign final documents thursday for the withdrawal of 
50000 cuban troops fron angola and for pretoria to begin granting 
independence to namibia africas last colony 
de moura said angolan officials had been told by chester a 
crocker the assistant us secretary of state that washington will 
drop its opposition to angolas joining the world bank and 
international monetary fund and extend diplomatic recognition once 
the accords were signed 
but crocker who mediated the african accords stressed the 
united states will not cease supplying weapons to unita 
our attitude toward unita is unchanged crocker told 
reporters we have no intention of disengaging unilaterally from 
the angolan situation at a time when others continue to provide 
large amounts of hardware to the other angolan parties 
crocker was evidently referring to the soviet union the source 
of the angolan governments weapons 
when asked if diplomatic recognition of angola will follow 
thursdays signing of the accords crocker said i dont have any 
prediction to make on that clearly the signing is a very important 
step 
on us opposition to angolas joining the imf and world bank 
crocker said that is primarily between the angolans and the imf to 
work out the economic terms of such membership that has not yet 
been done and so thats what constitutes the principle obstacle 
crocker and the angolan officials along with secretary of state 
george p shultz and the foreign ministers of cuba and south africa 
were to attend thursdays signing at the united nations of two 
accords on southwest africa 
one diplomat who had been expected to attend was bernt carlsson 
the swedish un commissioner for namibia who was aboard a pan am 
jumbo jet that crashed in scotland wednesday night carlsson 50 
was flying from london to new york when the jet crashed his absence 
would not delay the meeting 
the foreign ministers of south africa cuba and angola are 
scheduled to sign accords declaring the independence process for 
namibia will begin april 1 after 73 years of south african rule 
at the same time cuba and angola will sign an agreement with the 
united nations to have 70 un military observers monitor withdrawal 
of 50000 cuban troops from angola over a 30month period beginning 
in january 
a much larger peacekeeping force is planned for monitoring south 
africas withdrawal from namibia also known as southwest africa 
a decadeold security council plan for namibias independence 
calls for about 2000 civilian administrators and military police to 
back about 7500 un peacekeepers as south african troops withdraw 
and a civilian government is organized 
the namibian elections are scheduled for nov 1 
cuban troops went to angola in 1975 to help the marxist 
government fight invading south african troops and usbacked 
rebels of the national union for the total liberation of angola 
more commonly called unita 
south africa insisted on the cuban withdrawal from angola in 
exchange for its cooperation with the namibia independence plan 
pretoria has ruled the mineralrich territory of namibia since 
capturing it from germany during world war i in 1920 the league of 
nations granted south africa a mandate to administer namibia the 
united nations revoked that mandate in 1966

brent carlsson of sweden the un 
commissioner for namibia was one of the passengers aboard the pan 
am jetliner that crashed in scotland on wednesday un officials 
said 
carlsson 50 was to have been a witness thursday when the accord 
is signed that granting the african colony of namibia its 
independence 
flight 103 crashed about an hour after carlssons assistant 
malti ramen said the commissioner called her to say he was boarding 
the plane 
on thursday the foreign ministers of south africa cuba and 
angola are to sign an accord guaranteeing pretoria will end its 
73year rule over namibia and that 50000 cuban troops will 
withdraw from angola 
south african foreign minister rf botha told the associated 
press he arrived in new york on the pan am flight just before the 
illfated flight 103 
botha contacted at his hotel said he was saddened to learn of 
the crash 
carlsson had been commissioner for namibia since july 1987 the 
united nations in 1966 revoked a league of nations mandate giving 
south africa the right to govern namibia and asserted its own 
authority over the territory 
south africa however defied the un declaration until this 
month when it finally signed a preliminary agreement that linked 
its withdrawal from namibia with the cuban pullout from angola 
the united nations considered carlsson the chief official of 
namibia also known as southwest africa thursdays accord would 
have been its first step toward coming under his control during its 
transition to an independent government 
carlsson was formerly a special emissary for swedish prime 
minister olaf palme to middle east and african nations from 198385 
from 197683 he was general secretary of the socialist

scottish reporter bert houston was one of the 
first journalists to get into lockerbie after the village was hit by 
a crashing pan am jumbo jet wednesday night he wrote this report 
for the associated press 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
soon after the pan am boeing 747 
plowed into lockerbie on wednesday evening its council hall became 
a makeshift clinic within hours it was a morgue 
nobody knows how many of the 2500 villagers have lost their 
lives but up to half a dozen houses were flattened and others 
caught fire and were gutted 
mayor frank park stood in the street dazed and in tears too 
distraught to talk pleasant village lanes were littered with 
debris masonry ripped up fences and shrubbery 
royal air force rescue authorities say two rows of houses were 
demolished and no survivors have been found in the wreckage 
sherwood crescent the village center that bore the brunt of the 
crash was sealed off and accumulated traffic blocked the accesses 
to lockerbie so that rescuers had to fly in and out by helicopter 
there were fears that a gas station hit by the wreckage might blow 
up 
according to initial accounts from authorities the aircraft 
apparently hit a hillside near the tiny hamlet of corrie about six 
miles from lockerbie and left a trail of debris and bodies across 
the countryside 
along a country road leading to lockerbie rescue parties could 
be seen examining pieces of smoking wreckage and there were what 
looked like blanketcovered bodies 
some of the wreckage also landed on cars on the fourlane bypass 
around lockerbie and they went up in flames 
a former police inspector archie smith ran out of his house 
with his son when he heard the crash 
i didnt know what it was at first it was just a mighty bang 
where the houses were seems to be just a black hole the fire spread 
quickly and my home soon caught alight and it is now destroyed as 
well 
smith who was a policeman for 30 years said never ever have 
i seen anything so appalling so horrific as this 
the flames sent up a pall of thick choking smoke and the streets 
were littered with rocks and twisted pieces of metal 
sheila mcdonald was delivering christmas presents to a friends 
home on a hillside overlooking the town when she heard a horrible 
droniong sound 
she said this vshaped object just seemed to come flying 
through the air it was the wings and front section of an 
aircraft another part came just behind and all around seemed to 
be red dots like sparks 
it hit some houses in the town and there was a mass of flame 
and everything just started to shake

she asked that her new surname not be disclosed 
this is obviously a tragic and unfortunate case said 
mcguckian who noted ms footes obsessive behavior before 
reading the verdict why its gone on this long ill never 
understand 
kudel described ms goldstein as an insecure person with a 
desire to be recognized and suggested she fabricated her story 
and pressed charges against ms foote because she enjoyed the 
publicity her case had received

years when she received the first threatening call in december 1986

boeings 747 jumbo jetliner has an average 
safety record but its been involved in several of the worlds 
worst aviation disasters over the course of its nearly 20year 
history because of its large capacity 
the worst singleplane aircraft accident in history involved a 
japan air lines 747 that smashed into a mountain northwest of tokyo 
on aug 12 1985 killing 520 of 524 people aboard 
in march 1977 two 747s one a pan am jet the other a klm 
collided on a fogshrouded runway in the canary islands killing 
more than 582 people the blame was put on a miscommunication that 
resulted in one pilot taking off when another was on the runway 
aviation expert john galipault of the aviation safety institute 
in ohio said the 747 aircraft has a safety record about average for 
the early widebody jetliners according to statistical summaries of 
jet aircraft accidents 
the pan am 747 that crashed in scotland on wednesday was the 15th 
747 ever built and it was delivered to pan am in february 1970 
the aviation industry recently has focused on aging aircraft due 
in part to the inflight damage sustained by an aloha airline boeing 
737 airplane in hawaii this year boeing has undertaking a series of 
studies of its older airplanes to determine what effect age and use 
have on airworthiness 
a boeing 747 military version is being outfitted to become the 
new air force one presidential aircraft 
david jimenez of boeing commercial airplanes division in 
seattle wash said the plane that crashed was a 747100 model with 
approximately 16500 takeoff and landings 
the 747100 was the initial model of the aircraft and is no 
longer manufactured it was capable of seating up to 385 passengers 
the plane also was produced in other models and configurations 
including the high capacity type involved in the japan crash that 
could carry 550 passengers for short range flights 
the 1985 japan air lines crash was attributed to a crack in the 
rear cabin wall opened sending a rush of pressurized air into the 
tail section blowing the tail apart and severing hydraulic lines 
used to control the aircraft 
after that crash the federal aviation administration ordered 
modification of all 747s aimed at preventing such a rush of 
pressurized air if the rear cabin wall fails 
the boeing co admitted that its faulty repairs were one of the 
causes 
according to boeing 18 of the 883 747s produced have crashed or 
been otherwise destroyed 
among them was the korean air lines 747 that was shot down by a 
soviet jet fighter sept 1 1983 after flying through soviet 
airspace near sakhalin island 
others included an air india 747 that crashed june 23 1985 off 
the coast of ireland killing 329 people

lebanon bade a bitter goodbye wednesday to 
the red cross one of the few sources of care and comfort in this 
violencescarred country 
the agencys pullout prompted by terrorist death threats means 
an end to what often has been the only humanitarian aid for 
thousands of people during 13 years of civil war and factional 
violence 
lebanon is the only loser beiruts leftist assafir daily 
lamented wednesday as the international committee of the red cross 
evacuated its swiss workers 
the last ferry headed for larnaca cyprus included michael 
dufour the chief red cross delegate swiss ambassador dino sciolli 
and 12 other swiss nationals boarded the boat police said 
sciolli based in the cypriot capital nicosia told an official 
of the lebanese foreign ministry that his government was recalling 
him to switzerland to discuss the red cross pullout 
eleven red cross workers who left tuesday completed the same 
route and arrived in switzerland on wednesday on tuesday red cross 
officials in geneva had said all had left 
with the collapse of government authority over the years un 
organizations and humanitarian groups have been the saviors of 
countless victims of the bloodletting 
the red cross worked closely with the lebanese red cross whose 
rescue crews have braved bombs and bullets to carry out their 
mission in christian and moslem areas 
the departure left hundreds of lebanese and palestinian prisoners 
in israel and the khiam detention camp run by the israelibacked 
south lebanon army with no way to correspond with their families 
red cross officials visited the detainees regularly to deliver 
messages and to try to improve living conditions 
the agency also had been instrumental in arranging prisoner 
exchanges between palestinian guerrillas and israel 
another casualty of the departure is an orthopedic center in 
south lebanons provincial capital of sidon for five years it has 
cared for disabled victims of lebanons violence and provided them 
with artifical limbs 
the red cross 150 lebanese employees face losing their jobs if 
the withdrawal becomes permanent 
one minute we were happily going about our work the next i was 
told to go home for a week pending the red cross final decision 
on whether to shut down its operations in lebanon or not one 
lebanese worker said 
in geneva andre pasquier the red cross chief of operations 
said all the delegates were ready to go back to lebanon as soon as 
conditions would permit even tomorrow he said the fact that 
they stayed on their posts after one of them peter winkler was 
kidnapped last month demonstrated their determination to 
continue 
until the last year humanitarian workers were generally 
considered immune from kidnappings and death threats by lebanons 
extremists because they gave help regardless of political or 
religious affiliations 
they remained when thousands of other foreigners fled 
kidnapplagued moslem areas in recent years they treated the sick 
and wounded provided relief aid and even food often in highly 
dangerous conditions 
the evacuation was ordered tuesday by international red cross 
headquarters in geneva following the release friday of winkler 32 
a swiss national 
he was abducted nov 17 in south lebanon by unidentified gunmen 
they were believed linked to proiranian shiite moslem extremists 
apparently seeking to trade winkler for alleged shiite hijacker 
hussein hariri who goes on trial in switzerland in february 
it was not clear why the kidnappers released winkler or whether 
the subsequent death threats made against the allswiss red cross 
officials came from the same group 
the two largest moslem militias in south lebanon on wednesday 
urged the red cross to return 
the appeals came in separate statements by the sunni moslem 
nasserite leftist militia that governs sidon and the shiite moslem 
mainstream amal militia in tyre 
the kidnapping of humanitarian activists has tarnished our 
national image said the nasserite statement issued by the groups 
chief of staff usama saad 
he said the pullout was strange especially after the intense 
national efforts that were exerted to gain the release of peter 
winkler 
amals statement in tyre said criminal gangs here and there 
were behind the terrorist attacks aimed at emptying lebanon of all 
humanitarian organizations 
five other humanitarian activists have been kidnapped in south 
lebanon this year four a briton a swede a norwegian and a 
syrian were freed 
but belgian physician jan cools who disappeared may 21 remains 
missing a previously unknown group calling itself the soldiers of 
justice said sunday it was holding cools and accused him of 
spying for israel 
cools 32 had worked for the norwegian humanitarian organization 
norwac near tyre for three months before he disappeared 
there was no word whether norwac and other humanitarian groups 
such as the frenchbased medecin sans frontiers and britains oxfam 
charity will follow the red cross example

two bald eagles are nesting in a welltrodden city 
park overlooking puget sound despite the birds usual intolerance 
for human activity and the prospects of their raising a brood are 
considered good 
their 7foot wingspans casting immense shadows as they play in 
the thermal currents above the bluffs and feed in the sound the 
eagles arrived at wild discovery park early this year and began 
building a nest near the top of an 80foot fir 
jim watson state department of wildlife biologist on tuesday 
said the birds the first known eagle pair to settle in the 
710acre park are adding to the nest as the january mating season 
approaches 
the eagles could be from a generation that grew up near human 
activity and thus has a higher tolerance for it watson said 
the park is in a residential neighborhood on the citys western 
edge the nesting tree is 500 feet from a maintenance building used 
by dozens of people and 15 trucks said allissa beebe recreation 
attendant 
they dont seem to be bothered at all she said once we 
had five hang gliders out and tons of people in the park and they 
were out sailing around it was really neat 
the park which averages 1000 visitors a week and has dirt 
hiking and running trails also contains dozens of army and navy 
residences and army reserve barracks said les mcmillan park ranger 
watson said the birds prospects of raising a brood are good 
he said there are fewer than 10 yearround eagle pairs in king 
and pierce counties the states most populous in parks that like 
discovery park are relatively protected and border on puget sound 
or major lakes 
eagles are listed as threatened in the region and are protected 
by state and federal law 
the newcomers dont necessarily indicate a trend toward more 
urban eagles said watson pairs need very tall oldgrowth or 
secondgrowth trees for a nest an isolated territory of four square 
miles and water containing a generous food supply 
populated areas around puget sound and lakes in northwest 
washington rarely have that combination watson said 
statewide there are 302 nesting pairs that produced 285 young 
this year in 1975 113 nesting pairs were counted but part of the 
increase is attributed to better surveying said jim michaels a 
us fish and wildlife biologist 
bald eagle population numbers are up across the country chiefly 
because the pesticide ddt has banned since 1972 officials siad ddt 
weakened egg shells reducing the survival rate 
the bald eagle will remain listed as threatened in the region 
that encompasses washington oregon california nevada idaho 
montana and wyoming until 800 nesting pairs are counted the count 
last year was 627 said kelly mcallister researcher for the state 
department of wildlife 
during 1988 in the chespeake bay region which consists of 
virginia maryland delaware west virginia and eastern 
pennsylvania 186 nesting pairs produced 258 chicks that left the 
nest said glenn therres head of marylands bald eagle project 
in 1986 138 nesting pairs were counted and 192 chicks survived 
to fly he said 
the rapid recovery may mean the bald eagle will be downgraded 
from an endangered to a threatened species regionally within five 
years he said the eagle is listed as an endangered species in 43 
states therres said

security men foiled an attempt to topple 
the fragile coalition government of prime minister sadek mahdi and 
arrested more than two dozen members of a previous administration 
officials said 
defense minister abdulmaguid khalil said the coup was attempted 
on saturday against the moslem government whose factions are 
quarreling over a proposed peace agreement with christian and 
animist rebels 
he confirmed a report in the newspaper alsiyassa which said 
security personnel arrested 25 retired military officers and former 
civilian officials from the former government of president gaafar 
nimeiri 
nimeiri was ousted in a coup april 6 1985 
the alsiyassa report was the third newspaper report of an 
attempted coup in sudan in the past two weeks 
after the report appeared about 300 demonstrators ignored an 
emergency government order gathering in khartoums liberty square 
to demand government approval of a tentative agreement to stop 
sudans civil war 
relief officials estimate at least 500000 people died this year 
from famine due to drought and civil war 
riot police and plainclothes security men ringed the square as 
protestors chanted no no to war and yes yes to peace 
the democratic union party the secondlargest member of the 
government coalition led by mahdis umma party signed the peace 
agreement with the sudan peoples liberation army on nov 16 
the tentative pact calls for a ceasefire a conference to 
negotiate a permanent peace a new constitution and a freeze on 
implementing sudans islambased legal code 
rebel leader john garang began his civil rebellion in early 1983 
to press demands for what he considers fairer economic political 
and administrative treatment for southern sudan 
the crowd broke up only after they were asked to leave by abbas 
awad a member of the organizing committee representing 54 political 
parties and labor groups supporting the peace agreement 
we have specific information about plots aimed at jeopardizing 
democracy in the country and that the demonstration of today would 
have been used as a springboard for this purpose abbas told the 
crowd 
interviewed later he said the democratic union party canceled 
the demonstration because a group was planning to counter it 
to spread chaos so that the army would intervene 
parliament voted 13678 wednesday to authorize mahdi to convene a 
constitutional peace conference dec 31 and invite the rebels to 
attend according to the egyptian staterun middle east news agency 
the conference is a key clause of the peace agreement but the 
democratic unionist party and garang have been insisting that the 
entire accord be approved before convening the conference 
the vote in effect overruled the democratic unionist party 
demand prompting some of its members to threaten to withdraw from 
the coalition that also includes the moslem fundamentalist national 
islamic front 
the front oppposes the peace plan because it calls for freezing 
sudans islamic legal code until an alternative was reached

president hafez assad opened the door 
wednesday to reestablishing ties with two of syrias bitter foes 
egypt and iraq a presidential spokesman said 
egyptian president hosni mubarak was quoted wednesday as saying 
he invited assad to visit egypt in an attempt to improve relations 
assad during a meeting with a delegation from the federation of 
arab lawyers said cooperation between syria and egypt on a 
national basis has always been favored by both countries and would 
benefit the arab nation presidential spokesman jibran kourieh 
said 
the president also told the lawyers including the chairman of 
the egyptian bar association that although past attempts at 
syrianiraqi reconciliation did not work syria supports any arab 
solidarity action said kourieh 
mubarak made the invitation to assad in an interview with the 
saudi newspaper alshark alawsat which was published in cairo 
wednesday by the staterun middle east news agency mubarak also 
said he earlier offered to go to syria but assad snubbed the idea 
political observers speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
statements by assad were a new overture to two of its longstanding 
foes 
egypt and syria have been at odds since the late egyptian 
president anwar sadat flew to jerusalem in 1977 an event that 
culminated with egypts peace treaty with israel in 1979 
syria led the drive to expel egypt from the arab league as well 
as other regional and islamic organizations 
arab leaders have been trying to organize a summit of the 
22member arab league which has not met in regular session since 
1982 because of rifts between member governments saudi arabia the 
scheduled venue for the summit has indicated it wants egypt to 
attend 
the feud between syria and iraq one of the most bitter 
interarab vendettas was rekindled following the aug 20 ceasefire 
in the iraniraq war assad allied himself with persian iran against 
arab iraq syria and iraq are ruled by rival wings of the baath arab 
socialist party 
syria has faced growing political isolation in the region arab 
states condemned it for its alliance with iran presidential 
elections in lebanon in august and september collapsed after 
christian deputies refused to attend the parliamentary sessions 
where syriansupported candidates were expected to win syria keeps 
40000 troops in lebanon which it considers under its sphere of 
influence 
assad has also waged a campaign since 1983 to depose yasser 
arafat as chairman of the palestine liberation organization arafat 
has gained unprecedented recognition in the past month for leading 
the plo through the declaration of a palestinian state and talks 
with the united states for the first time in 13 years

rockwell international operator of the rocky flats 
nuclear weapons plant agreed to pay 47500 to the environmental 
protection agency in an agreement the federal agency said wednesday 
confirmed its jurisdiction over the plant 
rockwell officials said the department of energy which operates 
the plant about 17 miles northwest of denver would foot the bill 
reimbursing the company if necessary they denied the payment was a 
civil penalty 
rockwell also said the payment was just a monetary payment to 
avoid litigation costs 
but the epa said it was the largest civil penalty the agency ever 
has assessed against a contractor at a federal facility and the 
first it has assessed for environmental problems at rocky flats 
the payment stems from two enforcement actions one in 1986 and 
the other this year brought against rockwell by epa for alleged 
pcb or polychlorinated biphenyl contamination at the plant 
by agreeing to the terms of this settlement rockwell admits 
that the agency had the jurisdiction to bring the enforcement 
actions against them said david j janik the epa attorney on the 
case 
the energy department and rockwell argued that rockwell cannot be 
fined by the epa because rocky flats is a federal facility and epa 
doesnt fine other federal agencies 
it was rockwells position that the case should have been one 
between epa and doe said company spokesman pat etchart adding 
that the agreement does not set a precedent because we do reserve 
our right to contest any future actions the epa might take 
janik said rockwells argument that the payment wasnt a civil 
penalty is completely incorrect 
at rockwells request janik said epa agreed to leave the word 
penalty out of the agreement but they know the only authority 
the agency epa has for taking money from anybody is through a 
civil penalty 
janik said it was beyond epas powers to determine whether 
doe can give rockwell the money to pay the penalty as a taxpayer 
it doesnt sound very good he said 
workers at rocky flats use plutonium to make triggers for the 
nations nuclear bombs 
the main plutonium processing building at rocky flats has been 
closed since early october following a safety violation in which 
three people were exposed to plutonium but production at the plant 
has continued

india and china signed a civil aviation agreement 
and two other accords thursday during a summit that indian prime 
minister rajiv gandhi said marks a new beginning in chineseindian 
relations 
the agreements gave some concrete substance to a trip by the 
indian leader intended mainly as a symbolic restoration of good 
relations between two nations representing a third of the worlds 
population 
the two sides agreed in principle to establish direct air links 
between new delhi and beijing they also signed a threeyear 
cultural exchange program agreement and a science and technology 
accord calling for contacts between the scientific communities of 
the two countries 
after meeting with elder statesman deng xiaoping gandhi said new 
delhis troubled relations with beijing seemed but a memory 
we agreed on almost everything that was spoken of gandhi 
said 
the comment was a bit surprising from a man who has come to power 
under the shadow of bad relations with beijing but it made sense in 
the light of gandhis goals in china 
gandhi is the first indian prime minister to come to china since 
his grandfather prime minister jawaharal nehru journeyed here in 
1954 to celebrate the two countries close ties 
gandhis fiveday trip which began monday marks the first time 
chinese and indian leaders have met since 1960 when the late premier 
chou enlai went to new dehli 
relations turned sour in the early 1960s because of personal and 
political disputes between nehru and chinese leader mao tsetung a 
border war broke out in 1962 
in the past 26 years relations have improved slightly border 
negotiations started in 1981 as has a small amount of trade but 
little has really changed and the border today remains tense 
it was to break this political logjam that gandhi came to china 
he sought as he said to rekindle the spirit of peace and 
goodwill between the two most populous nations of the world 
his first two days were filled with talks on the border chinas 
troubled province of tibet which lies just north of india and 
trade but it was his discussion with deng that seemingly interested 
gandhi the most 
the meeting began shortly after 1030 am 
welcome my young friend the 84yearold chinese leader said 
to gandhi 44 as he took the prime ministers hand 
beginning with your visit we can restore our relationship as 
friends deng said the two countries leaders will become 
friends the countries will become friends the people will become 
friends 
and then as if he was talking to a schoolboy deng added you 
agree dont you 
i agree gandhi replied 
deng told gandhi that he had met nehru during his visit to 
beijing in 1954 
in the considerable period of time in between there was 
unpleasantness with each other deng said 
with a sudden wave of his arm the chinese leader commanded 
but let us forget all that we should be looking forward 
deng said he had sent messages to gandhis mother indira gandhi 
in the 1980s when she was prime minister 
at that time our countries had some contact deng said but 
the genuine start in the improvement of our relations is your visit 
so i wish to thank you 
sitting back in the overstuffed chairs in fujian hall in the 
cavernous great hall of the people the two embarked upon an 
analysis of international political and economic affairs 
the difference between the countries of the north and south are 
getting bigger and bigger deng was quoted as saying by the 
nationally televised news true development wont be achieved 
until all of mankind has achieved a certain level 
gandhi said deng impressed him 
i found that almost everything he spoke of was what we have 
been working for for these last 40 years gandhi said later at a 
news conference working for a new political order that doesnt 
look to blocs that doesnt look to confrontation as a solution 
working for a new economic order more equitable and just 
for gandhi his visit with deng marked the highlight of his trip 
because he was seeking symbols and not substance 
indeed the tangible achievements agreements on civil 
aviation science and technology and cultural exchanges are small 
but for gandhi a friendly meeting with deng was apparently the 
sign he had wanted the political logjam is broken 
we have agreed that we can and should move ahead the young 
leader said at the news conference after meeting deng we have 
laid the foundation for a peaceful stable and cooperative 
relationship between our two countries

immigration officials are adopting an 
aggressive new approach in dealing with nicaraguans and other 
central americans seeking asylum in the united states and have 
handled more than 200 applications in just three days in south texas 
the central americans arent being granted work permits during a 
30day period in which decisions are to be made on whether to 
approve or reject their asylum requests immigration and 
naturalization service spokesman duke austin said tuesday 
following a directive from thenattorney general edwin meese iii 
in july 1987 work authorization had been virtually automatic for 
nicaraguans once they presented themselves to immigration officials 
saying they feared persecution from their countrys leftist 
sandinista government 
the meese directive was in line with the reagan administrations 
overall opposition to the sandinista regime but ins now is facing a

hotels have repaired hurricane damage 
palms sway and discos throb but fine stretches of beach were blown 
away and the tourists without whom cancun has no purpose are slow 
to return 
we have to erase the image that exists abroad about the damage 
caused by the hurricane said carlos constandse who owns a hotel 
in this resort on mexicos caribbean coast 
hurricane gilbert struck cancun on sept 14 with 160 mph winds 
that snapped power poles like toothpicks uprooted trees and rammed 
a 240ton fishing boat into one of the hotels 
gilbert tore at the hotels first from one side then the other 
it left them a shambles of shattered glass soaked furniture and 
sandfilled rooms but caused little structural damage 
the storm killed more than 300 people on its destructive tour of 
the caribbean but only 14 of them in this state quintana roo it 
caused 61 million in damage to the cancun airport telephones and 
other services and 90 million to hotels the government tourism 
agency said 
when gilbert was gone the resort began a feverish repair program 
to get ready for the winter season which means healthy profits for 
hotel and shop owners and millions of dollars in foreign exchange 
for mexicos struggling economy 
im amazed at how well they got it back together already 
said george weist of lancaster pa who also visited cancun a year 
ago the only thing we wanted to do that we couldnt do was walk 
the beach 
fine white caribbean sand has been shoveled out of hotel lobbies 
and rooms bars and kitchens but still isnt all back where it came 
from 
the cancun hotel strip runs for 15 miles in the shape of a 7 
along a ribbon of sand that sits off the yucatan peninsula like a 
bracket 
beaches are the same as ever along the top of the 7 perhaps even 
broader but not along the vertical stretch where 100 feet of sand 
used to slope gently toward the turquoise surf 
some hotels on the northern third lost their beaches entirely and 
others have them only at low tide the beach remains farther south 
but is much narrower than before 
residents say the beach changes with the seasons under normal 
conditions shrinking with the north winds of winter and growing 
when they shift to the southeast 
sand is returning naturally according to hotel managers and 
scientists and the beach already has widened but no one knows how 
long full recovery will take 
because of high repair costs and low income most hotel 
managements will wait until after the fourmonth peak season to 
decide whether to speed up the beach recovery probably with suction 
dredging 
several major hotels will not be ready until january or later but 
others have reopened in stages renting some rooms while repairs 
continue on others new discos are opening but a few old ones 
remain closed 
a lot of people arent here said craig debano of anaheim 
calif it takes away from it for the single people 
a wellknown nightclub at his hotel still is being repaired 
cancun brings in about 20 percent of all the foreign exchange 
mexico earns from tourism collecting 500 million a year from 1 
million visitors the tourism agency said the 1988 total would be 
about 30 million less 
hotels in the resort offered discounts when they reopened but 
some said they would raise prices to last years levels for the peak 
season more than 180 a night in some cases 
the cancun chamber of commerce said 10 percent to 15 percent of 
nontourist businesses closed because of the storm in part because 
hotel and restaurant employees had to live without tips 
one manager giovanni ronghi said his hotel would be full for 
the christmasnew year holiday and was heavily booked for the 
februaryapril period 
he expects business to be down 7 percent overall from last year 
but that could change depending on how cold the united states 
gets 
hundreds of travel agents were brought in before the peak season 
gerda vandyck of syracuse ny said she would recommend cancun 
to clients who wanted to see the yucatan and be on the beach 
if they just want to go to the beach and have peace and 
quiet she will send them somewhere else mrs vandyck said as a 
smokebelching bulldozer clanked by

when a researcher interpreting longclosed 
documents concluded recently that the legendary robert e peary was 
not the first explorer to cross the shifting arctic ice to the north 
pole it came as no surprise to ralph plaisted 
we knew peary didnt do it all the members of our expedition 
knew it said plaisted who led a group of nine doityourself 
snowmobile explorers to the pole in april 1968 in the first 
indisputable conquest by surface 
still plaisted was an asterisk in the record books behind peary 
until this fall when original navigational records uncovered from 
pearys 1909 dogsled voyage indicated the renowned explorer 
probably never got closer than 121 miles from the pole 
though pearys record has been in doubt from the day he returned 
a senate committee and the influential national geographic society 
which cosponsored the peary expedition certified his claim in 
1911 peary was promoted to rear admiral in the navy and retired on 
a comfortable pension 
he became wealthy from books and lecture fees but i didnt 
said plaisted now 61 sitting in a study adorned with clothing 
photographs and memorabilia from his expedition in the large mobile 
home he shares with his wife 
plaisted said his own difficulties in the arctic including a 
failed expedition in 1967 convinced him that pearys claim was only 
wishful 
he said he went to the north pole in 37 days and came back over 
the same trail in 16 and we knew that couldnt happen because the 
roads we built were gone in a few hours said plaisted up 
there therere 5 million square miles of ocean and its moving 
constantly 
his own expedition took 43 days 2 hours and 30 minutes 
for 20 years plaisted and his crew which included a 
schoolteacher a lawyer a doctor and a movie cameraman had to 
content themselves with knowing inside that they were first 
meanwhile plaisted ran his own insurance agency until 1971 when 
he and his family built a log cabin near a remote lake in 
saskatchewan and lived for a year on moose and caribou meat fish 
and canned food he and his wife now run a small fishing camp at the 
site for spring and summer vacationers 
if i had started 20 years ago and tried to promote myself and 
say i know peary didnt do it and i know i did and i should be in 
the history books instead of peary they would have said its 
just sour grapes he doesnt have any proof plaisted said 
proof that peary never reached the pole came when baltimore 
astronomer dennis rawlins unearthed and analyzed pearys 
navigational observations from the day he claimed to have been at 
the pole 
the notes sealed for 50 years didnt jibe with real 
observations according to rawlins 
the sun is virtually steady at the north pole whereas here we 
have it rising rapidly he said the position ive calculated 
from the data is 88 degrees and 15 minutes latitude 14 degrees 
longitude if his clock was correct 
it means he was 105 nautical miles or 121 statute miles from 
the pole 
even national geographic a champion of the peary legacy for 
nearly 80 years has published an article indicating that peary 
faked his greatest achievement 
wally herbert a british polar explorer wrote in the magazines 
september issue that peary apparently inserted after his return the 
page in his diary where he celebrated reaching the pole at last 
though evidence suggests peary perpetrated a hoax plaisted 
rawlins and herbert all say he was a great navigator with a noble 
goal and shouldnt be judged too harshly 
hes 53 years old his feet are frozen and he knows hes never 
going to do it again and hes 121 miles from the north pole said 
plaisted referring to pearys loss of eight toes in six 
expeditions with his supplies he knew i can get there but i 
cant get back 
i know he didnt want to lie 
because of the dangers plaisted says he wouldnt go back there 
if you put a million dollars on my desk right now 
his group spent months in northern minnesota training on 
snowmobiles which had just been invented they wore 1000 
synthetic outfits based on eskimo designs and signed up 89 
financial backers 
when the expedition reached the pole one mass of jumbled ice 
not any different from anywhere else up there plaisteds group 
spent the night waiting for a us air force plane to fly over and 
document their achievement 
the next morning at 10 oclock we had to move our tents some 2 
miles so we could be in the same position as the night before he 
said 
three types of air force navigational instruments confirmed the 
90 degrees north position and the plaisted expedition became known 
in the guinness book of world records as the earliest indisputable 
attainment of the north pole over sea ice 
the discrediting of pearys claim means plaisted will take his 
place beside such polar record holders as roald amundsen of norway 
who in 1911 was the first person to reach the south pole and in 1926 
reached the north pole by airboat and joseph fletcher the first 
person to stand at the north pole after flying there in 1925 
ive been called and told theyre going to change the history 
books plaisted said laughing i said that and 50 cents will 
get me a cup of coffee 
but he acknowledges the recognition is better late than never 
now i can write the book i want to write about the 
expedition he said to write it before it would just be sour 
grapes to the national geographic and theyd shoot me down 
i should be very grateful that people created this hoax long 
enough for me to be born grow up and raise enough money to make the 
expedition plaisted said 
if they had said peary didnt do it then there would have been 
someone who would have before me

joe wedge only makes 4 an hour but the 
benefits are good he gets a house free heat electricity beef and 
all the milk his family can drink 
his employers say its the least they can do to make sure he 
stays on the job 
wedge is a farm laborer 
that makes him hot property in a part of the country where a 
booming economy and low unemployment have forced up wages and 
created a severe labor shortage for the dairy farmer some experts 
say the labor crunch ranks second only to development pressures in 
pushing northeast farmers out of business 
those farmers who are staying in business are cutting back 
operations simplifying chores turning to employment agencies or 
increasing worker benefits such as housing health insurance 
pension funds paid vacation holidays livestock and even pizza 
one of the most important things is creating an environment 
where people really have fun in the workplace says gary maas who 
advises farmers on labor problems and runs an agricultural 
headhunting service from his home in massena iowa 
every once in a while do something wild bring in a pizza or 
something 
farm experts say the labor problem has become acute in the last 
few years due to a dwindling pool of workers in the 16 to 24 age 
group and the bustling northeast economy this fall vermonts 
unemployment rate dropped to 19 percent setting a nationwide low 
apple orchardists overcome the problem by hiring migrant 
laborers but dairy farms are yearround businesses and its hard 
to keep workers when the competition is a construction firm or a 
burger king 
maas who was in new england recently conducting seminars on farm 
labor management took note of competing fastfood wages i think 
in manchester nh i saw they were paying 679 an hour he said 
wedge works for tom and mike audet brothers who have worked more 
than 15 years on their 250head dairy farm two miles from the new 
york state line 
the first eight years we tried to do it by ourselves with a 
high school kid tom says in the barns maternity ward where a 
pregnant holstein is about to calve 
but the pool of high school students dwindled and the farm 
expanded to 1000 acres 250 cows and 3300 maple sugar taps over 
the next six years the audets hired and lost 11 fulltime workers 
they added a house this year after their 11th worker showed up 
one day in damp clothing his tent had blown down in an ice storm 
the house payment is 225 a month for 30 years tom says as 
he keeps an eye on the pregnant cow so we can afford to pay a 
fulltime man and not pay a lot of interest on the money we 
borrowed 
we decided if were going to hire someone lets give them a 
break and let them walk to work mike says 
wedge a thin man with glasses red hair and a beard says the 
house was a major reason he came to work on the audets farm 3 
months ago hed been working in construction 
i get to play with the tractors the 28yearold wedge says 
with a smile i like machinery and cows we get a house provided 
lights heat all the milk you can drink they give so much beef a 
year the hours are shorter than any other farm ive worked on 
but while the audets are ahead in the benefits game many farmers 
have a ways to go to learn it says tom maloney an agricultural 
extension associate at cornell university in ithaca ny he 
recently conducted a survey of 122 new york dairy farms and found 
most employers were not keeping pace with health retirement and 
other benefits such as sick days and paid holidays 
we found out of 88 employees for example that on average they 
received two paid vacation days per year and the average work week 
was 60 hours maloney says 
the audets and others point out that extra benefits will only 
help if farmers can still find workers 
i think we may have to be looking at mexicans jamaicans 
mike says maybe these are the things we have to be thinking of 
because the labor just isnt here 
part of it is the image of agricultural jobs which is long 
hours hard work and low pay and i dont think weve done nearly 
enough in emphasizing some of the positive aspects of farm work 
maloney says however if you dont fix some of those things like 
the low pay issue you dont really stand a chance of turning the 
image around 
wedge drives a tractor down the audets road as the brothers 
stand on a hillside gazing at the land between their home and lake 
champlain acres of golden hayfields lie beneath the slateblue sky 
separated only by stands of trees an occasional fence or a barn 
and silos 
tom points to one of four farms the eye can see its up for 
development and the one just beyond it has already been sold and 
split into 10acre strips 
the brothers depart for lunch while wedge returns to the 
cowbarn he opens a door and the milkers stream inside and head for 
their respective stalls 
time flies on a farm thats another good thing about it 
wedge says and i like to be with the animals 
ive tried other jobs and i always go back to farming because 
it keeps you healthy

savers and investors need an extra dose of 
foresight as they try to plan how to manage their money in 1989 
in addition to the usual imponderables the likely direction of 
the economy interest rates and stock prices they are faced with 
the first change of occupancy at the white house in eight years 
presidentelect george bush and a democratic congress are under 
mounting pressure to shrink the federal budget deficit the 
decisions they make or dont make are likely to influence the 
outlook for investments of many kinds 
expert opinion isnt much help in sorting out prospects for 
the new year a sampling of about a dozen financial forecasts for 
1989 yields these conclusions 
the economy either will or will not slip into recession 
interest rates probably will come down if the economy slows but 
they may rise further before the decline starts and the stock 
market well it will fluctuate 
but there still are ways to plot a reasonable plan of action 
based on what is known now and on educated guesses you can make 
about the future 
the unusual pattern of interest rates that prevails as 1988 draws 
to a close makes some incomeproducing investments look appealing 
and others chancy 
rates on many relatively shortterm investments with lives of 
two to 10 years or so are now as high as or higher than what you 
can get with a longerterm commitment 
for example as of middecember 30year treasury bonds were 
yielding 902 percent while threeyear treasury notes offered a 
917 percent yield 
in these circumstances known to investment professionals as an 
inverted yield curve there isnt much incentive to take the 
extra risks involved with a long maturity 
or consider a fiveyear certificate of deposit yielding somewhere 
around 1029 percent the national average at banks and savings 
institutions reported by bank rate monitor as of dec 7 
like treasury securities cds are available with the backing of 
the federal government in the form of deposit insurance 
theres no overlooking the muchpublicized threat to the deposit 
insurance system of insolvent savings institutions with an unpaid 
bill that grows larger by the day 
among the governments possible options in dealing with this 
problem however reneging on its promise to depositors does not 
seem workable even if someone thought it was a desirable choice 
discrediting deposit insurance would likely create havoc in all the 
markets 
if you are convinced that interest rates are headed higher in 
early 1989 a logical choice would be to keep your nest egg in a 
moneymarket investment with a very short maturity 
the average yield of moneymarket mutual funds as reported by 
donoghues moneyletter of holliston mass recently stood at 775 
percent it would quickly move up further if shortterm rates 
continue their recent rise 
the newsletters current view longterm bond funds are not 
attractive now compared to money funds or even shortterm bond 
funds investors just are not being paid to be in more volatile 
longterm bond funds 
we think the time for a switch to longterm bond funds will 
come but it hasnt yet 
prospects for stocks and stock mutual funds continue to confound 
a lot of very sharp minds many experienced investors have been 
waiting since early in 1988 for a market decline and a recession to 
make stocks available at bargain prices 
so far the market has refused to accommodate them 
as thomas bailey chairman of the janus group of mutual funds 
put it in a recent note to shareholders todays stock market is 
ok but it does not represent any real bargain

television networks arent exactly scrooges 
theyll jump headfirst down a chimney with a bagful of toys if itll 
pull an audience 
a very special christmas party tonight on abc is an example 
of a holiday variety program that rings with good will its a 
onehour celebration of the triumphs of the mentally retarded 
yet ultimately the show must also deliver viewers to abc and 
toward that end its filled with the kind of celebrities barbara 
mandrell danny de vito randy travis susan saint james and mike 
tyson to name a few to whom television fans are drawn 
we have more star power than any other christmas special 
said john hamlin abcs vice president of special programs 
in the end both abc and special olympics the shows host hope 
to realize separate goals abc gets a lowcost about 650000 
holiday special to compete with nbcs the cosby show and 
special olympics which organizes athletic competitions for the 
mentally retarded receives the kind of free publicity that drives 
charitable organizations skyward 
the show will make the abilities of people with mental 
retardation real and apparent to millions of people said sargent 
shriver who joins his wife eunice kennedy shriver in heading 
special olympics people who watch the show can see that 
mentally retarded people can do things in sports that 90 percent 
of us cant do 
we live with and struggle with the mentally retarded every step 
of the way in the program nothing can do that as well as 
television 
but almost as soon as television becomes wellintentioned it 
grows dull too thus the difficulty in assembling a very special 
christmas was to create a program that could be both entertaining 
and educational engaging but not maudlin and all on a shoestring 
budget 
there is a challenge to maintain a certain tone of commercial 
interest acknowledged gary smith the director we will need to 
have celebrities for a good long time because thats part of the 
integration 
abc realizes that a very special christmas party is unlikely 
to be a ratings hit nor will it bolster the networks corporate 
image its a programming move and nothing more 
this is not something where we sat down and said lets do 
something for charity said abcs hamlin nobody at abc is 
committed to special olympics more than anything else 
at the same time abc senses that the drama and emotion of the 
mentally retarded becoming part of mainstream society has inherent 
commercial appeal 
who wouldnt want to watch a mentally retarded person execute a 
flawless ice skating routine with goldmedal winner scott hamilton 
and isnt there some widespread appeal in arnold schwarzenegger 
helping a special olympian lift weights 
hamlin who once volunteered for special olympics in the summer 
of 1987 in south bend ind said the organizations sports 
activities produce a positive feeling that cant be described 
when i went to the special olympics that was a tremendous 
experience hamlin said watching the athletes coming into the 
stadium its very hard to explain 
bobby shriver the shows executive producer and son of sargent 
shriver said the charge is a hard thing to put into words its 
a feeling you get at a very sweet christmas moment 
but such poignancy has been ignored by most of the media for 
years sargent shriver said that 15 years ago special olympics 
approached life magazine about a photographic spread they said 
we dont want to drive our readers away 
he said he had similar difficulty persuading sports illustrated 
to cover the special olympics then after years of saying no the 
magazine published a comprehensive report on last summers games 
still last summers special olympics covered in a twohour 
special by abc were a difficult sell abc felt that they could 
not sell it to their regular customers said bobby shriver who 
volunteered to line up advertisers on his own 
this year though the advertisers have come without urging 
procter amp gamble and rjr nabisco will split the commercials during 
a very special christmas 
procter amp gamble for one says its not looking to position 
itself as the maker of say some philanthropic toothpaste said a 
company spokeswoman the ads were purchased for media value 
only

if the economy were a good book there would be a 
crisis one of these days 
the stock market would crash and stay crashed or inflation would 
shoot up or unemployment would soar 
things would get bad but there would be a silver lining 
everybody would realize that something had to be done about the 
problems that caused the crisis 
the crisis would galvanize the country into action 
great crises produce great men and great deeds of courage 
john f kennedy wrote in 1956 in profiles in courage 
in a good book the stock market crash on oct 19 1987 would 
have been the perfect crisis to climax a tale of greed 
shortsightedness and easy living 
unfortunately at least from a literary point of view the 
recalcitrant economy kept chugging along and the moral of the story 
got lost 
the economy it seems is not a good book its kind of a bad 
book actually 
realizing this some people who believe the economy really does 
have serious problems have stopped waiting for a crisis to galvanize 
the country into action 
these people are starting to say there may never be a crisis 
instead they say there could be gradual imperceptible decay 
what is sometimes known as the british disease 
theyre reaching for a literary device again to explain their 
ideas but this time its the metaphor 
a failure to move quickly on the federal budget deficit 
doesnt necessarily mean a recession of the kind people like to 
write about paul samuelson of massachusetts institute of 
technology said in an interview this week in the wall street journal 
its more like the radon problem in the basement of the new 
house im building samuelson said coining a memorable phrase 
the clock is ticking all the time but nothing big happens that 
you can suddenly write about in the wall street journal 
samuelson is not alone in the metaphor concoction business 
its like one more pack of cigarettes it isnt a wolf at the 
door its termites in the basement says charles schultze a 
brookings institution scholar who is the former chairman of 
president carters council of economic advisers 
schultze is of two minds about the new metaphorical approach he 
is not so sure he said that talk of cigarettes radon and termites 
will galvanize the american public as effectively as a good 
oldfashioned crisis would 
the real tragedy of the budget deficit is its never been a 
tragedy schultze said in an ap interview this week using yet 
another literary device the paradox 
the united states has in recent years become the worlds largest 
debtor obliging future generations to pay a fat chunk of the 
national income to foreigners in the form of rents dividends and 
interest 
but as long as the economy keeps perking along it has been hard 
to focus attention on the underlying deterioration in the us 
investment accounts 
come to think of it ts eliot may have seen it coming six 
decades ago in this economic forecast 
this is the way the world ends 
not with a bang but a whimper

dozens of health care child care and family 
bills that died this year with the 100th congress are bound for 
resuscitation in 1989 their prospects at once better and worse than 
before 
on the plus side presidentelect bush repeatedly called for a 
kinder gentler nation during his campaign and proposed to spend 
more on child care health care education and homeless aid 
lawmakers are seizing on bushs interest to promote their own 
versions of child care and other social initiatives taking heart in 
what they view as a consensus on ends if not means 
on the other side of the coin is bushs pledge of no new 
taxes if he keeps that vow says one key lawmaker no social 
projects are likely to make it into the blueprint for fiscal 1990 
spending 
if the presidentelect will move on his position on tax 
revenues we can make room for some of these initiatives said 
rep leon panetta dcalif incoming chairman of the house budget 
committee if we could pick up half of a deficit reduction package 
in revenues as opposed to cuts we would make room he said that 
would amount to about 15 billion in new taxes 
the worst consequence of the deficit problem is that we are 
losing resources that could be devoted to social priorities 
panetta added were paying 166 billion in interest on the debt 
thats money thats not going for hunger housing nutrition and day 
care 
panettas senate counterpart tennessee democrat jim sasser 
stopped short of giving bush an ultimatum but indicated that without 
new tax revenues domestic spending increases will have to wait 
it may be possible to redirect some resources to some domestic 
needs sasser said speculating that dollars could be shifted from 
defense to education health care and infrastructure maybe not 
this year maybe not next year maybe the year after 
budget woes and philosophical splits over the last two years 
buried proposals to expand child care guarantee parental leave 
provide nursing home and home health care benefits increase the 
minimum wage require employersponsored worker health benefits and 
offer tax breaks to families with children 
all are certain to be back this year along with bushs campaign 
proposals and most will come through the house education and labor 
committee chaired by augustus hawkins dcalif who has a pledge of 
his own to promote anything his committee thinks will be good for 
the country cost be damned 
were just going to pass them and allow them the budget 
architects to adjust the budget in such a way as to pay for them 
hawkins said in an interview were not advocating anything we 
cant justify we think they will create earnings and reduce 
social costs in the long run 
but hawkins attitude is increasingly rare on capitol hill 
pay as you go is the rule we crossed that threshold with 
catastrophic health care said panetta referring to the 100th 
congress expansion of medicare coverage the program is being paid 
for by beneficiaries 
along the same lines house ways and means chairman dan 
rostenkowski dill said this month that members of his 
taxwriting committee are not going to endorse any new spending or 
revenuelosing proposal however meritorious unless it is included 
in a package that is selffinancing 
sen orrin hatch rutah the senior republican on the labor and 
human resources committee said a tax hike at least for some 
segments of society will be necessary to finance new social programs 
if bush and congress do not cut spending 
what weve got to do is find offsets he said were going 
to have to make priority choices between competing programs were 
going to have to get the money from some that arent really that 
important 
but hatch who chaired his committee when the gop controlled the 
senate conceded most programs are wellintentioned and many work 
well short of cuts to offset new spending he suggested that a 
multibillion dollar childcare program might for example be 
financed by a new tax on major corporations 
the tax would be imposed on the theory that they should be 
leading out in this area hatch said we could alleviate the tax 
if they do something for child care the workforce is diminishing 
its in their best interest to get involved 
among the major social initiatives expected in the 101st congress 
child care democrats will reintroduce their 25 billion act for 
better child care designed to subsidize day care for lower income 
people and bring care up to minimum federal health safety and 
staffing standards bush has proposed a 22 billion plan to expand 
head start make the dependent care credit available in the form of 
a refund to those who owe no taxes and give a tax break to 
lowincome families with young children whether or not they are in 
day care a middleground bipartisan proposal may be forthcoming 
from the senate finance committee 
health care competing needs include longterm nursing home care 
a pet project of new senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine longterm home care pushed by rep claude pepper dfla 
and health insurance for the 37 million americans who dont have it 
on the last bush has proposed letting people buy into medicaid 
but some congressional heavyweights including sen edward kennedy 
dmass and rep henry waxman dcalif want all employers to 
provide coverage which would help twothirds of those now 
uncovered rostenkowski for his part has said there is no way 
congress can take care of longterm care and the uninsured in one 
session 
family leave bush has said women shouldnt have to worry about 
losing their jobs if they take time off to care for new babies 
thats far short of congressional proposals that would require 
businesses to give leave to both parents to care for newborn newly 
adopted or seriously ill children to employees with serious medical 
problems themselves and in one case to employees to care for ailing 
relatives but some lawmakers are optimistic about a compromise 
given bushs interest in the issue 
minimum wage efforts to raise the minimum wage stalled in the 
100th congress over president reagans insistence on linking any 
hike to the creation of a subminimum training wage bush also favors 
a subminimum wage but has not been specific about to whom it would 
apply kennedy a prime mover on the issue believes there may be 
room for negotiation and a chance for early passage 
education bush has proposed a 500 million merit schools program 
to reward schools that get good results from largely disadvantaged 
student bodies he also has proposed a 50 million fund to spur the 
establishment of magnet schools 
homeless bush said in the campaign that the mckinney act 
designed to help the homeless should be fully funded for the first 
two years of the act congress released only 713 million of an 
authorized 11 billion this year congress appropriated 378 
million for the homeless act considerably less than the auhorized 
ceiling of 634 million

on a spring night in 1987 the bright musically 
talented wife of a prominent methodist minister was brutally 
attacked at her home there were no arrests no suspects and only 
the darkest hint of a motive and a shattering series of events and 
revelations after the attempted murder only deepened the mystery 
the first of three parts on the mystery of walker and peggy railey 
begins with the attack 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bewildered friends and followers would recall he 
looked tired and depressed still griefstricken and mystified over 
the savage assault on his wife 
little more than a week had passed since he found her comatose on 
the garage floor choked senseless and left for dead 
she had not regained consciousness 
now in the early evening hours of april 30 1987 the intense 
balding young man excused himself and disappeared into a private 
hospital suite 
he locked and chained the door sat down with pen and paper and 
began composing a chilling letter 
there is a demon inside my soul he wrote it has always 
been there my demon tries to lead me down paths i do not want to 
follow at times that demon has lured me into doing things i do not 
want to do 
my demon has finally gotten the upper hand 
when security officers broke in the next morning they found him 
sprawled across the bed he was alive but unconscious and in 
critical condition 
nearby were empty bottles of prescription drugs and his rambling 
letter which began with instructions for his funeral and ended 
thusly 
i have finally made the decision to take care of myself i have 
grown weak god has remained strong therein lies your hope i have 
none

the vicious attack on walker raileys wife and his ensuing 
suicide attempt devastated three families split a church and 
outraged a city 
for peggy railey was by no means an ordinary homemaker and her 
husband was perhaps dallas most dynamic and socially conscious 
young minister at 39 walker railey reigned as the senior pastor of 
the citys 6000member first united methodist church and loomed as 
a rising star in his mainstream protestant denomination 
the news of the suicide attempt swept through town nowhere more 
devastatingly than at first methodist where raileys flock was 
already reeling from the attempted murder 
his chief assistant the rev gordon casad told the congregation 
the next sunday we must remember our pastor and the troubling of 
his mind and spirit and keep him in our prayers 
asked if railey was now a suspect park stearns supervisor in 
the dallas fbi office replied this is a big no comment 
although police refused to reveal the contents of raileys 
letter they described it as an apparent suicide note and they 
redoubled their efforts to review with the convalescing minister 
what happened the night his wife was attacked 
a fellow pastor the rev david shawyer of plymouth park 
methodist church said im praying that it is not what it looks 
like im praying that what the police are suggesting could never be 
true 
im praying this will all come out some other way

raileys attempt on his own life was only the latest twist in 
what would be called dallas most haunting and sensational mystery 
in a decade one unrestrained commentator called the attempted 
murder the citys most extraordinary crime since the assassination 
of president kennedy 
peggy railey survived but only barely so comatose she could not 
identify her assailant 
several anonymous typewritten death threats preceded the attack 
apparently provoked by raileys strong sermons and public statements 
against racial prejudice and injustice but friends said mrs railey 
did not frighten easily and she had encouraged her husband not to 
soften his stand 
the last letter was slipped under the door of a church office 
just prior to easter sunday services it said easter is when 
christ arose but you are going down 
under the stern scrutiny of security officers railey delivered 
his easter sermon wearing a bulletproof vest beneath his robes 
it would be his last appearance in the pulpit of first 
methodists historic old sanctuary he hammered the congregation 
with a theme of death and resurrection that morning 
youre going to die he said pointing his finger at 
parishioners 
youre going to die he repeated 
im going to die

police and church officials first theorized that the attempt on 
peggy raileys life was some kind of grotesque retaliation for her 
husbands outspokenness 
with his wife in critical condition railey stationed himself 
outside her hospital room interrupting his vigil only for a trip 
downtown to give investigators an account of his activities the 
night of april 21 
he said hed spent the evening doing research at southern 
methodist university libraries returning home about 1240 am he 
said he noticed that a door to the darkened twocar garage was 
partly open 
driving inside with his headlights on he found his wife lying on 
the floor writhing in convulsions her face was puffy and 
discolored and she was frothing at the mouth 
he said the children ryan 5 and megan 2 were inside the 
house and unharmed 
following the interview capt john holt 37 the tall 
sandyhaired supervisor of crimes against persons told reporters 
the questioning was routine 
we dont have any indicators that would point to him as a 
suspect he said 
railey returned to the hospital to arrange for a suite near his 
wife he spent the day greeting a parade of visitors who expressed 
shock sorrow and support 
among those who came to share their grief that day was a striking 
frosted blonde who carried a single red rose and disappeared into 
raileys hospital suite

with the investigation in full swing and the fbi trying to

hes just numb hes overwhelmed by it said ralph 
shannon a longtime church member 
if railey was silent his ministerial colleagues were not 
rabbi joseph ofseyer of congregation shearith israel said railey 
had suffered for his message of justice and equality but that the 
religious community would not be cowed into silence and permit 
such a person to stand alone 
almost lost or overlooked in the outcry was an observation by 
police lt ron waldrop that the abusive letters appeared to be the 
work of one individual and not the concerted effort of a white 
supremacist group 
theres no central theme he added 
a short time later the fbi determined that the death threats had 
been written on an office typewriter at first methodist

walker raileys rise to clerical prominence seemed almost 
preordained from his turbulent childhood days in owensboro ky a 
coal mining town on the south bank of the ohio river 
the oldest of three children railey grew up a nonsmoker and 
nondrinker who delivered his first sermon at age 17 and became 
something of a circuit preacher while a history major at western 
kentucky university 
he attended vanderbilt divinity school for a year then headed to 
dallas and the perkins theological seminary at smu 
it was there in 1970 that he met margaret nicolai an equally 
talented intelligent and religiously dedicated young musician whom 
everyone called peggy she had arrived at smu from wisconsin to 
pursue a masters degree in organ music 
acquaintances say peggy recognized early on that young walker was 
a man with great ambition and potential but that she was not much 
taken with him romantically his persistence won her over and the 
couple was married in august 1971 
after obtaining a doctor of ministry in 1973 railey ministered 
to several rural churches in oklahoma and then was appointed an 
associate pastor at first methodist in dallas in 1980 after a 
stint as a senior minister at a suburban dallas church he returned 
to first methodist as senior pastor at age 33 
the appointment was the most dramatic step in a meteoric rise 
while not even the largest methodist church in dallas first 
methodist had the reputation as the nations mother church of 
methodism in no small part because eight of its ministers had gone 
on to become bishops 
under raileys leadership first methodist grew and prospered 
its membership approaching 6000 and its annual budget doubling to 
2 million and while railey himself was short balding and 
physically unimposing his radiant ministry served as a magnet for 
the young energetic and socially conscious while not alienating 
older more conservative parishioners 
he spoke out boldly against those who practiced or condoned 
racial intolerance he clashed with a city council member over what 
he perceived to be a racist stance on illegal aliens 
he challenged president reagan to take a more visible and 
articulate stand for peace and he once said of fundamentalist 
jerry falwell i guarantee he doesnt speak for the kingdom of 
god let alone the people in it 
when the threats came the raileys seemed to take them in stride 
the fbi encouraged mrs railey and the children to leave town for a 
while although she went to her parents home for four days she did 
not seem overly concerned 
diane yarrington wife of first methodists minister of music and 
one of peggy raileys closest friends said peggy told her she and 
walker were taking precautions but that they refused to be 
intimidated 
long before the attack the yarringtons and raileys pledged to 
care for one anothers children in the event of tragedy 
that pledge would soon come due

<TEXT>
as railey and his wife lay near death in the same intensive care 
unit police were anxious to talk again with first methodists 
senior pastor after his first interview police found unspecified 
inconsistencies in raileys account of april 21 
friends in the church hired a tough nononsense criminal defense 
attorney named doug mulder to advise railey and as the minister 
recovered he wasnt talking to police 
he did however speak with reporters 
to be honest with you i just dont know anything he told 
a veteran religion reporter 
later he told the associated press 
i didnt attack my wife i didnt plan to have someone attack 
my wife i didnt orchestrate a plan to attack my wife and if i had 
written the letters i wouldnt have written them on a typewriter in 
the church 
but i didnt write them 
he could not rationalize his suicide attempt which he knew was 
construed by some as an admission of guilt 
i dont understand why i did it anymore than i understand why 
i lived beyond it 
by this time doctors had removed mrs raileys respirator and 
she was now breathing on her own she was not comatose as such but 
in what doctors described as a vegetative state appearing to 
have sleepandwake cycles and respond to sound and pain 
in fact she was oblivious to her surroundings

mulder arranged for a private polygraph test which indicated 
railey did not try to kill his wife presumably because of those 
results mulder approved a policeadministered examination the next 
day that exercise was described as inconclusive 
the results showed that he didnt have anything to do with the 
attack nor did he conspire with anyone said mulder 
though raileys followers took new heart investigators were 
unimpressed and restated the ongoing request to interview him 
holt accused mulder of misrepresenting the outcome of the 
policeadministered examination he suggested that some of raileys 
responses were untruthful but refused to elaborate 
all but overlooked in the flap over the polygraphs was an 
unattributed police statement that raileys account of his 
activities the night of april 21 was in direct conflict with 
indisputable evidence 
the key word was indisputable

papillon grew up in the magnificent sanctuary the daughter of the 
rev robert e goodrich jr a former senior pastor and later a 
methodist bishop 
a portrait of goodrich who died in 1985 hangs in the first 
methodist foyer 
she had that knotted goodrich chin his thin drawn smile and 
the dark eyes that were his most distinctive feature eyes that 
seemed remote but also searching and intelligent journalist larry 
wright a childhood acquaintance wrote in texas monthly 
it was a strong face like her fathers and if in some lights 
it appeared hard in others you could detect a vulnerable and even 
wounded soul who had lived past the point where life surprised her 
as a youngster lucy played the piano in sunday school and was a 
cheerleader at an exclusive girls school she entered southern 
methodist university in 1959 to pursue a degree in music education 
and four years later married a methodist preacher 
they were divorced in 1973 after she bore two sons 
friends say she worked at a variety of jobs including a stint as 
a parttime model somewhere along the way she became enamored with 
psychology she married and divorced again and in 1982 received a 
doctorate in psychology and moved to california to complete her 
training she found various jobs in her new field there and 
reportedly began to visit the esalen commune 
and it was there that lucy decided to take on her identity as 
papillon french for butterfly in 1986 she opened a private 
psychology practice in dallas and legally changed her name to lucy

on july 14 1987 dallas countys chief prosecutor sat down with 
police and the fbi and heard for the first time all the facts of the 
case 
his face flushed with anger his thick mustache almost bristling 
norm kinne 53 stormed from the meeting room into a cluster of 
reporters and challenged walker railey as one headline proclaimed 
to talk or walk 
eyes flashing and his finger jabbing at the nearest of four 
television cameras kinne declared 
im tired of this man fooling with the justice system and the 
life of his wife im going to tell you walker railey im 
tired of you messing with the dallas police department and youre 
going to come before the dallas county grand jury and youre going 
to clear up these discrepancies or youre going to leave the 
country 
kinne could subpoena railey to appear before grand jurors but he 
had no way to compel him to answer questions if he invoked the 
constitutional protection against selfincrimination nor was it in 
the fiery prosecutors domain to order a reticent railey out of the 
country 
but at that moment nobody was foolhardy enough to argue the 
issue with kinne 
later that evening a vaguely contrite kinne said it was the 
photographs of peggy railey after the attack that so outraged him 
and triggered the outburst 
i got irritated because we have a lady here who is a loving 
wife and mother and who is lying in a hospital more dead than 
alive he said and we have an alleged pillar of the community 
who will not talk to us about this 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
six days before kinnes outburst a dallas morning news story 
linked lucy papillon to the railey case calling her a potential 
reluctant witness 
the article said mobile telephone records revealed that railey 
called papillon twice the night of the attack railey had neglected 
to mention those calls in his lengthy interview with police the 
morning after april 21 
phone records also showed railey placed two calls to his own home 
between midnight and 1230 am the last one about 10 minutes 
before he reported finding his wife near death on the garage floor 
investigators refused to discuss the significance of the mobile 
phone records but it seemed safe to assume they somehow represented 
the indisputable evidence of inconsistencies in raileys story 
later on the eve of a grand jury meeting on the railey case the 
morning news reported that railey had visited papillon the night his 
wife was attacked 
inside the jury room kinne was eager to confront railey 
although he was certain the embattled minister would refuse to 
answer questions and invoke his fifth amendment rights 
he did take the fifth 43 times 
i have followed the advice of my lawyer consistently and will 
consistently do that railey remarked brusquely when he emerged 
from the closeddoor session 
papillon spent an hour before the panel and according to her 
attorney phil burleson answered every question she knew nothing 
about the attack burleson said and then cautioned reporters 
against drawing conclusions that his client was romantically linked 
with railey 
but it made no difference leaks poured out of the grand jury 
room the whispered rumors were true 
lucy papillon was walker raileys mistress 
according to those present papillon told grand jurors she first 
met railey on a religious television show and they became 
romantically involved in june 1986 about the same time she changed 
her name she said she had accompanied railey on several ministerial 
trips and had vacationed with him in california 
nor were their liaisons confined to this country papillon 
revealed that railey stopped over for a prearranged rendezvous in 
london while returning from a world methodist council meeting in 
nairobi kenya in july 1986 
in one particularly chilling disclosure lucy said they embraced 
and kissed in walkers hospital suite while peggy lay near death 
nearby

despite the sensational revelations the grand jury testimony 
raised almost as many questions as it answered and the 
indisputable evidence remained cloaked in secrecy 
we still have a lot of discrepancies but were not going to 
discuss them said police lt ron waldrop there is no statue of 
limitations on attempted murder and thats how long well be

ar at church expense only hours 
earlier as a security measure because of anonymous threats a phone 
company computer recorded the times 
railey called home at 555 pm to say he was leaving the office 
at 558 pm he telephoned papillon and talked for one minute 
arriving home shortly before 630 pm railey said he found his 
wife working on a faulty garage door lock with a bar of soap 
investigators later found no trace of soap on the lock which was 
working fine 
railey said he sat on the hood of his wifes chrysler and talked 
with her for several minutes he wasnt hungry he said and the two 
shared a glass of wine in lieu of dinner 
he told her he intended to spend the evening on a research 
project at the smu libraries he did not change from his business 
suit and left the house a little after 630 
at 638 pm railey who never wore a watch called on the car 
phone for the time 
he said he spent half an hour or so at smus bridwell library and 
was back in his car by 726 pm at which time he phoned the family 
babysitter and discussed plans for a trip to san antonio the raileys 
planned later in the week 
at 732 pm he phoned papillon at her home near smu he drove 
directly to her house where he spent the next 40 minutes 
railey told a friend later he went there to get some relaxation 
tapes to help relieve stress 
from 8 pm to 830 pm railey was back at bridwell where he 
asked a librarian what time the library closed at 830 railey 
using a pay phone called home on a private line peggy railey told 
him she was putting the children to bed she then called her parents 
long distance in tyler and talked from 849 pm until 914 pm 
at 853 pm raily bought gas at a texaco station near campus 
after drinking a wine cooler he said he returned to fondren 
library smus main library but no one saw him there until after 11 
pm 
at 930 pm a jogger in the raileys neighborhood spotted a man 
in a business suit and street shoes running through a yard south of 
the railey home between 1015 pm and 1030 pm a neighbor heard 
rustling sounds in the alley behind the home 
sometime after 11 pm a librarian saw railey at fondren upon 
leaving at midnight he attempted to give his business card to a 
student at the checkout desk on the back of the card was a message 
requesting help in finding research information railey also noted 
the time 1030 pm when in fact it was midnight the student told 
police 
at 1203 am railey called home on the car phone but this time 
he used the public line according to friends the family seldom 
answered the public line which was connected to an answering 
machine 
hi babe he said im calling you from my mobile phone 
peg its about oh i dont know i dont have a watch its 
somewhere between 1030 and 1045 somewhere along in there i 
worked at bridwell until they closed and now im going to fondren 
this could not have been true he had in fact just left fondren 
according to other accounts 
ill be in about 1 if you want to go ahead and lock the 
garage door and ill park out front it really doesnt matter to me 
at this point my concern is that youre safe 
this portion of the tape might explain why peggy railey would 
enter the garage that night even so railey would still have to 
explain why if he really intended to speak with his wife he had 
called on the public line and left a message 
twentythree minutes later railey phoned the answering machine 
again and on this occasion gave the correct time 1229 
hi babe he began its 1229 and im on the way home from 
smu everything really went well i got a lot accomplished i 
had to leave my card with the reference librarian because there was 
one deal that i couldnt quite work out im not calling on the 
private line because i know youre already asleep but in case you 
get up with the kids i just wanted you to know that im on my way 
home its 1230 ill be home about 1245 
love you byebye 
at just past 1240 railey drove into his driveway and found his 
wife 
there was no sign of a struggle there was no skin under her 
fingernails to indicate she had either fought her assailant or 
scratched herself when grasping at whatever was pulled around her 
throat 
railey said he determined that the children were safe and 
notified police 
dallas emergency ms the dispatcher answered 
this is walker railey he interrupted send the paramedics 
and police please 
an ambulance arrived along with neighbors inside the house 
both children were in the living room megan watching a silent 
television screen and ryan staring blankly ahead 
months later kinne told a reporter he thought it possible that 
ryan witnessed the attack but he said the youngster gave 
investigators inconsistent accounts of what might have happened that 
night 
maybe daddy did it the boy told investigators once

police say peggy railey was attacked between 930 
and 11 pm on april 21 1987 no one can account for her husbands 
whereabouts at that time walker railey did leave a message that 
night on the household answering machine he said it was 1030 pm 
but a phone company computer showed it was after midnight that 
merely proved he was a liar police said not a strangler the final 
of three parts examines how railey fled leaving behind his 
braincrippled wife two children and a compelling unsolved mystery 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
doctors transferred peggy railey her body alive 
but her brain barely functioning from a dallas hospital to a 
nursing home in east texas so she could be near her parents 
bill and billie jo nicolai live in tyler but they had spent 
almost all day every day in dallas about 60 miles away attending 
to peggys needs though a fullservice hospital was no longer 
required she remained in a vegetative state from which she might 
never awaken 
back in dallas no sign was posted but the raileys home was 
quietly put on the market and sold 
walker railey voluntarily surrendered his credentials as a 
minister in the united methodist church and then surrendered 
control of his wifes legal affairs to her parents he granted 
temporary custody of his children to the friends who had kept them 
since april 22 john and diane yarrington 
mrs nicolai requested a court grant her guardianship of her 
daughter and railey waived his right to continue in that 
traditionally spousal role 
and then after the stunning developments and disclosures of 
midnovember railey vanished from sight 
i know he has some job prospects said yarrington 
over the next few months railey and dallas reporters played a 
game of hideandseek 
in early december railey told religion reporter helen parmley of 
the dallas morning news in a telephone interview from california 
that he fled despair not speculation and he maintained he was not 
abandoning his children 
in this case while i am relocating looking for work 
financially strapped not knowing where im going to end up or what 
im going to be doing everybody involved in this drama believes 
the most stable loving christian environment they can be in is 
where they are he said 
but before anybody could get themselves too lathered up over 
raileys plight dallas times herald columnist laura miller put a 
new slant on the case by telling a tale of the anger and indignation 
of peggy raileys family her father and her grandmother 
both believe railey was behind the attack 
the motive a divorced man doesnt get to be bishop said the 
grandmother ella renfro

larry wright a contributing editor at texas monthly magazine 
grew up in the first united methodist church in dallas his 
childhood pastor was robert goodrich jr lucy papillons father 
he left the church once in disenchantment but had been drawn back 
by raileys socially contemporary ministry then he had seen the 
devastation at first methodist after the attack on peggy walkers 
suicide attempt and the ministers affair with lucy 
so wright was less a journalist than a confused and angry member 
of the congregation when he confronted railey 
did peggy know about his affair with lucy 
we that never came up railey stammered 
she didnt know 
i can only say it never emerged 
did she suspect 
i have no way of knowing regarding that that she suspected at 
all about anything 
changing the subject railey revealed he had slipped into the 
first methodist sanctuary to attend funeral services for a family 
friend some of his former parishioners avoided him but most 
embraced him 
they could feel my pain railey said crying he said he also 
felt love 
did you feel a sense of shame wright asked 
i felt a great need to be forgiven if thats what youre 
talking about 
wright decided that was as much of a concession as he was likely 
to get but before departing he said he could not construct an 
innocent man out of raileys behavior the journalist recounted 
raileys misleading testimony to the police his avoidance of the 
grand jury and his inexplicable actions on the night of the attack 
i think you are a guilty person said wright 
i hear what youre saying railey replied 
wright did not know what to think railey failed to absorb his 
blunt accusation choosing instead to analyze it with detachment 
im aware that nobody can sit down with all the facts that are 
supposedly known and just make it all fit thats a frustration 
that everyone has felt including me railey said 
confess wright urged him it will haunt you forever it 
will drive you crazy 
i dont know if thats a word of advice a backhand comfort or 
what said railey im not guilty i didnt do it i dont feel 
tormented by the guilt of what i didnt do

on feb 2 billie jo nicolai filed a legal bombshell in civil 
court accusing railey of maliciously attempting to kill his 
wife and orchestrating a clumsy attempt to cover his actions 
with a phony alibi 
the lawsuit sought damages for physical and mental pain 
disfigurement anguish and physical impairment on behalf of mrs 
nicolais comatose daughter 
concern over the cost of peggy raileys medical expenses was the 
overriding reason for the action but the familys decision was also 
emotional said mrs nicolais attorney bill arnold 
they are bitter he said they are angry 
ted nicolai peggys younger brother revealed that railey had 
visited his wife no more than three times and that after a christmas 
visit with his two children ryan had suffered severe emotional 
problems 
norm kinne dallas chief prosecutor had sent an investigator to 
question ryan about the night of april 21 and the youngster talked 
freely about almost everything but whenever she asked about the 
attack ryan would tune her out he would turn his back and try to 
leave the room

precisely one year after the events of april 1987 a state 
district judge ruled that walker railey intentionally knowingly 
maliciously and brutally attempted to strangle his wife and cover 
up his actions with a false alibi 
judge john whittington issued a preliminary civil judgment on 
april 22 1988 holding railey financially liable for the injuries 
to his wife the extent of damages would be determined later by a 
jury 
the ruling while significant had no bearing on the criminal 
investigation 
whittingtons action came after railey failed to respond to legal 
notices of the suit the judge said railey by his technical 
default had admitted all the allegations 
railey could no longer be found under siege from the media he 
broke the lease on the san francisco love nest he shared with 
papillon on her visits from dallas it appeared he had fled the bay 
area altogether 
the court can issue a subpoena that compels him to come answer 
my questions said arnold but today i have less of an idea 
where he is than at any time since this case started

in june doctors reported a slight improvement in peggy raileys 
condition and she was returned to dallas and placed in the baylor 
institute for rehabilitation 
dr william parker the institutes medical director said she 
could turn her head and hear but could not process what she heard 
if we can establish anything that seems to stimulate a response 
that could be interpreted as functional then we would continue to 
try through repetition to improve on that he said 
parker said he didnt think his team of specialists would be able 
to determine whether peggy railey would ever communicate again 
i think the odds are probably going to be against it but time 
is the only thing thats going to tell he said 
after more than a year in a vegetative state doctors downgraded 
her condition to a persistent vegetative state meaning as a 
neurosurgeon explained that her chances for recovery were nil 
after two months in dallas she was quietly returned to the 
nursing home in tyler where her parents resumed their tender but 
apparently hopeless daily care

norm kinne sat puffing his pipe in the district attorneys office 
and reflecting on the railey case his opinions no less candid than 
when he first viewed the terrible pictures of peggy raileys wounds 
this guys a liar said kinne hes trying to cover his 
tracks he wasnt where he was at the time he says he was now the 
question is if he wasnt there where was he 
the conclusion that everybodys drawn is that he was home 
choking out his wife 
but that doesnt necessarily follow theres no proof he was at 
the scene at the time she was strangled theres no evidence that he 
strangled her or that he knew who strangled her or that he arranged 
or participated in any way 
thats not to say kinne didnt think about prosecuting walker 
railey he visualized presenting all the evidence that showed railey 
lied that he contrived an alibi and that he told no one of visiting 
his girlfriend that night 
but with a defense move for an instructed verdict of innocent 
the judge might ask where is the evidence that he choked his 
wife kinne said 
the trial would probably be over before it began 
as 1988 drew to an end kinne had not surrendered hope the case 
might some day be solved but any possibility was a long shot peggy 
railey might miraculously recover and identify her assailant or 
even young ryan railey might have seen something and be able to talk 
about it 
lucy papillon might eventually shed light on the case but kinne 
once pointed out that she had said nothing incriminating since we 
dont have adultery laws anymore 
for kinne walker railey remained the ultimate enigma 
the last thing youd expect from a guy like him would be to 
give up his wife and kids and flit off to california just say to 
hell with it and take off its just not what youd expect from a 
man of his stature 
it gives every indication of guilt whether he is guilty or 
not

on dec 5 judge whittington heard testimony in a oneday trial 
to determine if walker railey should pay damages to the nicolai 
family railey didnt show up 
the family was awarded 16 million half to cover her care half 
to punish railey it was a ruling more of symbolism than substance 
a hollow victory 
arnold said he didnt know where railey was or how much money he 
had he doubted his wifes family would ever collect the 16 million 
on videotape the court watched therapists treating peggy railey 
who has virtually no body control and a haunting lifeless look in 
her eyes 
still her sisterinlaw linda nicolai told of an experience at 
the hospital one day that suggested the depth of peggy raileys 
anguish 
as they guided her wheelchair down the hall they passed a man 
exercising with a cord similar to what police believe was used to 
choke peggy 
the witness said peggy railey began sweating hyperventilating 
and rubbing her arms together mrs nicolai added 
she kept looking at me with this wild look on her face and 
trying to tell me something

if any farmers believed at the beginning of the 
year that they were standing alone against the elements and 
marauding wolves they might have had some change of opinion by now 
weather along with time is the great leveler in agriculture 
when its good bellies are full and prosperity reigns and when 
its bad there is hunger and moneylenders start knocking at the 
door 
the 1988 drought hurt thousands of farmers but helped thousands 
of others by draining off surpluses and driving up commodity prices 
grain bins full of corn and soybeans from previous crops were sudden 
treasures 
but there were farmers whose crops were destroyed and who were 
left with nothing not even last years inventories to sell at the 
higher prices the agriculture department has said repeatedly some 
have failed 
congress ordered vast federal aid to droughtstricken farmers 
and existing usda programs were swollen by those seeking relief 
effects of the drought particularly its impact on the livestock 
sector may continue for years to some degree 
the drought as with any weather pattern was beyond the control 
of farmers 
clark edwards of the departments economic research service says 
farmers continue to move away from that ancient ideal of 
selfsufficiency that once epitomized american agriculture or at 
least was a dream of many 
edwards writing in the december issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine said farmers today buy most of the items they need to 
produce crops and livestock they buy these inputs and sell what 
they produce 
this makes them dependent on the economic decisions of 
others he said and the opening of the export markets over the 
last two decades makes farms more dependent on public and private 
decisions made around the world farms nowadays are far from 
selfsufficient 
take the transportation systems barge rail and truck that 
move inputs to the farm and products to the marketplace those rely 
heavily on the federal government 
this summer when barge traffic came to a standstill on the 
mississippi the army corps of engineers helped keep products moving 
by dredging the river edwards said one result was that prices 
at the farm were higher and prices at ports were lower than they 
would have been if the river had stayed unnavigable 
another example of forces beyond the control of farmers was the 
soviet unions decision to increase the protein content of livestock 
feed by importing more soybean meal that expanded the market for 
us soybean producers 
but decisions by south american soybean farmers to increase 
plantings after the us drought keep prices from rising as much as 
they would have edwards said decisions by governments to 
promote exports and control imports through trade regulations 
tariffs quotas subsidies embargoes and other border policies have 
made world trade a labyrinth 
he added easy money policies by the government keep the cost 
of borrowing lower and by keeping exchange rates lower expand the 
market for farm products but they do so at the risk of faster 
inflation 
other credit policies by the government also directly or 
indirectly affect farm income prices received by farmers are 
affected by federal price support programs marketing orders 
contracts and other arrangements between farmers and public or 
private agencies 
farmers often taken for granted institutional arrangements 
affecting their incomes including the availability of resources 
such as grazing rights or irrigation water utilities such as 
electricity public schools for their children public research on 
new technology private property rights and even such amenities as 
clean air and a milliondollar view edwards said 
the success of a farmer may depend on the individuals choices 
and actions although circumstances can dictate failure he said on 
the other hand unforeseen circumstances may bring windfall gains 
this is not to say the farmer is passive edwards said 
success depends on plans made and action taken on the 
availability of resources and management the problem is one of 
balance how much outside influence does a farmer need or want 
producers cant make it by being completely selfcontained nor by 
putting all their trust in neighbors and the country

the christmas tree lay toppled on its 
side lights still strung through brown and brittle needles almost a 
year later 
blood still stains the floor and walls and a grave its earthen 
bed littered with leaves gapes in the yard 
the desolate house on broomfield road its windows broken and 
door swinging in the wind still testifies to a murder rampage that 
wiped out a family 
on dec 28 1987 authorities arrested r gene simmons after a 
45minute shooting spree that killed two people and wounded four in 
nearby russellville officers then uncovered 14 bodies in and around 
simmons house 
one or two cars stop every week and the folks ask for 
directions to the simmons place said william brown who runs a 
grocery store people want to see it lots of people come by 
other than that life is still just about the same as before 
but a family is gone found dead at the house were simmons wife 
becky 46 his three sons and four daughters two of their spouses 
and four grandchildren including a 6yearold girl authorities said 
he probably fathered through his daughter sheila 
simmons 48 still faces trial in the slayings of his family but 
was sentenced to death last may for the killings in russellville he 
stunned the courtroom by renouncing any appeals and requesting a 
speedy execution 
let the torture and suffering in me end he pleaded please 
allow me to be at peace 
even now the authorities say they have not determined simmons 
motive 
the unopened christmas presents found under the tree indicated 
the slayings probably started dec 24 or even earlier pope county 
sheriff jim bolin says 
five bodies some in overcoats were found in the house 
probably killed as they arrived for the holidays seven others some 
clad in nightclothes were splashed with kerosene and covered with 
dirt in a grave authorities believe was dug before the killings the 
bodies of two grandsons both 1 year old lay in dark green plastic 
garbage bags in the trunks of abandoned cars 
six had been shot with a 22caliber pistol one of them seven 
times and eight were strangled with cord 
simmons has never indicated a motive but before he was taken 
into custody at a trucking company where he wounded his former 
supervisor he told a hostage ive gotten everybody who wanted to 
hurt me 
one of the people killed in russellville was a 24yearold law 
office receptionist who reportedly rejected simmons romantic 
overtures 
investigators also point to a fourpage letter written by his 
wife and sent the summer before to their son william h simmons ii 
who was slain along with his wife renata and their yearold son 
i am a prisoner here and the kids too she wrotei dont 
want to live the rest of my life with dad i know it would be 
great having my children visit me anytime having a telephone 
going shopping if i want going to church everytime i think of 
freedom i want out as soon as possible 
simmons attempted to control family members by censoring their 
mail restricting visitors and discouraging his wife and daughters 
from wearing makeup authorities say the telephone heat and air 
conditioning never worked and the family apparently used two nearby 
outhouses because the toilet was broken 
simmons 17yearold daughter loretta confided to friends she 
was depressed about living there and relatives said mrs simmons 
wanted to leave but feared financial problems and retaliation from 
her husband 
after receiving the death sentence simmons urged that no one try 
to delay deny defer or denounce this very correct and proper 
death sentence 
but the rev louis franz a roman catholic priest from star city 
and a foe of the death penalty intervened on his own 
judge john s patterson had set a june 27 execution date and the 
arkansas courts ruled simmons was competent to waive his appeals 
but franzs intervention has tied the case up in federal court 
that disappoints prosecutor john bynum survivors of the 
shootings and even simmons courtappointed attorneys 
i believe in the death penalty without any apology in certain 
cases bynum said this is one of them mr simmons doesnt 
deserve to live 
simmons lawyers john c harris and robert e irwin said their 
client wanted the death penalty from the start and restricted the 
defense they could present 
every lawyers goal should be to get what a client wants so 
long as its legal and ethical to do so harris said had it 
been carried out june 27 at 11 am we would have been on to doing 
other things which would have been better for our client the 
alleged victims in these crimes this community the taxpayers and 
everybody involved in this case 
david salyer whose forehead bears a thin horizontal seam where 
he was hit by a bullet from one of simmons two 9shot 22caliber 
revolvers is bitter about the delay 
for the lawyers its all a game said salyer who runs the 
sinclair minimart where simmons worked until 10 days before the 
shootings and one of his stops during the rampage 
salyer says he ran up 15000 in medical bills and lost business 
because he had to close the store for two weeks 
since the slayings the house and the almost 14 acres simmons was 
buying have gone into foreclosure and reverted to the former owners 
the house is strewn with clothes books food and other articles 
furniture is turned topsyturvy and blood still stains the walls 
floor and a mattress a handmade sign reading knock before 
entering and a dozen smurfs decals decorate the door to the one of 
the childrens rooms 
the christmas tree lay in a corner of the living room until 
someone took it about a week ago 
the walls are scarred by the writings of vandals at halloween a 
group of area teenagers held a seance there sheriffs deputy jim 
hollabaugh said 
they didnt need a lot of encouragement to leave he said 
they were trying to scare each other and they were looking for a 
reason to leave 
irwin has handled the disposition of the family possessions some 
of which the lawyers have taken as part of their compensation the 
unopened christmas presents were given to the few remaining 
relatives 
at the pleasant grove assembly of god church the congregation 
rejoices each sunday to music played on the simmons family piano a 
member of the church bought the piano and some dishware for 250 
said the churchs pastor the rev lb french 
we got it tuned he said it plays real good this suits 
the purpose as well as a new one 
in dover the small town between pleasant grove and russellville 
where the simmons children attended school mayor george boyd said 
the town hasnt been affected much by the slayings 
the children talk about it some but it hasnt basically 
changed anything about dover boyd said this fellow just kept 
to himself nobody really knew those folks

for israel 1988 began with the surprise of a 
spreading palestinian revolt against occupation and ended with the 
shock of seeing its best friend the united states start a dialogue 
with the plo its most hated enemy 
the parliament elections nov 1 gave prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc a slight edge but neither shamir nor 
foreign minister shimon peres labor party won a clear mandate for 
dealing with the palestinian problem 
by dec 21 the two rival groups were driven back into each 
others arms agreeing to form a national unity government under 
shamir a broadbased coalition similar to the one that had governed 
israel since 1984 
but critics contended the likudlabor union would deadlock over 
the peace process 
peres had supported arab calls for an international peace 
conference at which israel would be prepared to give up occupied 
land in exchange for a peace agreement 
shamir opposed both ideas and instead supported a new campaign of 
jewish settlement building in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
where 70000 jews live with 17 million arabs 
israels relations with jews in europe and the united states were 
also weakened by a sudden upsurge of fundamentalist religious 
parties they won 18 seats in the 120seat knesset or parliament 
and held a balance of power between labor and likud 
delegation after delegation of jews arrived to tell shamir that 
israel could suffer the loss of aid and political support if he gave 
in to extremist demands for socalled who is a jew legislation 
the legislation which would give orthodox rabbis exclusive 
control over conversions to judaism was seen as a slap in the face 
to the nonorthodox who constitute the vast majority of jews abroad 
the threatened loss of support couldnt have come at a worse time 
the united states which gives israel 3 billion a year in 
economic and military aid ended a 13year boycott and opened a 
dialogue with the palestine liberation organization on dec 16 
after chairman yasser arafat said the plo had renounced terrorism 
and recognized israels right to exist 
the american decision to seek a dialogue with the plo is seen 
here as some sort of betrayal said eytan gilboa an international 
relations expert at hebrew university in jerusalem 
in the occupied territories it was a year of bloodshed more 
than 330 palestinians and 13 israelis were killed in the continuing 
uprising which shook israel out of complacency with the status quo 
in the occupied lands 
it prepared the ground for mainstream politicians in the labor 
party to join leftists in proposing talks with the plo among the 
supporters were ezer weizman former defense minister and exhead of 
israels air force and mordechai gur a former armed forces chief 
of staff 
the israeli consensus on whether to negotiate with the plo has 
been broken by the us decision some in israel are demanding a 
rethinking of policy regarding negotiations with the plo said 
shlomo avineri exdirector general of israels foreign ministry 
the uprising also changed the lives of palestinians upsetting a 
traditional system in which major decisions were taken by village 
elders and the heads of clans or extended families 
sons defied fathers and underground committees of young 
palestinian activists bypassed arab mayors village chiefs and even 
plobacked associations to set the agenda for the uprising

a squeeze on a futures trader who was caught

the january contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark

the previous session 
one major trader who was caught short had to buy january 
contracts on the final day to close out a position said peter 
beutel assistant director of the energy group at elders futures inc 
traders who are short have sold borrowed contracts as a bet that 
the price will fall and they will be able to repay their debt with 
contracts bought at the cheaper price 
but in a classic short squeeze tuesday the trader was forced to 
pay exorbitant prices to get anyone to sell said another trader 
jack unger of merrill lynch energy futures 
there were conflicting reports about the identity of the trader 
or traders who were caught short any trader who is still short when 
the contract expires must make delivery of actual oil to the holder

zenith electronics corps chairman says the 
company soon will ask the government to invoke a neverused law to 
monitor imports of televisions from countries suspected of 
dumping the sets in the united states at unfairly low prices 
jerry pearlman zeniths chairman and president unveiled the 
plan tuesday in a telephone interview he called it a major part of 
the companys plan for getting back to steady profitability 
a new yorkbased investment partnership earlier this month 
dropped its efforts to throw pearlman off the board of directors and 
get the glenview illbased company to sell its moneylosing 
television business 
zeniths request to the government will be aimed at cutting off 
illegal dumping of inexpensive tvs from malaysia hong kong 
china mexico singapore thailand and the philippines not just 
the traditional sources of japan taiwan and south korea pearlman 
said 
zenith the last major usbased television manufacturer has 
not had an annual profit since 1984 largely because of fierce 
competition from cheap imports 
zenith will seek protection under 1984 legislation that allows 
the commerce department to monitor imports of products from new 
countries where dumping is suspected it can only do so if there is 
an antidumping order in place against more than one country already 
dumping is the sale of products in foreign markets at unfairly 
low prices to get rid of excess production or to force competitors 
out of business 
the legislation permits the commerce department to initiate its 
own antidumping action against the new countries if the agency 
finds evidence of dumping 
i hope to file it the petition soon pearlman said 
in washington commerce department spokeswoman claire buchan said 
the department had received only one request for protection under 
the 1984 legislation and action on it had been deferred until next 
year that concerned imports of brass sheets and strips 
she said she could not comment on zeniths petition before it had 
been received and studied 
brookhurst partners the new yorkbased challenger to pearlman 
had sought shareholder support for its proposal to force zenith to 
sell its moneylosing consumer electronics business or if that 
proved impossible to find a buyer for the whole company 
it dropped the shareholder solicitation on dec 2 shortly before 
votes were to be counted saying it was satisfied zenith was headed 
in the right direction 
although the pressure from brookhurst is off pearlman said 
were not going to relax in efforts to improve zeniths 
profitability the company has a profitable line of personal 
computers but its overall results have been depressed by losses in 
televisions 
pearlman said he expected the company to meet the goal stated in 
october of a pretax profit for 1988 but he indicated it would be 
close and said taxes could push net results into the red 
pearlman said he is optimistic about zeniths chances in the 
field of highdefinition television the next generation of tvs that 
will have sharper brighter pictures zenith has proposed a standard 
for hdtv transmission that if selected by the government would 
produce royalties for zenith 
also zenith has developed a sharp rugged kind of picture tube 
called flat tension mask that pearlman said would be ideally suited 
for commercial or military use but he said the cashstrapped 
company needs government money to make the screens bigger and build 
a plant to make them 
in a sign that money for zenith may be forthcoming the pentagon 
on monday said it would solicit proposals in the next two or three 
weeks in the areas of highdefinition lowcost display technology 
 
on other issues pearlman said 
the company is benefiting from strong demand and tight supplies 
of televisions and picture tubes zenith is turning down some orders 
for picture tubes from other tv makers even while running its 
picture tube plant around the clock seven days a week 
tv prices remain depressed but zenith recently announced 
increases of 1 percent to 2 percent to its wholesalers effective 
jan 1 if zenith and other companies can make the new prices stick 
there will be further increases in 1989 
pearlman said the new problem in dumping is that traditional 
competitors blocked from dumping tvs shipped from their home 
countries are opening plants in other countries and dumping tvs made 
there 
in 1984 he said about 80 percent of imported tvs came from 
japan south korea or taiwan in 1988 that was down to 47 percent 
he said 
what youve got here is the classic water balloon the 
government has stepped down in one part and its popped up in 
another part because the foot hasnt been as big as the balloon 
he said 
there are antidumping provisions for tv sets in place against 
japan south korea and taiwan and antidumping provisions for 
picture tubes against those three countries plus singapore and 
canada

companies in japan taiwan and south korea are 
taking over the us market for small business phone equipment by 
charging unfairly low prices for phone gear shipped here american 
telephone amp telegraph co says 
unfair competition has allowed the foreign companies to increase 
their share of the 4 billionayear us market to 60 percent from 
40 percent over three years atampt said tuesday as it announced its 
firstever dumping accusation 
our investigation showed a very clear picture of not just 
smallscale dumping but massive dumping ja blanchard an atampt 
executive said in a telephone interview 
the companies prices in their home markets averaged more than 75 
percent higher and in one case were 170 percent higher than in the 
united states atampt said 
the equipment at issue is for small businesses with two to 80 
phone lines and consists of phones and switches the two major types 
are known as key systems and private branch exchanges or pbxs 
it is illegal under us law for foreign companies to sell 
products in the us market for less than they sell them at home 
regardless of the motivation 
one obvious possible explanation for the dumping is if you 
can sell it for twice as much in the home market then you can grow 
your market share abroad blanchard said 
atampt accused more than a dozen manufacturers that sell products 
under more than 17 brand names among those accused were giants such 
as japans toshiba corp and matsushita electric industrial co ltd 
spokesmen in the united states for both of those companies declined 
to comment saying they did not have enough information about the 
allegations 
blanchard said that while the foreign companies were increasing 
their market share over the past three years the share of us 
manufacturers fll to 35 percent from 55 percent 
we decided we were simply not going to let that continue 
blanchard said 
the petition will be filed dec 28 with the commerce department 
atampt said 
the commerce department has 20 days from the filing date to 
decide whether atampts dumping claims merit investigation if it 
does the international trade commission will begin a separate 
investigation to determine whether the alleged dumping has harmed 
the us industry it should make its preliminary determination 
within 45 days 
final determinations and the possible imposition of dumping 
duties would occur in about a year 
in addition to matsushita and toshiba the other japanese 
companies named by atampt were hasegawa iwatsu meisei nakayo 
nitsuko and tamura 
also named were south koreas goldstar opc and samsung and 
taiwans sun moon star

although it posted a 671 million profit for 
the first nine months of 1988 honeywell inc says it faces a 
surprise loss of more than 400 million for the full year largely 
due to charges for tax expenses and streamlining costs 
honeywell on tuesday also said it would cut 1200 of its 
79000employee worldwide workforce as part of a plan to trim costs 
and increase the defense contractor and building controls makers 
competitiveness 
unusual tax expenses are responsible for about 300 million of 
the projected annual loss honeywell said tuesday 
there had been no indication earlier there would be a loss for 
the year said susan eich a honeywell spokeswoman 
honeywell posted a profit of 254 million on sales of 67 
billion last year 
honeywell announced the expected 1988 loss after the stock market 
closed tuesday in composite new york stock exchange trading 
honeywell stock was down 62 cents tuesday to 5962 
honeywell also said tuesday that james j renier president and 
chief executive officer will replace retiring chairman edson w 
spencer renier 58 who joined honeywell in 1956 as a senior 
research scientist was appointed president and chief executive in 
october 1987 
spencer 62 will remain on the companys board of directors 
mike hamilton an analyst for piper jaffray amp hopwood in 
minneapolis said he had been projecting a breakeven fourth quarter 
for honeywell after the company posted its ninemonth profit of 
158 a share but after tuesdays announcement he has revised his 
projection to a fourth quarter loss of 480 million 
its obviously a fairly messy situation at this stage to put it 
mildly hamilton said its clear from reniers comments that 
they have just taken the posture of blowing all ballast here in 
1988 theyre taking charges wherever they can do so 
tax expenses will account for about 300 million in losses for 
the fourth quarter the company said other charges are related to a 
restructuring of its solid state electronics division a loss of 
some defense contracts and early retirement and severance costs 
related to the 1200person workforce reduction 
in a news release renier said the company had a core of 
profitable businesses where earnings had been exceeded by a series 
of unusual charges however achieving our longterm financial 
goals would have been unacceptably delayed without these aggressive 
actions to improve operations he said 
the principal tax expense results from honeywells inability to 
assume tax benefits this year for operational writeoffs where actual 
expenses will occur in the future the company said for example 
honeywell wont be able to realize a tax benefit for a 
fourthquarter restructuring of its integrated computer circuits 
business 
the restructuring which included the november sale of its 
colorado springs colo merchant semiconductor operation reflects 
honeywells retreat from computer manufacturing that strategy 
includes an anticipated reduction of honeywells interest in 
honeywell bull inc the information systems company it formed with 
japans nec corp and frances bull group renier said 
eich said the job cuts were part of a program to reduce costs and 
enhance competitiveness about 60 percent of the reduction will be 
made through early retirements and severance agreements that will 
add to fourth quarter costs she said 
its very decentralized and its being implemented now eich 
said of the cuts which will include involuntary layoffs 
other factors in the huge fourthquarter loss will be the loss of 
military contracts in certain space and aviation businesses that 
honeywell will sell eich said

a sweetened 5775 million takeover bid by high 
voltage engineering corp failed to win support of the universal 
foods inc directors who have rejected the offer and urged 
shareholders to do the same 
a news release issued by the milwaukeebased universal foods said 
the board concluded tuesday that it is not in the best longterm 
interests of the shareholders or the companys other constituencies 
to sell or dismember this growing enterprise 
the 35 a share offer by high voltage expires at midnight dec 30 
universals stock declined 37 cents to 3562 a share tuesday 
on the new york stock exchange 
high voltage based in burlington mass is jointly owned by new 
yorkbased investors clifford press and laurence levy and sampw 
berisford plc a british food conglomerate 
the group sweetened the offer last week from its initial 3050 a 
share bid that universal rejected earlier this month the sweetened 
bid values universals 165 million outstanding common shares at 
5775 million 
john l murray universal chairman said the latest offer 
involved too many financial risks 
the highly leveraged transaction proposed by high voltage 
engineering risks crippling the companys expansion and causing 
drastic cuts in our research expenditures and capital investment 
program he said 
murray said that high voltage which is already highly 
leveraged was proposing to finance the offer through a newly 
created subsidiary with less than 10 million of its own funds 
levy said murray was incorrect and that his group was committing 
a total of 195 million to the buyout of universal foods levy also 
argued that universals stock would at best be trading in the 
mid20 range if high voltage had not made the tender offer 
we believe we have created for shareholders of universal value 
of approximately 170 million levy said 
guy a osborne president and chief executive officer of 
universal said he expected upcoming results for the first quarter 
of 1989 to confirm his companys accelerating growth rate 
universal is a maker of food colors and flavors yeast products 
frozen potatoes and italianstyle cheeses 
the company announced monday it was acquiring imperial flavors 
inc of winter haven fla a borden inc subsidiary which 
manufactures and sells flavorings and other ingredients to the

farmers will not be able to shrug off quickly 
the fierce effects of the 1988 drought that cut deeply into us and 
global stockpiles although the agriculture department says the 
situation may be improved a year from now 
but that depends on the weather returning to normal and providing 
enough precipitation in the next few months to replenish the deep 
soil moisture losses of 1988 
drought in the united states and canada lowered world crop 
production by more than 6 percent the departments economic 
research service said tuesday 
crop prices will continue to reflect these smaller supplies 
early in 1989 the agency said in a new outlook report but 
expanded output is likely in the second half stopping the drawdown 
in stocks 
meanwhile world supplies of animal products will remain large 
enough to dampen increases in livestock prices however the demand 
for both crop and animal products is expected to be bolstered by 
continued world economic expansion and population growth 
the agency stuck to an earlier estimate that the net cash income 
of us farmers in 1989 is likely to be in the range of 48 billion 
to 52 billion down from this years recordtying estimate of 57 
billion 
firm prices for most commodities and larger production will 
mean total farm receipts slightly above the 1988 record the 
report said cash expenses are expected to rise moderately with 
expanded acreage and costlier inputs production items direct 
government payments to farmers are likely to fall onefifth 
as used by the agency net cash income is the amount of money 
farmers have to spend during a calendar year and is the difference 
between gross cash income and cash expenses for example 1988 sales 
of grain stored from harvests in earlier years are counted as part 
of the current gross 
in another method of bookkeeping the agency measures net farm 
income for the year not simply the cashin cashout system 
involved in net cash income 
this method includes changes in the value of farm inventories 
and allowances are made for nonmoney items such as 
depreciation the family consumption of farmgrown food and the net 
rental value of dwellings 
net farm income for 1989 is forecast at 44 billion to 48 
billion compared with the estimate of 39 billion this year

the agriculture department says the soviet 
union has bought an additional 750000 metric tons of us corn for 
delivery under a recently extended supply agreement between the two 
countries but it has backed out of a soybean deal 
the corn purchase announced tuesday was the second this week 
matching an order for 750000 tons disclosed monday 
but the news was tempered by usdas announcement of the 
cancellation of the sale of 200000 tons of soybean meal that had 
been scheduled for delivery to the soviet union in 198889 no 
explanation was given but officials said conflicts in shipping 
schedules or price disagreements have been behind such cancellations 
in the past 
the latest sales brought total corn sold to the soviets to more 
than 703 million tons in the agreements sixth year which began 
oct 1 last year us corn sales to the soviet union totaled 
slightly less than 52 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 750000 tons of 
corn would be about 295 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 258 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 76 million 
although no wheat has yet been sold for 198889 delivery under 
the pact the soviets have ordered 500000 tons of soybeans and 
635000 tons of soybean meal plus 500000 tons of grain sorghum 
the united states and the soviet union on nov 28 signed an 
extension of the previous fiveyear grain agreement which had 
expired sept 30 the extension of the previous pact will run 
through dec 31 1990 
under terms of the agreement the soviet union is committed to 
buy at least 9 million tons of us grain annually including a 
minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn 
the soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million 
tons as wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting as 
two tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain

britains racy tabloids hit by huge libel awards 
to pop star elton john novelist jeffrey archer and prince andrews 
exgirlfriend koo stark face a new hazard a proposed law to curb 
intrusions into private lives 
but even those who believe the protection of privacy bill is 
unworkable or undermines press freedom acknowledge that some 
newspapers have gone a headline too far with some of their stories 
the bill sponsored as a nongovernment measure by a legislator 
john browne of the governing conservative party is likely to be 
debated in january 
it would copy some western european countries in giving all 
citizens a legal right to privacy and complement libel laws by 
allowing actions for damages for breaches a newspaper will have to 
show its disclosures were for the public benefit 
an englishmans home is his castle said browne 50 im 
seeking to put some water in the moat 
similar bills put forward without government support have failed 
to get to the vote but in todays seemingly more hostile climate 
toward the press experts say brownes bill stands a reasonable 
chance of becoming law 
another measure that may come before parliament would oblige 
newspapers to publish a wronged persons rebuttal 
politicians by and large are always very happy to legislate 
against the press because they like to control it said tony 
loynes editor of uk press gazette a trade weekly but weve 
played into their hands theres no question of that 
loynes said brownes bill may place yet another impediment before 
journalists on top of the official secrecy shrouding many matters of 
state 
journalists already suffer enough inhibitions to proper 
journalistic inquiry loynes added in an interview it is going 
to be extremely costly in the future 
it already is 
the 42 million circulation sun britains topselling daily 
this month paid a 182 million to pop star elton john who sued it 
for publishing allegations about his private life they settled out 
of court with the sun admitting the allegations were wholly false 
last month a jury ordered another newspaper the people to pay 
american actress koo stark about 546000 for falsely implying she 
had resumed her relationship with prince andrew in 1985 a year 
after she married 
she also collected apologies and undisclosed damages from the 
news of the world daily mirror and sunday mirror all tabloids 
that repeated the story 
the previous biggest libel award was about 800000 against the 
tabloid star over a story last year that novelist jeffrey archer 
gave money to a prostitute he said he had never met her 
weve gone too far and i include myself in that lloyd 
turner star editor at the time said recently 
turner edited a new daily tabloid the post which publisher eddy 
shah billed as the one with breeze without sleaze it went bust 
this month after just 33 issues and sales that seldom topped 100000 
the six daily tabloids circulating nationally sell a total of 
123 million copies 
critics see a disproportion between libel awards and accident 
awards the big libel sums usually go to the rich who can afford the 
legal costs while a recent award to a schoolboy run over by a bus 
and confined to a wheelchair came to only about 105600 
browne acknowledged difficulties in defining privacy but recent 
cases frequently cited by proprivacy advocates include english 
cricket captain mike gatting dismissed after tabloid revelations 
that he met a barmaid in his hotel room and prince andrews 
fatherinlaw maj ronald ferguson who had to quit as secretary of 
prince charles polo club over stories that he frequented a massage 
parlor 
the watchdog press council which hears complaints orders 
newspapers to publish adverse judgments and they usually comply 
but it has no powers of punishment 
browne himself has made headlines by successfully suing his 
wealthy exwife for a huge alimony settlement but he insists that 
isnt the motivation for his bill 
he says his primary concern is to protect such people as families 
of hostages from the glare of the media given rough guidelines 
he says courts will decide on a case by case basis

the chinese government has uncovered about 12 
billion in illegal profits through a nationwide crackdown against 
rampant profiteering tax evasion and unauthorized price hikes among 
chinas business community a report published wednesday said 
the official economic daily jingji ribao said the state 
campaign which began in october made great achievements but 
it said results were uneven because some local leaders lacked 
authority to expose illegal activities and some companies either 
refused to audit their books or underestimated their illegal profits 
eighty percent of companies and government offices have checked 
their own books for irregularities while another 470000 officials 
have been dispatched to screen company finances the newspaper said 
the state council chinas cabinet ordered the investigation 
into such practices as profiteering from sales of scarce basic 
materials unauthorized price rises unlicensed reselling of imports 
and tax evasion 
the campaign followed the governments decision last september to 
reinstate central controls over pricing and other aspects of the 
economy and slow down the pace of marketoriented reforms the 
measures were taken to combat a badly overheated economy and an 
inflation rate of about 26 percent

nationwide personal income dipped 02 percent in 
november down from unusually high october levels caused by bonuses 
to auto workers and a surge in farm subsidy payments the government 
reported today 
the commerce department said income declined 82 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 418 trillion last month that 
followed a gain of 17 percent in october which had been the 
largest in a year 
novembers decline was the first since january when incomes 
dropped 04 percent 
meanwhile the department said that personal consumption 
spending which includes everything except interest payments on 
debt rose 06 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 332 
trillion last month after a robust 10 percent gain a month earlier 
with spending rising faster than income in november the personal 
savings rate savings as a percentage of aftertax income was 43 
percent down from 52 percent in october 
on tuesday the government released an encouraging report on 
inflation and that helped some of the financial markets 
the dollar rallied tuesday against most major currencies in 
foreignexchange trading while bond prices rose sharply 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond rose nearly 10 per 1000 
face amount while its yield which moves inversely to price fell 
below 9 percent for the first time in a week 
but on wall street stocks declined the dow jones average of 30 
industrials which was about 14 points higher at the opening closed 
down 661 at 216607 
economists said the markets were encouraged by a labor department 
report that showed inflation on the consumer level slowed in 
november to an annual rate of just 3 percent a drop in clothing 
prices and stabilized prices for food contributed to the decline 
the department said 
with only december left another month similar to november could 
enable the reagan administration to finish its last year in office 
meeting its inflation target of 43 percent for 1988 down slightly 
from 1987s 44 percent 
also easing inflation worries was a commerce department report 
that the gross national product the broadest measure of economic 
health expanded at a moderate annual rate of 25 percent in the 
third quarter due to the summer drought 
for the same period the department reported that aftertax 
corporate profits rose 39 percent down from a robust 89 percent 
increase the previous quarter 
low inflation is good for all the markets it means the 
economic recovery was sustainable and longlived said maury 
harris chief economist for painewebber inc 
it also eases the pressure on interest rates which have risen 
sharply in recent weeks partly on inflationary fears 
inflation is considered the nemesis of financial markets 
particularly the credit markets because it erodes the value of 
fixedincome securities sending yields higher to compensate for the 
loss 
that depresses the stock market which competes for investor 
money and it often hurts the dollar because as prices of stocks and 
bonds slip foreigners become less willing to exchange their 
currencies for dollars to buy us securities 
wall street speculation lately had centered on whether the 
federal reserve will raise its discount rate a key shortterm 
interest rate to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation 
from increasing 
the discount rate is the interest the fed charges on loans to 
commercial banks and savings institutions and is considered the 
most direct vehicle for the central bank to express its credit 
policies most economists had predicted the rate soon will be raised 
05 percentage point to 7 percent 
but tuesdays inflation and gnp reports put some of those 
discussions to rest at least temporarily 
some people who jumped on the interestratesgoingup 
fedtightening bandwagon found out they were going on it 
prematurely said robert a brusca chief financial economist for 
nikko securities co international thats what the markets are 
telling you

grain and soybean futures opened lower today on 
the chicago board of trade reflecting disappointment over the 
cancellation of some large export sales of us soybeans and soybean 
meal 
late tuesday the agriculture department announced the 
cancellation of a sale of 200000 metric tons of soybeans to the 
soviet union 
the usda also announced cancellation of a sale of 200000 metric 
tons of soybean meal to an unknown destination which was believed 
to have been the soviet union 
analysts said such cancellations were not unheard of when dealing 
with the soviet union which has very limited port capacity 
the bottom line is that they sometimes buy more than can 
physically take and they probably have a clause that allows them to 
get out of the commmitment said walter spilka a grain market 
analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new york 
more than likely they want the stuff but cant take it now 
he said more than likely theyll be back to take it 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 434 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
to 1 cents lower with march at 278 a bushel oats were 2 cents 
to 3 cents lower with march at 224 a bushel soybeans were 
cent to 7 cents lower with january at 779 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were unchanged to 28 cent lower with february at 
7310 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent lower to 03 cent 
higher with january at 8385 cents a pound live hogs were 10 cent 
to 37 cent lower with february at 4605 cents a pound frozen pork

the internal revenue service today previewed 
the new tax forms that 101 million americans should begin receiving 
in the mail next week 
the irs traditionally mails out the 101 million tax packages 
after christmas in order to avoid the holiday crush but allow 
taxpayers plenty of time to begin preparing their returns which are 
due on april 15 
however some taxpayers report they have already received the new 
forms 
in presenting the 1988 tax packages irs officials emphasized 
that they contained few changes from the forms taxpayers used last 
year 
last year taxpayers for the first time filed returns that 
reflected the more than 2000 changes made by the tax reform act of 
1986 
despite the many changes on those forms the irs said most 
taxpayers were able to file accurate forms promptly and received 
their returns on time the irs said that most of the changes this 
year would be so subtle that they would likely go unnoticed by 
taxpayers 
the change with the biggest impact reflects the final reduction 
in personal tax rates mandated by the sweeping 1986 tax overhaul law 
however those reductions are incorporated in the tax tables and 
do not show up in the forms at all 
irs officials said that other changes had been made to clear up 
confusion raised by last years forms one area where clarifying 
changes were made involves the standard deduction because of 
confusion some taxpayers last year failed to enter their correct 
standard deduction thus lowering the refund they should have 
received 
irs officials said those mistakes were caught when the irs 
returns were processed but the errors slowed down the mailing of the 
taxpayers refunds 
in addition to mailing the tax packages the irs will make the 
forms available at many banks post offices and libraries 
in a letter to taxpayers printed in the new tax package irs 
commissioner lawrence gibbs promised to search for new and better 
ways to reduce the burden placed on the public

philip l smith departing chief executive 
officer of the pillsbury co stands to reap nearly 8 million from 
his fivemonth stint with the food and restaurant company according 
to a published report wednesday 
that doesnt include a pledge smith won from pillsbury this 
month guaranteeing the equity in his 153 million house said the 
wall street journal report gleaned from merger documents and other 
filings 
during smiths time at pillsbury the company waged an 
unsuccessful battle against a hostile takeover bid by grand 
metropolitan plc and on tuesday reported a 38 percent decline in 
secondquarter earnings a continuation of its longstanding 
financial problems 
smith 54 said monday that he planned to leave pillsbury early 
next year when grand met takes over he joined pillsbury aug 1 
giving up the job of chairman and chief executive at philip morris 
cos general foods corp unit to woo him pillsbury made an offer 
that included 1 million in annual pay and substantial stock 
options the journal said 
pillsburys agreement sunday to accept a sweetened 568 billion 
or 66 per share takeover bid from the british conglomerate means 
smith will get even more 
as a pillsbury stockholder smith will be able to tender 75000 
shares for grand met the journal reported at 66 apiece that 
holding would gross 495 million 
company documents indicate that smith had purchased 3000 of 
those shares before joining the company the journal said upon the 
acquisition smith will be able to sell the other 72000 shares 
which had been awarded as longterm incentives the journal said 
quoting an unidentified pillsbury spokesman the merger agreement 
provides that restrictions on stock options for all pillsbury 
executives would lapse 
smith through the spokesman on tuesday declined to respond to 
inquiries about his compensation arrangements the journal said he 
has said he expects to leave pillsbury early next year when grand 
met takes control 
when he became pillsbury chairman smith was guaranteed 625000 
base pay plus a bonus of 375000 for the year ending next may 31 
under an agreement that pillsbury modified in november with grand 
met in pursuit senior executives would receive double their salary 
and bonus as liquidated damages in any change of control thus 
smith would be entitled to an additional 2 million he also would 
receive annual retirement benefits of at least 200000 the journal 
reported 
on dec 2 pillsbury guaranteed that smith wouldnt lose money on 
the 153 million house he and his wife recently bought in 
deephaven the newspaper said if smith cant sell the house within 
six months of his termination following a change of control 
pillsbury would buy the residence for what he paid the journal 
reported 
when smith arrived at pillsbury the companys restaurants were 
in financial trouble and the company was a rumored takeover 
candidate the battle with grand met occupied much of his energies 
and gave him little opportunity to focus on operating problems 
pillsbury attributed its earnings decline for the second quarter 
ended nov 30 to a substantial onetime investment in the burger 
king advertising fund and the cost of responding to grand mets 
takeover bid

american steelmakers are dancing into what is 
expected to be their third consecutive profitable year and the 
workers whose sacrifices helped make that possible say its time for 
them to get some of the wealth 
employees in the steel industry have done much more than their 
share to save the industry and to build a foundation for its 
future the united steelworkers of america union said in a policy 
statement adopted in december 
profits are back but not the corpulence that made easy pickings 
of wage and benefit increases for the steelworkers union in the two 
decades before the 1982 collapse in steel 
i think theres going to be great efforts made to depict what 
the union does as a strategy but my own hunch is theres going to 
be a whole lot of improvising said ben fischer carnegie mellon 
university labor specialist and former usw presidential assistant 
the usw already has signaled its low regard for profitsharing in 
lieu of raises it rejected such an offer from alcoa and reynolds 
and held out for a 50 centperhour wage increase along with profit 
sharing bonuses and pension increases from the aluminum industry 
leaders in december 
in addition union leaders say privately that their relations 
with ltv corp once unsurpassed among the major producers have 
been soured by a dispute over 100 million in profitsharing 
payments the union claims 
coordinated bargaining disintegrated in the industrys fiveyear 
depression leaving the union to negotiate separately with each 
company and in some cases with individual plants like their 
corporatemanager counterparts usw officials are fewer and busier 
these days 
usx corp the nations largest steelmaker is sitting out this 
round with a contract valid through january 1991 by which it can 
only benefit if the competition has to endure a strike or increase 
labor costs 
ltv wheelingpittsburgh steel corp and the less influential 
sharon steel corp are still in reorganization under federal 
bankruptcy laws and usw delegations there are standing in line 
along with numerous other creditors for their piece of the 
restructured companies 
fischer points out that steelmakers are developing close new 
relations with customers which force steel executives to represent 
a new constituency when negotiating new labor contracts 
to the extent this is so this is a tremendous pressure in the 
direction of decentralization of labor relations he said 
moreover maintaining lean new profiles will be high on the 
agenda of bethlehem steel corp inland steel co armco inc and 
national steel corp the four producers that will enter talks to 
replace contracts expiring july 31 for 45900 usw members 
the steel companies have made good profits in 1988 theyll 
make less in 89 in all likelihoodand of course what they do not 
want to do is give away labor costs said donald f barnette an 
independent industry analyst 
whatever you give away this year becomes a base for future 
years he said 
presidentelect george bush has already said without giving 
precise details that he will extend the steel import quotas 
limiting foreign metal to roughly 20 percent of the us market 
some economists see a consumerled recession in 1988 that could work 
its way back up the production chain to basic manufacturing 
barnett for one sees little more than a downturn in the steel 
market 
the consensus outlook bright by comparison to the early 1980s 
gives the usw the hope of negotiating its first raises in six years 
in economic terms the industry is profitable our people have 
contributed a great deal to that success and are entitled to share 
in it usw president lynn williams said 
usw members accepted backtoback threeyear contracts starting 
in 1983 that reduced wages and benefits by nearly 19 billion as 
estimated by the usw using american iron and steel institute data 
the sacrifices amount to 45 billion when adjusted for inflation 
according to the union 
bluecollar employment plunged from around 175000 workers in 
1983 to less than 126000 by 1987 a period in which production 
capacity shrunk from 150 million tons to 112 million tons 
the 25 top producers that report to the american iron and steel 
institute an industry trade group expect 1988 operating profits of 
2 billion or more 
those numbers are not as big as they seem said thomas 
graham institute chairman and president of the steelmaking division 
of usx the steel industry in 1988 earned a little under 10 
percent return on assets below the average for other major 
industries 
steelmakers made 1 billion in 1987 after having lost 12 
billion in the industrys 198286 depression 
we proved from 1982 to 1986 that modernization investments 
together with major costcutting programs would pay off in terms of 
higher productivity lower average production costs and improved 
quality graham said 
now our task is to consolidate those gains to continue 
upgrading investments and to repair the damage which those huge 
losses have done to our companies through further improved 
profitability he said

automakers received some pleasant surprises in 
1988 higher sales fatter profits and for the most part labor 
peace 
one japanese company began shipping usmade cars back home 
another began building cars in the united states and general motors 
corp began flexing anew its muscle as no 1 carmaker 
in the fall of 1987 analysts fretted about flat sales in the 
1988 model year and less than two weeks into the model year the 
stock market crashed increasing gloomy predictions 
but the 1988 model year ended sept 30 with automakers posting 
the thirdbest sales year on record buyers drove 156 million cars 
and light trucks off showroom floors 
the calendar year promised an impressive performance as well 
depending on december sales 
financially it was a good year for the big three automakers 
with analysts predicting at yearend that gm ford motor co and 
chrysler corp would combine for a record 11 billion in earnings 
ford posted industryrecord quarterly earnings during the first 
and second threemonth periods of the year taking in 162 billion 
and 166 billion respectively 
in the third quarter historically a period of lower earnings gm 
surprised analysts by outearning ford for the first time in five 
quarters with 8592 million 
moves designed to strengthen gms position that started as far 
back as 1982 were beginning to show results gm chairman roger smith 
said in a yearend interview quality has come up our new plants 
are on streama lot of the investments we made are paying off 
while gm was streamlining ford and some overseas carmakers 
snatched some of the market that had put gm at the top 
securities analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co said wall 
street is beginning to take gm officials promises of economic 
improvement more seriously 
thats what theyve been trying to indicate for the better part 
of six to seven months he said the skepticism regarding the 
turnaround was phenomenal but youre seeing the vast majority of 
the people beginning to believe 
in labor relations 1988 was relatively smooth for gm and ford 
rougher for chrysler the year was headlined by an early contract 
agreement between chrysler and the united auto workers 
that contract ratified in may brings the uaws contracts with 
each of the big three to a common expiration date sept 14 1990 
the uaw agreed to threeyear contracts with gm and ford in 1987 
the path to the chrysleruaw contract was rocky 
the company faced noisy protest demonstrations after chairman lee 
iacocca announced chrysler may sell its acustar inc parts 
subsidiary chrysler later scrapped that idea 
the company announced in april three days after negotiations 
began that it would move production of its kcars to mexico from 
the united states chrysler backed down on that temporarily 
but in kenosha wis chrysler remained committed to close an 
aging former american motors corp assembly plant dec 23 
eliminating 5500 jobs 
other notable auto industry events during 1988 included 
toyota motor manufacturing usa inc began building cars at a 
new plant in georgetown ky and diamondstar motors a 
collaboration between mitsubishi motors corp of japan and chrysler 
in illinois started production 
offers of cash rebates moved in and out oldsmobile offered free 
gasoline and airplane tickets and chrysler experimented with money 
back or exchange guarantees in newcar purchases in two markets 
in march american honda motor co began shipping twodoor 
accords from its plant in marysville ohio to japan 
iacocca gave a clear indication about his choice for a successor 
in midnovember when he announced a restructuring in the companys 
executive office suites chrysler motors chairman gerald greenwald 
was named vice chairman of the parent corporation to share the 
office of chairman with iacocca who has three years left on his 
contract 
in washington the transportation department in october set 
fueleconomy standards at 265 miles per gallon for 1989 cars gm 
and ford had said a higher corporate average fuel economy standard 
could cause layoffs and production cuts 
chrysler said it could meet the original target of 275 mpg for 
1989 models

slowly a colorful batch of sugar is twisted 
into tasty sticks in the tiny factory of a candymaking family 
dynasty 
hatchers candy co has no use for advertising no signs mark the 
converted white house where the clan has carefully created candy for 
40 years 
its just word of mouth cm hatcher explains were 
small 
the company telephone number isnt listed in the book but the 
tourists come they drive past the lumber yards on their way south 
for christmas to pick up a peppermint bowl or two at the corner 
house 
the oldtimers follow their noses and neighborhood children 
sometimes show up for free tastes until hatchers son tony sends 
them on their way 
it started with my granddaddy the younger hatcher said my 
daddys been making candy since he was 13 my mamma and daddy raised 
me under that table over there 
the process is slow even at christmas when the familys special 
edible bowls and baskets are most in demand father and son with 
help from a few relatives and others hired for the holiday rush 
mold more than 4000 of their trademarks for christmas 
ive just been in it about 15 years said tony hatcher who 
took over when his father formally retired if it has to do with 
sugar daddy can make it 
the hard candy starts at two open furnaces the same ones 
hatchers grandfather used before he died sugar and water are mixed 
together in vats and cooked over open flame the caramelcolored 
liquid is poured onto a cooling slab where hatcher and doug thomas 
fold it as it crusts and thickens 
you gotta like it to stay in it especially this time of 
year said thomas whos been making candy with hatchers father 
for 30 years 
a pulling machine is the next step hatchers grandfather pulled 
his own but the machine helps like taffy the sugar turns until 
the mixture becomes milky white and hatcher adds a liquid flavoring 
the batch is then kneaded like bread dough on a warm clothcovered 
table 
red coloring is added to a chunk that is carefully pulled and 
intertwined with white to make stripes the stripes are wrapped 
around the batch before its carried over to the twisting table and 
fed into a simple shaping and cutting machine for candy sticks 
bowls are handmolded cooled filled with sticks and wrapped in 
plastic baskets with braided handles are packed in cardboard 
boxes the sticks are handpackaged and heatsealed under the family 
label that has remained the same over the years delicious 
hatchers assorted candy 
the hatchers add handturned green and red candy flowers with wax 
candles to make some baskets into table centerpieces solid striped 
sugar is molded into the shape of vases and intricate red candy 
roses with green leaves are added for special customers 
the hatchers sell to a couple of grocery chains their candy also 
can be found in tourist shops throughout the region hatcher 39 
makes candy five days a week and delivers it the other two 
a lot of your factories use liquid sugar and its vacuum 
cooked theyre into quantity i kind of like quality he said 
from nov 1 until christmas the company used about 6000 pounds 
of sugar a week about double the ordinary volume to make about 30 
75pound batches a day one batch yields about 2500 sticks or 65 
bowls 
hatchers father who worked in candy factories before he struck 
out on his own remembers when sugar cost 5 cents a pound compared 
with up to 40 cents now the family used to sell to country markets 
and commissary stores in the coalfields of southwest virginia but 
those days are gone 
we sold plenty of candy in the coalfields they were goin 
pretty good back then the elder hatcher said all the mom and 
pop stores are gone 
there are four younger hatchers who have expressed an interest in 
the family business after they complete college 
its just enough to get by tony hatcher said of the 
companys profit i hope they get into it

the nuclear regulatory commission today ruled 
that the seabrook nh nuclear power plant is financially 
qualified to run lowpower tests and said that the plant could 
receive its lowpower license by jan 6 
the commission also ruled unanimously that the pilgrim plant in 
plymouth mass could resume fullpower operations after being shut 
down for nearly 3 years 
pilgrim spokeswoman elaine robinson said tuesday that if the 
plymouth plant got the goahead today it would begin startup 
procedures before jan 1 although it would take four months to get 
the reactor back up to full production 
in the seabrook case the commissioners said that seabrook 
officials must set aside 721 million for decommissioning costs in 
case the plant receives the lowpower license but never secures a 
fullpower commercial license 
deputy general counsel martin malsch also said that the 
commissions licensing board must rule on another seabrook matter 
before the lowpower permit is issued 
seabrook spokesman sean oneill said the ruling appears to be 
good news for seabrook station although plant officials had not 
yet seen the order and could not comment further 
ted c feigenbaum a vice president with new hampshire yankee 
said predicted that the pending atomic safety and licensing board 
issue would be quickly resolved and that testing would begin in 
january 
robert backus lawyer for the seacoast antipollution league 
criticized the ruling saying its going to be hard for them to 
justify a decision to let a bankrupt company run a nuclear plant 
with the other associated financial problems seabrook owners face 
he said plant opponents would appeal once the commission grants the 
lowpower license 
roy morrison spokesman for the antinuclear clamshell alliance 
called the decision a dangerous and irresponsible step that would 
be met by nonviolent citizen protests 
critics led by massachusetts gov michael s dukakis have vowed 
to fight the seabrook permit in federal court and have hinted at 
challenging a pilgrim restart 
emergency evacuation planning is at the center of both 
controversies 
massachusetts officials are opposed to opening the sabrook plant 
at all arguing that narrow roads in seacoast towns in the northeast 
of their state near the plant make it impossible to quickly evacuate 
the area in the case of an atomic emergency 
and they say pilgrim should not reopen until an approved 
evacuation plan is in place the federal emergency management agency 
ruled last year that the current plan is inadequate 
the commission ordered seabrook officials in september to prove 
that they could cover the costs of decommissioning the reactor if 
the plant received a testing license but never obtained the 
fullpower permit 
in addition the commissioners were asked by plant opponents to 
lift an agency rule and consider the overall financial qualification 
of the plant owners 
public service company of new hampshire the plants lead owner 
filed for bankruptcy reorganization in january and in june the 
fourthlargest shareholder massachusetts municipal wholesale 
electric co withdrew from the project and halted its payments of 
2 million a month 
creditors are currently in court trying to protect their 
assets sen john f kerry dmass a leading seabrook critic 
said tuesday if the nrc goes ahead with the lowlevel licensing 
procedure before the asset question is finalized the nrc could 
jeopardize the situation and make the ongoing financial instability 
even greater 
the pilgrim plant a 670megawatt plant 40 miles south of boston 
was shut down for management and safety problems on april 12 1986 
only the browns ferry reactors in alabama run by the beleaguered 
tennessee valley authority have been idle longer 
officials at boston edison co operator of pilgrim said the 
16yearold plant is ready to be restarted after 35 million in 
safety improvements and a sweeping management reorganization the 
commissions staff agreed that the plant is ready to resume 
operations 
but opponents said an approved evacuation plan must be in place 
before the plant starts up 
if the nrc chooses to turn on pilgrim they will in effect be 
saying that in their view the issue of evacuation is 
meaningless kerry said tuesday 
if the nrc takes the callous approach and restarts pilgrim the 
message is clear the nrc is more concerned with the economic health 
of the nuclear industry than with the health and well being of the 
people it is supposed to be protecting he added 
the pilgrim shutdown has cost boston edison an estimated 600 
million including 230000 a day in replacement energy costs 
company officials said

roger b smith sits in a corner office of 
industrial america looking over his desk filled with model cars and 
trucks trying to drive the nations largest corporation off the 
shoulder and back into the passing lane 
the general motors corp chairman a onetime accountant who 
never worked an assembly line says things are getting better for 
the company which has faced lower profits in the past few years 
while domestic and foreign rivals have lured customers with snazzier 
and more innovative vehicles 
during that time gm has been streamlining layers of management 
and outfitting plants with new equipment to introduce a few 
innovations of its own 
it has closed more than a dozen plants and cut more than 130000 
people from the payroll including a 25 percent reduction in its 
whitecollar work force 
it was under smiths auspices that the symbol of us industrial 
might took a back seat to ford motor co in earnings and watched its 
share of the us market slip 10 percentage points from mid1986 to 
486 percent now 
gm has been rebounding lately the 63yearold chairman is proud 
to say 
a lot of the things we did dating back to 1982 are starting to 
pay off now thats the big thing he said in a yearend interview 
in his 14th floor office of the gm building our quality has come 
up our new plants are on stream a lot of the things in the old 
plants arent even done yet 
a lot of the plant and equipment investments we made are 
paying off he said its just a slow steady grinding of the 
progress weve been working on 
smith pointed to surprisingly strong thirdquarter earnings a 
resurgence in sales and most visibly for employees an announcement 
earlier this month of profitsharing the first since 1985 
amounting to about 200 per worker 
the gm chairman is well versed in the finances of the 
corporation an attribute for which he has been both praised and 
rebuked he began his career with the automaker as a general 
accounting senior clerk in 1949 and rose through the companys 
finance arm before winning a directors seat in 1974 
some critics have said smith is so preoccupied with numbers and 
let style slip to the point where it was hard to tell a buick from a 
chevy from an olds giving all gm cars that boxy look the automaker 
is trying to change that perception with its 1989 models 
smith himself is fond of the classic styles gm pioneered he owns 
two corvettes a 1960 and a 67 a 64 corvair and a muted yellow 
1936 cadillac convertible sedan 
its the big old long wheelbase one with a divider windshield 
and a hood that runs from here to down there and back again he 
said gesturing toward the other side of his office 
theyre great cars he said the only problem is that the 
engine is so big and the pistons are so small i have trouble knowing 
when the engines running 
smith keeps the caddy at his summer home near burt lake in the 
extreme northern part of michigans lower peninsula he takes it out 
frequently there 
people wave at you they think its nice the people are waving 
at the car i think 
smith plans to retire in 1990 a decade after he was elected 
chairman and chief executive officer amid one of the toughest times 
for the automobile industry 
during the 1980s the industry as a whole has recovered and is 
approaching the secondbest sales year on record us sales 
estimates for 1988 are running at more than 155 million cars and 
light trucks second only to the 1986 record of 163 million 
smith sees pretty good times ahead 
if you flatten at 15 million he said i dont have any 
problem with that i think general motors is particularly 
wellpositioned weve got a lot of our new plants that were in the 
startup phase last year 
smith holds out great hope for saturn corp a subsidiary 
building a plant outside nashville tenn little news about the car 
has been released other than it will be a compact or subcompact 
marketed via a new dealer network 
i think saturn is going to be a colossal success smith said 
under budget and ahead of schedule thats what we like 
production is to begin in 1990 for the 1991 model year 
one potential unknown for the industry will be the policy of the 
bush administration smith like other automobile company 
executives is cautious about forecasting washingtons policy shifts 
a little tiny stroke of a pen down there can shatter our 
industry he said look what theyre talking about on a 
15centagallon gas tax that can take 150000 jobs out of this 
industry thats crazy 
smith reacts strongly when he feel the industry or gm is 
threatened but he has spent his time in the bullseye too 
besides taking criticism that he is too financeconscious smith 
came under sharp attack by former gm board member h ross perot for 
executive excesses perot was severed from the board with a 750 
million buyout after his electronic data systems computer company 
was bought by gm in december 1986 
through all the controversy smith has tried to keep the lid on 
something he dislikes in automobiles 
all the cars in smiths garages are soft tops 
i like convertibles he said and i like fast cars and i 
like to drive

southland corp parent company of 7eleven 
convenience stores has sold part of the company to a group of 
outside investors and switched investment bankers documents 
outlining the companys 49 billion debtfinanced restructuring 
show 
the documents disclose that southland which struggled to 
complete financing for the deal last december dumped the investment 
banking firms of goldman sachs amp co and salomon brothers inc in 
favor of drexel burnham lambert inc the leading underwriter of 
highyield junk bond securities that play an important role in 
many debtrestructurings 
the documents filed with the securities and exchange commission 
on tuesday show southland seeks to reduce interest expenses by 
exchanging new debt securities for nearly 1 billion in existing 
securities with yields of 18 percent 
to compensate debtholders for a yield that could average 35 
percentage points less than the existing securities southland has 
agreed to make the new notes senior to other debt meaning that 
holders would have priority in getting repaid 
the new southland debt which could repay investors in either 
cash or more debt securities will shorten the repayment schedule to 
june 1997 from a december 2007 deadline specified for the existing 
issue 
the company indicated that to gain approval of the new 
arrangement from banks holding 2 billion in term loans southland 
has pledged to accelerate a 100 million repayment and will pledge 
as collateral 800 of the firms approximately 7200 7eleven stores 
in addition the documents show drexel helped southland sell 
about 25 percent of the company to an unidentified group of 
investors for an undisclosed price 
spokeswoman cecilia norwood said the emergence of drexel in no 
way reflects a dissatisfaction with southlands former investment 
bankers instead drexel presents the company with its best 
alternative for reducing its costs of its obligations to lenders 
she said 
since we went private its been fairly well known that we have 
been searching for ways of reducing the size and cost of our debt

grain and soybean futures prices closed higher 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade with corn and soybeans 
posting strong gains amid a generally bullish outlook for export 
sales 
the markets had opened lower in reaction to the agriculture 
departments announcement late tuesday of some cancelled export 
sales including a sale of 200000 metric tons of soybeans to the 
soviet union 
but the disappointment quickly faded amid news of strong export 
sales of corn and inherent bullishness in the market said 
walter spilka a grainmarket analyst with smith barney harris 
upham amp co in new york 
i suspect traders would argue that although the soviets have 
canceled these purchases they will make some purchases further down 
the road he said its inevitable that some new business will 
filter back in 
wheat futures prices rose shortly before the close on a report 
that china was bidding for 400000 metric tons of subsidized us 
wheat under the usdas export enhancement program analysts said 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 438 a bushel corn was 4 cents 
to 6 cents higher with march at 284 a bushel oats were 3 cents 
to 4 cents higher with march at 232 a bushel soybeans were 5 
cents to 11 cents higher with january at 796 a bushel

us paper mills plan to expand capacity for 
making paper and paperboard by an average of 33 percent a year over 
the next three years reflecting growing us demand and healthy 
exports the american paper institute said wednesday 
the capacity to produce wood pulp the raw material for paper 
will grow a smaller 26 percent a year over the same 198991 period 
the institute said the difference will be made up by increasing use 
of recyclable paper it said 
the institutes forecast is based on a survey of producers 
expansion plans this marks the second year in which producers 
raised their plans for capacity expansion the institute said 
last year the institute predicted total capacity in 1990 would 
reach 841 million tons of paper and paperboard and 644 million 
tons of wood pulp 
this year it predicted capacity would exceed those figures in 
1990 and in 1991 would total 886 million tons of paper and 
paperboard and 678 million tons of wood pulp 
paper output is closely tied to the health of the overall economy 
because paper is used in all areas of business paperboard is used 
in boxes so its use grows when production and shipments increase 
improved productivity and the decline in the dollar also put 
american producers in a better position to increase exports said 
richard storat the institutes vice president for economic and 
financial services 
the producers predicted annual capacity growth of 39 percent for 
printing and writing papers 52 percent for newsprint 27 percent 
for tissue papers 21 percent for solid bleached paperboard and 
18 percent for recycled paperboard capacity for unbleached kraft 
packaging papers the kind used in grocery bags should rise 
slightly after two years of decline they predicted

the largest undeveloped plot of land in the city 
a 76acre riverfront rail yard on manhattans west side will 
remain the private domain of donald trump the developer announced 
wednesday 
he intends to proceed with plans to build the worlds tallest 
building on the site as part of his trump city project a 
mixeduse development that would include apartments retail and 
office space 
a trump spokesman noting that teams of bidders from four 
continents were interested in the parcel said all discussions with 
potential buyers have been terminated 
now that all talk of sale is behind us we hope to be certified 
to begin the ulurp uniform land use review procedure and zoning 
processes in the next several months trump said in a prepared 
statement 
trump bought the 15block site then called lincoln west four 
years ago at the fire sale price of 95 million from argentine 
businessman francisco macri and abraham hirschfeld who ran into 
financial problems trying to develop the property 
when asked at a news conference two months ago about reports that 
he had been offered more than 500 million for the site trump 
replied i dont believe anyone has enough money to pay me for 
this piece of land 
he used a different tone in his statement wednesday saying 
building a great city for new york and new yorkers is more 
important to me than selling this unique and wonderful site for a 
very substantial shortterm profit 
the mammoth project would include a 150story apartment tower 
eight 60story residential towers three smaller towers shopping 
mall marina and 20 acres of parks between 59th and 72nd streets 
trumps plans have met with almost universal criticism from 
environmentalists preservationists and community groups

takeover guru henry kravis has asked the japanese 
for help in financing his firms record 2453 billion buyout of rjr 
nabisco inc and on wednesday made a sales pitch for the junko 
bondos to be issued as part of the deal 
kravis principal of kohlberg kravis roberts amp co and 
representatives from drexel burnham lambert inc met for about two 
hours with 240 investment bankers and institutional investors in 
tokyo according to spokesmen for kravis and drexel it was one of a 
reported series of meetings 
they said the two groups discussed the 5 billion in highyield 
highrisk junk bonds or junko bondos as theyre often 
called in japan that will be sold to finance kkrs 109ashare 
rjr takeover 
kkr also will be borrowing 14 billion from a syndicate of banks 
and it hopes to have significant japanese representation there as 
well kravis met with about a dozen large japanese banks earlier 
this week in tokyo 
steven s anreder a senior vice president at drexel said 
wednesdays tokyo meeting went very well 
im told the investors were very enthusiastic about buying 
bonds he said 
drexel and merrill lynch amp co kkrs two main wall street 
financial brokers will be underwriting the debt securities 
neither they nor kkr would say how many bonds they hoped to sell 
to the typically conservative japanese investors although analysts 
noted that japanese interest in these bonds has increased 
signficantly in recent years 
the foreign market share now totals around 3 percent with a 
large portion made up of japanese investors compared to just a 
small fraction a few years ago according to a recent general 
accounting office report and analysts 
the volume of junk bonds also has increased over the years as 
more and more companies find use for them in acquisitions theyre 
called junk only because theyre issued by companies whose credit 
ratings are below investment grade thats the case with rjr nabisco 
due to the huge debt load from the buyout 
while junk bonds will play an important role in kkrs financing 
the majority of rjr nabiscos resulting debt will come from bank 
loans 
before meeting with the japanese banks kravis met with 
representatives from 40 big international banks in new york to seek 
commitments of at least 500 million by jan 17 about 100 smaller 
us banks will be asked for 100 million to 500 million at a 
meeting in early january 
banks that commit loan money by jan 6 will be paid a modest 
incentive said james p ferguson a managing director for 
acquisition finance at manufacturers hanover trust co one of four 
lead banks on the transaction 
ferguson said the japanese are expected to put up about onethird 
of the 14 billion in bank loans

the european economic communitys 
executive body disclosed a plan wednesday to open up the life 
insurance market in the 12nation trade bloc 
the plan by the eec commission would allow individuals to shop 
around the bloc for life insurance policies and would permit 
insurance companies to offer their services throughout the trade 
bloc without having to set up a branch or subsidiary 
it is part of the eecs drive to create a single market of trade 
goods and investment by the end of 1992 
the plan contains a controversial reciprocity clause which would 
allow foreign insurers to offer their services in all eec nations 
to the extent that their home countries give eec insurers reciprocal 
market access 
the clause has been used already in draft eec legislation 
liberalizing banking and investment services 
under the terms of the plan which needs approval by the 12 
member states insurers from one country selling services in another 
would be bound by the rules governing domestic sales

pillsbury co chairman philip l smith who 
arrived at the food and restaurant company less than four months 
ago could depart nearly 8 million richer under the pending 
takeover by grand metropolitan plc according to documents reviewed 
wednesday 
the british liquor gambling food and specialty products 
conglomerate is expected to take control of pillsbury in late 
january or early february and say goodbye to smith who had been 
hired to replace william h spoor as chairman and chief executive 
officer 
smiths tenure was dominated by pillsburys unsuccessful battle 
against grand mets hostile takeover attempt which ended sunday 
with pillsbury accepting a negotiated offer of 57 billion or 66 
a share 
in smiths only full quarter with the company pillsbury 
experienced a 38 percent decline in quarterly earnings compared with 
the same period a year ago chiefly because the company took a 215 
million charge to pay expenses related to the takeover battle 
pillsburys profits for the three months ended nov 30 were 448 
million or 52 cents a share compared with 725 million or 84 
cents a share from the same quarter a year ago 
smith 54 left his job as chairman and chief executive at 
general foods corp to replace spoor who had come out of retirement 
briefly in february to replace john m stafford 
as part of smiths employment agreement he received 30000 
shares of pillsbury stock worth 217 million under the buyout 
according to pillsburys 1988 proxy statement he had purchased 
3000 shares before joining pillsbury and will receive under the 
terms of his contract an additional 30000 shares because of the 
change in control according to the proxy statement 
that would give smith 63000 shares to tender at 66 a share for 
415 million and that doesnt take into account additional shares 
that smith will earn under the companys fouryear management 
incentive plan the wall street journal reported wednesday that 
smith will be able to tender 75000 pillsbury shares for a total of 
495 million in all 
in addition smiths base salary at pillsbury is 625000 a year 
plus a minimum annual bonus of 375000 for the year ended may 31 
1989 according to the proxy statement he would be entitled under 
the takeover to an additional 2 million because of a modified 
agreement approved in november by pillsburys board of directors 
that gives smith and 10 other top executives the right to 
liquidated damages equal to two times the executives base salary 
and targeted annual bonus 
the damages are triggered upon the companys termination of the 
executives employment or the voluntary termination by the executive 
for good reason according to the agreement 
another clause in smiths employment contract says his retirement 
benefits will not be less than 200000 per year in the event of a 
change in control of the company the proxy statement said 
the wall street journal also reported wednesday that pillsbury on 
dec 2 guaranteed that smith wouldnt lose money on the 153 
million house he and his wife recently bought in deephaven an 
exclusive minneapolis suburb if smith cant sell the house within 
six months of his termination following a change of control 
pillsbury would buy the residence for what he paid the journal 
reported 
pillsbury spokesman larry haeg said the company had no comment on 
smiths compensation package or the journal story

the united states plans no new efforts 
to try to delay a european ban scheduled to go into effect in less 
than two weeks on imports of hormonetreated meat from america a 
us official said wednesday 
as near as i can tell we are now on a collision course set for 
jan 1 said alfred kingon the us ambassador to the 12nation 
european economic community 
he said in an interview he didnt know what new proposals could 
be made to the trading bloc to try to resolve the dispute 
i honestly dont know what they could be he said 
weve given them any number of suggestions on how to resolve this 
and theyve turned them down 
at issue is a decision by the eec to prohibit for health reasons 
all meat from animals treated with growth hormones the united 
states contends the use of certain hormones to fatten animals a 
common practice among american farmers does not pose a health risk 
the ban was to have taken effect jan 1 1988 but the trading 
bloc agreed to a oneyear delay it has refused us appeals for 
another however brief postponement 
kingon said that last week he formally requested a delay of a few 
months to give new administrations coming into office in the united 
states and at the communitys executive body in brussels a chance to 
tackle the issue 
its a terrible inheritance to leave to them he said 
moreover he said the european parliament the communitys 
legislative arm is taking a look at the issue and expected to 
release a report early next year 
the eec also known as the common market earlier in the week 
denied the us request but did narrow the ban to exclude pet food 
us officials estimated 140 million to 150 million dollars of 
american meat would be kept out of the community pet food accounts 
for about 20 to 25 percent of that sum according to us estimates 
although european officials place the amount at about half the total 
total trade between the united states and the eec is estimated to 
reach 166 billion dollars this year 
kingon reiterated the united states intention to respond to the 
ban by applying tariffs on certain products imported from european 
countries 
if they implement the prohibition on jan 1 as they say they 
are going to do then we will retaliate on jan 1 he said 
the eec has in turn vowed to counter the measures by slapping 
duties on such us imports as unshelled nuts natural honey dried 
fruit and canned corn 
kingon told a news conference on monday that the united states 
was drawing up plans to strike back at those threats 
in the interview he denied that such actions would signal a 
trade war between the trading partners

americans personal income rose strongly in 
both november and october after adjusting to exclude distortions 
from surges in farm subsidies and auto workers bonuses the 
government said wednesday 
the commerce department said income fell a slight 02 percent in 
november to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 418 trillion 
following a jump of 17 percent in october the biggest in a year 
but excluding the two special factors that occurred in october 
personal income rose 06 percent in november and 08 percent in 
october both significantly stronger than the inflation rate 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said personal income 
continues to rise at a healthy pace and in line with gains reported 
over the past 12 months 
personal consumption spending which includes everything except 
interest payments on debt rose 06 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 332 trillion last month after a robust 10 percent 
gain in october 
the numbers were in line with expectations and had little effect 
on the financial markets on wall street the dow jones average of 
30 industrials down 661 on tuesday slipped another 143 points to 
216464 bond prices and interest rates were little changed 
it looks like 1988 is going out with a bang said robert 
brusca an economist with nikko securities co international inc in 
reference to the income and spending report 
however brusca said the new statistics are likely to displease 
the federal reserve board which has been raising interest rates in 
an attempt to slow the economy the feds goals are to slow 
inflation and to ease domestic consumer demand so manufacturers can 
produce enough exports to whittle the us trade deficit 
we are living beyond our means and in order to put that thing 
the trade deficit back in place were going to have to do much 
better at living within our means brusca said mr bushs 
campaign song dont worry be happy is still well in place 
with spending rising faster than income in november the personal 
savings rate savings as a percentage of aftertax income dipped 
to 43 percent from 52 percent in october economists say one way 
to curb the trade deficit is to increase americans saving 
disposable or aftertax income declined 03 percent in november 
following a 17 percent gain a month earlier it was the first 
decline since april when annual income tax payments depressed 
personal income by 14 percent 
wages and salaries key components of personal income were up 
04 percent to a 252 trillion annual rate in november following a 
large 15 percent increase caused by bonuses to auto workers 
manufacturing salaries edged down 05 percent after a 22 percent 
increase in october 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group a washington 
consulting firm said growth in the number of jobs rather than in 
inflationadjusted income accounts for most of the rising income 
weve had a miraculous jobcreation machine but on a 
perworker basis the picture is not as bright many people in many 
parts of the country are earning less in real terms she said 
farm income usually a volatile category plunged 646 percent to 
a yearly pace of 157 billion after soaring 629 percent in october 
personal interest income rose a strong 10 percent to an annual 
rate of 6011 billion in november following an identical increase 
a month earlier rising interest rates since this spring have cut 
into the buying power of young families who borrow heavily but 
theyve added to the income of older families saving for retirement 
the biggest increase in spending last month was for durable goods 
big ticket items expected to last three or more years the 
category rose 15 percent followed by a 06 percent increase for 
nondurable goods and a 03 percent rise in spending for services 
john hagens an economist with the wefa group a bala cynwyd 
pa forecasting firm said the seasonally adjusted rise in spending 
for services was unexpectedly weak he speculated that the 
government was not adjusting the figures sufficiently to exclude 
normal shifts in buying patterns before the holidays 
about this time of the year people are focusing attention on 
purchases of goods because they can be distributed as christmas 
presents you cant really give a service as a christmas present 
hagens said

as a catalyst in the pollutioncontrol devices accounts for about 
onethird of platinum consumption worldwide 
analysts linked wednesdays rally to buying by bargain hunters 
whose confidence was bolstered by statements from the londonbased 
platinum refiner johnson matthey plc 
johnson matthey which helped ford develop the new converter 
stood by its earlynovember projection of platinum supply shortfalls 
in 1988 and over the next few years 
the worlds largest platinum refiner cited the global tightening 
of exhaust emission standards and the widespread use outside the 
united states of leaded gasoline platinum is better than other 
catalyst metals at cleaning up the exhaust produced by leaded 
gasoline johnson matthey said in a statement 
analysts expressed skepticism about the degree to which ford has 
developed its new technology for practical use 
the impression im getting is that there are still a lot of 
unanswered questions and it doesnt look like the technology is 
going to be applied on a widespread basis anytime soon said 
bernard savaiko metals analyst with painewebber inc in new york 
he said january platinum probably could climb another 15 to 20 
before encountering significant resistance 
peter cardillo commodities trading adviser with josephthal amp co 
in new york predicted platinum would rally even further to 565 or 
570 an ounce 
the market was obviously grossly oversold on the announcement 
by ford he said the supply situation has not changed and will 
not change

a federal appeals court has ordered the 
transportation department to award the seattletokyo air route to 
continental airlines in the latest round of a 2yearold battle 
among three of the nations largest airlines over the lucrative 
route 
a little more than a month ago the department decided to ignore 
an earlier appeals court decision and award the route to united 
airlines 
the us court of appeals in a brief decision late tuesday 
again ruled that the department had violated various deadlines in 
awarding the route and overstepped its authority in giving the route 
to united 
we cannot countenance the creative use of procedural mechanisms 
to evade either our order or the faas federal aviation 
administration review deadlines the court said adding that the 
department had engaged in a thinly disguised attempt to circumvent 
the decision of this court 
the court had found in september that continental should receive 
the route but the department had decided to once again review the 
case 
at various times over the past two years administrative law 
judges and top department officials have awarded the route to 
continental united and american airlines 
the route generates more than 100 million in revenue annually 
hal paris a dot spokesman said the department would have no 
immediate comment on the latest court order 
we havent seen the decision yet and will have to review it 
before commenting said paris 
art kent a continental spokesman in houston said his airline 
was delighted with the ruling 
as far as we are concerned the court of appeals ruling brings 
this matter to a close and we will begin our planning to institute 
our service on the route sometime next year said kent 
kent said it was too soon to say when continental may begin 
actual flights between seattle and tokyo 
the airline has said previously it would offer oneway 
seattletokyo fares as low as 299 
a united spokesman in chicago said the courts decision was based 
on what amounts to a legal technicality and that an appeal was 
possible 
united will act swiftly to review all options available and 
will take prompt action to protect the interests of our customers 
the communities we serve the traveling public and our own 
employees said rob doughty 
united has been flying the route since 1986 when it purchased pan 
american world airways pacific division but dot approved the 
purchase only on the condition that the route be dealt with in a 
separate proceeding 
both northwest airlines and japan air lines also fly nonstop 
between seattle and tokyo

gov mario cuomo on wednesday signed into law 
a bill allowing new york corporations to use poison pill 
takeover defenses to fight hostile takeover bids 
the new law is designed to undo until april 1 1989 the state 
supreme courts ruling earlier this year that a poison pill irving 
bank corp tried to use to thwart a hostile takeover by bank of new 
york co was illegal 
the court decided new york state law prohibits the inequitable 
treatment of shareholders and ruled the irving pill created such a 
condition the decision cleared the way for bank of new yorks 
acquisition 
a typical poison pill gives existing shareholders the right to 
buy additional stock in a company once an outside concern acquires a 
certain amount of the companys shares that increases the number of 
shares a hostile buyer must to acquire to take over the company 
making a hostile bid prohibitively expensive 
a special task force is studying the use of such defensive 
measures and will report to the state legislature in early spring 
at that point the legislature and cuomo either can make the new law 
permanent or let it expire 
both houses of the legislature approved the bill unanimously last 
week

drexel is like a god an awed competitor said 
in 1986 
at the height of its power drexel burnham lambert inc bestrode 
the financial world like a colossus using its moneyraising power 
to finance everything from nursery school chains to corporate 
takeovers 
on wednesday the colossus dropped to its knees legally if not 
financially drexel agreed to plead guilty to six federal felony 
counts and pay a record 650 million fine to settle the biggest wall 
street securities fraud case in history 
the deal requires approval of the securities and exchange 
commission and senior justice department officials 
drexels power came from its exploitation of an area of finance 
that other investment bankers had ignored either because of lack of 
imagination or lack of appetite for risk 
drexel helped clients raise large amounts of money quickly by 
issuing bonds that were riskier than investmentgrade securities and 
hence paid higher yields 
the securities quickly became known as junk bonds to the dismay 
of drexel and michael milken the brilliant strategist who helped 
pioneer them 
in spite of its upstart image drexel was not a newcomer to wall 
street it traces its roots to the founding of burnham amp co in 
1935 drexel firestone which burnham acquired in 1973 goes back to 
the 1830s and once counted jp morgan among its partners 
drexel was a secondtier investment bank though until the 
mid1970s when it came up with the concept of selling junk bonds as 
original issues 
until then the only junk bonds were securities that had 
originally been issued with a higher rating but whose issuers had 
fallen on hard times 
drexel worked both sides of the deal lining up investors who 
were attracted by the bonds attractive yields and grateful issuers 
who had never before been able to raise money in the bond market 
frederick h joseph now drexels chief executive was then head 
of corporate finance leading underwriting efforts 
milken led drexels junkbond trading operation and moved it to 
beverly hills calif from new york in 1977 
drexels biggest break came in the early 1980s when it hit on 
the idea of using junk bonds to finance corporate takeovers that 
idea vaulted it to the front ranks of investment banks and 
revolutionized the mergers and acquisitions business 
corporate raiders such as carl icahn sir james goldsmith saul 
steinberg and t boone pickens jr established close relations with 
drexel as did stock speculators such as ivan boesky 
among the companies taken over with the help of junk bonds 
floated by drexel were twa inc and crown zellerbach corp drexel is 
also playing a major role in financing kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
cos 245 billion buyout of rjr nabisco inc 
drexel is like a god in that end of the business and a god can 
to anything it wants they are awesome you hate to do business 
against them michael boylan the president of macfadden holdings 
told barrons magazine in 1986 
drexel liked the quote so much that one of its investment bankers 
framed it connie bruck recounts in a book published this year 
the predators ball 
drexel earned enormous fees for underwriting and trading junk 
bonds and for its takeover advice 
drexels capital as of dec 31 1987 totaled nearly 22 
billion up from 18 billion the previous year and up more than 
tenfold from 1981 that made the privately held company the fifth 
largest firm on wall street 
although drexel still is the dominant player in junk bonds the 
markets rapid growth has drawn competition from other investment 
banks 
drexels influence in the takeover game began to diminish 
somewhat amid the insidertrading scandal on wall street which 
erupted with the arrest of a drexel investment banker dennis r 
levine and then led to a government investigation of drexels 
tactics 
still drexel has denied suggestions that the probe severely 
impaired the firm claiming its junk bond business and its other 
investment banking operations remained strong 
as recently as wednesday before drexels agreement to plead 
guilty southland corp the parent company of 7eleven convenience 
stores announced it had switched its investment banking business to 
drexel dumping the prestigious investment banking firms of goldman 
sachs amp co and salomon brothers inc

the head of brazils staterun oil 
monopoly petrobras resigned wednesday the day after the resignation 
of the mines and energy minister 
armando guedes coelho who had headed petrobras since june said 
in a letter to president jose sarney that his resignation was 
unrelated to an internal financial scandal rocking the oil concern 
guedes resignation from the presidency of the petrobras oil 
company had been expected since late last week 
no substitute has yet been named to replace guedes who was 
personally chosen to head the oil monopoly by mines and energy 
minister aureliano chaves the presidential palace said chaves 
resigned tuesday amid press reports speculating that he hoped to 
become a fulltime presidential candidate for the 1989 elections 
i never expected to continue in my post through the end of 
sarneys mandate guedes told the gazeta mercantil newspaper 
earlier this week i was chosen by chaves and i will leave with 
him it is unfortunate the two events must coincide 
petrobras has been rocked by financial scandal in which two 
directors last week were removed from their jobs after allegedly 
receiving kickbacks from banks in return for company accounts in 
those financial institutions 
federal police were to decide later this week whether to open a 
police enquiry based upon a petrobras report that discovered 
evidences and indications of wrongdoing by the petrobras 
officials

tenneco inc said wednesday it closed the 590 
million sale of its chalmette la refinery to mobil corp 
completing the sale of its tenneco oil co holdings 
the refinery sale which includes 30 million in working capital 
is part of a 73 billion divestiture designed to pay for tennecos 
repurchase of 209 million shares of its stock and pay down the 
companys outstanding debt 
net proceeds from all oil company sales after taxes and expenses 
are expected to total 64 billion tenneco said 
when we announced the sale in october we had expected to close 
all the parts of the total package by the end of the year and we 
have accomplished that goal said tenneco spokeswoman ma shute 
the overall sale has gone well and according to expectations 
tenneco a diversified corporation with major interests in 
natural gas pipelines farm and construction equipment automotive 
parts and chemicals was the nations 10th largest oil company when 
it announced the results of bidding two months ago 
the success of that sale at a time the industry is suffering 
depressed oil prices surprised many analysts who had predicted the 
holdings would fetch between 5 billion and 7 billion 
analysts said the ability to package the oil company holdings 
apparently helped boost the price for tenneco which had about 85 
billion in outstanding debt when it announced the sale 
other companies that have bought chunks of tenneco oil included 
chevron corp which purchased tennecos gulf of mexico oil and 
natural gas reserves production facilities and lease interests for 
nearly 26 billion 
texas oilman t boone pickens mesa limited partnership bought 
the midcontinent division oil and gas subsidiary for 715 million 
cash 
shell petroleum co ltd part of the royal dutchshell group 
bought tennecos colombian operations for 500 million and british 
gas plc spent 1945 million on a variety of tennecos international 
oil and gas interests 
in a separate move tenneco has put its 1900mile louisiana 
intrastate gas corp pipeline and related facilities up for sale 
ms shute said wednesday that sale is pending 
the pipeline was purchased from goodyear tire amp rubber co for 
456 million in 1985
