launch of the discovery and its 
fiveastronaut crew could be scheduled for late next week as nasa 
prepares for the third postchallenger shuttle mission 
nasa officials who planned to announce a launch date today said 
wednesday the liftoff would occur no sooner than march 11 because of 
the need to replace a failed electrical part in one of the shuttles 
three main engines 
the target date had been march 9 but the air force told nasa 
monday that it planned to launch a highpriority military rocket on 
that day and could not support a shuttle flight with air force 
tracking facilities 
the electrical part problem apparently took care of that 
potential conflict but a delay in the military flight could affect 
the shuttle launch on a daybyday basis the air force mission has 
priority for national security reasons 
during five days in orbit discoverys astronauts are to deploy a 
large communications satellite and conduct scientific experiments

the socalled february ratings sweep indicate nbc 
and cbs have rebounded from last years writers strike but network 
executives say the septemberapril season used to track the 
ratings race should be yearlong 
i know you guys love races said david poltrack cbs vice 
president for marketing but any discussion of fullseason results 
is a historical curiosity and not a marketing issue and a 
disservice to us 
alan wurtzel abcs senior vice president for marketing and 
research said the season race is now a spectator sport and 
means nothing except for bragging rights 
in 1989 to say there is a season is so antiquated said 
wurtzel that means we would be abdicating the audience five 
months of the year and thats not something we can afford to do 
nbc entertainment president brandon tartikoff has long held that 
the ratings race season should be yearround too but such talk 
didnt come up at thursdays nbc briefing on the february sweep 
rating period one of four months a year when local tv ratings are 
measured to determine advertising rates 
but then nbc is winning another season handsdown 
ten years ago when the average viewer had few channels available 
the networks didnt have to worry about losing their audience to 
competition from cable or videocassettes over the summer but times 
have changed the audience that has access to an average of 25 
channels will go elsewhere if the networks fail to offer them what 
they want to watch 
in february the networks did 
the cbs miniseries lonesome dove and the heated competition 
it encouraged boosted the networks aggregate rating after a more 
than yearlong decline 
the fournight lonesome dove boosted thirdplace cbs above 
abc in the february sweep and makes second place for the season a 
tossup 
nbc won the sweep with an average ac nielsen co rating of 
163 cbs had a 147 and abc a 124 the rating is a percentage of 
904 million us homes with televisions 
abc had a 28 percent decline in february compared to february 
1988 when it had the winter olympics nbc and cbs showed increases 
this february over last 
abc was forced because of the writers strike to run the first 
18hour stretch of its 32hour miniseries war and remembrance in 
november hardly a ratings blockbuster it still did better than 
abcs regular programming the decision to run the program then came 
back to haunt the network in february when war and remembrance 
was to have run 
clearly we had a disappointing sweeps said wurtzel 
we did not have an enormous inventory because we had to play 
war and remembrance early and we had planned to play it in 
february he said the other two networks knew that and planned 
accordingly 
cbs got a big push both in ratings and morale from the 
critically acclaimed lonesome dove the highestrated network 
miniseries in more than four years but the miniseries success 
pleased abc and nbc too 
i think lonesome dove was beneficial to everybody said 
wurtzel network television needs to have exciting wellmade 
programming 
nbc even used figures from the week of lonesome dove to 
contend that network reach has not declined in the past decade 
even if ratings have 
say we the networks are all throwing a party explained 
gerald jaffe nbcs vice president for research projects the same 
number of people come to the party but instead of staying 2 hours 
maybe they stay two hours then they go to someone elses party

where drivers passing the 
maximumsecurity nevada state prison see a grim centuryold 
building of handhewn granite blocks and iron window bars disney 
production people saw a set for tom sellecks next movie 
they wanted a building with a forbidden look for hard rain a 
story set in a california prison in the early 1900s 
producer robert cort and director peter yates considered about 60 
prisons and visited 15 sites before deciding to film outdoor scenes 
at the prison located on the outskirts of the state capital in the 
high desert of northwest nevada 
the nevada facility was chosen because it had two yards and we 
could be guaranteed that their security would not interfere with our 
work and our work wouldnt interfere with their security said 
ellen pasternak the movies unit publicist 
robin holabird deputy director of nevadas film office said 
while the disney movie is the most recent planned for the prison 
her office receives a steady stream of requests for information and 
visits from producers interested in filming at the historic building 
when they come scouting we tell them were interested and will 
take extra steps so they know were serious about making a movie 
she said if all we could offer them was a new jail it could not 
have been done 
with hard rain nevada joins a growing number of governments 
marketing prisons as movie sets to attract the millions of dollars 
local economies can generate from hollywood moviemakers looking 
beyond california for new locations and lower production costs 
weve got lots of competition when it comes to prisons said 
bill marsden of the ministry of culture film board in alberta 
canada which tried unsuccessfully to attract the disney co by 
offering a vacant 19th century prison and prisoners from a 
neighboring jail as extras for hard rain 
now there are so many film commissions that when producers send 
out circulars saying theyre looking for a prison theyre sorting 
through photos for weeks marsden said 
ohio caught the attention of filmmakers by featuring the vacant 
state penitentiary in columbus in a prison for rent advertising 
campaign that ran in movie catalogs and magazines 
it described it almost like a real estate dialogue on a piece 
of property complete with electric chair said rj cavallaro 
assistant manager of the ohio film bureau 
ohio stopped running the prison for rent advertisement a year 
ago cavallaro said partly because the campaigns success 
stereotyped the state as a location for making prison movies 
we do have a lot of prisons and we really are grateful that 
filmmakers think of us when they think of prison movies but we also 
have to promote the rest of a very diverse state he said 
iowa state officials recently began an aggressive campaign 
promoting two state prisons by mailing out color fliers to 9000 
movie makers according to wendell jarvis director of the iowa film 
office 
weve had a couple of feature films shot here recently and they 
brought in several million dollars in a short period of time we 
want to open the doors up to bring in more of that money and work 
for iowa people he said 
jarvis said iowa wardens were enthusiastic about advertising 
their prisons and have agreed to let crews film in working prisons 
they realize theyre part of our economic development effort 
just like anyone else he said 
arizonas chief warden no longer allows moviemakers in the 
arizona state prison at florence once a popular location for films 
because of security and discipline concerns according to william 
mccallum director of the arizona motion picture office mccallum 
now passes requests for the florence prison featured in stir 
crazy and raising arizona on to states with available prisons 
weve probably lost millions of dollars because we cant get 
the business he said 
in addition to money the local nevada economy can expect to make 
from hard rain when disney hires local workers and buys 
supplies the nevada state prison itself will get economic benefits 
from the movie according to lt mike budge a prison official and 
consultant for the movie 
they had to give something to the inmates and theyre donating 
money to the inmate welfare fund and with that money were 
purchasing recreational equipment he said 
budge said the prison will get to keep a truck and 350 sets of 
inmate denims disney is supplying for the movie 
theyre also building a permanent guard post and adding fencing 
and razor wire because they want it to look more confining and that 
only adds to our security he said 
the announcement that disney planned to make a movie at the 
prison also improved discipline among inmates 300 of whom will be 
hired as extras budge said 
nobody wants to get locked up and miss their chance to be in 
the movie he said

it will be four years on march 11 that mikhail s 
gorbachev came to power in the kremlin instituting a policy of 
restructuring to the soviet system and bringing about a greater 
openess of that closed society following is the first of a series 
of reports by ap correspondents in moscow assaying those four years 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
president mikhail s gorbachev says he was once 
asked by a farmer what he was trying to accomplish with all his 
reforms 
simply we want in spite of everything for working people 
to lead a better life gorbachev said he replied i thought it 
was enough to say 
perhaps its as simple as that the quaint wish of a russian 
peasants son who grew up in such hardship that at one point he was 
kept out of school for want of shoes 
but he was taught to dream in the time of nikita s khrushchev 
another reformist soviet leader of humble origins and indications 
are gorbachev dreams of grander more profound changes not just for 
the people but for the state 
seventy years after the russian revolution the soviet economy is 
in serious trouble and communism has not provided a better life for 
workers who yearn for bigger apartments better working conditions 
more nourishing and varied food and an economy ruled from the 
center has not kept pace with the technology of the west 
in what would by american measure be a full presidential term 
gorbachev has made wholesale changes in the way the world perceives 
him and the nation he leads he has thrown open prisons and labor 
camps and in some cases borders to free thousands of political 
prisoners and permit tens of thousands of people to leave the 
country 
he has eased although certainly not eliminated the fear of 
foreigners under glasnost he has converted the mass media from 
a tightly controlled propaganda organ to a braying calliope of 
complaints debates exposes and experiments testing just how far 
the new openness may go and to what purpose 
yet for all his effort the changes at home have been largely 
atmospheric his plans for perestroika or restructuring soviet 
society have faltered 
the forces that keep this vast nation a drab monolithic parody 
of the communist state envisioned by its founders resist each 
tangible step toward that better life gorbachev seeks for those 
he calls the simple people who are the salt of our countries 
store shelves are barren meat butter cheese and sugar are 
widely rationed such simple necessities as winter boots and 
windshield wipers are perpetually unavailable and consumers may 
wait for years to buy longoutdated models of modern 
conveniences such as washing machines cars or even electric irons 
the air in urban areas is filthy the water unreliable living 
quarters poorly planned and filled far beyond capacity crash 
construction programs produce instant ruins crumbling high rises 
barely habitable by the time they are occupied years after their 
first cracked concrete slabs were laid to start them on their way 
one of the imponderables of this tumultuous time is how long even 
a remarkably dynamic and politically astute leader has to accomplish 
the goals he has set for himself fighting the shortcomings of the 
system and inertiabound bureaucrats 
one simple measure of how long the road is and how much time 
progress takes last summer the communist party central committee 
set as a national goal the installation of a telephone in just 
onehalf of all soviet homes by 1995 people in urban areas wait 
years for a phone and many rural districts dont have any service 
villagers five miles from moscow draw their water from community 
wells 
it is a fundamental tenet of official american analysis that the 
better life gorbachev seeks for his countrymen is not an end in 
itself but the means of maintaining his nations superpower status 
in a fastchanging world the soviet union according to that view 
can no longer afford its own military might and cant use its power 
to keep pace with or even steal the technology that is quickly 
increasing the gulf between the industrialized west and the 
longstagnant east 
as gorbachev has pressed for more discussion of problems 
modernization of services development of private initiative and 
greater public participation in the political process westerners 
have been tempted to think he is trying to fashion a nation 
resembling the worlds other great superpower the united states 
a pragmatic leader who calls himself a realist gorbachev 
repeatedly insists he intends to work within the framework of 
socialism both he and alexander yakovlev said to be his closest 
adviser have written books critical of the united states and what 
they said was its intolerance for other ways of life and thought 
regardless of any personal vision gorbachev is pushed by 
economic reality to reorder soviet priorities 
he doesnt have the resources to sustain the investments the 
soviet union is making in foreign policy and defense said one 
western analyst who discussed the issue on condition he not be 
identified 
nato estimates the soviet union devotes 15 percent to 25 percent 
of its gross national product to the military 
even the lower end of that range would be enormous by world 
standards the analyst said the upper end is truly staggering 
but thats not all because that same 15 to 25 percent monopolizes 
the countrys scientific and technological resources and people 
to begin reducing those figures gorbachev already has negotiated 
the first treaty reducing us and soviet nuclear arsenals and has 
announced substantial unilateral reductions in soviet grounds forces 
at home and abroad including this months completion of the 
withdrawal from afghanistan 
part of the reordering of priorities is to work on what 
gorbachev calls the enemy image the analyst said he has to 
persuade other leaders hes serious and lower the perception of risk 
in the rest of the world

even in good times its hard for southerners 
to trash anything that comes from a hog hence the presidential 
snack pork rinds 
you dont throw nothing away said larry pierce manager of 
the nahunta pork center you use everything from a hog but the 
squeal 
its the finest food substance available on the planet said 
state sen wendell murphy a duplin county hog farmer and one of the 
largest pork producers in the nation 
hogs provide hams pork chops bacon and sausage their feet are 
pickled the intestines are used as casings for sausage the tails 
are used for seasoning and the hide ends up in fancy driving gloves 
hush puppy shoes and president george bushs favorite munchie 
pierce who produces pork rinds thinks its great that bush 
prefers them with tabasco sauce but if the president wants some of 
nahuntas homestyle skins hell have to come to this crossroads 50 
miles southeast of raleigh to get them 
it will probably be good for the pork industry but theres not 
much way for it to help our business said pierce whose father 
founded the company 24 years ago we process 100 skins a week and 
cant meet the demand from our customers as it is 
the pork company which makes up most of nahunta started as a 
slaughterhouse in 1955 and added retail pork sales in 1975 it does 
not distribute its products but more than 3000 people a week come 
by to pick out fresh pork and cured hams they also grab up 99cent 
bags of pierces salted and deepfried pork skins 
we process about 500 hogs a week pierce said but were 
real particular about the skins we use if they arent quite up to 
snuff we wont use them thats why we only turn about 100 skins a 
week into pork rinds 
a special machine slices the skin off of pork pieces the skin 
pieces are cooked for four hours in vats to dry out the fat then 
the hard shriveled skins are deep fried 
the pieces of skin swell and pop turning into puffy slabs of 
rind in minutes 
this is our scientific measuring process pierce said as he 
dipped a handful of salt from a bucket and spread it over the fried 
rinds 
ones that come out like this we throw away he said 
plucking a dark hard chunk from among the beige sheets of fried 
skin and weve got two grades of rinds 
the ones that come out really nice and thin are no ones he 
said your thicker skins that come out a little tougher are no 
twos 
a bag of no ones which weighs a little more than 3 ounces and 
a 12ounce bag of no twos go for the same price 99 cents 
we actually sell more of the no twos pierce said people 
seem to like to gnaw on them a little bit 
a halfounce serving of pork rinds provides little in the way of 
nutrition potato chips and peanuts have more nutrients but also 
more fat and cholesterol 
a us department of agriculture analysis showed a twoounce 
package of rinds contains 315 calories 325 grams of protein 189 
grams of fat 58 milligrams of cholesterol and 1054 milligrams of 
salt 
the snack food association said pork rind sales nationally 
totaled 195 million in 1987 a figure dwarfed by potato chips 
which had 38 billion in sales the same year 
dwayne pilkington a professor of food science at north carolina 
state university said the origin of pork rinds is lost in history 
i dont know when people started popping skins or why 
pilkington said i dont know if its a takeoff from the old days 
of crackling or what 
crackling or cracklin is hog fat that has the lard squeezed 
out of it and is then cooked in some areas the layer of fat was 
ground up with the skin to make the crisp treat 
it could be that somebody had a piece of skin left over from 
cracklin put it on a stove and it popped sort of an accidental 
discovery pilkington said 
pierce said he isnt sure why pork rinds have remained a regional 
delicacy limited mainly to the south 
murphy who raises a million hogs a year said other areas of the 
country have just lagged behind the south in realizing how good pork 
rinds are 
anybody that doesnt like them has just never tasted them 
murphy said murphy a democrat said he was aware of the republican 
presidents use of symbolism in the 1988 campaign but he did not 
believe bush used pork rinds as a populist snack to fight a 
lessthanmacho image 
i really think he ate them before the presidential campaign 
murphy said but maybe nobody paid much attention to what he ate 
when he wasnt the president the office sure changes that

a 60day 1200mile ski and dog sled 
trek from siberia to alaska will be more celebration than 
exploration for a dozen us and soviet adventurers setting out this 
weekend 
aside from coldweather research the primary object of the 
bering bridge expedition across seldomvisited sections of the 
soviet far east and arctic alaska is good will said paul schurke 
33 of ely minn who describes the trip as adventure diplomacy 
my pocket is full of crossflagged ussoviet pins 
schurke said well be leaving a fullsized american flag in each 
soviet village a soviet flag in each alaska village 
the expedition is an attempt to call attention to the common 
cultural heritage of the indigenous population of the bering region 
schurke said 
some of the team members have relatives on opposite sides of the 
border and it is hoped the trek will result in a relaxation of 
rules barring visits by natives some of whom live within 2 miles 
of one another on islands in the bering strait separated only by 
sea ice and cold war politics 
the sixmember us team arrived in this siberian city of 16000 
wednesday after two weather delays 
they joined their six soviet counterparts for a news conference 
a vip dinner and the beginning of several days of medical 
experiments it was the first visit in decades by americans to this 
treeless city built of locally produced concrete blocks set atop 
permafrost 
three soviets and three americans on the journey are natives and 
speak several local dialects including yupik a language common to 
eskimos in both countries 
the trek across ancient trade and migration routes up the 
siberian side of the bering strait and down the alaskan side is to 
stop in 16 villages in the chukotka district of siberia and 14 in 
alaska organizers said it will end about april 1 in kotzebue 
alaska just above the arctic circle and about 550 miles northwest 
of anchorage 
youth groups have arranged for festivities which will include 
receptions and sharing of native dances and hopefully some native 
foods schurke said 
we expect we will come up with some sort of goodwill ceremony 
that well stick with for each of our visits and then let it roll 
spontaneously 
negotiations began a week ago between the us state department 
and the soviets on reopening the border closed by the soviets 
during the berlin blockade in 1948 schurke said he hoped a treaty 
might be ready for signing as early as april 1 on the bering sea ice 
what marks this trip is the sheer volume of human contact 
said schurke veteran of an unsupplied sled dog expedition to the 
north pole in 1986 the populations of the villages we will be 
visiting totals close to 50000 
most of the journey will be on relatively smooth coastal ice 
with detours around pressure ridges and open water there was 
concern about huge stretches of open water reported near the us 
island of little diomede and the soviet island of big diomede which 
flank the international dateline and the border dividing the two 
countries 
there is big water in the bering straits said dimitri 
shparo the soviet coleader of the expedition who was speaking 
through an interpreter that could force us to detour several 
hundred miles north to find ice 
the farther we go into march the more the sun will work on the 
ice the 47yearold polar explorer said the ocean current 
moving through those two islands also is fierce 
the expedition is only the latest attempt to warm the climate in 
superpower relations at the point where the nations are closest 
us and soviet officials and eskimos flew from nome to the 
siberian port of provideniya for a oneday visit last spring and a 
group of soviets spent the last week of february in alaska for talks 
with government and industry leaders

the pilgrims were happy with venison and beef 
jerky yuppies turned to blackened redfish and quiche but are you 
ready for the meal of choice in the 21st century try gas flushed 
chicken 
that entree was among an array of culinary choices outlined 
thursday that food experts believe may comprise our menus in the 
future 
more encouraging however is the ease with which we may buy such 
items video shopping according to experts is one possibility 
robot checkout cashiers is another 
fast food is too damn slow said marty friedman editor of 
new product news no one has time for fast food anymore 
but if the food writers and product spokesmen at the 11th annual 
international association of cooking professionals are correct we 
dont have much to look forward to 
they foresee a world where cooking becomes something few 
understand while heating becomes something everyone does 
fast food home delivery triple packaged resealable potato 
chips oat bran popcorn and melting pot ethnic foods like the 
burritski a burrito filled with polish sausage are almost 
upon us 
the real villain they said can be summed up in one word 
microwave 
because todays busy career people want food on demand the 
microwave is threatening to reshape the way we cook and eat 
according to richard nelson director of marketing research for the 
campbell soup co 
theyll probably be one microwave per person in the future 
said nelson who used a slide show to accompany his address at the 
convention that way no one will have to wait to eat 
nelson flashed a slide he said symbolized the microwaves impact 
on society the picture showed a haughty waiter at a fancy 
restaurant asking a welldressed patron how would you like your 
steak done sir 
the customer responded three minutes on high turned every 30 
seconds 
but countering the trend toward heavily packaged microwave food 
has been the publics demand for fresh food without preservatives 
the freshly prepared game was started by small entrepreneurs in 
major urban markets said nelson now the big boys want to 
play 
the challenge facing food manufacturers in the future will be how 
to create fresh foods with a shelf life while keeping up with 
continual demands for products to use in the microwave the 
panelists said 
one example is gas flushed chicken the term for a hightech 
packaging process in which the bird is precooked without 
preservatives in a vacuumsealed bag the end result doesnt require 
refrigeration 
convenience health indulgence those will be the major 
issues in the future said richard gerstman a food consultant 
with gerstman and myers 
the current tendency toward cocooning the panelists said 
will play a major role in how food is purchased in the future 
people are just going to want to put on their slippers and turn 
on the vcr they wont want to go out said friedman 
stores in chicago are already testing a cable home food shopping 
program and a chain in atlanta is testing automated checkers the 
panelists said 
but for those who like an occasional foray to the supermarket 
they may also find the shopping cart of the future has changed 
video carts will come with a flashing screen promoting various 
products 
among harried husbands and wives of the future the experts 
predicted the greeting upon returning home will be whose turn is 
it to heat

new sunday tabloid in naked city 
this weekend the new york post joins the crowd at the citys 
sunday newsstands its fleet street tilt a fading memory as it 
challenges the daily news and new york newsday for tabloid supremacy 
on the weeks higheststakes advertising day 
the post is confident about its debut sunday its competitors are 
ready and waiting 
when you see this paper on saturday night its going to look 
like a sunday paper thats been around for 30 40 years promised 
peter kalikow the real estate magnate who saved the post from 
extinction one year ago with a 37 million takeover 
the sections are right the comics are right the magazine is 
right its really there 
to let the public know its plans the post put commercials on 
television and a clever fullpage advertisement friday in one of its 
competitors the new york times 
the times ad in the form of two tabloidsize pages on the back 
of times front section could be folded to simulate the posts 
front and back pages 
a banner news headline in the ad said it was announcing a cure 
for the common sunday another headline over what would be the 
sports page reads post goes to game 7 
industry analysts question if the financing and the market are 
right they predict the posts move to sunday where a successful 
newspaper makes 40 percent to 50 percent of its advertising money 
could mean the demise of at least one of the tabloids 
the question is whether this market is capable of supporting 
three daily tabloids ask god and the readers said daily news 
editor f gilman spencer this one is in stable shape without any 
question were in good shape to take on all comers 
kalikow on the eve of running out 575000 copies of the sunday 
post believes three tabloids can live happily ever after in new 
york ad space for the first three weeks in the 128page paper is 
sold out including space in the pullout book and travel sections 
kalikow said 
he also cites changes recently made in the competitions sunday 
editions as evidence his paper is already a factor the news 
expanded sports page newsdays additional color pages spencer and 
newsday associate publisher steven isenberg said those moves were in 
works before the post went weekend 
none of this is expected to affect the new york times or its 
massive sunday edition the times can stand back and wait and 
then see whos left said industry analyst john morton 
but while kalikow is confident others in the industry remain 
skeptical the last time the post had a sunday edition was during a 
newspaper strike in 1978 it was scrapped when the strike ended 
so far there does not appear to be room for three profitable 
daily tabloids thats certainly the same for sunday said 
newspaper analyst bruce thorp of the provident national bank im 
not convinced theres room for two profitable daily tabloids 
agreed morton the problem is youve got a town that probably 
cant support that many newspapers new york is probably the last 
remaining city with the market segmentation to support two 
newspapers 
but three or four in the long run is probably not doable 
the post runs third in the city circulation race trailing the 
daily news 1281706 and the new york times 1038829 and 
leading new york newsday 176043 according to the audit bureau of 
circulations figures from sept 30 1988 kalikow anticipates a 
similar sunday showing 
morton and thorp cited other problems the post faces lack of 
home delivery kalikow says a major push to change that is under 
way overcoming sunday readership loyalty kalikow believes the 
papers 550473 weekday readers will buy the post tremendous 
startup costs kalikow without mentioning figures says the sunday 
paper is here to stay 
here for the papers first 12 weeks is a reader inducement a 1 
million stock market game which also will run in weekdays 
more likely to draw readers are the changes wrought at the post 
under editor jane amsterdam in the year since kalikows purchase of 
the paper which was founded in 1801 by alexander hamilton 
gone are many of the rupert murdoch flourishes which marked his 
reign at the post no more headless body in topless bar

millions of americans age 65 and over should get 
flu shots every year but most dont bother in part because of 
unfounded fears of the vaccine federal health experts say 
the national centers for disease control said thursday that only 
12 percent of americans in a recent survey said they had received an 
influenza vaccination in the preceding year that included only 32 
percent of those 65 and over a group at increased risk for death or 
severe complications from the flu 
an official 1990 us health objective calling for at least 60 
percent of older americans to receive annual flu shots is not 
likely to be met the cdc conceded in its report 
unfortunately there are a lot of fears of side effects from 
the vaccine and a lot of misconceptions that the vaccine can cause 
influenza neither of which is true said dr mary ann sprauer a 
cdc immunization specialist 
current flu vaccines do not cause influenza themselves and they 
cause a day or two of fever and aches in fewer than 10 percent of 
those who take the shot she said 
the cdcs survey on health risks and behavior patterns was 
conducted in 1987 in 31 participating states and washington dc 
only 7 percent of those 1844 11 percent of those 4564 and 32 
percent of those 65 and up said they had received flu vaccine in the 
previous 12 months 
the cdc especially recommends flu vaccine for people at increased 
risk of severe complications from influenza including older people 
and those already suffering from certain chronic medical problems 
such as heart disease 
other surveys have shown that only about 20 percent of 
highrisk individuals get the shot in a typical year said dr 
walter gunn a cdc flu specialist in addition to fears about the 
vaccine he said many people just dont know that flu typically 
kills 20000 americans in the average year 
adding to the problem ms sprauer said is the fact that 
often health care providers dont recommend the vaccine a lot of 
patients would be willing to get it if it were offered to them 
among the states participating in the healthrisk survey new 
york had the worst rate of flu vaccination only 9 percent hawaii 
was highest at 19 percent 
among older people in particular percentages ranged from 24 
percent in rhode island to 41 percent in montana 
flu vaccine is believed to be about 90 percent effective in 
preventing illness in healthy younger people and about 75 percent 
effective in preventing serious illness or death in highrisk 
elderly populations the cdc reported 
the atlantabased cdc also reported thursday that the 198889 flu 
season is continuing at serious levels 
a key indicator of severe flu activity the cdcs tracking of 
deaths from either pneumonia or flu in selected cities was at 
higherthanexpected levels last week for the fifth week in a row 
gunn said 
that indicator now has reached its highest point this winter 
as bad as anything weve had in the past several years he said 
gunn said the predominant flu strains circulating in the united 
states are those known as the victoria flu the taiwan flu and the 
sichuan flu all of which are protected against by the recommended 
198889 flu vaccine

even in good times its hard for southerners 
to trash anything that comes from a hog hence the presidential 
snack pork rinds 
you dont throw nothing away said larry pierce manager of 
the nahunta pork center you use everything from a hog but the 
squeal 
its the finest food substance available on the planet said 
state sen wendell murphy a duplin county hog farmer and one of the 
largest pork producers in the nation 
hogs provide hams pork chops bacon and sausage their feet are 
pickled the intestines are used as casings for sausage the tails 
are used for seasoning and the hide ends up in fancy driving gloves 
hush puppy shoes and president george bushs favorite munchie 
pierce who produces pork rinds thinks its great that bush 
prefers them with tabasco sauce but if the president wants some of 
nahuntas homestyle skins hell have to come to this crossroads 50 
miles southeast of raleigh to get them 
it will probably be good for the pork industry but theres not 
much way for it to help our business said pierce whose father 
founded the company 24 years ago we process 100 skins a week and 
cant meet the demand from our customers as it is 
the pork company which makes up most of nahunta started as a 
slaughterhouse in 1955 and added retail pork sales in 1975 it does 
not distribute its products but more than 3000 people a week come 
by to pick out fresh pork and cured hams they also grab up 99cent 
bags of pierces salted and deepfried pork skins 
we process about 500 hogs a week pierce said but were 
real particular about the skins we use if they arent quite up to 
snuff we wont use them thats why we only turn about 100 skins a 
week into pork rinds 
a special machine slices the skin off of pork pieces the skin 
pieces are cooked for four hours in vats to dry out the fat then 
the hard shriveled skins are deep fried 
the pieces of skin swell and pop turning into puffy slabs of 
rind in minutes 
this is our scientific measuring process pierce said as he 
dipped a handful of salt from a bucket and spread it over the fried 
rinds 
ones that come out like this we throw away he said 
plucking a dark hard chunk from among the beige sheets of fried 
skin and weve got two grades of rinds 
the ones that come out really nice and thin are no ones he 
said your thicker skins that come out a little tougher are no 
twos 
a bag of no ones which weighs a little more than 3 ounces and 
a 12ounce bag of no twos go for the same price 99 cents 
we actually sell more of the no twos pierce said people 
seem to like to gnaw on them a little bit 
a halfounce serving of pork rinds provides little in the way of 
nutrition potato chips and peanuts have more nutrients but also 
more fat and cholesterol 
a us department of agriculture analysis showed a twoounce 
package of rinds contains 315 calories 325 grams of protein 189 
grams of fat 58 milligrams of cholesterol and 1054 milligrams of 
salt 
the snack food association said pork rind sales nationally 
totaled 195 million in 1987 a figure dwarfed by potato chips 
which had 38 billion in sales the same year 
dwayne pilkington a professor of food science at north carolina 
state university said the origin of pork rinds is lost in history 
i dont know when people started popping skins or why 
pilkington said i dont know if its a takeoff from the old days 
of crackling or what 
crackling or cracklin is hog fat that has the lard squeezed 
out of it and is then cooked in some areas the layer of fat was 
ground up with the skin to make the crisp treat 
it could be that somebody had a piece of skin left over from 
cracklin put it on a stove and it popped sort of an accidental 
discovery pilkington said 
pierce said he isnt sure why pork rinds have remained a regional 
delicacy limited mainly to the south 
murphy who raises a million hogs a year said other areas of the 
country have just lagged behind the south in realizing how good pork 
rinds are 
anybody that doesnt like them has just never tasted them 
murphy said murphy a democrat said he was aware of the republican 
presidents use of symbolism in the 1988 campaign but he did not 
believe bush used pork rinds as a populist snack to fight a 
lessthanmacho image 
i really think he ate them before the presidential campaign 
murphy said but maybe nobody paid much attention to what he ate 
when he wasnt the president the office sure changes that

winemaker serge hochar like some of his 
competitors likes to sell no wine before its time but in wartorn 
beirut its not always up to him to decide 
you never know if youll be hit hochar said wednesday 
adding that hes missed some vintages when fighting broke out near 
his chateau musar the bestknown of lebanons five wineries 
i must say i have been very lucky said the vintner whose 
products are internationally rated among the top wines of the middle 
east my home 200 yards from the fire line between east and west 
beirut has been bombed only three times in the last 14 years and i 
managed to escape 
the beirutborn winemaker who is in his 50s styles his wine for 
cosmopolitan tastes he was in san francisco on wednesday on a 
sevencity us tour to market his wines which ranged from 1959 to 
1980 
despite his unpredictable environment hochar says he will not 
release a vintage if he doesnt like it and he insists on holding 
his wines in cellars for at least eight years 
i am not a political man i am a wine man and a wine man is a 
human person because i work with life i keep my vines and my wines 
alive he said 
hochar makes 15000 to 20000 cases of wine a year at the 
30yearold winery founded by his father gaston the star is his 
bordeaux red a blend of cabernet sauvignon cinsault and syrah 
it can take weeks for hochar to get grapes from the bekaa valley 
40 miles south of beirut to his winery in lebanons embattled 
capital city 
we have to cross five or six checkpoints many borders 
sometimes we have to go south from the vineyard and sail back by 
boat 
and everywhere he said he must pay duty at each border and to 
whomever has the power or a gun 
you get used to it after a while he said you dont 
realize you are in a war situation you live with it in 
lebanon you can always manage to find a few friends to make things

tenor neil shicoff triumphed in the title role of 
werther on thursday night as the metropolitan opera performed 
the massenet opera for the first time this season 
in the first scene when werther is marveling at a garden the 
emotionalism of the goethe hero was in his voice later shicoffs 
voice shimmered without any of the italian sound which would be 
wrong for this french opera 
after an exceptionally long second intermission an announcement 
was made that shicoff had been suffering from flu for a week but 
would continue this was a surprise since neither vocal difficulty 
nor the added resonance that a cold sometimes gives were heard 
shicoffs final act was as splendid as the two before he even 
managed to create sympathy for werther longing for charlotte who 
is married we havent great patience for werthers romanticism 
these days 
mezzosoprano kathleen kuhlmann who was born in san francisco 
was making her met debut as charlotte she get fulls marks for vocal 
production and preparation of the role but her voice isnt 
attractive it isnt shrill or harsh it just isnt appealing in 
tone she sang charlotte in a new production in cologne and will 
sing the part in a new production in hamburg 
dawn upshaw as charlottes sister sophie has a clear but 
creamy soprano instead of getting by on being pert as some sophies 
do the nashvilleborn soprano sang it beautifully bernd weikl of 
vienna sang albert charlottes husband for the first time at the 
met with a warmly inflected voice 
the four are all attractive on stage 
jean fournet from rouen france conducted he made his met debut 
in 1987 with another french opera samson and dalila

an ohio river barge carrying a 1000ton 
nuclear reactor from the nations first decommissioned commercial 
nuclear power plant passed this city thursday on its twomonth 
8100mile trip to burial at hanford wash 
theres a bit of history here said mike mckerman a 
consultant to the us department of energy on the project i like 
to think of it as the end of the beginning of nuclear power 
mckernan said the nuclear plant at shippingport pa was the 
first commercial nuclear plant to be commissioned in the united 
states and the first to be decommissioned it is the first in the 
world to be dismantled 
duquesne light co of pittsburgh began operating the plant in 
1957 and closed it down in 1982 duquesne operates two other nuclear 
power plants at shippingport about 35 miles southwest of pittsburgh 
along the ohio river 
earlier this month the reactor was mounted on the barge paul 
bunyan the barge pushed by the motor vessel pere marquette left 
shippingport on tuesday for new orleans doe spokesman tom bauman 
said 
the doe has spent a lot of money on this thing to make sure it 
is safe said al zupon of the army corps of engineers in 
pittsburgh you could sit on top of this thing and ride it down 
the river with no threat of radiation 
we are being updated on the tows progress twice a day 
mckerman said so far there have been no problems it is moving 
along just as it was planned 
the reactor which is 35 feet long and 25 feet high and encased 
in concrete is being shipped to an energy department disposal site 
for burial bauman said 
the vessel will take the ohio river to the mississippi river to 
the gulf of mexico to the panama canal and the pacific ocean north 
to washington state the journey is expected to take about 60 days 
officials said 
the reactor parts were packed in concrete before being loaded 
onto the paul bunyan last month but the trip was delayed because of 
bad weather bauman said

william randolph hearst couldnt have put it 
clearer why asked editor charles peters summing up the 
philosophy that has guided his magazine for 20 years should i 
publish something i dont agree with 
nonetheless to celebrate a survival that was never a sure thing 
the march issue of peters skinny magazine the washington monthly 
violates his own premise 
whats wrong with this magazine asks the cover inside 11 
former editors are allowed to take issue with the boss one of 
washingtons enduring curmudgeons 
the result the reader gets to watch liberalism argue with itself 
none of marchs contributors quarrels with the monthlys 
fundamental liberal philosophy one it is no more likely to abandon 
than popular mechanics would question the utility of the basement 
workbench 
but like popular mechanics peters magazine has been concerned 
with the way things actually work and why they dont if they dont 
his view is that they often dont his goal is to expose and 
correct the follies of liberalism he calls it neoliberalism 
we were not trying to move the democratic party to the right 
recalls former monthly writer nicholas lemann we were trying to 
make liberalism even better and stronger than it already was 
like scores of other onetime monthly writers lemann moved on to 
better pay in his case at the atlantic peters paid his editors 
10000 a year himself 24000 but gave them the chance to write 
and be read in washington 
the magazine has 33000 subscribers and after a long struggle 
is in the black peters a former west virginia legislator and peace 
corps executive founded it with some help from investors including 
sen jay rockefeller dwva a fellow former peace corpsman 
arthur levine now with us news amp world report takes the 
monthly to task for not coming to grips with the full consequences 
of its advocacy of a less greedy way of life 
if were to be less materialistic it means that well buy 
fewer products and there will be less revenue for business the hard 
question that neoliberals and others havent asked is can we have 
more time for families and volunteerism less materialism and still 
have high economic growth i dont think so 
gregg easterbrook now a contributing editor of newsweek accuses 
the monthly of harboring an unwholesome suspicion of profits 
occasionally companies make big profits via fraud monopoly or 
other chicanery he writes usually they make big profits 
because they deserve to the market is pretty effective in 
distributing that reward 
anyway asks easterbrook whats so bad about the 
serviceyuppiepaper economy that america is becoming 
the monthly often laments that the backbreaking dangerous 
souldraining jobs in heavy industrial production are being replaced 
by highly paid whitecollar desk jobs sounds pretty good to me 
michael kinsley now editor of the new republic attacks peters 
perennial crusade for a peacetime draft 
telling people they must give up two years of their lives is a 
major infringement on freedom kinsley argues moreover if rich 
people were drafted into the army they would push out poor people 
who are there because they want to be he says its no favor to 
wouldbe volunteers to shut off this option in order to put others 
unwillingly in their place 
peters gives himself the last word accepting many of the 
criticisms but taking issue with others 
to easterbrook he says that whats wrong with maximizing profits 
is that it encourages corporations to take chances with worker 
safety to pollute the air to attempt to gain monopoly control of 
markets 
to levines growth arguments he says without economic growth 
we wont have the tax revenues necessary to clear up the 
environmental mess that already exists 
and to kinsley he says a draft would give america at least one 
social institution where rich and poor could come to know and 
understand one another 
upperclass participation in the military would give people 
with clout a compelling interest in avoiding war and in case war 
turns out to be unavoidable in being equipped with weapons that 
work peters writes thus a draft of the wealthy would both aid 
military reformers and enhance the prospect for peace

the jury in oliver norths irancontra trial 
had the day off today so the former white house aides lawyers could 
detail complaints that the government is censoring material to 
hamstring the defense 
us district judge gerhard a gesell is hearing arguments from 
norths attorneys that the classified information procedures act 
governing the handling of classified material in criminal trials 
should not be applied in this case 
north is accused of lying to congress and the attorney general 
about the reagan administrations secret attempts to aid the 
nicaraguan contras during a period in which us aid to the rebels 
was banned the government has made repeated attempts to censor 
evidence in the case 
the defense said in a court filing that the office of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh has knowingly obstructed the conduct of 
this trial as well as the crossexamination of a witness by 
imposing entirely unnecessary secrecy demands on information already 
in the public domain 
prosecutor john keker responded far from manipulating the 
process to its advantage the government is trying to declassify the 
information that is necessary to permit this trial to reach a 
conclusion 
the latest fight erupted when norths lawyers discovered that 
memos the government was trying to censor in court had been made 
public eight months earlier in a separate legal case 
defense lawyers said they found out monday night that classified 
memos written by norths courier to the contras robert owen had 
been turned over earlier to the christic institute which opposes 
us policy in central america 
confronted with that information the government said it would no 
longer consider the memos to be classified gesell however said he 
would review his rulings on secrecy in light of the problem 
norths lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on 
grounds of prosecutorial misconduct but gesell said he wasnt 
looking for sanctions against anyone he said his primary goal 
is to see that the trial is conducted properly 
on thursday two people involved in the contra supply network 
testified that north appeared to be the man in charge 
rafael quintero a cuban who had done work for the cia said 
north sought to reassure a high salvadoran air force official that 
president reagan supported the contra resupply effort 
quintero said that at a 1986 meeting in el salvador the official 
expressed concern about joining with north and others in assisting 
the contras and then possibly being left out in the cold after a 
few weeks or months 
north quintero said responded that mr reagan was totally 
behind this program and behind helping the contras and all we needed 
was more time for congress to approve aid 
in another instance retired air force lt col richard gadd who 
helped arrange for airplanes to carry supplies to the contras 
described a meeting with north in december 1985 at a washington 
hotel gadd said north turned to another air force retiree involved 
in the resupply operation richard secord and directed him to 
advance mr gadd 150000 for parachutes and other items the 
contras wanted gadd subsequently got 100000 
gadd arranged to provide airplanes for the covert contra supply 
operation at a time when us military aid to the contras was banned 
by congress 
north is accused of 12 crimes including five counts that he made 
false statements and obstructed congress in 1985 and 1986 by denying 
any involvement in the contra resupply operation

as glasnost and perestroika unfold in mikhail 
gorbachevs soviet union british spy novelists are looking beyond 
the evil empire rhetoric to a more complicated approach that blurs 
enemy lines 
what weve lost is the natural assumption that if you say 
russians youre talking about a certain character says gavin 
lyall creator of the popular cloakanddagger character harry maxim 
you cant be as simplistic anymore you move in a direction of 
possibly more subtlety said lyall 57 
anthony sampson remarked in the independent newspaper recently 
that those beloved villains the soviets are losing their 
villainy 
theyve all been undermined by that exasperatingly softspoken 
gorbachev as he insists on retreating from every filmic 
battleground from afghanistan to angola 
comments sunday times tv critic patrick stoddart if we are no 
longer to be scared of reds under the bed what on earth are we 
going to read before we turn out the light 
the drawing power of cold war drama remains strong however as 
shown by game set and match a 13part television adaptation of 
spy novelist len deightons trilogy aired in britain last fall it 
won critical acclaim and high ratings 
the deighton trilogy about a british intelligence agent whose 
wife turns out to be a soviet plant was written before glasnost 
became a household word but in interviews on the tv set 
codirector patrick lau insisted the work was glasnostinspired in 
that the enemy is no longer drawn in broadstroke cartoon 
characters 
richard cohen publishing director of centuryhutchinson books 
and former editor of famed spy novelist john le carre said 
writers are having to be a bit more sophisticated certain 
simplistic political maneuverings as the background to thrillers 
cant be used now 
he said glasnost is wiping the slate clean leaving open the 
question of where to locate the enemy 
rupert allason a conservative party lawmaker and espionage 
historian suggests the middle east whose secret services have a 
deep grounding and are every bit as challenging as the kgb was 10 to 
20 years ago 
lyalls recently published uncle target is set largely in 
jordan while his next book will take readers to morocco and bermuda 
ted allbeury 70 a british former intelligence officer who now 
writes highquality spy novels said the thaw accompanying moscows 
openness offered richer fodder 
it opens one more door he said in an interview if you can 
imagine the war that must be going on between the old kgb 
operators and the brighter people theyre using more 
allason who writes under the pseudonym nigel west told bbc 
radio last month its very difficult in this period to try and go 
back to the sinister figure of running spies all around the world 
the fact is the newspapers show us every day that they have 
failed and the kgb defections have in effect put karla le carres 
fictional soviet spymaster out of business 
not that the soviet union as a topic of interest is likely to go 
away the basic structure is as old as storytelling said 
richard cohen it does have a certain form to it 
john gardner who writes james bond novels by arrangement with 
the estate of bond creator ian fleming doesnt see glasnost and 
perestroika putting western intelligence out of business 
people say we must find a new evil and my response to that is 
the old one aint gone away its very much still there he said 
in an interview 
just because we have gorbachev saying wonderful things doesnt 
mean we relax any vigilance gardner said in an interview 
former british spy anthony cavendish worries that new british

the national zoo celebrated its 100th birthday 
this week with barbara bush leading the noisy hoopla but over at 
the smithsonians insect zoo things were so quiet you could 
actually hear the giant madagascar hissing cockroach hiss 
the silence was broken by shrieks and gasps from a class of 
firstgraders who gathered round to watch cleo the orangekneed 
mexican tarantula gobble her weekly meal of a live cricket 
if you blinked youd miss the show might these spiders be 
desperately hungry on such a spartan diet 
tarantulas dont burn a lot of calories said sally love the 
insect zoos director they just sit around waiting for something 
to bump into them they can go for a year and a half without eating 
anything at all 
miss love is plainly in love with bugs 
a george washington university graduate with a degree in biology 
she postponed plans to get a masters degree and quit her job as a 
grunt on capitol hill seven years ago to run the tiny insect zoo 
at the deadend of a thirdfloor hallway in the national museum of 
natural history 
insects are gaining momentum in popularity for some reason 
said miss love who has appeared on the johnny carson and david 
letterman television shows as well as west german and canadian tv to 
display the biggest showiest specimens from her zoo 
everybody has a horror and a fascination with insects she 
said but when people try to take a close look at insects they 
say hmmm theyre not so bad after all in fact they are really 
very interesting 
among the dramatic bugs she has chosen for her tv appearances 
she calls them the oh mys because of the audience reaction 
are some of the zoos 50 or so tarantulas a whip scorpion from 
arizona the giant walking stick from new guinea threeinch 
cockroaches rare leaf insects from sri lanka whose disguise is to 
look like the leaves they are devouring and scarab beetles and and 
coneheaded katydids from peru 
to the delight of school children on field trips to the zoo miss 
love consents to stare crosseyed as a giant madagascar hissing 
cockroach crawls up the side of her nose 
for this i went to school she says with a giggle 
miss love receives 20 a week to spend on fresh fruits and 
vegetables for her bugs most eat things like romaine lettuce and 
bananas but the large milkweed bug prefers sunflower seeds and raw 
peanuts 
the meat eaters tarantulas scorpions centipedes and the like 
eat crickets with an occasional caterpillar or beetle larvae 
tossed in for a treat the tobacco hornworms of course like 
tobacco and the giant coconut crabs from the seychelles in the 
indian ocean cant get enough of coconut cake with vitaminrich 
fish food sprinkled on top 
miss loves two staff assistants are augmented by 50 or 60 unpaid 
volunteers like henry gemmill 71 retired former managing editor 
and washington bureau chief of the wall street journal 
gemmill says he comes in every thursday to conduct a little 
horror show for the kiddies he drops a cricket into the tarantula 
sandbox and describes eversogently how the spider sucks the 
cricket soup from its prey the same way count dracula sank his 
fangs into beautiful maidens 
he also informs his young listeners that it doesnt seem 
entirely fair to me but in the world of bugs the female has 
achieved not only equality but a pretty clear superiority 
female spiders grow bigger and live much longer than males 
gemmill said and some even eat their husbands 
to which a young boy in the crowd responded thats the way it 
goes

mike and kim harnage of warner robins were honeymooning on a 
cruise ship when they put a note in a bottle and threw it into the 
ocean nov 5 1986 
two years of marriage and the recent birth of their daughter had 
put the bottled message far in the back of the harnages minds but 
after getting a postcard from estrade on feb 20 the couple was 
eager to talk with him 
i feel a lot better after talking to the guy said harnage 
who reached estrade by telephone wednesday estrade who lives on 
st kitts told him the note was brittle and the bottle was covered 
with barnacles 
there was no immediate word however on whether the harnages 
would take estrade up on his phone offer 
estrade made the discovery as he was walking on a beach st 
kitts is about 100 miles from the us virgin islands and east of 
puerto rico 
i found it kind of ironic that i would find this primitive form 
of communication when i work with stateofthe art equipment

as the nato alliance and the warsaw pact head 
into new arms control talks the gulf between the us and soviet 
approaches is so wide it makes prospects for a quick settlement 
uncertain 
the western allies under us leadership want sharp reductions 
on the eastern side the idea is to force the warsaw pact down to 
nato levels and then cut a little bit more on both sides by 5 
percent to 10 percent 
the soviets meanwhile have adopted a more dramatic and radical 
stance on arms control under president mikhail s gorbachev they 
are likely to insist on far deeper cuts in nonnuclear forces on 
both sides and across a wider range of weapons 
the two sides are starting over after 15 years of futile 
negotiations to reduce nonnuclear forces in central europe they 
have broadened their vistas to cover the entire expanse of the 
continent from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains in the 
soviet union 
all 35 nations that signed the 1975 helsinki agreement to reduce 
eastwest tensions are involved but the negotiations will be 
conducted by the 16nation north atlantic treaty organization and 
the 7nation warsaw pact 
secretary of state james a baker iii is going to vienna on 
saturday night to kick off the talks although he will be back home 
again before the actual opening on thursday 
he will have a chance to compare notes with the other nato 
foreign ministers and to hold a getacquainted session with soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze they are likely to agree on 
a date and an agenda for baker to make his first trip to moscow in 
late april or early may 
the overall improvement in ussoviet relations is bound to have 
a salutary effect on the negotiations on the other hand the 
opening nato position would make far deeper cuts in the warsaw pact 
forces than in the western alliance and leaves out missiles and 
airplanes 
assuming the warsaw pact went along the levels of tanks 
antiaircraft artillery and armored personnel carriers on the two 
sides would be only marginally below current nato strength 
jonathan dean a former us negotiator suggested in a report 
thursday for the union of concerned scientists that the proposal 
does not go far enough to achieve real cuts in the 300 billion nato 
spends annually on the defense of europe 
the pact seems ready for deep cuts but it wants to see nato 
cut too dean said natos position would not decisively 
achieve stability to reduce the possibility of conflict between the 
alliances 
james p rubin research director of the private arms control 
association said that not only does the western approach appear 
to be onesided but the complexity of the negotiations seems 
daunting 
rubin in an interview said the outcome will depend on whether 
the desire of both east and west to reduce their defense burdens is 
strong enough to enable political leaders to cut through these 
inherent technical complexities and differing approaches 
if an agreement is ultimately reached rubin said it is likely 
to be based on a tradeoff of natos advantages in quality aircraft 
for the warsaw pacts overwhelming numerical edge in groundbased 
tanks and equipment 
in the meantime gorbachev offered last fall to withdraw six tank 
divisions from eastern europe and to reduce soviet manpower in 
europe and asia in january he announced a 142 percent reduction 
in the defense budget and a 195 percent cutback in weapons and 
military hardware 
soviet ambassador yuri v dubinin said at a news conference 
thursday that the troop reductions were unilateral and irreversible 
however the nato proposal would require a 50 percent reduction 
in warsaw pact tanks dubinin was not willing to take up that 
challenge he said the soviets had the impression the real nato 
approach to reducing nonnuclear forces in europe was still being 
formulated by the bush administration 
it would be risky now to discuss it the soviet diplomat said

his celebrity status considered marital property in their divorce 
proceedings 
in a decision made public thursday state supreme court justice

only to equal distribution of marital property including the sale 
of their 18 million tarrytown estate and royalties due for getzs

the bush administration is proposing a new us 
policy toward central america that includes rewards for nicaragua if 
it passes certain checkpoints on the road to democracy say 
congressional and administration sources 
while still in its formative stages the new policy is outlined 
in a secret 10page document secretary of state james a baker iii 
showed to house and senate leaders thursday during a hastily 
arranged visit to capitol hill 
baker made clear to lawmakers that he does not intend to abandon 
the antisandinista contra rebels who now are subsisting on us 
supplies in honduran jungle camps along the nicaraguan border 
he told congressional officials he would seek to renew the us 
humanitarian aid which runs out at the end of this month for a 
year according to some present at the meetings aid would continue 
to flow at current rates about 4 million a month and would keep 
the rebels available as a standby fighting force until after 
nicaraguas national elections which are being moved up to early 
1990 
but some participants said it was clear that the oneyear 
extension would be objectionable to congressional democrats who 
oppose the contra policy and that it might be negotiable bakers 
top objective for central america remains to achieve a bipartisan 
consensus on how to achieve democracy and peace in the region the 
participants said 
theyre trying to put something together that everybody can 
agree on that both democrats and republicans can support said 
sen william cohen rmaine who attended one meeting in the office 
of senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
at the same time baker was making the rounds guatemalan 
president vinicio cerezo also was calling on some of the same 
congressional leaders to ask stronger us support for last months 
regional peace agreement reached in el salvador among the five 
central american presidents 
the pact calls for drafting a plan by midmay that would disband 
the 11000man contra force and provide for them to be assimilated 
into nicaragua as the sandinistas open up and democratize their 
political process free political prisoners and hold new elections 
bush has been cool to the plan saying it is similar to past 
sandinista promises which have not been kept and contains no 
enforcement mechanism to make sure the reforms are achieved bush 
reiterated his skepticism to cerezo in a meeting on thursday said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
but house speaker jim wright dtexas said the united states 
should support the plan and seek to propel it forward we ought to 
be positive and supportive and not pour cold water on it wright 
said before a meeting with cerezo 
but wright in a statement that seemed to fit in with bakers 
proposal added we have some leverage we can apply at the proper 
moment to reinforce the agreement and help make it work 
wright said that leverage could include lifting the current us 
trade embargo on nicaragua 
sources in the administration and on capitol hill all speaking 
on condition of anonymity said baker was considering lifting that 
embargo as well as offering small economic incentives to help 
nicaraguas failing economy if the sandinistas live up to their 
pledges of democratization 
baker is also considering a range of possible us actions that 
could include resumption of normalized relations on visas air 
travel foreign aid and exchange of diplomats said one 
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
while current aid to the contras officially runs out march 31 
supplies that have been bought by that date could continue to flow 
to the rebels and keep them supplied at least through april 
congressional sources said while the adinistration may propose its 
new aid package before congress leaves town march 23 for a 10day 
easter break it is unlikely action will come before april 
bakers discussions on capitol hill were seen in part as an 
effort to get moving on central america amid accusations that bush 
has been slow to get his foreign policy machinery off the ground 
the administration apparently was taken by surprise by the agreement 
reached feb 14 by the five presidents in costa del sol el 
salvador and is scrambling to catch up 
the five countries are costa rica el salvador guatemala 
honduras and nicaragua 
part of whats driving them the central american presidents 
is our own policy vacuum said an administration source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity they had no idea what our policy was 
when they met 
bakers discussions with congress were to get us out of this 
vacuum the source said 
some congressional critics noted as well that the policy 
proposals apparently had not yet been cleared with the contras or 
the central american presidents this is a washington plan not a 
central american plan said one republican source

president bushs decision on whether to 
intervene in the threatened eastern airlines strike will show 
whether he wants to improve relations with organized labor a union 
president says 
vincent sombrotto head of the national association of letter 
carriers said that if bush appoints an emergency investigative 
board and delays the strike by 60 days that would show a 
recognition of american labor as an institution 
but if bush refuses to invoke the law sombrotto said that 
would just be consistent with the reagan administrations 
laissezfaire attitude 
former president reagan responded to his first labormanagement 
crisis in august 1981 by firing some 11400 striking air traffic 
controllers and reagans relations with organized labor suffered 
throughout two terms 
now the specter of a strike at 1201 am est saturday has 
forced bush to decide whether he wants to invoke provisions of the 
railway labor act to impose a 60day cooling off period 
alfred kahn who headed the nowdefunct civil aeronautics board 
and was chairman of the council on wage and price stability during 
the carter administration said it would be a mistake to intervene 
but audrey freeman an analyst with the private conference board 
in new york said she doubted that bushs decision either way would 
make a major statement about his intentions toward labor 
i dont think the controllers strike changed the course of 
history of labormanagement relations she said and i dont 
think that whatever mr bush will do will change the course of labor 
relations 
at midnight the end of a 30day coolingoff period set by the 
national mediation board eastern can impose work conditions and the 
union can strike the board recommended that bush name the emergency 
panel 
kahn who was instrumental in the late 1970s move to ease 
government regulation of the airline industry and increase 
competition said i think that if the bush administration 
succumbs and appoints this board it would be tipping the scales 
in favor of labor it would be such a labordictated intervention it 
could be seen as killing eastern 
kahn in a telephone interview from the campus of new york 
university said the more they the unions can delay either a 
strike or the probability of a settlement the more they can 
increase the chances of eastern going under 
mark de bernardo special counsel to the us chamber of 
commerce said the union movement is going to unduly pressure the 
new administration by raising the stakes in situations such as 
the eastern dispute 
its a fairly dangerous gambit forcing this into an early 
bellwether of where the bush administration is going to go in the 
area of laborrelations he said government intervention was not 
a hallmark of the reagan administration 
if he bush makes the decision to intervene it will be a 
reluctant one de bernardo said 
sombrotto acknowledged that its a little unusual for 
organized labor to urge government intervention to stop a strike 
which is the ultimate weapon of unionized workers but he said that 
it is a little different period he said a strike would be 
detrimental to the flying public and to the economy as well as 
to the eastern airlines employees 
in contrast to earlier years when the organized labor movement 
was much stronger the aflcio has urged bush to use this law to 
delay a strike in days past government intervention to stop a 
strike would have infuriated labor leaders at the same time frank 
lorenzo the chairman of texas air corp which owns eastern has 
warned that putting off planned cuts in costs could send the carrier 
to the corporate graveyard

a university of oregon senior faces a 
contempt of court charge for enclosing a letter with a parking fine 
in which he complained in mostly vulgar terms about having to pay 
jeffrey sebastian 23 said he was angry about the fine because 
he received the parking ticket while taking a required exam he 
suggested in a letter peppered mostly with profanities that the 
city should coordinate parking with the school when exams are 
scheduled 
the emotion did slip sebastian said about the letter which 
he claims is an expression of constitutionally protected free 
speech but that doesnt change the feelings that i felt 
after municipal judge frank bocci read the letter he ordered 
sebastian to show cause why he shouldnt be held in contempt for 
disorderly contemptuous or insolent behavior toward the judge and 
court 
now sebastian faces the prospect of a 25 fine or 10 days in jail 
i felt it was offensive to the proper judicial operation of the 
court and to whats referred to as the dignity of the court bocci 
said this week he added that it was the first time in 24 years on 
the bench that hes issued a contempt citation against someone for 
writing a letter 
the case was heard this week by pro tem judge jim spickerman 
after bocci disqualified himself from the case to avoid any bias 
floyd prozanski jr a city prosecutor admitted there were no 
oregon cases dealing with the issue but he cited cases in new jersey 
that appeared to offer some guidance 
however defense attorney steve chez cited another new jersey 
case that concluded with a pair of rhyming couplets 
statutory attempts to regulate pure bluster 
cant pass what is called constitutional muster 
use of vulgar words that may cause resentment 
is protected by the first amendment 
a decision is expected next week

poet laureate howard nemerov says writing a 
poem about congress was a real hard test but he thinks the 28 
lines he penned to help the house and senate observe their 200th 
anniversary served the purpose 
nemerov read his poem at a joint meeting of the two houses 
thursday held early because the bicentennial of march 4 1789 
when the first congress met in new york will fall on a saturday 
when congress is not in session 
i think the historian of congress was the one who transmitted 
the invitation and i said well what the hell have a go 
howard said the poet 
im not a romantic poet but i dont mind trying to do a decent 
job of whatever comes up and if i cant do it i wont he said 
the house historian raymond smock said he asked nemerov about 
three weeks ago if he would write the poem 
i simply called him up and told him we would like to have this 
happen and he was delighted he said you could see that 
already the wheels were turning and he was thinking about congress 
and saw it i think as a challenge 
nemerov said it wasnt any cinch turning out a poem about 
congress in three weeks 
it cost a lot of blood and sweat to do it he said if 
there were time i would have told the congress i was brought up 
to believe that no subject was intrinsically unpoetical but you 
ladies and gents gave me a real hard test however i think i done 
all right 
smock said the lawmakers thought it was just the right touch 
nemerovs poem entitled to the congress of the united states 
entering its third century ends with the lines 
so its a republic as franklin said 
if you can keep it and we did 
this far and hope to keep our quarrel 
funny and just though with this moral 
praise without end for the goahead zeal 
of whoever it was invented the wheel 
but never a word for the poor souls sake 
that thought ahead and invented the brake 
nemerov is the third person to serve as poet laureate following 
robert penn warren and richard wilbur under a 1986 law adding that 
title to the 50yearold position of consultant in poetry to the 
library of congress 
the law includes a clause that provides each department and 
office of the federal government is encouraged to make use of the 
services of the poet laureate for ceremonial and other occasions of 
celebration 
poets took exception when the law was written 
i can see all sorts of terrible things possibly happening 
stanley kunitz the 1979 winner of the pulitzer prize for poetry 
said at a conference at george washington university 
relations between politics and poetry have been almost always 
destructive to poetry added josephine jacobsen like kunitz a 
former library of congress poetry consultant 
but nemerov says he never heard of such a provision 
smock said he and other bicentennial planners knew what the law 
said but that wasnt why they decided to ask nemerov if he would 
write a poem 
it was more a feeling that this occasion called for a poetic 
expression said smock 
i dont know whats happened to poetry smock said it 
seems to have retreated to our universities and its not something 
thats done publicly like it used to be we thought it would be 
delightful to afford the poet laureate an opportunity if he was 
willing

here is the poem that poet laureate howard 
nemerov read at thursdays joint meeting of congress to mark its 
bicentennial 
 
to the congress of the united states entering its third century 
 
because reverence has never been americas thing 
this verse in your honor will not begin o thou 
but the great respect our country has to give 
may you all continue to deserve and have 
 
here at the fulcrum of us all 
the feather of truth against the soul 
is weighed and had better be found to balance 
lest our enterprise collapse in silence 
 
for here the million varying wills 
get melted down get hammered out 
until the movies reduced to stills 
that tell us what the laws about 
 
conflicts endemic in the mind 
your jobs to hear it in the wind 
and compass it in opposites 
and bring the antagonists by your wits 
 
to being one and that the law

the future looks cloudy for the landsat 
satellites that keep on eye on the earth and its climate with 
shutdown likely by the end of the month unless more money can be 
found 
congress only provided enough money to run the system through the 
end of march and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
doesnt have any extra funds to keep them going noaa satellite 
director thomas n pyke jr said thursday 
as a result the contractor that runs the satellites for the 
government has been directed to begin shutting them down pyke said 
in a telephone interview 
a landsat satellite scheduled for launch in 1991 is not affected 
but sen al gore jr dtenn blamed the decision on the 
administration and called the funding halt one of the most 
ridiculous policy decisions i have seen in 13 years of service in 
the house and senate 
at a time when we are trying to get more information about 
environmental change the bush administration is shutting down one 
of our best sources of information said gore chairman of the 
commerce science and transportation subcommittee on science 
technology and space 
all landsat services including access to more than 2 million 
archive images of the planet will cease march 15 the earth 
observation satellite company eosat announced 
if this is carried to completion near the end of this month 
they will actually pull the switch on these two satellites and place 
them on internal control pyke said once that has been done it 
may not be possible to reestablish communications with these 
satellites 
in the meantime however the house science space and technology 
committee has called a hearing for next tuesday to look into ways of 
saving the satellite system 
it makes absolutely no sense to shut down the satellites 
said rep george brown dcalif a committee member he called on 
president bush to intercede immediately by asking the national 
aeronautics and space administration and the departments of defense 
and agriculture to help fund the program 
eosat vice president peter m p norris termed the threatened 
shutdown beyond belief 
the landsat program provides important environmental data that 
touches on projects throughout the world norris said 
but explained pyke we have gone to the other federal agencies 
who make use of landsat data and asked them if they can help with 
the continued funding of landsat operations but as of today we have 
received no additional funds from any source 
currently eosat operates two satellites landsats 4 and 5 which 
provide photos used for a variety of purposes including mineral 
exploration checking soil conditions and vegetation urban and 
rural planning monitoring volcanoes tracing ocean currents and so 
forth 
both satellites are well past their expected lifetimes and are 
not fully operational pyke noted but they are still providing 
useful information 
an improved satellite landsat 6 is under construction pyke 
added that project will continue because funds were provided to 
complete and launch that satellite which is expected to go into 
service in 1991 
eosat was established to take over landsat operations in 1985 
after the reagan administration sought to sell both landsat and the 
nations weather satellites to commercial operators 
congress refused to approve sale of the weather satellites but 
permitted the landsat sale with federal support to be phased out 
over five years 
eosat has struggled financially in recent years facing strong 
competition from the french spotimage satellite system and also the 
possibility of civilian sales of satellite images by the soviet 
union

the cost to taxpayers of president bushs 
savings and loan plan could jump by more than a third if the 
administrations economic assumptions turn out to be too optimistic 
the white house budget director says 
richard darman director of the office of management and budget 
acknowledged on thursday that economic projections showing interest 
rates declining by 5 percentage points over the next five years are 
optimistic 
but the administrations plan to close and sell off insolvent 
savings institutions has a 10 billion to 15 billion fudge 
factor that should accommodate any increase in costs caused by 
higher interest rates he told the senate banking committee 
darman said if interest rates stay on average 2 percentage points 
above what the administration projects budget outlays for the sampl 
plan from 1989 through 1999 would rise from 399 billion to 506 
billion 
and if deposits at sampls grow at a 4 percent annual rate instead 
of the 7 percent forecast budget outlays would swell by another 
47 billion to make up for a lower level of deposit insurance 
premiums he said 
darman vigorously defended bushs proposal to borrow sampl rescue 
money in a way that keeps 50 billion in spending out of the budget 
deficit 
darman said adding 50 billion to the deficit would risk a larger 
crisis while congress and the administration tried to agree on how 
to meet the targets of the grammrudman law 
i think it could well bring the political system to 
stalemate he said the net effect of that would be to drive 
interest rates up higher and force us into recession 
in other sampl developments 
the federal deposit insurance corp took control of 37 more 
insolvent sampls bringing the total under its supervision to 73 the 
37 were in six states 12 in texas 10 in kansas eight in arkansas 
four in louisiana two in alaska and one in maryland 
although the fdic regulates commercial banks it is taking over 
the 220 worstoff sampls in preparation for the regulatory 
reorganization proposed by bush 
former democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson and rep 
henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking committee 
backed a liberal coalitions proposal to require financial 
institutions to commit money to lowand moderateincome housing as a 
concession for an sampl bailout 
the coalition would finance its proposal by boosting the top 
federal income tax rate from 33 percent to 38 percent and by making 
assessments on brokerage firms and mutual funds as well as banks 
and sampls 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady won the support of a major 
banking group for the administration sampl plan the board of the 
american bankers association voted unanimously to work for the plan 
even though it would nearly double deposit insurance premiums paid 
by banks 
the abas support was conditioned on the eventual granting of 
partial premium rebates and on capping the premium at 15 cents per 
100 of deposits the administration proposal would permit 
regulators if necessary to raise the premium as high as 35 cents 
the general accounting office congress investigative agency 
told a house panel that junk bonds have been a profitable 
investment for sampls but warned that their safety hasnt been tested 
during an economic downturn 
the gao told the house banking subcommittee that the nations 
sampls had invested about 13 billion in junk bonds as of sept 30 
the bonds pay higher interest but carry a greater risk of default 
on another point darman said the administration is forecasting 
that 200 of the nations 2950 sampls will fail because they will be 
unable to meet stricter capital standards requiring sampl owners to 
put up more of their own money within two years thats in addition 
to the 350 that have already failed and are awaiting closure

the federal deposit insurance corp is 
supervising 73 savings institutions after taking control of an 
additional 37 sampls in six states 
although the fdic regulates commercial banks it began on feb 7

of the 37 put under the fdic on thursday 12 were in texas 10 in 
kansas eight in arkansas four in louisiana two in alaska and one

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan insists 
that the feds antiinflation moves have been proper despite 
criticism that its tightmoney policy could topple the country into 
a recession 
greenspan told the house budget committee on thursday that he did 
not believe forcing the country into a recession was a proper way to 
fight inflation and he said that was not the feds intention 
but he said if the central bank had not been pursuing a policy of 
gradually pushing up interest rates since march of last year 
inflationary pressures would be much more severe at the current time 
if inflation gets out of control the fed is forced to squeeze 
credit much tighter driving interest rates even higher and making 
any economic downturn much more severe 
that is what occurred in 198182 when the country suffered 
through the most drastic recession since the great depression as 
thenfed chairman paul volcker drove interest rates higher and 
higher to combat the worst bout of inflation since the civil war 
greenspan indicated that the feds current course was aimed at 
making sure that the next recession will not have to be as severe 
i do believe that the business cycle has not been repealed 
greenspan said we will at some point get a recession but i hope 
that we have correct policies in place so the recession will be 
mild 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif noted that there was a 
difference of opinion on the feds credittightening moves which 
included a decision last friday to boost to 7 percent the discount 
rate the interest the central bank charges to make loans to 
financial institutions 
opinion seems divided whether this move was too little too 
late or too much too soon panetta said 
panetta said that regardless of whether the higher interest rates 
end up pushing the country into a recession the credit tightening 
will have many adverse consequences including a bigger budget 
deficit more troubles for the savings and loan industry higher 
debt payments by third world countries and higher costs to consumers 
who borrow to purchase homes and autos 
but greenspan said the central bank remained convinced that the 
dangers of doing nothing outweighed risks to specific sectors of the 
economy from higher interest rates 
on another matter greenspan said he still supported increasing 
the federal gasoline tax but only as a conservation measure not as 
a way of boosting federal revenues 
greenspan also said that boosting taxes on alcoholic beverages 
and cigarettes would not harm the economy but he said simply 
increasing federal tax revenues was not the answer the governments 
imbalance between spending and revenues 
echoing a position taken by president bush and former president 
reagan greenspan said that higher federal revenues were much more 
likely to end up funding new programs rather than being used to 
reduce the budget deficit 
there is a tendency in congress when revenues are available 
to increase government programs greenspan said 
greenspan said he would prefer acrosstheboard spending cuts to 
tax increases if congress and the administration fail to agree on a 
plan to reduce the 1990 budget deficit to 100 billion 
greenspan repeated warnings that he has made in earlier 
congressional appearances that it is crucial that congress and the 
new administration reach agreement on a credible multiyear plan to 
reduce the budget deficit 
he said there was no question that such a deficitreduction 
program would encourage financial investors and allow longterm 
interest rates to fall substantially

the director of a federal program that provides 
a thin financial cushion to the elderly and the infirm opposes 
congressional moves to expand the eligibility rolls 
michael carozza deputy commissioner of the social security 
administration told a joint hearing of two house committees on 
thursday that the current program works 
i dont think it would particularly help this problem 
carozza told rep tom downey dny when asked about a bill in 
congress to ease restrictions to benefits under the supplemental 
security assistance program 
ssi is an effective safety net providing the aged blind and 
disabled with a floor of income the value of which is enhanced when 
combined with medicaid food stamps and other assistance carozza 
said 
he shared a witness table with social workers and a 97yearold 
indianapolis woman who lives on 13 a day in ssi benefits who also 
testified before the house select committee on aging and the ways 
and means human resources subcommittee 
created in 1972 ssi is operated by the social security 
administration as a supplement for those who get federal benefits 
such as food stamps and medicare but have little or no other income 
to live on some 4 million people received 107 billion in 
benefits last year according to the ssa 
parents of severely disabled children are eligible under some 
circumstances although 45 percent of the recipients are over 65 
but rep robert matsui dcalif called the program a failed 
guarantee against poverty 
although the programs concept and structure are basically 
sound the current level of federal assistance does not provide 
recipients with an income that even brings them up to the poverty 
line said matsui 
and rep edward roybal dcalif chairman of the house select 
committee on aging said ssi is in fact characterized by 
inadequate benefit levels large gaps in service insufficient 
outreach activities and overly rigid eligibility requirements 
he and social workers cited numerous stories of recipients going 
two years or more without benefits and then barely able to live on 
the 368 maximum monthly benefit this is less than 75 percent of 
the poverty level said roybal 
carozza said however i believe this is appropriate when you 
consider that ssi intends to be an income of last resort

the common market has agreed to cut its 
use of chlorofluorocarbons the synthetic compounds that destroy the 
earths ozone layer by 85 percent and seek a total ban on its 
production by the end of the century 
chlorofluorocarbons invented in 1930 are used in aerosol 
sprays refrigeration coolants cleaning agents and several other 
products the compounds are blamed for depletion of the ozone layer 
that protects the earth from the suns harmful ultraviolet rays and 
for an increase in skin cancer 
environmental officials meeting in brussels agreed thursday to 
give the 12 eec member nations a mandate to completely phase out the 
manufacture and use of the compounds by the year 2000 
in washington environmental protection agency administrator 
william reilly urged president bush to support the 
chlorofluorocarbon phaseout by the end of the century but his 
proposal was not immediately endorsed by the administration the 
washington post reported today 
the eec member states are responsible for about half the worlds 
annual chlorofluorocarbon production of 1 million tons with britain 
leading in both production and exports according to the 
londonbased environmental group greenpeace 
the commission will represent the 12 nations at international 
conferences being held this year to discuss the ozone issue and to 
monitor application of an international accord called the montreal 
protocol 
this protocol signed by 40 countries and ratified by 32 took 
effect jan 1 and is intended to reduce the production and use of 
chlorofluorocarbons by 50 percent from current levels by 1998 
on sunday scientists industrialists and government officials 
from around the world will gather in london to discuss how to 
eliminate chlorofluorocarbons which also are blamed for damaging 
crops and forests by depleting the protective ozone shield 
british environment secretary nicholas ridley said more than 110 
countries have accepted britains invitation to attend the threeday 
conference entitled saving the ozone layer 
several countries including the united states have banned use 
of the compounds in aerosol propellants and prime minister margaret 
thatcher said thursday that britain will soon require all new 
refrigerators to contain substances that will not harm the ozone 
layer 
britain will lobby other nations to do the same ridley said he 
said emphasis will be placed on developing countries such as india 
and china which are beginning mass production of refrigerators and 
other consumer goods containing the compounds 
greenpeace says britain exported chlorofluorocarbons to 117 
countries in 1988 81 of which had not signed the montreal protocol 
thirtyone countries have agreed to reduce their emissions by 50 
percent by the end of the century britain already has vowed to cut 
its emissions in half by the end of this year and to reduce total 
emissions by 85 percent by 1999 
in tokyo a government official said today that the government 
has urged domestic companies to reduce their dependency on 
chlorfluorocarbons or cfcs before regulations restricting their 
use become mandatory 
beginning in july japan will regulate the production and import 
of cfcs in compliance with the montreal protocol 
chlorofluorocarbons and related chemicals known as halons which 
are used in firefighting equipment can last 100 years they are 
stable and nontoxic at lower levels but when they reach the 
stratosphere 1525 miles up they are broken up by ultraviolet 
radiation and their chlorine atoms destroy the ozone 
over the antarctic an ozone hole an area where ozone has been 
seriously depleted is worsening according to the british 
governments stratospheric ozone review group the group reported 
that ozone concentration in the winter was reduced by 95 percent in 
some parts 
an international expedition warned in february that the 
atmosphere over the arctic region is also primed for a large 
destruction of ozone 
the us national aeronautics and space administration reported 
last year that annual ozone depletion over the northern hemispheres 
midlatitudes is much higher than thought the protective shield 
appears to have shrunk by 23 percent since 1969 over the area 
which includes most of the united states and canada nasa said 
scientists say a thinning of the ozone layer increases the 
incidence of skin cancer according to greenpeace each 1 percent 
depletion is estimated to increase incidence of skin cancer by about 
4 percent 
the london conference to be opened by kenyan president daniel 
arap moi will be addressed first by scientists studying ozone 
depletion then from industrialists developing safe alternatives for 
some compounds 
another conference is scheduled in helskinki finland on may 25 
to monitor application of the montreal protocol

edward derwinski will become the first 
secretary of veterans affairs after a key senator said the former 
lawmaker could probably rise above a dangerous breach of 
confidentiality he committed 12 years ago 
the senate voted 940 on thursday to confirm derwinski whose new 
veterans affairs department will be the governments largest 
department second only to the pentagon 
derwinski will be head of the veterans administration until it 
becomes a cabinet department on march 15 it will have 240000 
employees 
the senate confirmed derwinski after the veterans affairs 
committee voted 100 the same day to clear the nomination 
i appreciate the unanimous endorsement of the committee and 
will now focus my efforts to work for americas veterans said 
derwinski 62 
derwinski a state department official until chosen to head the 
veterans administration in december served 12 terms in an illinois 
congressional seat before losing it to redistricting in 1982 an 
army veteran he served in the japanese occupation of 1945 and 1946 
in the final tally in the full senate those not voting were 
sens david boren dokla david durenberger rminn al gore 
jr dtenn bob packwood rore paul simon dill and timothy 
wirth dcolo 
derwinski was questioned during his confirmation hearings about 
an incident in 1977 when he was the senior republican on a house 
committee investigating bribery of members of congress by the korean 
government 
he told the committee on wednesday he inadvertently mentioned in 
a conversation with a korean diplomat on or near the steps of a 
house office building that a korean official was going to testify 
before the committee 
the korean central intelligence agency official became a 
protected witness and fbi agents picked him up 30 minutes before 
kcia officials arrived at his home according to accounts of the 
incident 
derwinski denied being the source of the tip until confirmation 
hearings for a state department post in 1983 after 12 terms in the 
house as an illinois republican the hearings and his admission 
attracted practically no public attention at the time 
when weighed against derwinskis 30 years of service in congress 
and the state department i do not find his indiscretions as to 
this one incident to be disqualifying said committee chairman 
alan cranston dcalif i am optimistic about mr derwinskis 
potential to rise above this unattractive episode to put it behind 
him once and for all 
i do not find his indiscretions as to this one incident to be 
disqualifying cranston said after concluding that what he did 
in 1977 was wrong and that the entire record demonstrates that he 
has often not been candid or forthcoming about it 
derwinski was scheduled monday to appear before the committee 
again but this time to discuss budgetary matters 
derwinski said there was nothing malicious or intentional to 
what i did and contended i honestly do not believe i ever 
endangered anyone 
i also acknowledge it wasnt a very wise thing to do in fact 
a rather stupid thing to do derwinski said this was the only 
such conversation he said

president bush could keep the federal campaign 
fund afloat if he decides to run for reelection but the treasury 
may fall 72 million short when it is to pay for the 1996 
presidential contest a congressional panel was told 
the fund that pays for the presidential campaigns is facing a 
shortfall because fewer people are marking the box on their income 
tax returns that would put 1 of their taxes into the kitty members 
of the federal election commission said 
bushs presence in the 1992 campaign could be counted upon to 
keep other republicans from running thus reducing the amount of 
money the federal government would have to pay lee ann elliott 
vice chairman of the federal election commission told a house 
appropriations subcommittee 
but if anything would happen so that it would be an open race 
as it was last time there would be a shortfall she said 
the treasurys luck probably will run out in 1996 when a crowded 
field of candidates in both parties can be expected to run for an 
open seat in the white house as was the case last year 
we predict that there will be a 72 million shortfall in 
1996 she said 
last year when there were more than a dozen candidates seeking 
the democratic and republican presidential nominations the federal 
government spent some 176 million to cover the campaigns for the 
primaries and general election as well as paying for the parties 
national conventions 
about 54 million was left over but while that sounds like a 
lot it was the smallest carryover in more than a decade said fred 
eiland a spokesman for the commission 
the commission which was presenting its fiscal 1990 budget 
request to the committee asked for 250000 to start an education 
campaign largely through public service announcements and 
advertising to remind people to check the box on their federal 
income tax returns to put 1 of their taxes into the presidential 
campaign fund 
under federal law the treasury is to pay for the costs of the 
general election campaigns for president the costs of the major 
parties national conventions and to provide matching funds in the 
primaries to presidential candidates who reach a certain level of 
voter support and fundraising ability 
the first to feel the pinch would be presidential candidates 
running in the primaries eiland said while the law requires 
specific amounts to be spent on the general election and the 
conventions there is flexibility in how much would be spent on the 
primary campaigns 
historically presidential campaigns rely heavily on an infusion 
of cash from the federal government during the primary campaigns 
because that is when the field of candidates is most crowded and 
political contributors are most divided 
since 1980 however contributions to the presidential campaign 
fund have declined as fewer people marked the box on their tax forms 
in 1981 the highwater mark for the fund 287 percent of the 
1980 income tax returns used the checkoff putting 41 million into 
the campaign fund eiland said participation dropped to 27 percent 
a year later giving 39 million to the fund 
by last year participation had fallen to 21 percent with 33 
million going into the presidential campaign fund he said 
congress set up the fund in 1972 and the 1976 presidential 
election was the first to be financed with public money

a swedish research project in which two 
cows had holes sliced in their stomachs to test different types of 
food has prompted protests by animal rights activists 
swedish papers thursday published pictures of one of the cows 
norma with a hole into her flank that was large enough for a man to 
put in his arm and insert a plastic feed bag into her stomach 
the study at skara veterinary hospital was to determine whether 
cows could convert as much nourishment from domestic feed as from 
imported grains 
the feed bags similar to tea bags are inserted and withdrawn 
several times a day in between the holes are closed with plastic 
plugs 
the study involves 40 cows half fed swedishgrown foodstuffs and 
the rest on imported grains 
the animal protection board in goteborg expressed dismay at the 
project and the research farm reportedly was flooded with letters 
from offended citizens 
i can understand if many people react negatively to this but i 
can guarantee that the cows are not adversely affected by the 
hole bo pehrsson the veterinarian leading the project was 
quoted as saying 
he said farmers could save up to 158 per cow annually if 
domestic feed replaces imported grains

the new push of science into agriculture 
through biotechnology is raising questions about the kind of farming 
that may result says chuck hassebrook of the center for rural 
affairs 
so new is the practice of genetic engineering cloning embryo 
transfer and other scientific feats that hassebrook and others at 
the center fear there hasnt been enough attention paid to the basic 
research agenda involving biotechnology 
a new report choices for the heartland alternative directions 
in biotechnology and implications for rural america written by 
hassebrook and colleague gabriel hegyes has been issued by the 
center based in walthill neb 
the expense and sophistication of biotechnology will narrow the 
range of individuals directly involved in breeding animals and 
plants the report said questions about who will be served by 
this technology and who will set the research agenda are of 
paramount importance when so few people control the tools and 
language of the trade 
private companies the agriculture department state and regional 
experiment facilities and the agricultural scientific community in 
general are advancing rapidly into biotechnology frontier 
crops with builtin insecticides and livestock with genetic 
capabilities to produce more meat and milk are some of the obvious 
goals 
properly directed agricultural research and biotechnology can 
make agriculture more efficient by providing ways to replace capital 
and purchased inputs production items with the labor and 
management of more family farmers the report said 
for example the center said a new development which could save a 
farmer 5 per hog produced in return for an additional 2 worth of 
time spent on management and labor would increase family farm 
opportunities and make agriculture more efficient by decreasing 
production costs 
hassebrook outlined the report thursday to house and senate 
agriculture committee staffers in hopes of gathering congressional 
support for a closer scrutiny of biotechnologys rapidly developing 
role in the structure of american agriculture 
agricultural research is almost a form of social planning in 
that the decisions you make about what research youre going to 
pursue is going to have a lot to do with shaping agriculture 
hassebrook said in an interview 
the essence of the centers report is that there are two 
directions that can be followed by the biotechnology wave 
one path leads to industrial production systems that continue 
the trend toward larger and fewer farms continuous production of 
one or two highvalue cash crops and largescale livestock 
operations that require high investment and total confinement 
the other route is to lowinput sustainable family farm 
systems designed to preserve soil and water resources farmers using 
these systems seek to improve farm profits by cutting back on 
capital investments and reducing purchases of fertilizers 
pesticides and other production items 
we could use biotechnology to make agriculture more sustainable 
and to strengthen family farms or we could use it to go in the 
other direction hassebrook said the problem is that very few 
are asking these questions its almost kind of leaving it to 
chance 
the center for rural affairs is a nonprofit family farm research 
and advocacy group that began in 1973 hassebrook has been with it 
since 1976

the agriculture department says the soviet 
union has bought an additional 485000 metric tons of us wheat at 
subsidized prices 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said thursday the wheat was part of an 
authorization on jan 25 of more than 2 million tons under the 
export enhancement program or eep 
sims said the wheat is for shipment for april counting some left 
over from a previous eep arrangement and the jan 25 authorization 
the soviets have 525200 tons still available under the program 
with the latest sale the soviet union has bought almost 35 
million tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a longterm 
supply agreement which was extended last fall to run through dec 
31 1990 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the 485000 tons are equal to about 178 million bushels 
worth around 73 million at recent us farm prices 
the eep arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and 
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced 
prices in order to meet foreign competition the exporters then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as 
bonuses or subsidies 
sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also 
included about 102 million tons of corn along with 450000 tons of 
soybeans 14 million tons of soybean meal and 507400 tons of 
grain sorghums 
sims said the 485000 tons of wheat were sold by the peavey co 
110000 tons continental grain co 100000 bunge corp 100000 
ferruzzi usa inc 150000 and mitsubishi international 25000 
the companies will get subsidies of 2246 per ton or about 61 
cents per bushel under the eep arrangement

the environmental protection agency is making 
it difficult for citizen groups near superfund hazardous waste sites 
to participate in a grant program a congressional report says 
the program which provides up to 50000 in grants for community 
groups to hire technical experts isnt working rep jim florio 
dnj said thursday after releasing the report with rep edward j 
markey dmass 
while some community groups described epa staff as helpful to 
applicants many more commented that they were actively 
discouraged from applying or expressed the belief that the agency 
could not be interested based on the cumbersome process it had 
established the report said 
the report based on a survey of 72 people and community groups 
concluded the technical assistance grant program was plagued by a 
long application process difficulttounderstand forms and epa 
staff resistance 
walter kovalick jr deputy director of epas office of emergency 
and remedial response said trying to empower citizen groups is a 
very difficult task when trying to balance fiscal responsibility and 
being as helpful as we can to community groups 
he said epa is trying to improve the program and emphasized it 
was not agency policy to discourage participation 
grants are available at each of the 1175 superfund hazardous 
waste sites so that community groups can get the technical 
information needed for a voice in cleanup operations 
kovalick said 13 grants have been awarded so far and the epa is 
considering an additional 79 letters expressing interest 
the survey found that under the program created in 1986 
more than 90 percent of the community groups encountered major 
problems with the application process with 9 out of 10 applicants 
reporting difficulty in completing paperwork one out of four 
applicants spent more than six weeks filling out the applications 
epa required that communities pay 35 percent of the technical 
assistance costs although congress recommended only a 20 percent 
matching requirement 
the agency agreed to waive the costsharing requirement only in 
exceptional circumstances while congress wanted waivers whenever 
needed to foster public participation 
the report blamed the cumbersome application process for 
discouraging affected groups from participating in the program 
and added that the 35 percent community share makes the program 
insurmountable for many community organizations 
kovalick said epa was given discretion to choose the matching 
contribution for communities and felt that by setting the figure at 
35 percent there would be more federal money to spread around

us mortality rates for two of the three leading 
causes of death heart disease and stroke are headed downward 
but cancer is on the increase as unhealthy habits of yesteryear 
catch up with the older population 
the centers for disease control said thursday that the us death 
rate from heart disease in 1987 was 313 per 100000 people down 
from 318 the year before for stroke or cerebrovascular disease 
the rate was 61 per 100000 down from 62 
but the mortality rate from cancer the nations no 2 killer 
has been going up in recent years the cdc said there were 196 
cancer deaths in 1987 for every 100000 americans up from 195 the 
year before 
what we are seeing is the continuation of some longterm 
trends said dr harry rosenberg a researcher with the national 
center for health statistics 
heart disease cancer and stroke account for about twothirds of 
the 2 million deaths that occur in the united states every year the 
atlantabased cdc said in its weekly report 
health professionals closely analyze the cdcs statistics on the 
three leading causes of death for use in determining public health 
programs 
theyre used to monitor the health of the nation rosenberg 
said 
he said the cancer rate has been rising as americans who had 
unhealthy lifestyles in their youth get older but the rate should 
fall in coming years because of changing lifestyles among the young 
for example among 45 to 54yearolds the cancer rate dropped to 
166 per 100000 in 1986 from 181 per 100000 in 1979 rosenberg 
said he attributed preventative measures of the past two decades 
such as improved diet and less smoking as contributing to the drop 
the decline in deaths from heart disease and stroke has been a 
decadelong trend said thomas thom an epidemiologist with the 
national heart lung and blood institute 
most experts believe that the decline can be attributed to 
improvements in personal health greater prevention of disease 
improvement in medical care for heart or stroke patients or all of 
those factors thom said 
the decline is very real and very consistent he said 
thom cited trends toward quitting smoking controlling high blood 
pressure and lowering cholesterol levels as well as increased 
physical activity and generally health consciousness as factors 
in the decrease at the same time cardiac intensive care units have 
come into widespread use in hospitals and heart surgery has become 
commonplace 
there are plenty of reasons to think all those reasons 
contributed he said 
heart disease killed 762820 of the 22 million americans who 
died in 1987 cancer killed 477190 and stroke killed 149220 a 
year earlier 21 million americans died including 765490 from 
heart disease 469376 from cancer and 149643 from stroke 
rosenberg said 
complete mortality figures from 1988 are not yet available 
rosenberg said 
the mortality rate from heart disease was showing a slight 
increase from 1987 levels in the 12 months from october 1987 to 
september 1988 he said but that might be traced in part to an 
influenza epidemic last winter which preyed upon those at increased 
risk of problems from flu such as patients with chronic heart 
disease he said

the senate debate over john towers troubled 
nomination as defense secretary is producing its share of partisan 
sparks after only one day with one key senator holding out the 
possibility of airing sensitive information in a closeddoor session 
i dont suggest it and i want to avoid it but it may be 
necessary to have a closed session armed services committee 
chairman sam nunn said thursday in the midst of a flareup over 
material damaging to tower that has been leaked from an fbi report 
sen pete wilson rcalif said tower had been trashed by 
material that was leaked and said those responsible never mentioned 
exculpatory material that also appeared in the fbi report a 
closed session of the senate would not repair the damage thats been 
done he said 
several senators called for releasing some of the fbi material in 
sanitized form to give the public a better idea of what it contains 
but when nunn dga raised the possibility of making the 
transcripts of closed committee sessions public no republican 
followed up 
despite gop expressions of outrage over the leaks towers 
chances of confirmation dimmed further as three additional democrats 
joined the opposition and the white house conceded that president 
bush has failed to persuade any democrat to support the nomination 
with a second day of debate set for today an associated press 
survey of senators showed 44 democrats and republican larry pressler 
of south dakota either solidly against the nomination or leaning 
against and 40 republicans either solidly committed or leaning 
toward confirmation the democrats hold a 5545 majority in the 
senate 
republicans said they hoped to use the debate to marshal public 
support and the white house insisted it would fight to the end 
but one senior gop senator speaking on condition of anonymity 
said he wouldnt rule out the possibility of a withdrawal before a 
vote 
nunn led the democratic opposition in opening wednesdays debate 
he said he was concerned over the appearance created by towers 
acceptance of consulting fees after his service as an arms 
negotiator 
nunn cited the obvious tension between the information he 
acquired as arms control negotiator and his obligations to his 
consulting clients 
nunn also came down hard on towers drinking practices i 
personally believe he had a serious drinking problem in the 1970s 
and the 1980s including recent years he said 
were not talking about the secretary of interior were 
talking about someone next to the president at the very top of the 
nuclear chain of command nunn said the example we set here is 
going to work its way down 
republicans rushed to towers defense with sen john warner 
rva saying that not one of the 70 current senators who served 
with tower ever told the fbi of seeing him unable to carry out his 
responsibilities 
sen william cohen rmaine said tower was being assailed by 
ufws unidentified flying witnesses and said most of us would 
have to disqualify ourselves from passing judgment on issues that 
come before us if held to the standard for conflict of interest 
that democrats are applying to tower 
sen phil gramm rtexas provided one of the few light moments 
of the day when he addressed the subject of alcohol 
if my momma is watching i want to make it clear that the world 
would be a better place if the lord had never allowed whiskey to be 
created he said 
but in a long defense of the man he replaced in the senate the 
texas republican said great leaders such as civil war gen us 
grant and britains winston churchill were drinkers 
discussing the conflictofinterest charge gramm said our 
conflict of interest is greater than towers and he cited defense 
industry campaign money that lawmakers receive how is our 
appearance less indicting than his he asked 
by this logic the ideal guy to be secretary of defense would 
be a fellow who just came in on a turnip truck who would agree not 
to make any decisions related to turnips or trucks and would agree 
as soon as he left to retire to a monastery gramm said 
the testiest exchange of the day occurred after sen john glenn 
dohio began quoting witnesses who used words such as crocked 
to describe tower 
sen john mccain rariz interrupted and said glenn had been 
using material from the confidential fbi report glenn said the 
words had already appeared in print but offered to have them removed 
from the official record of debate sen ernest hollings dsc 
had used such language already this week 
the exchange set off the round of republican complaints about 
leaks and led nunn to say the white house had been guilty of the 
same thing in reverse claiming that the report contained nothing 
to disqualify tower without disclosing the allegations

a harvard astronomer turned sleuth helped crack an 
international electronic spy ring in west germany by tracking down 
the hacker who broke into his computer files 
for more than six months finding the computer snoop was a lonely 
obsession for 38yearold clifford stoll who initially was unable 
to convince the fbi to investigate the computer breakin 
on thursday a west german official announced the arrests of 
three hackers who allegedly acquired sensitive military computer 
passwords and codes and sold them to the soviets the pentagon has 
not determined the extent of the damage to us security 
a west german television network said the passwords and other 
information came from key military and research computers in the 
united states western europe and japan 
i would say stoll was largely responsible for cracking the 
case said charles s hurley former spokesman for the lawrence 
berkeley laboratory in berkeley calif where stoll once worked 
over a period of many months he tracked them 
it all started with a 75cent accounting error that stoll noticed 
in the california laboratorys sharedtime computer system accounts 
in august 1986 
if it had been 1000 off i wouldnt have thought anything of 
it stoll said in an interview thursday its like if your 
house collapses you just assume theres been an earthquake but if 
you find a tiny termite hole you think geez id better 
investigate its the little problems that are the most 
fascinating 
stoll a computer expert with a doctorate in astronomy from the 
university of arizona searched for clues for three days and 
discovered the error was caused by someone who had gained access to 
the computer through telephone lines 
for four months i did absolutely nothing but watch what he 
typed in said the bushyhaired stoll 
stoll said it became apparent that the hacker was trying to use 
the berkeley laboratorys computer as a gateway to the socalled 
milnet a computer network linking defense plants university labs 
and military installations 
he was searching for key words like nuclear icbm sdi 
biological warfare norad he was reading everything he could get 
his hands on and then it turns out he was selling it to the 
soviets stoll said 
he said he told the fbi about the hacker in the late summer of 
1986 but there wasnt much of a response 
they said what have you lost i said well all weve 
actually lost is 75 cents so the fbi said who cares its not 
important 
to be fair stoll added theyre much more sensitive to 
computer breakins now 
charles steinmetz a spokesman for the fbi in washington said 
the bureau would not comment on the case 
stoll said his girlfriend tired of his electronic pager that 
would beep whenever the hacker got onto the system was responsible 
for the big break in the case she suggested that he lay a trap 
he created bogus military data and a fictitious computer network 
called sdi net the hacker took the bait spending two hours 
reading through the material giving stoll enough time to trace the 
call to hanover west germany 
three months later stoll said he got a letter from a man in 
pittsburgh asking for information about sdi net when he turned that 
letter over to the fbi in april 1987 he said the bureau found the 
man had connections to eastern european governments and immediately 
began an investigation 
in all stoll said the spy ring had attempted to break into about 
450 different computers and succeeded in stealing information from 
more than 40 of them including data systems at the pentagon 
defense contracting firms and us military bases around the world 
according to a german television network authorities believe the 
west german hackers were recruited by the soviet kgb in 1985 and 
were paid with cash and drugs and were later forced to provide 
the codes and passwords to the soviets 
stoll now has a contract from doubleday inc to write a book 
about his notsoamateur sleuthing 
but he said he is glad the case is nearing an end so he can get 
back to work at the harvardsmithsonian astrophysical observatory in 
cambridge mass 
in one sense it was exciting he said in another sense 
it was dreadful because i got zero astronomy done for two years

instead of complaining about plans to shut down 
86 us military installations congress should accept the package 
and provide the necessary funds for the closings say the cochairmen 
of the commission that devised the plan 
once you start chipping away this thing goes down the tubes 
former sen abraham ribicoff dconn on thursday told the house 
defense appropriations subcommittee 
we collected a vast amount of data describing conditions at 
thousands of installations we were asked to review said former 
rep jack edwards rala in testimony before the corresponding 
senate subcommittee we did not just pluck this list out of thin 
air 
critics of the commissions recommendations particularly 
lawmakers facing closings in their areas have complained that the 
findings are flawed 
congress can block the closings only if both the house and senate 
pass disapproval resolutions and lawmakers cannot pick and chose 
among bases 
a vote on the plan is schedule within weeks

bush administration officials say labor 
secretary elizabeth dole will outline a proposal to raise the 
minimum wage to 425 an hour over three years and create an hourly 
training wage of 335 at a senate hearing today 
the plan is to be presented before the senate labor and human 
resources committee whose chairman sen edward m kennedy dmass 
has introduced legislation calling for a hike in the minimum wage to 
455 to be accompanied by automatic periodic increases in the 
future 
mrs doles testimony is expected to set the stage for a renewed 
battle between the administration and congressional democrats who 
opposed the training wage last year as a subminimum wage that 
organized labor says might threaten the jobs of higher paid workers 
the minimum hourly wage has been set at 335 since 1981 a 
minimum wage increase to 425 by 1991 would represent a 27 percent 
increase over that rate 
she will make the case that this is a proposal that fulfills 
president bushs campaign pledge to raise the minimum wage but 
recognizes that any increase means a loss in job opportunities 
said one administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
thats why the increase is more modest than the increase 
proposed last year by kennedy dmass said the official and 
thats why the training wage is there as well to try to offset any 
unemployment 
the official said the details of the administration position 
which would create a training wage to allow businesses to pay newly 
hired employees 335 an hour for the first six months of employment 
before facing a requirement to raise their pay to the full minimum 
were completed late thursday afternoon 
the plan also would expand an exemption from the 335 floor 
that currently applys only to some small businesses in the retail 
and service industries to all small businesses whose annual earnings 
remain under a specified level 
bush has repeatedly linked a raise in the minimum wage to a 
training wage and mrs dole said in her confirmation hearing that 
she would support adding language to any legislation to prevent 
employers from cutting their costs by hiring people at the training 
wage and laying off higher paid workers

the indiana house overwhelmingly rejected a 
bill that would have suspended jail terms of rapists and child 
molesters who voluntarily underwent surgical castration 
lawmakers voted 918 thursday against the bill which was 
sponsored by rep richard worden an investigator with the allen 
county public defender office 
he said he introduced the legislation because he believes as many 
as 80 percent of rapists and child molesters who go to prison 
eventually get out and commit the same crimes again 
weve tried counseling and weve tried sentencing but that 
doesnt work said worden castration does work 
but opponents of the measure said castration was uncivilized 
punishment 
i really question whether this solution would work said rep 
richard bray a former prosecutor the problem is mental not 
physical 
rep frank newkirk a former deputy prosecutor said he 
sympathized with wordens frustration over short jail terms for sex 
offenders but he said the bill was flawed because it would give a 
sentencing judge no option but to release a convicted offender who 
underwent castration 
rep david jones said the general assembly should set standards 
for civilized behavior and suggested the bill would send the 
opposite message 
worden responded our citizens are civilized but we have some 
animals out there who call themselves citizens

deafening noise yellow dust and debris filled 
the cabin when a huge hole ripped open in the side of a boeing 747 
crewmembers said and the pilot said he knew he was only going to 
have one shot at landing the jet 
i was praying for my life for the lives of the passengers 
that we would get down safely said laura brentlinger chief 
purser on united airlines flight 811 
crewmembers on thursday told of 25 terrifying minutes aboard the 
jet when the forward cargo door and a 10by10 foot section of 
fuselage ripped away during the feb 24 flight nine passengers were 
sucked from the plane and presumed dead twentyseven others were 
injured 
the pilot capt david cronin told the washington post he relied 
on his 38 years of training to bring the plane down 
part of the emergency descent procedure is to pull the power 
back and put on the speed brake he said in todays editions of 
the newspaper at 270 knots youre supposed to drop the landing 
gear 
because we were on two engines if i had done that we would 
have lost too much altitude to make it back so i held off on 
extending the gear he said 
he said he had to constantly revise airspeed calculations because 
the aircraft was overweight and the hole in its right side caused a 
lot of drag 
it was a difficult situation to keep the aircraft pointed in 
the direction we wanted to go and make it do what i wanted it to 
do cronin said 
i dont think a 747 has ever flown on two engines at that 
weight my concern for being overweight was staying airborne he 
said 
to lighten the load 90000 pounds of fuel were dumped 
things were going very rapidly then we were very busy 
cronin said 
the most difficult part was we didnt have just one 
emergency the pilot said we had compounded emergencies 
usually if an airliner has an emergency its usually an engine 
fire or a hydraulic problem 
normal landing speed with all four engines would have been 132 
knots the crew estimated that 170 knots would be safe cronin said 
he chose to touch down at 200 knots because he was afraid of losing 
control of the jet if he slowed it further 
we only had one shot at it he said there was no way 
youre going to go around again youre going to land 
attendant ricky umehira said he heard a big boom was knocked 
to the floor and grabbed onto the bottom of the stairway at the back 
of the firstclass compartment 
after getting his bearings umehira said he saw the hole in the 
side of the plane about 12 feet away 
i thought this couldnt be happening to me no way not to 
me he said 
attendant ricky lam was by himself in the pit the cramped 
cooking galley below the main passenger deck 
the explosive decompression lifted lam off his feet and he landed 
on his back as he felt the plane go into a steep nosedive 
lam climbed up an emergency chute to the main cabin and said he 
had to crawl through all kinds of rubbish and debris and 
couldnt see anything but yellow dust 
i was thinking i was the only one left on the plane he said 
and then i stood up and saw the passengers

venezuela pumps about 15 billion a year into 
floridas economy and business leaders are concerned that civil 
unrest and economic woes in the south american nation could disrupt 
their lucrative trade 
hundreds of people have been killed or injured in riots this week 
in the wake of governmentordered price hikes in venezuela the 
underlying economic problems are expected to make it harder for that 
nation to import goods in the near future 
venezuela which has had a relatively high standard of living in 
the past decade because of an infusion of oil money is floridas 
biggest export market for items like personal computers software 
and car and boat parts 
about 40 percent of floridas exports go to venezuela said 
jose gimenez president of the venezuela chamber of commerce in 
miami you can mention any item and its probably there 
the rioting may not have an immediate impact on trade but 
gimenez said he believes it signals an end to the glory days of 
venezuelas consumer economy 
venezuela has been living in a subsidized cocoon for 25 years 
now it hurts to come out into the open gimenez said 
florida bankers were expecting a decline in trade with venezuela 
even before the unrest because of that countrys falling foreign 
currency reserves and its decision to impose a substantial 60 
percent tariff on many imported goods

leftist rebels assaulted a 
military post on the capitals outskirts one day after the armed 
forces said they were beginning a threemonth ceasefire at least 
three soldiers and two civilians died in the shootout 
panicked residents of the working class san ramon neighborhood 
threw themselves on the ground behind walls parked vehicles and 
piles of bricks at a masonry supply business as soldiers advanced on 
rebel attackers thursday evening 
commie dogs show yourselves cowards some soldiers shouted 
as they moved forward running in a crouch and pausing every few 
yards to survey the scene aim and fire 
the guerrillas attacked just before sunset firing four antitank 
rockets at the stateowned antel telephone switching station in san 
ramon on the northwestern edge of the city 
the attack on the telephone facility which caused no casualties 
and only slight damage to a brick wall appeared to be a diversion 
minutes later about 10 blocks away a gunbattle broke out at the 
san ramon civil defense post where about 20 soldiers were stationed 
several dozen troops from the 1st army brigade on duty nearby 
advanced toward the post and the exchange escalated into a fierce 
battle that lasted nearly an hour 
journalists saw at least three dead soldiers loaded onto a truck 
two civilians one an adolescent boy also were killed there are 
lots of dead one young soldier told a journalist 
several soldiers were wounded but there was no official casualty 
count early today and no indication of rebel casualties 
the armed forces on wednesday began what they said was a 
threemonth halt to offensive operations in an effort to foster 
peace talks the usbacked government of president jose napoleon 
duarte has called on the rebels to respond in kind 
the rebels said wednesday they were willing to declare a 
ceasefire once a time place and agenda for peace talks is agreed 
upon 
the guerrillas have said they will participate in this years 
presidential election and respect its the outcome if it is postponed 
from march 19 until september giving them time to prepare 
earlier thursday the rebels said the army was violating its own 
ceasefire by moving into guerrillacontrolled territory 
that demonstrates the falsehood of the supposed ceasefire 
said the insurgents clandestine radio venceremos 
it did not mention fighting as a result of army troop movements 
which it said occurred in the northern zones of morazan san miguel 
and chalatenango provinces 
those areas are dominated by the rebels who are waging a 
nineyear revolution against the government 
a top army officer indicated the military would continue some 
operations despite the ceasefire 
a ceasefire does not mean the armed forces relinquishes its 
constitutional duty of defending sovereignty and ensuring security 
tranquility and stability col mauricio vargas commander of the 
eastern region said in a televised interview wednesday night 
if people are up in arms in any part of the nations territory 
we have the legal and moral obligation to fight them he said 
the guerrillas accuse the government of procrastinating in 
response to their peace overture 
the us state department says the rebels refusal to declare a 
ceasefire calls into question their stated desire for peace

a new study urges harvard university to 
look beyond traditional sources for black and women faculty saying 
the school has made little progress since its minority hiring was 
criticized almost a decade ago 
we believe that there would be symbolic importance to minority 
and women students at harvard and in the nation as a whole if there 
were a more visible presence at harvard of faculty who share their 
social characteristics said the report which was issued thursday 
harvard president derek bok declined comment on the report 
in a separate study in new york a committee of doctors and 
medical educators recommended that every teaching hospital in the 
state set a fouryear goal of having blacks and hispanics make up 11 
percent of its firstyear resident physicians 
the new york state council on graduate medical education said 12 
percent or 360 of the 3000 firstyear residents in training in 
new york last year were minority group members about evenly divided 
between blacks and hispanics however the greatest concentration of 
minorities was in a few new york city hospitals it said 
the harvard review of affirmative action in the universitys 
faculty of arts and sciences was requested by dean michael spence 
the faculty of about 900 teachers is the liberal arts heart of the 
prestigious school founded in 1636 to educate young men 
the 10member panel that wrote the report included three women 
two blacks a hispanic and an asian 
while noting that women face difficulty finding faculty openings 
and advancing at harvard the panel said blacks hispanics and 
native americans need the most help the pool of candidates in those 
groups is small and in some instances shrinking they noted 
the report advocates affirmative action not with quotas or by 
stretching standards but by looking beyond traditional routes and 
groups to find potential faculty 
currently harvard has numerical targets for women and minority 
faculty and issues a yearly progress report but it is not required 
to meet those targets 
the report was considered wednesday by the arts and sciences 
faculty council and is expected to go to spence and the full faculty 
for approval later this spring 
real change will rely on new attitudes rather than administrative 
orders said jeffrey wolcowitz assistant dean for undergraduate 
education and spokesman for the faculty committee 
if harvard as the premier institution that trains the best and 
the brightest is a place that is absent of the best black men and 
women it sends a message that we are not very good and many of us 
are said dean lawrence watson cochairman of the association of 
black faculty and administrators 
in 1980 a report prepared at the request of the schools black 
students association concluded that harvards recruitment efforts 
had been passive 
according to the new report in 197879 just 12 women were full 
professors or 34 percent of the total today they number 30 or 78 
percent there were 44 women on the faculty headed for tenure in 
197879 or 198 percent compared with 64 and 277 percent now 
in 197879 the numbers of minority full professors totaled 21 or 
59 percent with tenuretrack teachers numbering 17 or 77 
percent this year there are 27 full professors or 7 percent and 
28 minorities on the way up or 121 percent 
to improve hiring the new report proposes naming a special 
associate dean for affirmative action in arts and sciences that 
each faculty department designate a faculty member for that effort 
and that a standing faculty committee on affirmative action be 
established

israeli troops demolished or sealed 10 homes in 
the occupied lands to punish palestinians suspected of attacking 
arab collaborators or israeli targets the army said today 
in the west bank the army blew up seven houses and sealed an 
eighth late thursday and early today the homes belonged to 
palestinians suspected of killing an arab collaborator and throwing 
firebombs at israeli cars and homes the army said 
in the gaza strip the army sealed rooms in two houses belonging 
to palestinians suspected of throwing firebombs at an israeli 
government office and setting on fire a bus carrying workers to 
israel 
since the beginning of the palestinian uprising in december 1987 
the army has destroyed or sealed more than 200 houses usually 
before suspects were convicted of any wrongdoing 
the united states condemns the practice saying it violates the 
right to due process of law 
prime minister yitzhak shamir meanwhile said a battle thursday 
in south lebanon between israeli troops and four palestine 
liberation organization guerrillas showed the organization is 
making fun of its promise to stop terrorism 
officials said the four guerrillas who were killed had been 
trying to infiltrate israel on a hostagetaking mission 
despite the explicit plo promise to the united states that it 
would stop terror actions against israel the infiltration attempt 
is a decisive proof that this terrorist organization is carrying out 
terror acts shamir told the daily yediot ahronot 
the united states opened direct contacts with the plo in december 
after plo chairman yasser arafat said he was renouncing terrorism 
and recognizing israel 
foreign ministry spokesman alon liel said today that the latest 
infiltration attempt violated the us conditions 
asked whether israel was trying to persuade washington to end the 
contacts liel said we are forwarding the information regarding 
these attacks on a regular basis to the united states but they 
should draw their own conclusions

the lastminute cancellation of a town 
health board hearing on militaryfunded anthrax research at the 
university of massachusetts didnt deter a quaker group from 
expressing its opposition 
we feel the issue is of extreme importance and we will not back 
down just because of a decision they have made in the last 24 
hours said john bonifaz who is organizing efforts by the local 
branch of the american friends service committee to stop the 
research 
the quakers claim the 23yearold research project poses a health 
threat to the nation as well as amherst because its findings could 
be used for military purposes the group went ahead with its own 
meeting thursday after the health board hearing it had requested was 
canceled 
anthrax is an infectious disease contracted by wild and 
domesticated animals especially cattle and sheep it is caused by a 
bacterium and can be transmitted to people 
the chief scientist on the research project curtis b thorne 
has maintained his work on the basic structure of the bacterium is 
aimed at finding a vaccine for the disease 
town manager barry delcastilho said he canceled the hearing after 
a town attorney warned him that two of the boards four members work 
at the university posing a conflict of interest he said he hoped 
to appoint a fifth member to the board soon to make a quorum for a 
hearing 
at the meeting bonifazs group presented a draft regulation that 
would ban military biological research others spoke to urge the 
board to stop the research which is funded by the department of 
defense 
research conducted under contract with the department of 
defense has military and not public health objectives it is the 
military contract for this research that is of concern to us said 
nachama wilker director of the council for responsible genetics in 
boston 
university officials didnt attend the meeting chancellor joseph 
duffey has argued that the strain of bacteria being tested is 
nonvirulent and has been under study for 23 years without incident 
he also said the schools policy is to allow defense department 
research as long as it is unclassified

the navajo high court dismissed an 
attempt by embattled tribal chairman peter macdonald to overturn his 
suspension over kickback allegations 
thursdays decision by the tribal supreme court apparently clears 
the way for the navajo tribal council to appoint an interim 
replacement for macdonald 
macdonald has been under fire since witnesses including his son 
told a us senate select committee that he had taken kickbacks and 
bribes from companies wanting to do business with the tribe 
macdonald has denied any wrongdoing 
in a lawsuit macdonald sought to have the councils decision to 
place him on leave declared illegal 
he first brought the lawsuit to kayenta tribal district judge 
harry brown his brotherinlaw who issued a temporary restraining 
order to stop the suspension 
but the tribal supreme court said that macdonald filed the suit 
in the wrong court that the brotherinlaw judge should have 
disqualified himself and that the council cannot be sued for its 
actions as a legislative body 
the courts decision did not specifically address the councils 
feb 17 decision to place macdonald on administrative leave 
lawyers for the council majority opposing macdonald declined to 
comment on the ruling macdonalds office said he might issue a 
statement later 
on wednesday the council authorized the tribal department of 
justice to file a civil fraud lawsuit against macdonald over the 
tribes purchase of the big boquillas ranch 
the councils resolution said the suit should try to recover 
any and all tribal funds wrongfully obtained by the sellers 
witnesses before the us senate panel testified that macdonald 
shared a phoenix oilmans 72 million profit from quick purchase 
and resale of the ranch to the tribe 
the navajos are the nations largest indian tribe approximately 
150000 of the tribes 200000 members live on the reservation 
which includes much of northeastern arizona as well as parts of 
northwestern new mexico and southeastern utah

think twice before setting foot on 
the beaches of rio de janeiro 
thousands of hungry little parasites are waiting hidden in the 
sand 
a city study of rios beaches that was released earlier this week 
says those chic beaches pictured on postcards and in international 
travel magazines are hardly pristine in fact the report warns 
theyre downright contaminated 
the sand is the dirtiest its ever been on record said 
carlos mora spokesman for rios sanitation department which 
conducted the study 
the study conducted last month and released tuesday found the 
sand of the toniest of rios beaches copacabana leme ipanema and 
leblon is packed with nine types of parasites carried in animal 
and human feces among them is the potentially fatal esquistossomose 
parasite which afflicts 8 million brazilians 
we dont want to create a panic mayor marcello alencar said 
when he announced the studys findings but the public ought to 
know what is happening in its city 
rios beaches polluted in the past by chemical waste from 
factories and by occasional breaks in sewage lines along the 
beachfront have new enemies now they are stray animals and 
homeless beggars who bed down on the beaches as well as hordes of 
street vendors in makeshift shacks along the shore 
a week ago in an effort to clean up the beaches police 
officials raided copacabana and hauled off hundreds of dollars worth 
of merchandise from the illegal stands parked on the beach and along 
the boardwalk 
but the peddlers and the animals returned the next day with a 
vengeance and the beaches took another drubbing 
you wouldnt catch me taking my kids to these beaches said 
mora the city has forgotten that it has to protect to beaches 
not just rave about how pretty they are 
he said that compared with a year ago when the beaches were last 
tested for pollution the beaches had gotten a lot worse 
despite the findings some health experts were skeptical of the 
potential health threat to sunseekers 
the sun kills the parasites on the surface said dr carlos 
albeto de freitas a disease control expert for the city the 
danger lies in the deeper sand 
still the possibility of catching a disease from the sand is 
greater than in past years 
people just ought to be careful they dont dig their feet too 
far under the sand de freitas said otherwise they might go 
home with more than a nice tan

in eight days political maverick edward vrdolyak 
has come out of hiding unofficially won the republican mayoral 
primary and posed a potential threat to richard m daleys bid to 
get his fathers old job 
vrdolyak a writein candidate has not been declared the 
official victor of tuesdays republican primary but thursdays 
canvass by the chicago board of election commissioners found him 
ahead 11621 to 10478 over herbert sohn 
if people can spell the name vrdolyak or close to it and 
write it in i mean it was just wonderful said the joyous 
exdemocrat a former alderman whose combative style is guaranteed 
to add spice to the campaign that leads to the april 4 general 
election 
his apparent victory sets up a threeway battle for mayor 
vrdolyak democratic nominee richard m daley both white and 
timothy evans a black alderman running as an independent 
the scenario is similar to the 1983 democratic primary in which 
daley and incumbent jane byrne split the white vote allowing harold 
washington to score a narrow victory on the way to eventually 
becoming the citys first black mayor 
the winner of the april 4 election fills the final two years of 
the fouryear term won by washington who died seven months after 
winning the april 1987 election 
paul kleppner a northern illinois university professor who has 
analyzed chicago voting trends for the us justice department 
downplayed the significance of vrdolyaks candidacy and predicted a 
daley triumph 
vrdolyak will only draw white votes away from daley if people 
are sure theyre not endangering the chance of a white candidate 
winning kleppner said 
still said analyst tom roesser active in local gop circles 
vrdolyaks votedrawing power far outstrips sohns 
eddie cant win but he could cause some real mischief 
roesser said 
daley son of 21year mayor richard j daley is vacationing in 
florida but his chief campaign strategist david axelrod said 
vrdolyaks influence on the election will be negligible 
four of the citys 2911 precincts remained to be counted and 
after another review the winner of the gop primary will be 
officially declared on tuesday 
sohn who was endorsed by the local republican party held out 
hope he could still be declared the gop nominee and his aides 
suggested the courts may make the final decision 
vrdolyak the former chairman of the cook county democratic 
party has lost his last two tries for office he ran as an 
independent for mayor in 1987 then became a republican and sought 
the office of clerk of the county court system last november 
after the november defeat he was rarely seen in public and gave 
few interviews to the news media but on feb 22 less than a week 
before the republican primary he appeared at a rally and said he 
would run as a writein candidate for mayor at the urging of his 
admirers

a bomb blast early today 
shattered windows at a civic center in a mining town where blacks 
have launched a consumer boycott to protest the resegregation of 
public facilities 
police said a limpet mine placed outside carletonvilles civic 
center banquet hall exploded shortly after midnight causing slight 
damage and no injuries 
less than two hours later a second bomb slightly damaged a power 
pylon in carletonville police said 
no arrests were reported and there were no claims of 
responsibility 
white storeowners in carletonville have reported a sharp drop in 
black patronage since the boycott began monday in the town 45 miles 
southwest of johannesburg the local chamber of commerce reportedly 
has drafted a memorandum urging the town council to abandon the 
resegregation campaign

towns were taken over by the extremeright conservative party in 
local elections last october carletonville and several other 
councils have restored whites only status to parks and other 
areas opened to all races in recent years 
the governing national party has indicated it is reevaluating

one of the four cannons that were all the 13 
colonies had when the revolutionary war started has been found in 
the basement of a police station ending a search that began nearly 
20 years ago 
it is a priceless piece of history which could be called a 
national treasure capt albert swanson metrolopitan district 
commission historian said after cannon was found thursday 
the 3footlong 500pound brass cannon believed to have been 
forged in london around 1760 was found behind dozens of bicycles in 
a storage room that was being cleaned at the metropolitan polices 
lower basin station 
swanson said it was used in the battle of bunker hill on june 17 
1775 two of the four cannons the colonies had at the start of the 
revolutionary war were captured by the british 
but the rediscovered cannon now called the hancock and the 
other now called the adams were hidden in a swamp in dedham 
swanson said 
the hancock and the adams were placed at the bunker hill monument 
during the 19th century the metropolitan district commission was in 
charge of the monument from 1919 until the national park service 
took it over in 1975 
when we took the site over in 75 there was one cannon tube 
the adams left at the top said peter steele curator of the 
monument 
they were a pair we contacted the mdc about the missing one 
but no one was able to put their fingers on it i had pretty much 
given up hope this is great news 
swanson said he knew the cannon had been brought to the police 
station but no one could tell him where it was and he had been 
keeping an eye out for it for 18 years he and steele thought it had 
been taken from the monument in 1970 or 1972 
what apparently happened is that a bracket holding the cannon 
broke swanson said it was brought to the station for 
safekeeping 
swanson said he hopes the cannon will be refurbished and placed 
in new brackets at the monument by june 17 bunker hill day

the united states and south korea today 
announced plans for largescale joint military exercises despite 
warnings from communist north korea that the maneuvers could wreck 
prospects for peace talks 
the us eighth army said about 200000 us and south korean 
troops along with air force and navy units would participate in 
the annual team spirit exercises beginning march 14 about 
70000 us troops are to take part 
north korea warned thursday during talks with south korean 
delegates that team spirit must be abandoned if the two sides 
are to make progress on easing tension across the divided peninsula 
north korean officials charged team spirit was preparation for a 
nuclear attack on the north 
north korea has been demanding a halt to team spirit for 
several months and todays announcement in seoul could be used by 
the north to end all talks with the capitalist south there was no 
immediate reaction from the north today 
south korean officials said they hoped north korea would continue 
talks on improving relations but that the exercises are vital to 
the souths defenses the north maintains far larger military forces 
than the south and seriously threatens south koreas safety they 
said 
north korea keeps armed forces estimated at 840000 troops south 
korea has about 600000 of its own forces in addition to us forces 
north korea and china will be invited to send observers to the 
exercises to show there was no hostile intention us officials 
said the north has rejected similar offers in the past 
north korea pulled out of peace talks with south korea in 1986 
after seoul refused to end team spirit that year us officials 
said the north might do the same thing this year 
north korean and south korean delegates failed to make progress 
thursday on setting terms for talks between their prime ministers 
after the north said team spirit must be called off before the 
opening of substantive negotiations the two sides agreed to meet 
again april 12 
us and south korean officials said team spirit was being 
held for the 14th consecutive year as a purely defensive exercise 
that poses no threat to the north 
the purpose is to train american and south korean forces to 
defend korea its never threatened north korea in the past and 
there is no threat this time said a us military spokesman on 
condition of anonymity 
the exercises will be on the same scale as in 1988 the us 
spokesman said 
the soldiers will practice reinforcing south korean units with 
us troops in the event of a north korean attack the united states 
has about 42000 troops based in the south under a mutual defense 
treaty and about 30000 others will come from the united states to 
take part in the maneuvers 
the exercise will involve us ground forces including units 
based on the american west coast along with major us navy and 
us air force units 
us military officials stressed today that the exercises would 
be held far away from the north korean border to avoid any risk of 
an accidental confrontation the main exercises will be held march 
1423 
the two koreas are archrivals with hundreds of thousands of 
troops facing each other along their 150mile border the north 
invaded the south in 1950 launching the korean war they are 
technically still at war because no peace treaty was signed

farce is built on desperation and things dont 
get more desperate than the doings at the cleveland grand opera 
company circa 1934 
its gala benefit performance of otello is threatened by the 
apparent demise of famed italian tenor and unrepentant ladies man 
tito merelli the company along with 50 pounds of shrimp 
mayonnaise may expire unless someone can be found quickly to 
replace the man known to his adoring fans as il stupendo 
that is the basic setup for lend me a tenor a new farce by 
ken ludwig that barreled into broadways royale theater on thursday 
night although the play is slight the evening is still delirium 
triumphant primarily because of the crackerjack direction of jerry 
zaks and a superb cast led by victor garber and philip bosco 
youll know lend me a tenor is a farce the minute the curtain 
rises on six smashing art deco doors scattered throughout designer 
tony waltons allwhite hotel suite they are waiting to be slammed 
and zaks sees that they are in high often hilarious style 
tito of course is not dead hes sleeping off a combination of 
red wine and phenobarbital but neither the opera company manager 
bosco nor his milquetoast assistant max garber knows that 
max a frustrated opera performer rises to titos high c 
slapping on blackface a shaggy wig and the singers purple tights 
he goes on for the star and no one knows the difference when tito 
wakes up he dons an identical costume didnt you know he would 
carry a spare and suddenly there are two tenors and glorious 
confusion 
much of the fun is physical rather than verbal garber mixing a 
drink with his finger bosco attacking a bowl of wax fruit or garber 
desperately trying to wake up the horizontal tenor zaks 
inventiveness is astonishing he has to work hard with ludwigs 
script some of the jokes are obvious unsurprising laughs but zaks 
does his best to divert attention from these dips in dialogue 
still there are some very funny situations particularly in the 
second act the opera disguise allows max to change his personality 
he becomes forceful and is able to conquer the opera managers 
daughter shes looking for a fling but only wants to be flung by 
tito garber is all bumbling sweetness a walter mitty who discovers 
his voice and confidence at the same time 
if garber is all mumbles bosco is all roar the actor raises 
apoplexy to high art particularly in one scene when he throws 
himself in a rage at titos inert body seldom has such fury been so 
funny 
ron holgate cant quite hold onto his italian accent but 
everything else is just about right in his performance as the 
overinflated tito hes even a fine singer and hes perfectly 
matched with tovah feldshuh as his jealous wife who one minute is a 
purring pussycat the next a snarling panther 
j smithcameron is fetching as the ingenue a stereotypical role 
that usually is more simpering than sexy jane connell charges 
merrily through the play as the chairman of the opera guild and 
there is other good support by caroline lagerfelt as an amorous 
soprano and jeff brooks as an operatic bellhop 
the glamorous costumes by william ivey long epitomize the 1930s 
some of them are even funny particularly an evening gown for miss 
connell that makes her in the words of another character look 
like the chrysler building 
lend me a tenor isnt feydeau not much is these days 
particularly on broadway but it is great fun particularly because 
of zaks orchestrating all those slamming doors 
in other reviews 
sheer craziness is how clive barnes of the new york post 
described the play if you are feeling under the weather or even 
over the weather for that matter and you believe laughter is the 
best medicine let me prescribe for you this lovely dose of pure 
operatic idiocy 
howard kissel in the daily news called the play enjoyable under 
jerry zaks brilliant direction although he noted that the plot 
would not withstand intense scrutiny 
but in the new york times frank rich said the play was all 
things farcical except hilarious the lines are almost never 
witty settling instead for double entendres and worse too 
many of the farcical situations seem like pale echoes of those in 
similar works from the plays period

west german computer hackers have 
stolen data that provides access to key military and research 
computers in the west and passed that information to the soviets 
officials and news reports said 
a west german television network on thursday said passwords 
codes and other information came from computers in the united 
states western europe and japan west germany prosecutors said 
three people were arrested and a tv network said at least 10 
computer hackers were involved in the spy ring 
the norddeutsche rundfunk broadcasting network said among the 
computers was the us defense departments general databank known 
as optimus a nasa and a star wars research computer and 
computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy research at the los 
alamos national laboratory in new mexico and the fermi national 
accelerator laboratory in illinois 
the network said attempts were made to gain access to the 
lawrence berkeley laboratory at the university of california which 
it called a key link in efforts to break into other us computers 
clifford stoll an astrophysicist who did research at the 
laboratory said up to 50 military computers were broken into 
through an astronomy computer but that the hacker did not have 
passwords for classified information 
we were amazed heres some guy breaking into an astronomy 
computer in berkeley reaching out into military computers trying to 
search for information about sdi the strategic defense initiative 
known as star wars about nuclear warheads stoll said in a 
telephone interview thursday from his home in cambridge mass 
stoll who works at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory at 
harvard university said he and other researchers helped break the 
spy ring by providing false information he said someone linked to 
east bloc groups wrote the laboratory asking for related 
information leading authorities to crack the ring he did not 
elaborate 
alexander prechtel spokesman for the federal prosecutors office 
in karlsruhe said police in hanover arrested two computer hackers 
on suspicion of espionage activities for an eastern european 
intelligence agency another suspect was arrested in west berlin 
he said 
they are suspected of breaking into foreign computer systems 
and selling information to communist agents prechtel said 
he said investigators are trying to assess how much damage was 
caused to western security interests 
roland bachmeier spokesman for the federal interior ministry 
said information was provided to soviet intelligence agents 
the officials declined to elaborate 
in hamburg today west germanys bestknown club for computer 
hackers said that in autumn 1987 it warned federal officials about 
the vulnerability of international computer systems however chaos 
computer club president wau holland said federal officials did not 
take the opportunity for a talk 
norddeutsche rundfunk said that at the bidding of soviet agents 
the computer hackers gained access to a us defense department 
computer and important research and business computers elsewhere 
the hackers obtained sensitive information that would allow the 
soviets themselves to gain access to the computers and develop 
technology based on the information the network said 
the information would also give the kremlin access to us 
military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging to 
several european institutes that deal with atomic and aerospace 
research the network said 
thousands of computer codes passwords and programs were 
delivered to the soviets the network said they opened the door 
for the kgb to gain access to some of the most important computer 
centers of the western world 
william bardeen head of the theory group at fermilab in batavia 
said soviets participate in research there so there are soviet 
scientists living at fermilab and using the computers there isnt 
anything confidential or strategic in the computers 
jeff schwartz spokesman for los alamos national laboratory said 
he knew of no evidence that a foreign intelligence agency had gained 
access to its classified computer system 
norddeutsche runkfunk said the three suspects were detained 
following searches of at least six apartments in west berlin and 
hanover 
zdf television said the three suspects belonged to a hardcore 
of 10 hackers 
according to norddeutsche rundfunk authorities believe the three 
west german hackers were recruited by the kgb the soviet 
intelligence agency in 1985 and were paid with cash and drugs 
and were later forced to provide the codes and passwords to the 
soviets 
the network said the trio handed over information from the united 
states japan britain france italy switzerland and west germany 
at a 1985 meeting with two kgb agents in east berlin 
in tokyo a laboratory official said today that unknown west 
german hackers broke into a computer system in a japanese government 
research laboratory in 1985 
the national laboratory for high energy physics discovered that a 
research project was penetrated in mid1985 laboratory spokesman 
shinichi watanabe said he said no sensitive information was stolen 
and the laboratory has since heightened security by changing 
passwords and other measures 
he said it was not known if the intruders were part of the 
alleged spy ring in west germany

a federal appeals court upheld a decision 
that 26 antiabortion activists had violated racketeering laws with 
their protests a ruling one lawyer said strikes a blow at the 
very heart of the antiabortion movement 
abortion foes and their lawyers attacked the decision calling it 
a serious setback for people who practice civil disobedience 
a threejudge panel of the 3rd us circuit court of appeals on 
thursday upheld a lower court decision that the protesters violated 
racketeering laws by conspiring to prevent abortions at northeast 
womens center inc a philadelphia clinic the court also awarded 
about 110000 in damages and attorneys fees to the center 
the centers lawsuit was the first test of the federal racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act in a civil case against 
abortion demonstrators said edmond a tiryak the lawyer who 
brought the action for the clinic 
from our point of view this is an important example that will 
be used nationally he said the lawsuit has been used as a model 
by other clinics in as many as 11 other cases still at the trial 
level he said 
the center had charged that the protesters used force threats 
and trespassing to intimidate center employees and women seeking 
abortions 
whats been going on at the center has been intimidation and 
fear said tiryak this opinion i think strikes a blow at the 
very heart of that activity by the prolife movement 
an antiabortion leader named in the suit lambasted the decision 
but predicted it wouldnt stop future demonstrations 
the american judicial system has taken a vengeance against 
anyone who tries to stand up for children in the womb said 
michael mcmonagle executive director of the prolife coalition of 
southeast pennsylvania 
nevertheless he said that since the lawsuit was filed in 1987 
the rescue movement has taken off the ground and rico suits cant 
stop it now 
the rico act has most often been used against organized crime 
figures but tiryak said it was applicable in the case because 
protesters used extortion in the form of threats and force to 
deny the center its right to operate and to deny women their right 
to use the center 
the appelate panel unanimously upheld a june 1987 finding by a 
federal district jury that the protesters had engaged in a pattern 
of criminal activity from 1984 to 1986 designed to prevent the 
center from providing abortions 
the appeals court said videotapes made by the center revealed 
demonstrators pushing shoving and tugging on patients as they 
attempted to approach the center knocking over and crossing police 
barricades and blocking the ingress of cars 
the court rejected the protesters argument that their actions 
were justified because of the issue saying they could have used 
numerous legal alternatives to persuade women not to have abortions 
short of harassment 
tiryak contended the center lost its lease and was forced to move 
because of the protests 
mcmonagle claimed no protester was ever charged with assault 
even though police were present at the demonstrations 
pushing doesnt make a racketeer doesnt make extortionist 
he said 
mcmonagle said the protesters will request that the full appeals 
court review the decision by the threejudge panel 
the appeals court ordered the district court to further consider 
injunctions the center is seeking to limit the number of 
demonstrators outside the center and prohibit them from using 
bullhorns 
meanwhile a federal judge in los angeles issued a temporary 
restraining order barring the antiabortion group operation rescue 
from blockading womens health clinics in california during its 
planned easter week protests 
us district judge terry hatters order which was sought by the 
american civil liberties union instructs protesters to stay at 
least 15 feet away from clinics 
operation rescue leaders said they hoped to assemble 10000 
demonstrators in los angeles to blockade clinics from march 2225

laotians fleeing communist persecution 
have been forced back to their homeland by thais and hundreds if 
not thousands of them have died a us human rights group claimed 
today in a report 
a thai interior ministry official denied his country had forced 
anyone back the official speaking thursday on condition of 
anonymity said the report could damage relations between thailand 
and laos two weeks before scheduled talks on the repatriation of 
laotians 
the lawyers committee for human rights in its report cited two 
november 1987 cases in which laotian soldiers allegedly massacred 
groups of 33 and 16 laotian hill people just after they were evicted 
from thai soil 
the 64page report however gave no evidence of more recent 
largescale killings western officials in thailand involved in 
refugee affairs said thursday that laotians seeking asylum are being 
forced to return 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said some 
slayings have been reported but they have no evidence of hundreds 
of deaths 
in the 1987 massacre of 33 people which has been cited by other 
sources the report quoted the sole survivor an 8yearold girl 
she told the committee that the soldiers lined up the group put 
ropes around the necks of the adults told the women to hold their 
babies in front of them and opened fire 
thailand has a policy of systematically denying asylum by 
pushing back laotian asylum seekers on its northern border the 
report said this has resulted in the deaths of hundreds if not 
thousands of laotians 
it said the policy represents a serious violation of human 
rights and humanitarian principles 
in january the new yorkbased lawyers committee angered thai 
officials with a report saying that hundreds of vietnamese boat 
people died last year after thai authorities forced them back to sea 
large numbers of laotians have fled their homeland since the 
communists seized power in 1975 the persecution has been most 
severe on the hill people or hmongs whom the united states had 
recruited to fight the communists during the indochina war 
thai officials say they must take tough measures to curb the 
influx of laotians because they say the united states and other 
western nations are not resettling enough of them 
it said that along the border the laotians are routinely 
subject to extortion rape and other forms of brutality by 
smugglers thai and vietnamesepathet lao laotian communist 
security forces and other armed parties 
under a un program thailand is supposed to allow entry to all 
laotians into thailand for an interview to determine whether they 
fled political persecution or are economic migrants but the report 
said sections of the border are sealed off 
along other border areas extortion and bribery are 
widespread with some laotians having to pay thai officials to 
receive an interview the report said 
the report said that if fair procedures cannot be achieved the 
un refugee agency should publicly denounce the interview 
program 
western officials confirmed the abuses related to the screening 
according to un figures through december the thais screened 
26067 laotians and admitted 22492 of them as refugees 
the report also criticized abuses by thai officials in the 
unaided camps housing about 76000 laotians the camp commander 
at chiang kham allegedly humiliated tortured and raped refugees he 
was transferred in may 1988 but has not been prosecuted the report 
said

an american flag that is spread on the floor at a 
student art exhibit can stay put a judge ruled but students 
protested school restrictions on who could see it 
it is good to know that the flag has not lost its ability to 
communicate ideas cook county circuit judge kenneth gillis said 
in rejecting a lawsuit filed by veterans groups that sought to 
prevent the flag from being displayed on the floor 
the exhibit at the school of the art institute of chicago is as 
much an invitation to think about the flag as it is an invitation to 
step on the flag gillis said 
it seems to me that this country is large enough to permit this 
expression gillis said expression is part of the equation that 
makes this country strong 
while the judge ruled thursday it is not illegal for the artist 
to place the flag on the floor he said it is unlawful for viewers 
to step on it 
robert jones a spokesman for the veterans of foreign wars said 
he was very hurt by gillis dismissal of the lawsuit 
the flag to me is a living thing and they dont have any right 
to do that to it jones said but well abide by the ruling 
its a nation of laws 
veterans contend the work invites viewers to trample the flag 
the exhibit of students work was reopened thursday after 
protests last week prompted a closure but only students faculty 
and staff were permitted 
students immediately protested the limitation and urged the 
exhibit be opened to the public and the media 
only in a space open to the public does freedom of expression 
truly exist restricted viewing is censorship luis brown a 
student spokesman said at a rally outside the school as about 200 
people cheered 
administrators said the limited reopening would preserve the 
artists rights while protecting the school and other students 
our main concern right now is to maintain security and to keep 
the show open for faculty staff and students said peter brown 
the schools vice president 
scott tyler the artist said at the rally that although the us 
flag symbolizes freedom to some people it represents domination and 
suppression to others 
in his work titled what is the proper way to display a us 
flag a flag is spread on the floor in front of a montage of 
photographs of flagdraped coffins south koreans burning the us 
flag and other scenes

britains foreign secretary said in an interview 
broadcast today in iran that the satanic verses offends moslems 
and british but irans president said britain will be forced to 
apologize and retreat 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe of britain made his comments 
after the iranian parliament voted tuesday to break diplomatic ties 
with britain within one week if british officials refused to disavow 
the controversial novel by salman rushdie 
howe said today the novel not only offended moslems but also 
insulted the british by comparing their country to nazi germany 
while carefully distancing his government from the novel however 
howe defended the right of rushdie to publish the work 
irans president ali khamenei shot back whether britain 
apologizes or not there is no doubt that it will be forced to 
apologize and retreat in the face of the great islamic nation his 
remarks reported by the official islamic republic news agency were 
made at mass prayers today 
in a commentary the news agency spurned howes conciliatory 
remarks though geoffrey howe seemed interested in ties with iran 
and agreed that the book has hurt moslem feelings his interview 
showed no signs that the uk government has revised its stance on 
the satanic work irna said late thursday the interview made it 
clear that he was playing with words 
irna also ridiculed what it called those stereotyped statements 
of the right of freedom to speak which have become customary of 
british officials of late who seem to be unmoved by the injured 
feelings of the planets more than one billion moslems 
the interview with howe was broadcast by the british broadcasting 
corps persian service thursday night and this morning the bbc 
said it was to be repeated later today 
british officials said thursday they had rejected an iranian 
offer of negotiations saying iran must first renounce its call for 
violence in the dispute 
iran claimed the overtures for conciliation came from britain and 
that rushdie remains subject to divine justice 
irans spiritual leader the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on feb 
14 told moslems to kill rushdie for the novel which many moslems 
say is blasphemous iranian moslem clergymen have offered a bounty 
of 52 million for the death of the writer who was born a moslem 
in india 
rushdie now a british citizen has been in hiding under police 
protection with his american wife novelist marianne wiggins 
in his comments howe insisted there was no point talking to iran 
while the death threat against rushdie remains in place 
howe said we do understand that the book has been found deeply

a tanker carrying 90000 barrels of crude oil ran 
aground in stormy seas about 15 miles from hawaiis most popular 
tourist area spilling an estimated 117000 gallons of fuel oil and 
crude into the water officials said 
coast guard spokesman keith spangler said the 800foot tanker 
exxon houston sent a distress call at 820 pm thursday off the 
hawaiian island of oahu 
the captain of the tanker reported the ship was hard aground 
threetenths of a mile northwest of barbers point on oahus 
southwest coast about 15 miles west of the islands densely 
populated area containing honolulu and waikiki beach its most 
popular tourist area spangler said 
theyve told us their fuel tanks were completedly emptied 
spangler said 
he said an estimated 92000 gallons of fuel oil had leaked 
through holes in the tankers hull and 25000 gallons of crude oil 
had spilled 
spangler said it wasnt clear whether the crude leaked when the 
tanker broke loose from its moorings in 12to14foot seas or 
whether it spilled through holes in the hull officials dont know 
if crude is continuing to leak he added 
spangler said the oahu civil defense agency reported early today 
that fuel oil was washing ashore on the beach at barbers point 
however he said the length of shoreline affected probably wouldnt 
be known until daybreak 
winds and ocean currents should direct the spill east toward 
honolulu spangler said earlier coast guard reports said rough seas 
appeared to be dissipating the oil 
leonard alcantara a honolulu attorney for exxon said the ships 
captain kevin dick and the 23member crew have remained aboard and 
were in no danger 
they said theyve suffered some damage but they dont know how 
much yet spangler said 
the exxon houston was unloading alaska north slope oil at the 
hawaiian independent refinery at about 525 pm when a mooring line 
broke causing the offloading hoses to break said andrea simpson a 
spokeswoman for pacific resources inc the refinerys parent 
company 
the vessel reported trouble but did not request coast guard 
assistance when it broke its moorings spangler said 
a total of nine commercial and us navy tugboats were dispatched 
to help dislodge the tanker and environmental specialists also were 
en route officials said

oriented and violent programs that cut into the network television 
fare her children can watch 
the 40yearold mother of four offended by the offcolor humor 
on the primetime series married with children conveyed her 
distaste to the shows major advertisers in a flurry of letters 
starting in january 
much to mrs rakoltas surprise the letters prompted two of the 
nations largest advertisers procter amp gamble co and mcdonalds 
corp and several others to pull their commercials from the series 
the toprated program on the fledgling fox broadcasting co network 
the american family is being painted into a corner its an 
invasion of my privacy at this point mrs rakolta said thursday 
she said she objects to having to monitor primetime television 
for shows she doesnt want her younger children to watch if 
people want that stuff they can pay for it or rent it or go to 
the movies she said 
but fox which has tried to attract young adult audiences has 
had no trouble selling advertising time on the sunday evening show 
despite mrs rakoltas efforts said fox spokesman brad turell in 
los angeles 
the show is completely sold out he said adding that reports 
of mrs rakoltas campaign have rallied support behind the show 
we have received literally hundreds of telephone calls today 
from across the country from viewers saying that this one womans 
opinion is getting too much attention and hoping that we wont 
change the show turell said 
mrs rakolta who lives in the affluent suburb of bloomfield 
hills and has three daughters ages 18 10 and 9 and a son 8 said 
she intends to start a group or join existing ones to organize 
national boycotts of advertisers 
her writing campaign began one sunday night in january when she 
and her children watched married with children and she ended 
up shooing the children out of the room

advertised then stayed up to 4 am writing letters 
since she wrote to them procter amp gamble mcdonalds 
kimberlyclark corp and tambrands inc have told their advertising

portrayal of american family life said procter amp gamble 
spokeswoman kelly gillespie 
the president of cocacola usa ira herbert said his company 
will screen future episodes more closely

refined tastes 
hal katz executive vice president of vitt media international 
inc a new york ad buyer said the amount of sex depicted on 
television is rising dramatically adding as it increases

fighting for custody of the fertilized eggs they put in frozen 
storage a few years ago 
junior lewis davis 30 says he does not want his wife mary sue 
davis 28 to become pregnant and a judge has issued an order 
temporarily blocking her from having the embryos implanted 
despite davis divorce petition and his objection to becoming a 
father mrs davis has said she eventually plans to have the eggs 
implanted according to the complaint 
davis contends that he and wife jointly own the fertilized eggs 
and that any plans to use the frozen embryos to become pregnant as 
late as several years from now have an impact on his life 
blount county circuit judge w dale young has agreed and on feb 
23 he issued the order that also prohibits mrs davis from removing 
any of the eggs from frozen storage pending further hearings 
seven of the couples fertilized eggs are stored at fort sanders

the united states and the soviet union have 
agreed to increases in their embassy staffs reversing a cutback 
forced by the reagan administration after reporter nicholas daniloff 
was accused in moscow of spying 
charles e redman the state department spokesman said friday 
that 18 positions were added last month to the us embassy in the 
soviet capital and to the soviet embassy here along with two 
additional slots at the us and soviet consulates in leningrad and 
san francisco 
on aug 1 redman said 13 additional slots will be added to each 
of the embassies and two more to the consulates the maximums then 
would be 256 for the embassies and 30 for the consulates 
daniloffs arrest he was subsequently released touched off a 
diplomatic tiff in which the reagan administration in october 1986 
imposed ceilings of 225 at the embassies and 26 at the consulates 
this forced the soviets which had a bigger staff to withdraw 
about 80 workers 
explaining the reversal redman said the workload at the us 
embassy and consulate had increased more visas are being issued for 
soviets emigrating and for those going to the united states on

a steward from a jordanian jet hijacked in 1985 
testified friday that accused sky pirate fawaz younis threatened to 
kill passengers and crew and tricked them into believing his men had 
shot the planes security guards 
the steward omar suliman el ghadi 32 was the fifth witness in 
the trial at us district court to identify younis as the leader of 
five heavily armed men who stormed aboard royal jordanian airlines 
flight 402 in beirut on june 11 1985 
in the initial moments of the hijacking el ghadi testified 
younis ran to the front of the boeing 727 pounded on the locked 
cockpit door with his gun and shouted if you dont open the door 
i will explode it 
the hijackers were armed with ak47 assault rifles and hand 
grenades according to testimony from other witnesses and a 
videotape taken at the end of the 30hour ordeal 
the testimony by el ghadi was the first during the fiveday trial 
to portray younis as directly threatening the passengers and crew 
with death 
younis 30 has pleaded innocent to a sixcount indictment 
stemming from the hijacking 
he was captured by fbi agents in international waters in the 
mediterranean sea more than two years after the hijacking on sept 
13 1987 and the trial is seen as a test of a 1984 statute in which 
us authorities assert longarm jurisdiction over the taking of 
american hostages abroad 
near the end of the hijacking el ghadi testified the sky 
pirates told passengers and crew that at 7 am the following 
morning they would start killing them the security officers 
first 
the hijackers removed jewelry from a female security officer and 
led all nine of them off the plane 
we heard gunfire testified el ghadi 
younis called nazeeh by the other hijackers came back aboard 
and said thats it we killed the security and put their bodies 
in the cargo of the airplane 
the security officers were not in fact killed and el ghadi said 
that when he saw them later in jordan i was shocked 
el ghadi began his testimony by describing the early moments of 
the hijacking as gunshots were heard outside the plane passengers 
streamed inside knocking the sky marshals off balance and the 
hijackers ran aboard 
the steward testified that he refused orders from the hijackers 
to close the door of the airplane for takeoff and that a few 
moments later younis emerged from the cockpit slapping and 
pushing the flight engineer to the rear to close the door 
another hijacker called no 2 by el ghadi then began to 
beat the female security guard and threatened her with a knife el 
ghadi intervened 
hijacker no 2 put his submachine gun at the back of my head 
and ordered him to search her the steward testified 
after refueling in cyprus the hijackers ordered the plane flown 
to tunis where they wanted to read a statement demanding that 
palestinians be removed from lebanon tunisian authorities blocked 
the runways with trucks and the plane returned to beirut 
the sky marshals were taken off the plane followed several hours 
later by the passengers and crew most of whom shook hands with the 
younis as they left 
el ghadi said he refused to shake hands and was again threatened 
with death but was allowed to board a bus with the other passengers 
and crew

racial tensions sparked when several 
white students waved confederate flags during a black history 
program prompted officials to close classes for spring vacation two 
weeks early

and decided to dismiss school superintendent kenny goodwin said 
after students were sent home at 830 am friday 
he said the weeklong spring holiday would begin monday instead 
of march 20 and will be a cooling off period

disturbance had been disciplined but not all had been suspended 
in protest of mondays incident black athletes began a boycott 
of the football and baseball teams 
several black students interviewed after school thursday said 
they dropped out of sports activities because they were hurt by 
what the white kids did 
some of the whites involved in the flag incident were members of 
the football team said one black player who asked not to be 
identified weve been playing with them all this time and then 
they do that it hurt us he said

saying the law works both ways 
officials are forcing a storefront church to move because its too 
close to a liquor store and lounge 
residents of this community near orlando voted in 1984 to change 
the city charter to prohibit business within 1200 feet of a school 
or church from selling liquor the intent may have been to protect 
churchgoers and schoolchildren city commissioners said but in this 
case the liquor store was there first by 24 years so the oakview 
baptist church will have to leave 
the 40member church which holds services on sundays and 
wednesdays moved into the oneroom office in september 
parttime pastor don voss a school bus driver says moving would 
be a hardship the 5yearold church has moved several times and had 
only 5 in its treasury after he paid last months rent of 375 he 
said thursday 
he questioned why the city didnt catch the infraction earlier 
the congregation is made up of fruit pickers house cleaners bus 
drivers and security guards we just barely can make it we dont 
have much income said voss who is not paid a salary 
a member of the code enforcement board raised the issue when 
commissioners met with three city boards last month the city 
attorney was asked to research the question and he reported last 
week that the church violated the city charter the law cannot be 
changed without a voter referendum 
personally i wish nobody had brought it up said 
commissioner john rees 
commissioner theo graham who was instrumental in the petition 
drive that got the 1200foot restriction on the ballot said the 
intent was not to stop a church from coming in if they want to be 
that close to a bar thats their business 
the city code enforcement officer glen venable said the church 
had 30 days to leave

orders to us factories for manufactured goods 
declined 13 percent in january reflecting a fallback in demand for 
transportation equipment from record levels a month earlier the 
government reported friday 
analysts said that despite the overall decline the report 
provided evidence of continued strength in the economy 
excluding transportation orders were up 02 percent in january 
after a 18 percent rise in december 
the category of nondefense capital goods viewed as a barometer 
of future industry investment plans rose 16 percent in january to 
401 billion 
there may be a little more strength in investment than we had 
previously thought said economist john hagens of the wefa group 
a forecasting firm in bala cynwyd pa 
overall orders for durable and nondurable manufactured goods 
fell to a seasonally adjusted 2358 billion in january after 
posting a 47 percent increase in december the commerce department 
reported 
it was the first decline in factory orders since a 19 percent 
drop in september 
the decline was attributed to a retreat in demand for ships 
tanks and planes that resulted in an 85 percent decline in orders 
for transportation equipment last month the category had surged 
221 percent during the previous month to a record 396 billion 
the motor vehicle aircraft and shipbuilding industries all had 
posted large gains in december 
defense orders subject to wide swings depending on when 
contracts are signed plunged 339 percent in january to 69 
billion after a 24 percent surge in december 
excluding the military orders were up 02 percent in january 
after a 4 percent gain in december 
analysts expect economic growth to slow this year as the federal 
reserve board continues to tighten its grip on the money supply to 
cool the economy and dampen inflationary pressures 
but most economic reports for january have signaled continued 
strength in the economy at the start of the new year 
irwin kellner chief economist for manufacturers hanover trust 
co in new york said januarys factory orders figures were 
consistent with the feeling that the economy is still growing at a 
respectable rate 
for all of 1988 orders for manufacturers goods were up 97 
percent the best showing since 1979 after posting a 71 percent 
gain during 1987 
american manufacturing was bolstered by strong demand for exports 
in the past two years as the decline in the value of the dollar 
against foreign currencies made us products more competitive in 
the international marketplace 
in january orders for big ticket durable goods items 
expected to last three years or longer were down 27 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 1285 billion 
demand for nondurable goods meanwhile was up 05 percent to 
1073 billion 
shipments of manufacturered goods were up 03 percent in january 
to a seasonally adjusted 2316 billion

an oil slick was spotted today off sensitive marine 
reserves in the northern florida keys but coast guard officials 
said the spill did not appear to be a threat to the area 
a flyover by coast guard officials found the slick was 2 miles 
long and a quartermile wide much smaller than first reported 
its not as bad as we feared coast guard spokesman joe dye 
said 
parks in the area reported small gobs of tar washing up and said 
there did not appear to be major damage 
dye said dead birds were found out near the oil but it was not 
clear if they were killed by the slick 
a fisherman reported the oil just before 10 am dye said 
we have no idea where it came from he said there are 
apparently no ships in the area 
the gulf stream runs past key largo at that point which means 
the oil could have come north from cuba or even farther away 
the oil floated close to two sensitive north key largo marine 
reserves the key largo national marine sanctuary and john 
pennekamp coral reef state park 
pennekamp boasts the nations only shallowwater living coral 
reef which also extends into the federal key largo reserves 
coast guard and park officials will consult to decide whether to 
order booms placed around the slick immediately and send boats to 
clean up the oil dye said 
although the coast guard said the spill was 10 to 12 miles 
offshore there were reports of tar balls at the 120squaremile key 
largo reserve said park spokeswoman maddy hoover 
we dont know too much just yet but weve gotten reports that 
weve got crude oil and tar balls from the size of baseballs to the 
size of grapefruit she said 
the 20milelong reserve stretches north from molasses point off 
the atlantic shore of key largo and includes the area outside the 
3mile limit while pennekamp includes the shoreline and out to the 
3mile limit in some of the same areas she said

government troops and workers ordered to 
abandon wartorn northern ethiopia to rebels were stranded friday 
for lack of transport an african diplomat said 
i understand it will take them a long time before they can 
return the foreign envoy said in a telephone interview from 
ethiopias capital addis ababa 
if troops civil servants and other officials abandon tigray 
province as ordered monday by the government that would leave the 
administration with no overland access to eritrea the extreme 
northern province that has the east african nations only ports the 
government still is flying planes into assab and massawa its main 
ports on the red sea 
the retreat follows a series of rebel victories which the 
government referred to indirectly thursday in a statement urging 
ethiopians to be ready for an active involvement in every area of 
the armed struggle 
no nation can tolerate violence and there is no alternative 
now except to join hands and diffuse the aggression launched against 
the ethiopian people said the statement published by the 
official ethiopian news agency 
the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said he did 
not know if rebels have moved into towns in northern tigray province 
evacuated by the government 
there are no government troops fighting there he said 
even those who are left are in southern tigray there are no 
government officials in the north 
the government did not refer directly to tuesday reports by 
insurgents that the government had evacuated tigrays provincial 
capital mekele fearing humiliating and shaking defeat as in enda 
selassie and surrounding areas 
enda selassie is near mekele 475 miles northwest of addis ababa 
the whole of tigray is now liberated from the fascist regime of 
mengistu rebel spokesman yemane kidane told a reporter in sudans 
capital khartoum 
the government said the secessionist tplf and the eritrean 
peoples liberation front had coordinated attacks against ethiopian 
army along adwa aksum and enda selassie route with the view to 
dismember the ethiopian red sea area from the rest of the country 
kidane said tigrean rebels destroyed ethiopias 206th army corps 
killing and wounding 14645 soldiers and capturing 12975 including 
a general rebel claims often are exaggerated and there was no way 
to verify kidanes statement 
early last year tigrean and eritrean rebels in a joint offensive 
captured several towns which the government retook in a midyear 
counteroffensive 
eritrean rebels have been fighting for independence since 1962 in 
africas oldest civil war the tigreans took up arms to demand more 
autonomy 
mengistu inherited the rebellion in 1974 when he and fellow 
officers overthrew the late emperor haile selassie and established a 
marxist government

president bush called friday for banning the 
production and use of ozonedepleting chemicals entirely by the end 
of the century if adequate substitutes can be found 
the moves to protect the worlds ozone layer which shields the 
earth from much of the suns cancercausing ultraviolet rays came 
on the heels of a decision thursday by 12 european countries to 
pursue a ban on the chemicals instead of only cutting back on 
production as the worlds industrial nations had earlier agreed to 
do 
the united states accounts for about onethird of the production 
of ozonedamaging chemicals primarily chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
which are widely used as coolants in refrigerators and air 
conditions and as a cleaning agent for electronic and computer 
equipment 
richard k reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
had sought the stronger administration position on cfcs prior to his 
departure friday for london where representatives from more than 100 
nations are meeting to discuss the ozonedepletion problem 
reilly according to administration sources had strongly 
recommended at a white house meeting thursday that the united states 
should join its european allies and call for the complete 
elimination of cfcs as opposed to cutting production by only 50 
percent as required by current treaty 
under a 1987 treaty the industrial nations are committed to 
halving cfc production by the year 2000 but many scientists have 
said that such a cutback would not be enough to protect against 
serious ozone depletion 
on thursday the 12 nations of the european economic community 
announced in brussels belgium that they have agreed to a total ban 
on the chemical in their countries by the end of the century reilly 
is known to have wanted to carry a similar commitment with him to 
the london conference which is scheduled to begin sunday 
we intend to reaffirm the strong position of the united states 
about chlorofluorocarbon manufacture and use reilly said friday 
adding that we intend to maintain our leadership among the 
worlds nations in dealing with the ozonedepletion problem 
scientists have raised concerns about the chemical because it 
does not break down at lower altitudes and floats into the 
stratosphere where it breaks down and interacts with the gaseous 
veil of ozone that shields against the suns cancercausing

white chocolate will be the hot chocolate of the 
90s food experts at a convention of chefs say the drink of choice 
at coffeehouses and ski lodges soon may be white chocolate 
cappuccino 
europeans have enjoyed white chocolate for years but the 
confection has gone largely ignored in the united states because 
federal regulations forbid the term white chocolate 
manufacturers were wary of marketing the candy the success of 
nestles white alpine candy bar introduced in 1985 has changed all 
that 
marty friedman editor of the floridabased new product news 
named white chocolate as one of the top 15 new food trends during 
this weeks international association of food professionals 
convention 
its the last unexplored avenue in the chocolate world said 
janice wald henderson west coast editor of chocolatier magazine and 
author of a white chocolate cookbook white chocolate was the last 
stone unturned 
hendersons cookbook contains recipes for white chocolate 
waffles white chocolate pound cake white hot chocolate white 
chocolate bread pudding and white chocolate german cake 
its a big hit now said liz echendia copublisher of the 
confectioner a national trade publication its a new taste that 
hasnt been around before 
white chocolate introduced in switzerland after world war i 
comes from the cocoa bean and differs from milk chocolate and dark 
chocolate only in that it lacks a liquid chocolate extract the 
substance that gives standard chocolate its bitter sharper 
flavor according to chocolate experts 
it has many of the flavor notes of milk chocolate but it has a 
lighter cleaner taste said carl anderson a vice president of 
nestle foods corp in white plains ny where the 40cent alpine 
white with almonds bar has become one of the topselling 25 candy 
bars in the country 
nestle circumvented the white chocolate definition problem by 
describing the contents of the bar as what europeans call white 
chocolate on the back of the label otherwise its referred to 
only as alpine white 
i wouldnt be surprised if deep down inside people think it 
has less calories than other chocolate said friedman it looks 
so pristine and white its one of the biggest successes in the 
candy world 
nestle also sells white chocolate chips white chocolatecoated 
ice cream bars and bulk white chocolate for individual consumers and 
candy manufacturers 
anderson attributed the popularity of white chocolate to a 
general trend among consumers for lighter food 
youre seeing a move away from harder brown liquors to rum and 
vodka youll be seeing lighter soft drinks people are eating more 
fish and chicken than beef he said we have some research 
showing that thewhite color and cleaner taste is appealing 
henderson also has a theory about why people like white chocolate 
i love the texture its exceptionally creamy and rich she 
said thats what good desserts are all about otherwise eat an 
apple

a parole board denied early release friday to 
bernhard goetz who is serving a oneyear jail sentence for 
illegally possessing the gun he used to shoot four teenagers on a 
new york city subway in 1984 
a short statement by the state board of parole said releasing 
goetz after just two months would deprecate the seriousness of the 
crime and undermine respect for the law 
edward elwin executive director of the parole board said the 
decision means goetz has to serve his full sentence minus any time 
off for good behavior unless he gets a court to overturn the 
boards ruling 
goetz could have been released monday if the board had ruled the 
other way said elwin 
goetz is angry hes frustrated said his lawyer mark baker 
he doesnt belong there 
its probably one of the most political decisions thats ever 
come down the pike baker said anybody in power is afraid to do 
something that favors bernhard goetz for fear of being labeled a 
racist by the fringe elements so he sits and rots 
baker said the decision might be appealed 
goetz 41 was convicted on the gun charge but acquitted of 
attempted murder assault and reckless endangerment charges the 
case drew international attention some people called the white 
radio technician a racist vigilante for shooting four black young 
men who were merely panhandling supporters hailed goetz as a hero 
who resisted a robbery 
in turning goetz down for parole the board noted that goetz had 
fired his gun repeatedly 
it is clear from the record that the present oneyear sentence 
for this classd felony which can have a maximum sentence of seven 
years was imposed after careful and thoughtful consideration of the 
circumstances of the case and the subjects background said the 
boards statement 
goetz began serving his sentence jan 13 after appeals in the 
state courts failed to reverse his conviction on monday the us 
supreme court also refused to reverse it 
had goetz not appealed his conviction he probably would have 
ended up serving considerably less time in jail while upholding the 
conviction state appeals courts also ruled that goetz had been 
sentenced incorrectly the trial judge had given him six months at 
his courtordered resentencing goetz was given the oneyear term 
goetz is serving his sentence in new york citys rikers island 
jail where he has been repairing radios for the police and fire 
departments 
elwin said goetz got the standard treatment the parole board 
gives city jail inmates one member whom he would not identify 
reviewed the prisoners record and letters sent in by the judge 
prosecutor and defense lawyers elwin said

labor secretary elizabeth dole told congress on 
friday that president bush will veto any attempt to raise the 
minimum wage beyond the administrations goal of 425 an hour at 
the end of three years and unless the legislation includes a 
training wage for all newly hired workers 
mrs doles blunt warning came as she formally presented the plan 
to the senate labor and human resources committee setting the 
administration strongly against a plan by sen edward m kennedy 
dmass and majority democrats that would raise the hourly minimum 
to 465 
she contended the democratic plan similar to one that died under 
opposition by thenpresident reagan last year would cost 650000 
jobs 
bushs plan would raise the 335 minimum wage unchanged since 
1981 by 30 cents an hour a year until it reaches 425 an hour in 
1991 all new workers hired at the minimum could be paid 335 an 
hour for the first six months of their employment 
any more expansive approach at this time would be unacceptable 
because it would decrease job opportunities mrs dole said 
legislation outside these parameters would call for a veto 
kennedy told mrs dole he hoped that were not getting hit with 
a take it or leave it 
mrs dole said bluntly the president has signed up for 425 
an hour and not higher 
425 is it she said waving her hand 
the labor committee will consider the bill kennedy introduced 
with senate majority leader george mitchell who has said he wants a 
floor debate and vote on the question by the end of the month 
under the training wage all workers hired at the minimum 
could be paid 335 an hour for six months before they are covered 
by the higher standard kennedy and other key democrats and 
organized labor have opposed setting a lower standard for any 
workers which organized labor fears could cause companies to layoff 
higherpaid workers in favor of those who can be paid less 
twelve states and the district of columbia have raised the 
minimum wage in laws that take precedence over the federal standard 
inside their borders according to the labor department california 
and connecticut have the highest minimum at 425 an hour although 
dc has a 485 floor for some workers 
the other states with minimums higher than the federal government 
are alaska hawaii maine massachusetts minnesota new hampshire

president bush called friday for banning the 
production and use of ozonedepleting chemicals by the end of the 
century if adequate substitutes can be found 
his move to protect the worlds ozone layer which shields the 
earth from much of the suns cancercausing ultraviolet rays came 
on the heels of a decision thursday by 12 european countries to 
pursue a ban on the chemicals instead of only cutting back on 
production as the worlds industrial nations had earlier agreed to 
do 
the united states accounts for about onethird of the production 
of ozonedamaging chemicals primarily chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
which are widely used as coolants in refrigerators and air 
conditions and as a cleaning agent for electronic and computer 
equipment 
richard k reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
had sought the stronger administration position on cfcs before he 
left friday for london where representatives from more than 100 
nations are meeting to discuss the ozonedepletion problem 
in remarks at the national academy of sciences to a group of high 
school science award winners bush said recent studies indicate 
the 50 percent reduction of cfcs under existing treaty may not be 
enough 
the president said he asked reilly to join other nations at the 
meeting in london to support the call for the elimination of cfcs 
by the year 2000 provided safe substitutes are available 
reilly according to administration sources had strongly 
recommended at a white house meeting thursday that the united states 
join its european allies and call for the complete elimination of 
cfcs as opposed to cutting production by 50 percent as required by 
current treaty 
under the 1987 treaty the industrial nations are committed to 
halving cfc production by the year 2000 but many scientists have 
said that such a cutback would not be enough to protect against 
serious ozone depletion 
on thursday the 12 nations of the european economic community 
announced in brussels belgium that they have agreed to a ban on 
the chemical in their countries by the end of the century reilly is 
known to have wanted to carry a similar commitment with him to the 
london conference which is scheduled to begin sunday 
we intend to reaffirm the strong position of the united states 
about chlorofluorocarbon manufacture and use reilly said friday 
adding that we intend to maintain our leadership in dealing with 
the ozonedepletion problem 
scientists have raised concerns about the chemical because it 
does not break down at lower altitudes and floats into the 
stratosphere where it breaks down and interacts with the gaseous 
veil of ozone that shields against the suns cancercausing 
ultraviolet rays 
after scientists detected increasing ozone depletion the 
industrial nations agreed in september 1987 to a pledge of sharp 
cut in the production of ozonedepleting chemicals primarily cfcs 
but also three halon chemicals by the end of 1999 
the treaty has been ratified by nearly 40 nations including the 
united states japan most of western europe and soviet union but 
it includes a provision that allows additional measures including a 
complete ban if further ozone damage is found 
the parties to the treaty are scheduled to consider an 
accelerated phase out schedule which is provided for in the 1987 
accord at a meeting in helsinki in early may the meeting that 
will begin sunday in london attracting representatives from more 
than 100 nations is described as a dress rehearsal for the helsinki 
session 
according to the world resources institute the united states 
produces roughly onethird of the worlds cfcs with ei dupont de 
nemours amp co the worlds largest producer there were 750 million 
pounds of cfcs produced in the united states last year and about the 
same amount in western europe according to dupont 
dupont which accounts for about half of the us production has 
announced plans to stop making the chemical perhaps as early as the 
mid1990s and will begin to offer substitutes next year 
we think in the mid90s is when well see the wide scale 
introduction of the alternatives said catherine forte a dupont 
spokeswoman said in a telephone interview the manufacturers of 
packaging for many food containers already have stopped using cfcs 
as a blowing agent in the formulation of plastics 
but industry and epa officials have acknowledged continuing 
problems in developing adequate cfc substitutes for some uses a 
substitute for cfcs used widely as a cleaning solvent for computer 
and electrical equipment has been particularly difficult suggested 
industry experts 
the epa is still conducting toxicity tests for a number of the 
cfc substitutes said agency spokesman chris rice ms forte at

produce than the existing product

novelist salman rushdie said friday he is disturbed 
by his own governments criticism of the satanic verses the 
book that brought him a death sentence in iran 
rushdie in a call to the office of opposition legislator paddy 
ashdown said he believed the british government is beginning to 
play both ends against the middle said an aide to ashdown who 
took the call 
iranian president ali khamenei predicted his nation would 
prevail today the west is not facing our nation but islam and 
the the islamic nation and this wave will grow by the day the 
iranian news agency irna quoted him as saying at friday prayers in 
tehran 
irans spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini pronounced 
rushdie a heretic and sentenced him to death on feb 14 iranian 
clergymen have offered as much as 52 million to the person who 
kills rushdie 
rushdie 41 a british citizen born in india and his wife the 
american novelist marianne wiggins have been in hiding under police 
guard since the sentence was pronounced 
from now on anyone who wants to write these things or to make 
a film out of it will wait for death threats from moslems who have 
accepted the imams fatwa death sentence and want to carry it 
out khamenei said 
irna said the crowds interrupted the sermon with chants of god 
is great and death to britain 
the satanic verses affair sundered relations that had only 
recently been restored moderates within the iranian government have 
been eager for western assistance in rebuilding their country after 
a long war against iraq while britain has sought irans help in 
gaining the release of three of its citizens held hostage in 
lebanon britain is also seeking the release of a citizen jailed in 
iran on charges of spying 
the affair has cost britain commercial opportunities ag plint 
managing director of plint and partners ltd complained in a letter 
to the times of london on friday that his company stands to lose an 
order worth 170000 
one death was reported friday in clashes between police and 
antirushdie protests in the northern indian city of srinagar 
police fired on moslem demonstrators killing at least one person 
and injuring more than 100 authorities said 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said again friday that 
rushdies right to free speech was fundamental but that the book is 
offensive and not just to moslems 
freedom of speech is important even in relation to a book 
which has plainly caused offense in the moslem community and is 
capable of causing offense to others howe said in birmingham 
in an interview thursday on bbc radio howe emphasized that we 
are not upholding the right of freedom to speak because we like the 
book and complained that the book compares britain with 
hitlers germany 
alison holmes an irish affairs researcher in ashdowns office 
who spoke to rushdie said the writer was worried that being 
antitory is now equated with being antibritish because obviously 
the government has found that there are some antigovernment 
statements in the book 
ms holmes said rushdie denied howes claim that the book drew 
comparisons between britain and nazi germany he wanted mr howe 
to show him any sentence in his book that warranted a comparison to 
nazi germany she said 
ashdown leader of the 19 social and liberal democrats in the 
650seat house of commons said he shared rushdies concern 
in my view the government is now shifting ground and it is a 
matter of i think the deepest and gravest concern that this 
government supposed to be a government in favor of the freedom of 
liberty is not prepared to stand up and defend it appears to me 
the most basic freedom of all which is the freedom of speech 
ashdown told independent television news 
prime minister margaret thatcher told bbctv she understood that 
moslems had been hurt just as christians had been deeply hurt 
by some things directed at them 
however she said i think that these great religions are 
strong enough and deep enough to withstand these kind of events 
on thursday britains foreign office said it had rejected 
iranian proposals for a meeting to discuss the crisis and that no 
meeting was possible until iran renounced violence 
in other developments friday 
in bangladesh police lobbed tear gas and charged with batons 
into demonstrators who tried to raid dhaka universitys 
britishowned library no injuries were reported 
about 6000 moslems staged a peaceful antirushdie 
demonstration outside the british embassy in the hague the 
netherlands police said 
in turkey about 400 moslem protesters burned the british flag 
and a picture of rushdie after prayers at istanbuls biggest mosque

treasury secretary nicholas brady and white 
house budget director richard darman met with congressional leaders 
friday in a renewed effort to open negotiations on president bushs 
116 trillion spending plan 
after the two hours of closeddoor talks democratic leaders 
indicated that they believed serious discussions would begin perhaps 
as soon as next week 
since bush unveiled his budget on feb 9 he has been pushing to 
start bargaining talks with congress on a 1990 spending plan in 
order to assure financial markets that progress is being made in 
reducing the budget deficit which is expected to hit 170 billion 
this year 
congressional democrats had refused to say whether they would be 
willing to bargain with the administration insisting instead that 
bush needed to spell out in greater detail the spending cuts he 
would seek in order to reduce the 1990 deficit below 100 billion 
while darman has been meeting for the past three weeks with 
members of the budget committees those sessions have been described 
as factfinding talks in which the democrats were searching for the 
fine print in the bush budget 
democrats have been insisting that the administration spell out 
some 10 billion in unspecified savings bush is seeking in scores of 
domestic programs in order to meet his deficit reduction goals 
democrats have complained that bush has wanted to take credit for 
boosting spending in such areas as education and the war on drugs 
while making the democraticcontrolled congress take the blame for 
cutting programs or boosting taxes to pay for bushs increases 
on friday house budget committee chairman leon panetta 
dcalif said he believed the factfinding phase of the discussions 
was essentially at an end and it would now be up to democratic 
leaders in congress to decide whether to authorize direct 
negotiations with the administration 
panetta characterized fridays discussions as a talk about what 
format the actual bargaining should take and who should participate 
it would be fair to say that there is some movement toward 
beginning negotiations with the administration senate budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn told reporters after the 
meeting 
we have still got some hoops to go through before we get into 
negotiations but i am hopeful sasser said 
both sasser and panetta stressed that they viewed the effort to 
draft a 1990 budget as a twotrack process involving both the normal 
congressional committee hearings and the negotiations with the 
administration 
in the event that these negotiations are unsuccessful then we 
could carry on with the budget process and hit our targets for 
completing work on a budget as required by statute sasser said 
april 15 is the deadline for congress to produce an initial 
budget resolution establishing broad spending guidelines for the 
1990 fiscal year which begins oct 1 
sen pete domenici of new mexico ranking republican on the 
senate budget committee said that time is running out so some 
decisions will have to be made he said various options had been 
explored but no final decisions were made at the friday meeting 
darman and brady walked past reporters without pausing to answer 
questions while darman has been meeting on a regular basis with 
ranking democrats and republicans on the house and senate budget 
committees it was the first time that brady had gone to the capitol 
to participate in the talks 
darman last week predicted in a meeting with reporters that 
serious talks would begin within two weeks in part because the 
democrats would realize that the sessions would prove to be to their 
benefit 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash who also 
participated in the discussions friday said we are nearing the 
end of one phase of the discussions and looking at the next step

a group opposed to the death penalty said 
friday it gave un officials petitions with more than 1 million 
signatures denouncing such punishment and asking clemency for a 
woman on death row in indiana 
the indiana supreme court is considering an appeal of the murder 
conviction of paula cooper 19 who is held at the indiana womens 
prison in indianapolis 
ms cooper was 15 in 1985 when she and three other teenagers 
from gary ind robbed and killed ruth elizabeth pelke a 
78yearold retired bible teacher ms pelke was stabbed at least 30 
times with a butcher knife 
thou shalt not kill an italian antideath penalty group 
presented petitions with more than 1 million signatures appealing 
for mercy for ms cooper to un officials 
members of the group say they have also sent more than 2 million 
signatures gathered throughout europe to indiana officials 
including an appeal pope john paul ii issued in 1987 
the united nations does not issue appeals for clemency in death 
penalty cases unless they involve political crimes or violations of 
human rights the italians conceded ms coopers case did not fit 
those categories 
roman catholics and some leftist groups in europe have adopted 
ms cooper as the figurehead of their campaign against capital 
punishment amnesty international and the american civil liberties 
union also have called for mercy 
were talking about a girl in the flower of her youth in the 
prime of life said don germano greganti the president of thou 
shalt not kill 
in a sense its the defense of the ultimate person an 
adolescent someone who needs the support of family and the 
political structure to complete her growth said greganti 
greganti also noted that ms cooper is black and black people 
have been subject to a great deal of intolerence and 
discrimination 
she has murdered someone said paolo pietrosanti another 
member of the group but we also say that the most vile homicide 
is that which is perpetrated and premeditated by the largest number 
of people 
this premeditated homicide itself is the death penalty 
pietrosanti said 
members of thou shalt not kill met with cooper for three 
hours in her indiana prison cell this week 
when ms cooper was sentenced indiana law allowed the death 
penalty for anyone over the age of 10 convicted of murder the age 
limit has since been raised to 16 but was not made retroactive 
as of feb 1 27 people awaited execution in the united states 
for crimes they committed before reaching age 18 ms cooper and 
troy dugar of louisiana are the only condemned prisoners who 
committed their crimes before age 16

mayor andrew young ruled out halting new city 
building projects friday in reaction to a georgia supreme court 
ruling that voided atlantas program to encourage minorityowned 
contractors 
we will do what we have to do on a casebycase basis without 
minority regulation young said i hope we can continue to do 
business together 
young a longtime civil rights leader cited decades of slavery 
and segregation in likening the stricken atlanta plan to the 
marshall plan that helped europe back to its feet after world war ii 
we cant help but begin to see that the reagan legacy has come 
home to roost young said 
he said the atlanta program which set a goal of 35 percent 
minority participation in city contracts had been aimed at full 
participation by all sectors of atlanta 
young said at a news conference there was no need for a 
moratorium on contracts because most of the major projects he had 
planned in his nearly eight years in office already are under way 
the georgia supreme court ruled 70 thursday that atlantas 
minorityfemale business enterprise program was unconstitutional and 
that the citys defense of the 14yearold program was woefully 
inadequate it said there was insufficient evidence of past 
discrimination 
young said friday that the guidelines were drawn and implemented 
in the implicit spirit of fairness to atlantas black majority 
young said there would be no appeal to federal courts but the 
city might seek clarifications or modifications at the state level 
thursdays ruling followed the us supreme court decision in 
january to overturn a setaside program in richmond va 
we never had quotas we never had setasides we simply had 
goals young said we had a flexible approach we felt was quite 
different from richmond 
last year atlanta awarded 294 million to minorityowned and 
operated companies 367 percent of all city contracting business 
more than 300 million in city business has gone to minority 
companies since the 35 percent minority participation goal was 
established in 1975 
the court found that the program was too broadly drawn and that 
the city failed to consider alternatives to a yearly minority 
participation goal in its contracting 
in overturning an earlier superior court ruling that upheld the 
program the supreme court indicated that atlanta could have used 
milder measures in its affirmative action efforts but did not fully 
explore them 
the high courts ruling was on behalf of the american 
subcontractors association whose attorney j ben shapiro praised 
the courts decision 
that program is illegal as of right now shapiro said 
it was not immediately clear whether the ruling effectively 
dismantles the program young said city experts needed time to study 
the ruling 
some city business leaders expressed optimism that atlantas 
biracial business climate would survive the ruling 
the program allowed us to develop certain relationships said 
tom cordy president of amc mechanical contractors one of the 
partners in the construction of the underground atlanta 
entertainment complex those relationships will go on people will 
continue to do business as we have 
fulton and dekalb counties which include parts of atlanta have 
goals of 20 percent minority participation in county contracts 
their programs were not affected by the ruling thursday but the 
fulton county program is being challenged in federal court

communist party officials removed yuri v 
andropovs name from a city north of moscow tass said friday 
making him the latest former leader whose name has been wiped off 
soviet maps 
residents of the city 150 miles north of the capital had asked 
that rybinsk assume its original name the official news agency said 
a soviet atlas published in 1986 lists the city by the name of 
rybinsk with andropov in parenthesis 
andropov headed the kgb until leonid i brezhnev died in 1982 
when he became kremlin leader he was a mentor of president mikhail 
s gorbachev until his death in 1984 when he was succeeded by 
konstantin u chernenko 
tass said the communist party central committee the supreme 
soviet presidium and the soviet government reversed their 1984 
decision naming the city after andropov 
andropov has not been widely attacked in the official media under 
gorbachev 
in january 1988 a city squares and a moscow neighborhood were 
stripped of the name brezhnev who is now blamed for stagnation and 
bloated bureaucracy 
in december kremlin officials ordered the names of brezhnev and 
chernenko wiped off their homes and any other towns schools or 
factories that still bore their name 
associates of former soviet leader josef stalin also have had 
their names removed from cities and squares 
western diplomats disagreed about whether there is any 
significance to the move in a society where place names are being 
changed because of political disgrace and also to reinstate more 
popular historic names eliminated without the approval of residents 
its a major change in the leaderships approach to andropov 
said a highranking western diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
this is the first concrete indication that gorbachev is in 
political trouble because he was andropovs protege he said 
but he also said the name change also may be part of gorbachevs 
rejection of a cult of personality for former leaders 
another moscowbased western diplomat said the change could be 
part of a general move in the soviet union to give back cities their 
traditional names im surprised if it is a criticism of andropov 
it seems rather odd he said

president bushs savings and loan bailout plan 
would cost taxpayers more than twice the 40 billion forecast by the 
administration over the next 11 years plus an additional 20 
billion if interest rates dont fall sharply the congressional 
budget office estimated friday 
including interest on money bush would borrow to pay off 
depositors in 800 sampls already insolvent or near insolvency 
taxpayers will pick up 70 percent of the estimated 360 billion tab 
over three decades acting cbo director james blum told the senate 
banking committee 
blum however said that the total bill could go much higher if 
interest rates do not fall dramatically as the administration 
predicts 
the number of insolvent institutions grows beyond the 300 dealt 
with over the last two years the 350 that are now insolvent but 
still in business and 150 more expected to become insolvent in the 
next year or so 
deposit growth in sampls doesnt return to the 7 percent annual 
rate experienced so far this decade 
sen don riegle dmich the banking committees chairman 
complained that bushs rescue package is openended with no cap on 
what taxpayers eventually might have to pay 
theres a question of honesty in dealing with the american 
people he said the mechanism being proposed says were asking 
you to sign a blank check today and well fill in the numbers later 
it could be any figure 
but blum said he saw no alternative 
these are losses that have already been incurred by the 
government he said referring to federal guarantees of up to 
100000 each for covering depositors against losses 
white house budget director richard darman had told the committee 
thursday that the cost to taxpayers of bushs proposal would be 
399 billion from 1989 through 1999 assuming that interest rates 
decline by 5 percentage points over the next five years 
darman however conceded that taxpayers could be stuck with up 
to a 506 billion share of the pre2000 costs of the package if 
interest rates are 2 to 3 percentage points higher as congressional 
budget experts predicted they would be 
using the optimistic white house expectations on interest rates 
blum estimated the taxpayer costs of the bailout over the next 11 
years at 84 billion including 16 billion in interest costs to the 
treasury not included in the administrations cost estimates 
if interest rates fall just 2 to 3 percentage points instead of 
the 5 percentage points predicted by the white house blum said 
that would add 20 billion to the estimated 84 billion in costs to 
taxpayers by 1999 
slower annual deposit growth in the range of 4 percent to 5 
percent instead of the 7 percent assumed in bushs plan would add 
5 billion to the tab he said 
altogether using white house assumptions about interest rates 
and deposit growth the congressional budget office put the total 
bailout tab at 205 billion over the next 11 years about onethird 
higher than administration figures

president augusto pinochet said the 
military committed human rights abuses after seizing power in a 1973 
coup but he blamed the abuses on leftist foes of his authoritarian 
government 
the 73yearold president and army commander made his surprising 
comment during a speech thursday night in puerto varas 620 miles 
south of santiago 
the pinochet government has been accused of widespread human 
rights abuses including torture and killing of hundreds of 
dissidents 
the roman catholic church and local and foreign human rights 
organizations have documented the cases of at least 700 dissidents 
who disappeared after being arrested by security agents 
pinochet and other government officials repeatedly denied the 
accusations calling them part of a communistinspired propaganda 
campaign 
pinochets speech was carried friday by santiago radio stations 
but progovernment newspapers did not carry the quotes related to 
the human rights issue in full 
they accuse us of human rights abuses they talk about 
killings pinochet said i do not say the contrary there were 
excesses from both sides 
he added but who encouraged them we didnt they did it was 
their fault 
jaime castillo president of chiles independent human rights 
commission called pinochets speech positive 
but he added there is a contradiction when he now admits the 
abuses he used to deny but at the same time blames them on those 
who were the victims of such abuses 
pinochet said the armed forces had to act against more than 
15000 guerrillas when he led the bloody 1973 coup that toppled 
the elected government of president salvador allende an avowed 
marxist allende died in the takeover 
pinochet said that after the coup the military found illegal arms 
caches big enough to arm 35000 men he said the country had 
been driven to the brink of civilian war 
after the coup thousands of leftists were rounded up human 
rights groups including the un human rights commission say many 
were tortured jailed or sent into exile an unspecified number were 
killed others were officially reported killed in clashes with 
security forces 
in 1978 the pinochet government issued an amnesty favoring those 
responsible for abuses after the coup opposition leaders say they 
plan to investigate the abuses after pinochet steps down next year 
and punish those found guilty of having committed crimes 
pinochet is due to hand over power march 11 1990 to the winner 
in a presidential election scheduled dec 14

the commander of lebanons moslem army 
units sent about 500 soldiers and 10 aging sovietdesigned tanks 
friday to south lebanon where he has said he expects an israeli 
operation at any time 
the 3000 lebanese soldiers already in the south are not equipped 
with tanks they have stayed out of israels fight with palestinian 
and shiite moslem guerrillas in the area 
israel maintains a security zone just inside lebanon with the 
aid of a predominantly christian surrogate militia its military 
command refused comment friday on the lebanese troop movements but 
a spokesman said the army is doing everything to secure its 
northern border 
two israeli jet fighters flew reconnaissance as the mechanized 
battalion moved to zahrani 35 miles south of beirut palestinian 
and lebanese militia gunners fired at them but no hits were reported 
maj gen sami khatib who commands the moslem units of the 
divided lebanese army said in an interview this week he would send 
reinforcements south to fight israel and cooperate with un 
peacekeeping troops in the area 
he said he expected an israeli operation soon and well fight 
and try to hamper the enemys advance as much as we can 
the soldiers who arrived friday deployed around the zahrani oil 
refinery but a lebanese military spokesman said they and their t54 
tanks would move to zaghdraya the inland town 12 miles from the 
israeli zone is the armys most forward position in south lebanon 
khatib said lebanese soldiers would help the un interim force 
in lebanon enforce security council resolution 425 the resolution 
passed after an israeli invasion in 1978 calls for the 
unconditional withdrawal of israeli forces and deployment of the 
5800member force along the border 
unifil whose area of operations overlaps the buffer zone has 
not been able to move to the border because the israelis will not 
pull back 
israel invaded lebanon again in june 1982 and established the 
security zone after withdrawing most of its troops three years later 
lebanese soldiers have been caught in crossfire several times but 
have not fought a major engagement with israeli for more than 16 
years the army did not confront the israelis in either invasion 
khatib commands 22000 soldiers based in moslem territory south 
of beirut and along the coast and gen michel aoun has 20000 
christian troopers in the christian area north and east of the 
capital 
the army divided when moslem militias drove christian units from 
moslem west beirut in february 1984 nine years after lebanons 
sectarian civil war began aoun technically commanded the entire 
army however until a deadlock on the presidential succession 
created two governments last fall 
president amin gemayels sixyear term ended with no successor 
elected because rightwing christians opposed candidates chosen by 
neighboring syria the main power broker in lebanon 
christian and moslem governments emerged from the crisis with 
the christian cabinet led by aoun a fellow maronite catholic chosen 
by gemayel as caretaker prime minister 
moslems would not accept aouns authority and acting premier 
salim hoss a sunni moslem who heads the moslem cabinet named 
khatib commander of moslem army units 
by longstanding agreement lebanons president is christian the 
premier sunni and the parliament speaker shiite moslem 
syria which has 40000 soldiers in lebanon supports khatibs 
command

political handicappers tried friday to come up 
with an early line after an election canvass sent veteran campaigner 
edward vrdolyak to the post as the final entry in this citys 
threeway mayoral race 
vrdolyak a former alderman who announced himself as a writein 
candidate just six days before tuesdays mayoral primary became the 
apparent republican winner after a canvass thursday by the chicago 
board of election commissioners 
the canvass showed him with 11621 votes to 10478 for herbert 
sohn the endorsed gop candidate who conceded friday the board is 
expected to make it official next week 
the results set up a threeway battle in the april 4 mayoral 
election pitting vrdolyak against democratic nominee richard m 
daley and independent candidate timothy evans vrdolyak and daley 
are white and evans is black 
political observers saw daley as the early favorite with evans 
second and vrdolyak third 
daley will win but it might be closer than most people 
think said mike royko the pulitzer prizewinning columnist and 
veteran political observer of the chicago tribune 
the thing thats hard to gauge right now is what eventual 
impact of vrdolyak will be on daley both men are white and 
whatever votes he skims off will come from daley he said friday 
but it wont be enough for evans 
asked to predict the outcome royko said daley would collect 46 
percent of the vote followed by evans with 44 percent and vrdolyak 
with 10 percent 
four other wellknown chicago political analysts agreed with that 
order of finish professors eugene kennedy of loyola university and 
paul kleppner of northern illinois university popular black radio 
personality lu palmer and republican official tom roesser 
with daley having won the primary tim evans wont have much 
of a chance said palmer the primary winner already has all the 
money and more is going to flock to him 
vrdolyaks not going to have much of an impact why should 
white voters cross over and vote for vrdolyak theyve already got 
their candidate 
formal polls assessing the candidates chances have not yet been 
released since the three entries in the race were certain 
daley who beat mayor eugene sawyer in the democratic primary and 
moved one step closer to attaining the office held 21 years by his 
legendary father extended his florida vacation to a third day 
friday 
his campaign manager david axelrod dismissed vrdolyak as a 
threat saying he does not strike fear in anyones heart 
evans trying to stretch his existing campaign funds and raise 
more scrambled to tape three television shows for weekend broadcast 
and scheduled seven appearances around the city he picked up the 
endorsement of the 28000member chicago teachers union 
vrdolyak an alderman and democratic county chairman before 
converting to the republican party some 18 months ago appeared on 
two talk shows on predominantly black radio stations 
some callers criticized vrdolyak for his staunch city council 
opposition during the tenure of the late harold washington the 
citys first black mayor one suggested vrdolyak entered the race to 
extract a reward from daley in exchange for dropping out 
vrdolyak denied the charge then added you have the typical 
democratic viewpoint that you can negotiate anything

the army is training special units to deal 
exclusively with the palestinian uprising so that other soldiers can 
perform duties elsewhere the army weekly bamahane reported in its 
latest issue 
the troops will undergo basic infantry training followed by 
training on armored personnel carriers they will then take a new 
antiuprising course the newspaper said 
if a war broke out the units would serve as mechanized infantry 
bamahane said 
their year will consist of nine months of security duty in the 
territories and three months of mechanized infantry training col 
m personnel chief of the armys ground forces was quoted as saying 
his full name was not released in keeping with military 
regulations 
senior army officials have complained that dealing with the 
15month uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip has 
severely affected the armys training program 
many reserve and regular units instead of training have been 
sent to patrol the occupied territories 
in addition the united states alleged last month that israels 
failure to train professional riot control forces led to an increase 
in casualties 
when the revolt broke out dec 8 1987 soldiers were sent to 
deal with stonethrowing demonstrators without helmets clubs or 
sufficient amounts of tear gas 
many of the arab deaths have since been blamed on army reservists 
or teenage recruits inexperienced in civilian riot control in the 
last 15 months at least 388 palestinians have been killed 
during the same time frame israeli media say professional police 
forces such as the border police have not killed a single 
palestinian 
the new allon units apparently named ofter yigal allon a 
founder of prestate elite commando units came under attack from 
both ends of the political spectrum 
maybe it will bring the casualties down but the uprising will 
not stop said ran cohen a reserve colonel and a legislator of 
the leftist citizens rights movement this is part of a very 
dangerous process of turning the army and its troops into a colonial 
police force 
rafael eitan a rightwing parliament member and former army 
chief of staff called the idea of special units rubbish 
you dont need special units you have to know how to punish 
he said 
they think that by changing organization theyll solve the 
problem eitan continued instead of shooting children we 
should expel their leaders and give missions to the jewish 
settlers

half the countrys 262 towns and 
cities were without mayors friday the result of a terror campaign 
by revolutionaries who say municipal chiefs administer us designs 
fear is human said armando calderon sol mayor of san 
salvador in a recent interview with the associated press 
they other mayors come to me for advice but i cant ask them 
to be cannon fodder they have their families to think about i tell 
them its a personal choice 
the interior ministry says 131 mayors have chosen to resign 
some have been replaced by lowprofile substitutes usually 
a member of the municipal council 
most have simply locked their doors leaving residents no means 
of locally registering births and deaths getting married or 
complaining about potholes 
marxistled revolutionaries say mayors are a principal component 
of the usimposed counterinsurgency campaign a 9yearold 
civil war has killed an estimated 70000 people 
el salvador a nation of 5 million is the western hemispheres 
biggest recipient of us economic and military aid about 15 
million per day the rebels say washington and el salvadors ruling 
class have sought through elections to put a democratic veneer on 
a state that remains dominated by the military 
a big chunk of us aid goes to development projects administered 
by the salvadoran government through local authorities 
following municipal elections a year ago the farabundo marti 
national liberation front or fmln began threatening mayors and 
insisting they announce their resignations 
the guerrillas have assassinated nine mayors the most recent 
slaying was in the eastern town of sesori on nov 24 during the 
last two months of 1988 several municipal chiefs a week were taking 
to the air waves and buying newspaper ads to announce their 
resignations 
at first the guerrillas concentrated on their zones of 
control the northern sectors of chalatenango morazan san 
miguel and cabanab provinces where they move freely and enjoy 
considerable support but by late last year they were threatening 
mayors nationwide 
mayor ricardo de leon of san miguel the nations thirdlargest 
city remains in his post despite two threats last month 
im not challenging the insurgents to kill me de leon of 
the rightist republican national alliance said in an interview 
i dont have enemies i dont even consider the left my enemy 
because serving the people includes serving the left but the people 
gave me this post and only the people can tell me to leave it he 
said 
de leon asked the roman catholic church to arrange a meeting with 
local guerrilla leaders so he could ask them why i am considered a 
military target 
hes still waiting to be contacted 
of course im afraid but the support of the people gives me 
valor he said 
the campaign has been condemned by the christian democratic 
government the armed forces and even the democratic convergence a 
guerrillaallied leftist electoral front 
the rebels as part of a peace proposal offered to stop the 
campaign if the government postponed presidential elections 
scheduled march 19 and met their demands for security and antifraud 
measures during the vote 
the government and rebels have not been able to agree on when 
where or how to negotiate on the proposal which also ecompasses 
many other issues

the marines have told 135 young people who 
signed up for the corps but were not slated to report until later 
not to bother showing up because their recruitments were fraudulent 
and they really werent qualified a spokesman said 
word of their release from the corps delayedentry program 
follows the dismissal of 30 recruits last month from boot camp at 
parris island sc 
all the dismissals stem from the discovery that high school 
diplomas were fabricated and criminal and medical records were 
disregarded by the pittsburgh recruiting station said corps 
spokesman maj robert w mclean at parris island investigators 
concluded that recruiters signed up young men who werent qualified 
in order to meet their recruitment quotas 
records of an additional 20 recruits in the delayedentry program 
are being reviewed he said friday 
mclean said earlier this week that maj george a eberhart jr 
head of the pittsburgh recruiting station and 15 of his recruiters 
were relieved of duty and that two additional recruiters received 
administrative warnings because of the improper recruiting in all 
there are 47 recruiters assigned to pittsburgh 
none of the young men sent home from boot camp or released from 
the delayedentry program faces any disciplinary charges officials 
said 
the actions follow an investigation triggered by a suburban 
pittsburgh recruits claim that his recruiter enlisted him even 
though he knew the young man had a severe stomach ulcer that should 
have disqualified him the recruit had to be hospitalized while at 
boot camp 
mclean said 30 recruits were sent home from boot camp after a 
review of 83 questionable cases he told the press on thursday that 
in addition 135 of nearly 700 recruits in the corps 
delayedenlistment program were also released over the same 
reasons that the others were disqualified for 
the delayedenlistment program allows recruits to commit 
themselves to the corps without reporting to boot camp until up to 
six months later 
rep doug walgren dpa said he met with the marine corps 
congressional liaison and was told the marines have never 
experienced this widespread a problem in their memory with 
fabricated recruitments 
this is a very high number of recruiters in a relatively small 
pool for them all to be involved in what is clearly a serious 
violation of rules walgren said that number suggests they are 
under extraordinary pressure to produce or its something far 
widespread beyond this recruiting station 
the head of the army recruiting battalion in pittsburgh said 
thursday that a surprise inspection in november found six instances 
of possible improper recruiting four recruits were recommended for 
dismissal and two cases have not been resolved said col randell 
wilkes

president carlos andres perez today 
said whether venezuela can continue to make payments on its foreign 
debt depends on the success of its austerity program 
the crisis latin american nations are undergoing has a name 
written with capital letters foreign debt perez told foreign 
correspondents at miraflores palace the government headquarters 
a newspaper today reported more than 300 people died and and 
1500 were injured since monday in riots in caracas and 11 other 
cities the unrest was caused by governmentimposed bus fare 
increases which appeared to release pent up frustration over the 
nations austerity program 
buses and cars circulated in caracas today as the capital 
returned to normal with early morning traffic jams and honking 
horns replacing some of the tensions of this weeks unrest 
looters emptied the shelves of supermarkets and neighborhood 
grocery stores in the first days of rioting since then part of the 
22000 police and soldiers ordered on alert in caracas have guarded 
stores where people have been waiting hours in line to buy such 
staples as eggs bread and cheese 
perez in a morning news conference said payments on the 
countrys 33 million foreign debt depends on how our economic 
program develops 
venezuela affluent during the 1970s thanks to its rich oil 
reserves saw its fortunes slide along with petroleum prices in 1981 
real wages have since then fallen by a third inflation is 
expected to double this year to 70 percent and the 33 billion 
foreign debt is the fourth largest in latin america after brazil 
mexico and argentina 
venezuela suspended payments on 204 billion of the debt in 
january and the newspaper el nacional reported last week that 
payments on another 5 billion of the debt was suspended 
earlier this week the government asked the international 
monetary fund to include provisions allowing venezuela to suspend 
all payments on its debt until september venezuela also asked for 
an additional 43 billion in loans from the institution over the 
next three years 
asked if he intended to delay repayment beyond september perez 
said it would depend on the success of his economic adjustment 
program 
perez who has been in office for only one month has blamed 
leftists for prolonging venezuelas worst unrest in 31 years of 
democratic rule 
on wednesday gabriel puerta a former guerrilla leader accused 
the government of inventing political motives for the disturbances 
which he blamed on the failure of the governments economic policies 
on thursday evening soldiers hunting snipers and seeking looters 
conducted housetohouse searches in downtown caracas and the 
western slums shooting was heard early today as soldiers fired into 
the air and at buildings to flush out snipers it appeared the 
gunfire also was meant to enforce the governments dusktodawn 
curfew by keeping people off the streets

been killed and 1500 injured in four days of violence the 
bloodiest in venezuelas history other reports said the death toll 
ranged from 250 to 350

caracas central morgue and said there were other bodies in hospitals 
across the city the dead included at least four children aged 3 to

the coast guard spotted an oil slick off 
the northern florida keys on friday but marine reserve officials 
said the twomile spill apparently was no immediate threat to the 
areas popular reefs 
the slick of unknown origin was 10 to 12 miles off the north 
key largo coast friday afternoon said coast guard spokesman joe dye 
where it is it would not be a threat he said two or three 
dead birds were spotted but it was not clear if they were killed by 
the oil dye said 
officials of two parks off key largo the key largo national 
marine reserve and john pennekamp coral reef state park sent boats 
out to survey the area after spotting some tar balls in the waters 
we have tar balls measuring onequarter to 4 inches in diameter 
that are washing near the southern boundary on the park said 
pennekamp director carl nielsen but it is not a big spill this

the pilot who landed a jetliner after its 
side ripped open ejecting nine passengers said friday that after 
the shock he said a quick prayer for his passengers and went back to 
work 
capt david cronin was in charge of united airlines flight 811 on 
its feb 24 nonstop flight from honolulu to auckland new zealand 
when shortly after takeoff the boeing 747s right forward cargo door 
and an adjoining 10by10 foot section of fuselage tore away 
in addition to the nine people missing 27 were injured in the 
turbulence of the sudden decompression and the flight back to 
honolulu 
cronin said the accident outweighed anything he experienced in 
the military as a fighter pilot 
after realizing the extent of damage to the plane i said a 
prayer for them passengers momentarily and got back to business 
cronin said at a news conference held within earshot of jets taking 
off and landing at san francisco international airport 
first officer al slader said simulated disaster exercises 
undertaken annually by united personnel were important but 
insufficient for the many problems that faced them 
the crew reverted almost to survival instincts slader said 
the crewmembers answers were carefully controlled by airline 
officials who prohibited them from answering questions pertaining 
to concerns about aging aircraft or the investigation of the 
disaster 
cronin was on his nexttolast flight after 38 years of military 
and commercial flying and he said hes looking forward to his next 
and final flight 
because the flight took off through a fierce thunderstorm he 
said he had ordered passengers to keep their seatbelts fastened 
without that precaution many more lives would definitely have been 
lost cronin said 
after the accident the crew members said they reached for 
oxygen masks but found the oxygen lines had been severed 
cronin said the plane was quivering and shuddering and he 
could see flames from one wing 
during the 25minute flight back to honolulu the crew had to 
dump 90000 pounds of fuel partly because with only two engines the 
plane was in effect overloaded 
in addition the gaping hole in the side created drag which 
affected speed and control 
part of the emergency descent procedure for getting the plane 
back down to breathable air is to lower the landing gear to create 
drag 
but cronin said their decision not to lower the landing gear 
probably was critical to keeping the big jet from losing altitude 
too quickly before its remaining engines got it back to the honolulu 
runway 
if they had lowered the wheels immediately there would have 
been a good chance we would have gone in the water he said 
the crew also agreed to gradually move landing flaps to angles 
not normally prescribed to keep the plane in the air 
i dont think a 747 has ever flown on two engines at that 
weight my concern for being overweight was staying airborne the 
pilot told the washington post on wednesday 
meanwhile second officer mark thomas said he checked out the 
passenger area and saw no panic at all and that none of the 
passengers were moving 
normal landing speed with all four engines would have been 132 
knots the crew estimated that 170 knots would be safe cronin said 
he chose to touch down at 200 knots because he was afraid of losing 
control of the jet if he slowed it further 
once the plane reached view of honolulu international he said he 
was confident of the planes safe landing which took up twothirds 
of the runway because of their speed and not having reverse thrust 
from all four engines 
there was a sigh of relief and we started looking after the 
passengers thomas said 
after all remaining passengers had unloaded cronin said he and 
the other two crew members left by way of an emergency chute they 
inspected the damage which he described as a hole you could drive 
a semitruck through 
my reaction was i cant tell you what my reaction was like 
oh pause you know what oh dear

leftist rebels on friday called 
for a boycott of the presidential election scheduled for march 19 
saying the vote would aggravate war and poverty 
the insurgents have proposed postponement of the election until 
september they said if the vote were put off they would 
participate and respect its outcome 
we call on the our people not to vote march 19 said the 
farabundo marti national liberation front on its clandestine radio 
station 
despite more than five weeks of debate on the guerrilla proposal 
the christian democratic government and the insurgents have not been 
able to agree on when where or how to negotiate its possible 
implementation 
a leftist electoral front on friday accused the government and 
the rightist republican nationalist alliance or arena of 
procrastinating in response to the plan 
arena controls the legislature and is favored to win the 
presidential election it is adamantly opposed to postponement of 
the vote 
the christian democratic party and arena are trying to take 
advantage of the situation for propagandistic electoral ends thus 
manipulating the peoples desire for peace said the leftist 
democratic convergence 
it alleged in a communique that the two parties intend to prevent 
postponement by stalling until march 19 
the leftist alliance proposed rescheduling the election july 9 
it also said the government the fmln and representatives of the 
political parties should meet in mexico next week to negotiate an 
end to the 9yearold civil war 
the election of march 19 is designed to sustain the war after 
the previous five flawed elections have aggravated the original 
causes of the conflict said the rebels on radio venceremos 
we have proposed to compete in the political sphere in which 
clear and clean results would conciliate the parties in conflict in 
light of the inviability of continuing the war they said but 
those who have made a living from the war have sought to close the 
doors to peace 
the elections of march 19 will only aggravate hunger and 
misery as they hold out no hope of real solution for the countrys 
crisis the rebels said

guatemalan president vinicio cerezo said friday 
political realities are pushing nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
to abandon a totalitarian blueprint and pursue a democratic 
outcome for his country 
cerezo who is here for talks with bush administration and 
congressional leaders said ortega doesnt like democracy hes 
trying to make a revolution through a totalitarian formula 
at the same time he said ortega has had to pay attention to the 
demands of other central american presidents that he embrace 
democracy mindful that they would otherwise repudiate him 
cerezo spoke at a luncheon sponsored by the carnegie endowment 
for international peace 
based on his discussions here cerezo said there are considerable 
doubts among bush administration officials about ortegas 
willingness to comply with the democratic promises he made at the 
recent meeting of central american presidents in el salvador 
cerezo added that he believes these doubts are justified the 
administration he said wants more assurances that democracy will 
be established in nicaragua in a time period comparable to that of 
the demobilization of the contras 
still he said he believes the administration is convinced that 
it should emphasize a diplomatic solution in nicaragua rather than 
continuing to attempt to solve problems through military force 
ortega spoke after administration and congressional officials 
disclosed details of the carrot and stick approach to nicaragua 
advocated by secretary of state james a baker iii 
the policy includes unspecified rewards for nicaragua if it 
passes certain checkpoints on the road to democracy 
baker made clear to lawmakers that he does not intend to abandon 
the contra rebels who now are subsisting on us supplies in 
honduran jungle camps along the nicaraguan border 
he told congressional officials he would seek to renew the us 
aid which runs out at the end of this month for a year according 
to some present at the thursday meetings 
aid would continue to flow at current rates about 4 million a 
month and would keep the rebels available as a standby fighting 
force until after nicaraguas national elections which are being 
moved up to early 1990 
at the central american summit meeting the five presidents 
agreed to try to draft a plan that would lead to the demobilization 
of the contras in return for open elections in nicaragua and the 
release of most of the 3300 jailed contras and former members of 
the armed forces who served under the somoza family dynasty

president bush called friday for banning the 
production and use of ozonedepleting chemicals by the end of the 
century if adequate substitutes can be found 
his move to protect the worlds ozone layer which shields the 
earth from much of the suns cancercausing ultraviolet rays came 
on the heels of a decision thursday by 12 european countries to 
pursue a ban on the chemicals instead of only cutting back on 
production as the worlds industrial nations had earlier agreed to 
do 
the united states accounts for about onethird of the production 
of ozonedamaging chemicals primarily chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
which are widely used as coolants in refrigerators and air 
conditioners and as a cleaning agent for electronic and computer 
equipment 
richard k reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
had sought the stronger administration position on cfcs before he 
left friday for london where representatives from more than 100 
nations are meeting to discuss the ozonedepletion problem 
in remarks at the national academy of sciences to a group of high 
school science award winners bush said recent studies indicate 
the 50 percent reduction of cfcs under existing treaty may not be 
enough 
the president said he asked reilly to join other nations at the 
meeting in london to support the call for the elimination of cfcs 
by the year 2000 provided safe substitutes are available 
reilly according to administration sources had strongly 
recommended at a white house meeting thursday that the united states 
join its european allies and call for the complete elimination of 
cfcs as opposed to cutting production by 50 percent as required by 
current treaty 
under the 1987 treaty the industrial nations are committed to 
halving cfc production by the year 2000 but many scientists have 
said that such a cutback would not be enough to protect against 
serious ozone depletion 
on thursday the 12 nations of the european economic community 
announced in brussels belgium that they have agreed to a ban on 
the chemical in their countries by the end of the century reilly is 
known to have wanted to carry a similar commitment with him to the 
london conference which is scheduled to begin sunday 
we intend to reaffirm the strong position of the united states 
about chlorofluorocarbon manufacture and use reilly said friday 
adding that we intend to maintain our leadership in dealing with 
the ozonedepletion problem 
scientists have raised concerns about the chemical because it 
does not break down at lower altitudes and floats into the 
stratosphere where it breaks down and interacts with the gaseous 
veil of ozone that shields against the suns cancercausing 
ultraviolet rays 
after scientists detected increasing ozone depletion the 
industrial nations agreed in september 1987 to a pledge of sharp cut 
in the production of ozonedepleting chemicals primarily cfcs but 
also three halon chemicals by the end of 1999 
the treaty has been ratified by nearly 40 nations including the 
united states japan most of western europe and soviet union but 
it includes a provision that allows additional measures including a 
complete ban if further ozone damage is found 
the parties to the treaty are scheduled to consider an 
accelerated phaseout schedule which is provided for in the 1987 
accord at a meeting in helsinki finland in early may the 
meeting that will begin sunday in london attracting representatives 
from more than 100 nations is described as a dress rehearsal for 
the helsinki session 
according to the world resources institute the united states 
produces roughly onethird of the worlds cfcs with ei dupont de 
nemours amp co the worlds largest producer there were 750 million 
pounds of cfcs produced in the united states last year and about the 
same amount in western europe according to dupont 
dupont which accounts for about half of the us production has 
announced plans to stop making the chemical perhaps as early as the 
mid1990s and will begin to offer substitutes next year 
we think in the mid90s is when well see the wide scale 
introduction of the alternatives said catherine forte a dupont 
spokeswoman said in a telephone interview the manufacturers of 
packaging for many food containers already have stopped using cfcs 
as a blowing agent in the formulation of plastics 
but industry and epa officials have acknowledged continuing 
problems in developing adequate cfc substitutes for some uses a 
substitute for cfcs used widely as a cleaning solvent for computer 
and electrical equipment has been particularly difficult suggested 
industry experts 
the epa is still conducting toxicity tests for a number of the 
cfc substitutes said agency spokesman chris rice ms forte at 
dupont also said the substitutes are going to be more difficult to 
produce than the existing product

nato will offer next week to trim key 
conventional weapons systems by 5 percent to 10 percent while asking 
the warsaw pact to make even larger cuts an alliance source said 
friday 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
proposal for cuts in natos main battle tanks artillery and armored 
troop carriers would bring those weapons substantially beneath 
current levels 
since we are convinced that we are pretty much at the 
minimum of our defense this means for our military people a 
significant sacrifice said the source who outlined the plan to 
reporters at nato headquarters 
the plan also calls for warsaw pact nations to slash by more than 
half their main battle tanks and artillery 
the western alliance contends the soviets and their allies have 
built up a huge superiority in conventional or nonnuclear weapons 
in europe the alliance wants the east bloc nations to make much 
greater reductions in their forces to bring the two sides to rough 
equality 
the proposal will be made thursday when negotiators for the 16 
alliance nations and the seven warsaw pact nations begin talks in 
vienna on reducing conventional forces in europe the discussions 
will cover weapons in the vast region extending from the atlantic 
ocean to the ural mountains in the soviet union 
the source said main battle tanks armored troop carriers and 
artillery were singled out for initial discussion because they can 
be used in a surprise attack 
he would only say nato was prepared to reduce its holdings in 
tanks artillery and armored troop carriers to 90 percent to 95 
percent of current levels the reduction he said ranges roughly 
between 5 percent to 10 percent 
under the nato formula an overall ceiling will be set of 40000 
main battle tanks 20000 for each side nato said in a report last 
year that it has 16424 such tanks in active units and an additional 
5800 in storage it estimated the warsaw pact total at 51500 with 
more than natos in storage 
the warsaw pact in a recent count put its tank total at 59470 
and natos at 30690 
for artillery pieces nato will propose an overall cap of 33000 
or 16500 for each side according to the source 
nato estimated its artillery which includes mortars and multiple 
rocket launchers at 14458 pieces plus an additional 2870 held in 
storage it estimated the east blocs at 43400 with more pieces in 
storage than that held by the west 
the warsaw pact count put its artillery at 71560 pieces compared 
to 57060 for the west 
on armored troop carriers the source said the alliance will 
suggest an overall limit of 55000 or 27500 for each side 
it was unclear though how that would affect the actual count 
because neither nato nor the warsaw pact has provided breakdowns for 
those forces 
the nato report said it has 4153 armored infantry fighting 
vehicles plus 575 in storage and that the warsaw pact has 22400 
with additional ones in storage it also said the alliance has 
35351 other armored vehicles including armored personnel carriers 
and the warsaw pact has 71000 
the warsaw pact counts 70330 infantry vehicles and armored 
personnel carriers for the east and 46900 for the west

officials on friday said a west german 
computer spy ring that sold stolen data to the soviets represents a 
new and dangerous dimension in international espionage 
the illegal entry into hundreds of data systems is an extremely 
dangerous new threat federal interior minister friedrich 
zimmermann said 
governments and businesses must now become extremely 
vigilant zimmermann said a day after officials said they had 
penetrated a ring of hackers who sold thousands of passwords and 
codes from military and research computers in the united states 
western europe and japan to soviet intelligence agents 
zimmermann whose ministry is responsible for counterespionage 
and domestic intelligencegathering called the hackers operations 
a new dimension of soviet bloc spy agencies 
although he said it was too soon to assess the full extent of the 
damage he added the investigation had succeeded in dealing a 
major blow against the kgb soviet secret service 
juergen schmid a spokesman for the federal justice ministry 
called the incident extremely serious but not drastic 
the hackers were able to gain entry but failed to penetrate 
deep into the secret areas of the databanks he said 
security officials friday said three men were in custody and 
another five were under investigation 
alexander prechtel a spokesman for the federal prosecutors 
office said the suspects range in age from 25 to 35 
he said several were involved with illegal drugs but did not 
elaborate 
prechtel said police in hanover arrested two hackers on 
suspicion of espionage activities for an eastern european 
intelligence agency another suspect was arrested in west berlin 
he said 
officials of the federal criminal investigation office in 
wiesbaden said more than 100 state officers and federal agents were 
involved in making the arrests and in subsequent searches of 
apartments in west berlin hanover and hamburg 
a west german broadcast network norddeutsche rundfunk said 
thursday the computer networks infiltrated by the hackers included 
the us defense departments general databank known as optimus a 
nasa and a strategic defense initiative or star wars research 
computer and computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy research 
at the los alamos national laboratory in new mexico and the fermi 
national accelerator laboratory in illinois 
the network said attempts were made to gain access to the 
lawrence berkeley laboratory at the university of california which 
it called a key link in efforts to break into other us computers 
clifford stoll an astrophysicist who did research at the 
laboratory said up to 50 military computers were broken into 
through an astronomy computer but that the hacker did not have 
passwords for classified information 
we were amazed heres some guy breaking into an astronomy 
computer in berkeley reaching out into military computers trying to 
search for information about sdi about nuclear warheads stoll 
said in an interview thursday from his home in cambridge mass 
stoll who works at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory at 
harvard university said he and other researchers helped break the 
spy ring he said someone linked to east bloc groups wrote the lab 
asking for related information leading authorities to the hackers 
william bardeen head of the theory group at fermilab in batavia 
ill said soviets participate in research there 
so there are soviet scientists living at fermilab and using the 
computers there isnt anything confidential or strategic in the 
computers bardeen said 
jeff schwartz spokesman for los alamos national laboratory said 
he knew of no evidence a foreign intelligence agency had gained 
access to its classified computer system he said none of the labs 
findings were secret 
norddeutsche rundfunk said the three suspects were detained 
following searches of at least six apartments in west berlin and 
hanover 
according to norddeutsche rundfunk authorities believe the three 
hackers were recruited by the kgb in 1985 and were paid with cash 
and drugs and were later forced to provide the codes and 
passwords to the soviets 
the network said the three handed over information from the 
united states japan britain france italy switzerland and west 
germany at a 1985 meeting with two kgb agents in east berlin 
the hackers obtained information that would allow the soviets 
themselves to gain access to the computers and develop technology 
based on the information the network said 
the information would also give the kremlin access to us 
military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging to 
several european institutes that deal with atomic and aerospace 
research the network said 
officials at the european laboratory of particle physics in 
geneva said attempts were made in 1986 and 1987 to gain access to 
the labs computers a laboratory offical who asked not to be 
identified said soviet and other specialists have been visiting 
researchers at the facility for years 
in brussels european economic community officials said the west 
german hackers had penetrated a european space agency computer in 
paris 
willy helin a spokesman for the eecs research and 
telecommunications commission said specialists are trying to 
determine whether suspected soviet agents had also gained access to 
other eec computer networks 
in tokyo a lab official said unknown west german hackers broke 
into a computer system in a japanese government research lab in 1985 
the national laboratory for high energy physics discovered that a 
research project was penetrated in mid1985 said lab spokesman 
shinichi watanabe he said no sensitive information was stolen and 
the lab has since heightened security by changing passwords and 
other measures 
he said it was not known if the intruders were part of the 
alleged west german ring

czechoslovakias charter 77 human rights 
movement has nominated jailed czech playwright vaclav havel for the 
1989 nobel peace prize an emigre source said friday 
the announcement came one day after 2000 hungarians said they 
would nominate havel for the prize during a demonstration in 
budapest seeking his freedom last month two us congressmen had 
nominated the playwright whose works are banned in his own country 
for the prize 
the londonbased publisher palach press which monitors events in 
czechoslovakia said a charter 77 committee would submit the 
organizations nomination to the norwegian nobel committee in oslo 
the committee is made up of czechoslovak activists mainly 
intellectuals in a bid to publicize the imprisoned dramatists case 
and gain support for his nomination for the prestigious prize 
palach press said 
sen dennis deconcini dariz and us rep steny h hoyer 
dmd also nominated havel on feb 1 on behalf of the helsinki 
commission a human rights monitoring group 
havel 52 was convicted last month on charges of incitement and 
obstructing police for his role in a january rally in prague and he 
was sentenced to nine months in jail the january rally honored jan 
palach a student who set himself afire to protest the sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 
havel who has appealed his sentence had previously spent 
slightly more than four years in jail for his rights campaign 
a translation of the feb 26 letter made available to the 
associated press in vienna by palach press reads 
we therefore believe that the nobel peace prize should be 
awarded primarily to those who working outside their own profession 
and often with great personal sacrifice contribute toward making 
life on this planet more just and respectable 
sources linked to the oslo committee told the associated press 
that several proposals exist for havels nomination he is one of 
nearly 100 candidates including several organizations 
the announcement of the prize usually comes in september or 
october

john tower could be the first cabinet nominee 
ever to stand on the senate floor to answer questions from senators 
facetoface an ordeal that reporters were known to undergo during 
the 19th century 
senate republican leader bob dole suggested the extraordinary 
appearance friday to give the embattled nominee for defense 
secretary a chance to answer charges and questions about his 
personal life democratic leaders said they would consider any 
request 
associate senate historian don ritchie said no one has been 
called to the senate floor for questioning in more than 50 years 
and only five times that are listed in senate records 
leaks of secret material to reporters were the target of early 
grillings on the senate floor and would be again if dole gets his 
way dole suggested friday that tower needed a chance to rebut the 
allegations about his personal life that the republican leader said 
were based on biased leaks from the fbi report on tower 
the first recorded target of senate questioning was william 
duane editor of the philadelphia aurora newspaper ritchie said 
that duane had written stories about secret senate deliberations on 
changing the way electoral ballots were counted stories based on 
leaks from senators 
but ritchie said duane left the chamber to talk to his lawyer 
fled the capitol and never returned 
then in 1848 john nugent of the new york herald was questioned 
about stories on secret senate deliberations over a treaty thirteen 
years later zebulon white and hiram ramsdale of the new york 
tribune were hauled before the senators again to be asked about 
leaks of secret treaty deliberations 
no one revealed their sources said ritchie adding that each 
of the three reporters was held hostage in senate committee rooms to 
encourage them to cooperate 
a more recent example cited by dole came in 1933 when the 
senate sergeantatarms david barry wrote a newspaper article some 
members found objectionable not all senators are crooks barry 
wrote just some of them 
the senate historian said that barry was questioned on the senate 
floor that february grilled later by a senate committee and then 
fired 
then in 1934 three airline officials were called to answer 
questions about government contracts with airmail carriers 
as a former senator tower has the right to come to the floor of 
the senate but does not normally have permission to speak to his 
onetime colleagues 
nonsenators have spoken on the senate floor on other occasions 
including lawyers defending those charged in impeachment proceedings 
the senate can of course allow anyone to speak to them by 
voting to do so

former national security adviser robert c 
mcfarlane was given a suspended sentence and fined 20000 friday 
for misleading congress with assurances that oliver l north was 
obeying its ban on helping the nicaraguan rebels 
the former marine lieutenant colonel became the first irancontra 
figure to be punished for his role in the affair he was sentenced 
by us district judge aubrey e robinson jr for his guilty pleas 
to four misdemeanor charges of withholding information from congress 
robinson suspended imposition of any prison term and instead 
placed mcfarlane on two years probation and ordered him to perform 
200 hours of community service during that time mcfarlane could 
have received a maximum prison term of four years and a 400000 
fine 
robinson imposed the sentence and fine with little comment after 
mcfarlanes attorney leonard garment called his client an 
honorable man 
the public servants in this country are not to be found to be 
more decent and more honorable garment told the judge every 
action on his part was taken out of a high sense of duty a 
strong sense of serving his countrys interests 
he stood up and rendered a faithful accounting of his public 
responsibilities when called upon to do so garment said 
referring to mcfarlanes admission in court that he misled congress 
about the irancontra affair 
mr mcfarlane and his family have suffered greatly and enough 
during these past years garment said referring to the emotional 
trauma mcfarlane experienced that culiminated in a suicide attempt 
several months after the affair was made public 
urging probation garment said if ever there were a case that 
called for this act of discretion this such a case 
mcfarlane in his characteristic emotionless monotone told 
robinson that clearly this episode in our history has rendered 
enormous turmoil on our countrys processes 
to the extent that i contributed to that i regret it 
mcfarlane said of his role in the irancontra affair i tried to 
serve my country 
the judge did not elaborate on the reason for his sentence 
except to say that the nature of the offense and the totality of 
the circumstances required him to impose a 5000 fine for each of 
the four counts 
robinson said he would make further recommendations about the 
type of community service he wants mcfarlane to complete during the 
two years of probation 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh did not oppose garments 
request for a suspended sentence outside the us courthouse walsh 
told reporters his office made no recommendation on the sentence 
and declined further comment 
as he left the courthouse mcfarlane said he has strong faith 
and a terrific wife and a free country i am looking to the future 
thats all i have to say 
he had looked tense as he entered the courtroom walking hand in 
hand with his wife jonda 
robinson said he had carefully read the extensive submissions 
including a statement by mcfarlane that were filed with him but 
which werent on the public record 
the sentencing occurred in the same courthouse where north 
mcfarlanes former aide is standing trial on 12 felony counts 
arising from his involvement in the irancontra affair 
mcfarlane is expected to be a key prosecution witness against 
north and had asked to be sentenced by robinson before he testifies 
in the irancontra trial 
on march 11 1988 mcfarlane pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor 
counts of withholding information from congress and agreed to 
cooperate with walshs investigation of the irancontra affair 
mcfarlane admitted writing three letters in 1985 assuring two 
house committees that north was not helping raise money for the 
nicaraguan contras or providing military assistance in defiance of a 
ban on such aid that was imposed by congress 
mcfarlane admitted to a fourth count of misleading the house 
foreign affairs committee on dec 8 1986 by denying any knowledge 
of efforts to solicit money from foreign countries to help the 
contras after congress cut off us military aid 
among the 12 felony charges against north are allegations that he 
drafted the three 1985 letters for mcfarlanes signature that were 
sent to the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the 
house foreign affairs subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs 
in opening statements at norths trial on feb 22 defense lawyer 
brendan v sullivan jr complained that the former national security 
council aide is charged with crimes for letters that his boss 
sent 
mcfarlane decided to write them but the government wants you 
to convict oliver l north for them sullivan said suggesting 
that mcfarlane faces tough crossexamination when he testifies 
against north 
prosecutor john w keker told jurors in his opening statement 
that mcfarlane is still reluctant to take the responsibility for 
what happened and is going to blame oliver north for lying to 
him 
each of the four misdemeanor charges that mcfarlane pleaded 
guilty to carried a maximum oneyear prison term and a fine of up to 
100000 
the two letters that mcfarlane wrote to the house intelligence 
committee on sept 5 1985 and oct 7 1985 were in response to the 
panels inquiries about news reports that north was helping raise 
money for the contras and providing military advice 
in one letter mcfarlane wrote i can state with deep personal 
conviction that at no time did i or any member of the national 
security council staff violate the letter or the spirit of the law 
we did not solicit funds or other support for military or 
paramilitary activities either from americans or third parties he 
wrote 
rep lee hamilton dind the intelligence committees former 
chairman testified as the first witness in norths trial telling 
jurors that he relied on the information that mcfarlane gave him 
i certainly relied upon the information given to me by the 
national security adviser of the president hamilton testified 
i thought that information was accurate honest and correct he 
said 
mcfarlane who tried to commit suicide in 1987 by taking an 
overdose of a tranquilizer played a major role in the irancontra 
affair after resigning as reagans national security adviser in late 
1985 he led a secret mission to tehran in 1986 in an unsuccessful 
attempt to trade weapons for us hostages mcfarlane who 
accompanied north on the mission carried a keyshaped cake and a 
bible signed by president reagan 
he also testified without immunity from prosecution during the 
televised congressional hearings on the irancontra affair in 1987

about 2000 students protesting the selection 
of republican national chairman lee atwater as a trustee of howard 
university took over an auditorium stage friday forcing officials 
to move a convocation including presentation of an honorary degree 
to comedian bill cosby 
cosby was a scheduled speaker at a ceremony marking the founding 
of the predominantly black university 122 years ago but students 
carrying signs demonstrated outside the auditorium streamed inside 
chanted and took over the stage 
others occupied an administration building for several hours and 
some blocked reporters from entering 
police reported no arrests 
the convocation was moved to an art gallery where there was a 
brief ceremony to give cosby an honorary degree before he left the 
campus 
the students at howard university have a tradition of being 
activists university spokesman alan hermesch said later when 
they feel stongly about issues they demonstrate 
university president james cheek met with students who flocked to 
a convocation luncheon and promised to meet with several 
representatives saturday to discuss their grievances hermesch said 
the students said their main complaint was the schools decision 
last month to name atwater to its board of trustees 
their comments indicated they identified atwater with 
controversial ads during george bushs presidential campaign last 
year featuring willie horton a murderer who attacked a maryland 
couple while he was on furlough from a massachusetts prison 
the horton issue contributed to the rising antiblack sentiment 
of the american people said michael lewis a spokesman for a 
group of students who organized the protest and we feel that 
facilitated the election of former ku klux klansman david duke to 
the louisiana state legislature recently 
weve been down this road before said mark goodin a 
spokesman for atwater the prison furlough issue has been explored 
ad nauseam he said that was not racially motivated whatsoever 
it was simply an issue that was explored because of the peculiarity 
of the institution in massachusetts he added

shining path guerrillas executed 37 men in 
a peasant village by cutting their throats and shot to death a 
mother and her baby when the woman tried to flee a military 
official said friday 
the attack monday in a remote village was one of the bloodiest 
since the shining path launched its insurgency in ayacucho state in 
may 1980 
in a related matter the government friday prolonged for two 
months antirebel emergency measures in lima and parts of seven 
states where more than half of perus 21 million people live 
the measures suspend constitutional guarantees to travel and meet 
freely they also permit government forces to conduct searches 
without a warrant and detain suspects for up to two weeks without 
filing charges 
about 200 rebels in seven boats seized canaire a mountain hamlet 
located on the apurimac river 55 miles east of ayacucho 
the rebels surrounded villagers who had assembled in the central 
plaza executed 37 men and shot to death a woman and her 9monthold 
baby when she tried to flee the official said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
violence was a revenge attack by the maoist shining path guerrilla 
group 
at the militarys urging canaire had formed a peasant patrol 
against shining path attacks and members were gathering in the 
village plaza to make rounds when the guerrillas arrived the 
official said 
many of the attackers wore army and police uniforms and took the 
peasants by surprise he said 
villagers were confined in the village church after the 
executions which they were forced to witness he said 
since 1980 both rebels and the military have been accused of 
slaughtering peasant farmers in perus andes mountains mainly in 
impoverished ayacucho state 
in the largest massacre on record guerrillas killed 87 peasants 
in 1983 in the village of lucanamarca in 1985 troops slaughtered 
69 villagers in accomarca 
the shining path has systematically attacked villages that have 
organized peasant patrols under military orders to defend themselves 
against the rebels 
most peasant patrols are poorly armed with lances slings and 
shotguns 
the central and southern andean highlands are populated by 
quechuaspeaking indians who live in isolated hamlets 
ayacucho the capital of ayacucho state is located 235 miles 
southeast of lima the region is the cradle of the shining path 
fight which has claimed more than 12000 lives 
a state of emergency was first declared in ayacucho in late 1982 
and the measure has been prolonged periodically since other regions 
in the central highlands the pacific coast and the amazon jungle 
were later declared emergency zones as insurgency spread

radio stations nationwide are boycotting cat 
stevens songs because the 1970s balladeer said he supported 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis murder threat against satanic 
verses author salman rushdie 
the former pop star however denied friday that he wants to see 
the writer killed he said he was totally abhorred by press 
publicity and headlines such as kill rushdie says cat stevens 
stevens a briton who took the name yusuf islam and founded an 
islamic school in london when he became a moslem in 1977 said he 
had simply stated the islamic ruling on the rushdie affair when 
he was asked a question at kingston polytechnic a college near 
london on feb 21 
he said in a statement issued in london that his only fault was 
being honest he also said the novel insults god and his 
prophets including those prophets honored by christians and jews as 
well as moslems 
stations such as kzpsfm in dallas wcxrfm in washington dc 
webefm in westport conn wbzyam in new castle pa and klsxfm 
in los angeles have dropped cat stevens records from their 
programming 
in detroit wriffm promoted a no cat stevens weekend by 
cutting into his songs with explosions or the sound of someone 
punching someone right after a very optimistic and nonviolent 
line of dialogue program director marty bender said friday 
were doing the no cat stevens weekend to make a point about 
one human being advocating the death of another this guy 
carries a lot of weight a lot of people grew up listening to his 
stuff bender said 
the tempest stems from stevens remarks to moslem students in 
england last week in which he endorsed khomeinis call to kill 
rushdie for writing the novel that many moslems consider blasphemous 
the koran makes it clear if someone defames the prophet then 
he must die the singerturnedteacher told the students 
stevens was a leading singersongwriter of the 1970s with such 
hits as moon shadow peace train and wild world in 1971 
morning has broken in 1972 and another saturday night in 
1974 
but he abandoned his career and stage name years ago 
stevens said friday that it is the duty of every moslem to put 
forward the islamic viewpoint and that is what i did 
my only crime was i suppose in being honest i stood up and 
expressed my belief and i am in no way apologizing for it stevens 
said in a statement 
stevens statement was headed in black type under islamic law 
the ruling regarding blasphemy is quite clear the person found 
guilty of it must be put to death only under certain circumstances 
can repentance be accepted 
stevens said moslems in britain must observe british laws but 
might have to become more involved in british politics if the 
government would not comply with their demands for a ban on 
rushdies novel 
bender who estimates wrif only played cat stevens songs once or 
twice a week readily admits were just goofing around and he 
believes much of the fuss on the nations airwaves has its roots in 
promotion 
its more ploy than politics he said 
in nashville disc jockeys at wgfxfm dropped the singers works 
and offered to swap their recordings for copies of satanic 
verses 
radio personality tom leykis of kfiam in los angeles asked 
people to bring in records to burn only to have that denounced by 
colleague geoff edwards who was suspended feb 28 for refusing to 
run leykis promotions 
kfi publicist mike venema said a station announcement on the 
resolution of that conflict was pending however a bonfire 
scheduled for march 8 was canceled because the fire department 
revoked a permit it had granted venema said 
leykis said in a press release he would still destroy the 
records perhaps by steamroller but as an alternative he was trying 
to organize a celebrity concert protesting the death threat against 
rushdie 
a spokesman for wcxr in the nations capital emphasized that the 
station pulled the records off the air feb 28 after serious 
discussion of listeners complaints that they felt uncomfortable 
hearing cat stevens 
we didnt do this to generate publicity or to scream our call 
letters out said promotion director mark lapidus calling the 
indefinite suspension of cat stevens airplay a response to 
listeners requests

the white house trying to save a utah 
snakevenom researcher who was bitten by a rare snake searched 
remote corners of the globe for serum and then used us government 
contacts friday to speed the medicine to his bedside 
two badly needed serums were located in outofthe way parts of 
iran and the soviet union and with the white house getting the 
customs service to waive normal clearance rules were en route to 
salt lake city late friday 
william haast director of miami serpentarium laboratories at the 
university of utahs research park maintains 1000 exotic 
poisonous snakes at the lab which provides venom to health 
organizations and others for research and use in manufacturing 
antivenins 
the 78yearold man had been bitten nearly 150 times previously 
and he thought he had built up immunity haast evidently did not 
initially consider thursdays bite by a pakistani pit viper to be 
serious 
but he became ill and was in serious condition friday at the 
university of utah health sciences center awaiting the rare serums 
that could give him a full recovery 
he already has been treated with massive doses of antivenin 
including a shipment the utah hospital obtained through an unusual 
airport relay involving a california zoo a helicopter and a delta 
air lines jetliner 
stephen studdert a special assistant to president bush said he 
got a call thursday night from an associate of haast 
studdert who is from salt lake city had given a speech there 
recently describing bushs kinder gentler approach to human 
problems an associate of haast read an account of his speech 
studdert said and called for help thursday night 
studdert said the white house switchboard relayed the call to his 
home and the associate whom he did not identify asked how we 
could help the serum could not be located in the united states 
only in iran and the soviet union 
the presidential aide said he immediately set up conference calls 
with people around the united states and in other countries he said 
doctors and other specialists advised the white house that the 
serums haast needed were not available in this country 
what then transpired is an unusual jointeffort involving people 
in the united states iran and the soviet union with planes rushing 
for clearance and being met on airport runways by us government 
emissaries seeking to protect the serum and get it delivered 
over the next several hours studdert said in an interview he 
arranged through us government medical and other private sources 
for peopletopeople nongovernment contacts in iran and direct 
government contacts between the united states and the soviet union 
using an american interpreter who speaks farsi studdert put 
haasts representatives in telephone contact with serum specialists 
in iran who located one of the necessary serums about two hours 
from tehran 
studdert explained that two different serums were needed one 
for young pakistani pit vipers and another one for the older snakes 
of the same kind 
then he said he put billy dale a white house transportation 
office official to work organizing the flight routes for delivering 
the serums 
vials of the iranian serum were flown by luththansa to frankfurt 
where the flight was met by representatives of the us consul 
generals office and then transferred on an air france flight to 
paris the vial was then to be flown to new yorks kennedy airport 
picked up by a federal drug enforcement administration helicopter 
and flown to laguardia and put on an america west flight scheduled 
to arrive in utah saturday afternoon 
subsequently studdert and his colleagues located the second 
serum the one for younger pakistani pit vipers at the english 
national poison unit in london and that a british airways flight 
was headed from london to los angeles with that package 
doctors are going to go ahead and administer the serum from the 
london youngsnake unit he said 
in addition another supply of the necessary serum was obtained 
with through the tashkent institute of vaccines working 
cooperatively with the united states through the soviet institute of 
health studdert said that serum was put on an aeroflot flight from 
tashkent to moscow and was being flown to frankfurt for eventual 
shipment to the united states 
when i decided i should get involved i clearly did not want to 
disturb the president studdert said but i decided this is 
what the president would have wanted us to do 
were not in the business of transporting pharmaceuticals he 
said but this was a case where the medical solution was not 
available in this country and we were happy to be able to play a 
role

a panel of present and former white house 
correspondents and former presidential press secretaries debated the 
limits of reporting on private lives of public officials friday 
with the john tower confirmation battle as a backdrop 
the discussion took place during a symposium on the press and the 
presidency sponsored by the national press foundation and the 
lyndon baines johnson library 
eleanor clift who covered the white house and now covers 
congress for newsweek said there was an audible gasp when tower 
was asked at a press club luncheon earlier this week whether he had 
ever violated his marriage vows 
tower whose drinking habits and relations with women have 
dominated debate over his nomination to be secretary of defense 
conceded he had done so but said he didnt think he was alone 
i think we all squirm a little when we get into these areas 
ms clift said i think we all like to think there is a line 
beyond which we personally dont go i am uncomfortable in the old 
days there was a clear rule if it didnt interfere with the 
professional duties it wasnt news well the line between private 
lives and professional duties is now so murky that almost anything 
spills over so we dont know where to draw the line 
although the discussion tounched on the tower controversy the 
question posed for the panelists was in the context of reporting 
about the private lives of presidents and their families 
james gerstenzang of the los angeles times said if the 
president is performing in front of us if its something we are 
finding out we are seeing or hearing about him thats usable 
frank cormier retired white house correspondent of the 
associated press told the group that when he was covering president 
kennedy aboard air force one everything was off the record unless 
specified otherwise 
its very difficult for us in retrospect to realize how limited 
in a sense things were 25 years ago cormier said 
in the johnson white house he said things got very fuzzy as 
to what was off the record 
i guess theyve gotten less fuzzy now he said i guess 
anythings fair game 
marianne means of hearst newspapers said reporters are tougher 
on ourselves today in all these personal areas as we are tougher on 
our presidents 
ms means said that when she first came to washington people 
took free trips from people they were covering the bottles of booze 
would arrive at christmas 
sid davis a former white house correspondent for nbc news 
responded it is true that journalists today dont take tickets 
and booze and airplane rides but i am not sure on the substance of 
stories that the standards are better today than they were 15 or 20 
years ago 
in the kennedy era we did hear stories about kennedys private 
and social life and those of us who covered kennedy those days are 
often asked why we never put those stories on the air davis said 
the reason why we never put them on the air is because all we 
heard was rumors 
there are things that happened when we were correspondents that 
we didnt put on the air that would get on the air today or into 
print today he added 
larry speakes former spokesman for president reagan said 
intense competition spurred by the advent of 24hour television 
is driving the news to be stretched awfully thin at points 
reporters are having to come up with some new angle on a story where 
there may be no new angle 
ms means said that the more packaged a candidate or 
president become the more sort of a cardboard person the 
greater is the pressure on reporters to get behind that and see 
what the person is really like 
thats where we get into areas that we used to consider 
strictly private she said 
jody powell president carters press secretary said he was 
recoiling at the thought that the packaging of the candidates 
would suddenly cause us to begin writing about adultery it seems to 
me that is not exactly why we are doing it 
gerald warren deputy press secretary to president nixon said 
the press i think all of us must live up to a little higher 
standard and i think when reports are floated around about elected 
officials both in the executive branch and on the hill i think we 
should spend more time trying to prove or disprove those reports 
helen thomas white house bureau chief for united press 
international said all those candidates put out a press release 
every time they sneeze they know that their life is going to be an 
open book

five carmelite nuns who have spent 
five months barricaded inside their cloister protesting what they 
call the liberalization of their order said they would defy their 
eviction friday by the vatican 
two of the women who had taken temporary vows which expired 
during the protest were told they must vacate the monastery of the 
most blessed virgin mary of mount carmel the paterson roman 
catholic diocese announced 
the diocese added that the two were no longer considered members 
of the religious order 
two others were told they should seek residence in a different 
convent and the fifth a 71yearold nun who suffers from heart 
problems would be allowed to stay in the convent said tim manning 
a spokesman for paterson bishop frank rodimer 
manning said he did not know if the five nuns would be forcibly 
removed if they refused to leave i think perhaps that maybe a bit 
more time needs to elapse before those kind of decisions are made 
he said 
the nuns challenged the validity of the ruling friday and said 
they would continue their protest said a spokeswoman for the group 
nothing came here with a vatican seal on it said the 
spokeswoman betty sutton its the bishops final trick to get 
them out 
five of the cloisters 13 nuns locked themselves in the infirmary 
of their aged whitewalled priory on oct 4 to protest the 
introduction of such things as television and sweets into their 
retreat 
the nuns saying they wanted the monastery returned to the 
carmelites traditionally austere lifestyle drew international 
attention rodimer called the protest attempted anarchy 
the rebel nuns had said they had feared they would be evicted for 
protesting the changes which were initiated by their mother 
superior prioress theresa hewitt 
despite the difficult situation created by some of the 
religious the fundamental principles of religious life were firmly 
retained with prudence and charity read the ruling from the 
congregation for the religious the arm of the vatican that oversees 
religious communities 
mother hewitt called the lockin a scandal when the nuns took 
over the infirmary and criticized the unruly members of her flock 
for disrupting the cloistered lifestyle at the carmel 
the former sister john was one of two nuns whose vows expired 
during the protest manning said she is now known as nicole 
prescott and the other nun the former sister bernadette is now 
known as lynn williams he said 
the other nuns were identified as sister philomena who suffers 
from heart problems and sister teresita romano and sister maria 
ercalano

christine keeler whose affair with a cabinet 
minister shook harold macmillans government 26 years ago was back 
on the front pages friday because of a movie about britains most 
sensational postwar scandal 
the 47yearold former call girl appeared at the world premiere 
of the movie scandal thursday night accompanied by her 
17yearold son seymour 
critics loved the movie but politicians condemned it for raking 
up memories of the affair that forced a minister to resign caused 
the recall of a soviet naval attache and led to the suicide of a 
prominent london osteopath 
anglican bishop james thompson of stepney in londons tough east 
end objected to the film for reviving interest in the downfall of 
ms keelers former lover john profumo who was minister of state 
for war 
profumo has long worked with alcoholics and the poor in the east 
end and in 1975 queen elizabeth ii made him a commander of the 
order of british empire in recognition of his social service work 
ms keeler who has had two failed marriages and lives on welfare 
in a london public housing project said she was glad the truth of 
those wild days of 1963 had been put on film 
the movie recounts her introduction to dr stephen ward a 
successful osteopath with leftwing sympathies and friends in high 
places 
ward let ms keeler live in his apartment and introduced her to 
capt eugene ivanov an assistant naval attache at the soviet 
embassy he took her to lord astors country house cliveden where 
profumo spotted ms keeler then 18 swimming naked in the pool 
after profumos liaison with ms keeler became public and it was 
revealed that she also had an affair with ivanov members of 
parliament expressed concern that government secrets might have 
leaked to the soviets 
profumo denied in parliament that he had slept with ms keeler 
in the face of growing evidence however he later admitted he lied 
to spare his wife actress valerie hobson he resigned june 5 1963 
ward was charged with living on immoral earnings and denied it 
just before his trial ended when the case was going against him he 
killed himself 
ms keeler swapped high living for londons holloway jail in 1964 
when she was given a ninemonth sentence for perjury during the 
trial of another former lover west indian nightclub singer 
lucky gordon 
a major argument arose in prime minister macmillans conservative 
government about how the matter was handled 
lord denning then one of britains top judges found no evidence 
that national security was endangered but the conservatives image 
was badly damaged and they lost the 1964 election 
except for ms keeler reallife protagonists skipped the 
premiere of scandal but their screen counterparts showed up 
joanne whalleykilmer who plays ms keeler john hurt as ward ian 
mckellen as profumo and britt ekland as mariella novotny a brothel 
keeper 
roy hattersley deputy leader of the opposition labor party said 
of the movie about britains most sensational postwar scandal to 
rake it up seems to be a disgrace to our society 
conservative legislator irvine patrick said profumo has paid 
the price and i think that to be dragged through it all again in 
what is a created reconstruction is totally and utterly unfair 
britains largest circulation tabloid the sun saw it 
differently anyone who remembers the sixties will enjoy this 
films nostalgia anyone who doesnt will still find it 
fascinating 
shaun usher wrote in the daily mail this account of the 
profumo affair is the most accomplished british commercial film in a 
long time fluent engrossing racing along the story capsuled long 
ago in that headline the minister the model and the russian spy 
r barry obrien covered scandal for the daily telegraph in those 
days and was one of the last people to talk with ward before the 
osteopath killed himself 
the film does not tell the whole story but does tell it the 
way it was he said

eastern airlines said it cut its weekend schedule by 
nearly 75 percent friday but had supervisors and other workers ready 
to keep the carrier operating indefinitely through a strike 
joseph leonard executive vice president and chief operating 
officer said eastern was suspending service to nearly 60 cities on 
saturday and sunday service will be maintained to almost 50 cities 
including easterns flights out of miami and on its northeast 
shuttle and south american routes leonard said 
the schedule changes were made as a midnight strike loomed by 
easterns machinists union 
while nearly all of the more than 100 daily flights through miami 
will be maintained leonard said most flights will be suspended at 
easterns atlanta hub 
the company expects to gradually resume suspended flights if a 
strike continued in to next week he said we do not want to 
operate a schedule that is not 100 percent reliable 
eastern ticket offices were extending their hours to reschedule 
passengers from cancelled flights to the extent that is humanly 
possible he said 
eastern had strike contingency plans that would enable it to go 
on indefinitely leonard said 
the airline had adequate cash reserves leonard said which other 
sources have estimated at nearly 400 million there were no plans 
for layoffs or asset sales right now leonard told reporters 
friday evening 
he said the airline would use only eastern pilots and that there 
were 200 experienced management pilots available although the 
3500member pilots union planned to honor machinists union picket 
lines leonard predicted some union pilots would cross the picket 
lines 
easterns extensive strike plans also included hiring 1100 
experienced mechanics and technicians to augment management 
maintenance workers leonard said 
the company also has nonunion employees and supervisors ready to 
fill in for flight attendants whose 5900member union said it 
would support the machinists strike 
leonard said eastern had actually improved its ontime 
performance by 6 percent since sending the machinists home friday 
morning to prevent sabotage the carrier has led all major airlines 
in ontime performance the past four months

a fleet of tugboats and salvage ships worked in 
rough seas and gusty wind friday to refloat a grounded tanker and 
stop any more of its cargo of 37 million gallons of crude oil from 
reaching oahus beaches 
some of the 117000 gallons of fuel and crude that spilled from 
the 800foot tanker continued to leak and washed ashore along a one 
to twomile stretch of shore at barbers point on oahus southwest 
coast according to coast guard lt brad nelson 
capt gordon piche commanding officer of the marine safety 
office said tugboat crews planned to try to free the ship at high 
tide at 2 am saturday 
crews were unloading ballast water friday afternoon and preparing 
to remove some of the crude oil onto a barge he said 
oil washed up on a beach where a popular tourist luau is held 
prompting the state department of health to post polluted waters 
signs and at other areas as far as two miles to the north said 
coast guard spokesman dennis hubbard 
helicopter crews determined the oil slick was not edging toward 
honolulu said coast guard spokesman david santos 
its staying close to barbers point and not drifting that 
much santos said 
tugboat crews reported friday morning that no more oil was 
escaping from the exxon houston according to leonard alcantara 
honolulu attorney for exxon co usa the ships 23 crewmembers were 
not injured and remained aboard he said 
the coast guards pacific area strike team was on its way from 
the west coast with equipment to clean up the spill nelson said 
a local oil spill cleanup cooperative called the clean islands 
council was activated and on the scene said les rogers spokesman 
for exxon co usa the houstonbased domestic oil and gas division 
of exxon corp 
in addition exxon has initiated response steps including 
authorization of more tugs if needed to free the vessel he said 
elsewhere an oil slick was spotted friday off sensitive marine 
reserves in the northern florida keys but coast guard officials 
said the spill did not appear to be a threat to the area 
parks in the area reported small gobs of tar washing up and said 
there did not appear to be major damage coast guard spokesman joe 
dye said dead birds were found out near the oil but it was not 
clear if they were killed by the slick 
we have no idea where it came from he said there are 
apparently no ships in the area 
in antarctica the second oil spill in a month has been brought 
under control by chilean navy personnel using chemical solvents to 
fight a kilometerlong slick created by a grounded peruvian 
scientific ship a chilean navy spokesman said friday leaks in two 
damaged tanks on the humboldt were sealed by divers he said 
on jan 28 an argentine navy ship the bahia paraiso ran 
aground off an antarctic peninsula some 300 miles from the site of 
the humboldts accident creating a major oil slick it was 
eventually cleaned up by ships and personnel from argentina chile 
and the united states 
the hawaii spill occurred thursday evening about 15 miles from 
honolulu but an oahu civil defense spokesman said it was unlikely 
the oil would reach famed waikiki beach to the east 
the chances of that happening are very very slim said 
spokesman frank apel its just too far away 
there was no trace of oil along the shoreline beyond barbers 
point nelson said and there was no immediate move to close any 
beaches there also was no evidence of affected marine life or 
seabirds being washed ashore he said 
currents normally would carry the oil to the northwest away from 
honolulu but gusty wind was blowing it in the opposite direction 
he said 
nine tugboats worked to refloat the exxon houston which broke 
free of its moorings and apparently drifted onto a reef during rough 
seas thursday evening nelson said 
the ships hull suffered minor damage but was sitting in 16 feet 
of water and was in no danger of sinking nelson said 
we do know that one of the ships fuel tanks and at least one 
of the empty cargo tanks have been breached said rogers 
the vessel was threetenths of mile off barbers point on oahus 
southwest coast and had just unloaded 168 million gallons of alaska 
north slope crude oil to the hawaiian independent refinery when it 
broke free of its moorings nelson said 
the crew initially declined coast guard assistance but the 
ships captain kevin dick later reported that the vessel was 
hard aground nelson said 
an estimated 25000 gallons of crude oil spilled when the tanker 
broke free during unloading and 92000 gallons of heavy bunker fuel 
oil spilled when an aft tank was ruptured when the tanker went 
aground nelson said

a chilean couple who were denied political 
asylum in norway tried to give away their five children thursday by 
advertising for a foster home in a norwegian newspaper 
isnt there a nice norwegian family that wants to be parents to 
oscar 10 luis 6 nicolas 4 natalia 2 and patricia three 
months asked the couple in the faedrelandsvennen newspaper in the 
southern town of kristiansand 
juan patricio arrancibia collao and his wife raquel quesada 
molina took the painful step because they feared their children 
would be killed or disappear if they returned to chile the national 
news agency ntb reported 
this is the first time weve seen anything like this said 
tove johnsen manager of the kristiansand immigrants office 
i consider it very serious that a family has reacted so 
strongly to a rejection that they would give their children up for 
adoption rather than take them out of the country she told the 
news service 
the couples attorney sverre nordmo told ntb they still can 
appeal their deportation order by april 6 and that he was surprised 
when they took such desperate action 
when he arrived here in march 1988 collao told officials he had 
been tortured in a chilean prison in late 1987 his family followed 
him to norway the following month ntb said 
most of the 900 or so chileans who arrived during the first half 
of 1988 risk being deported because norwegian authorities believe 
they would be in no real danger in their homeland according to the 
norwegian ministry of justice 
by the latest count from the state bureau of statistics there 
were 3747 chileans living in norway in july 1988

a judge ruled thursday there is 
sufficient evidence to try usborn john hull for drug trafficking 
and violating costa rican security by providing arms to nicaraguan 
rebels 
judge maximo esquivel of the superior court tribunal in san 
carlos would not say what evidence he used to make his decision 
the judge said evidence indicates that between 1982 and 1986 
hull worked with a costa rican citizen to provide arms to nicaraguan 
rebels known as the contras in their guerrilla war against the 
lefist nicaraguan government 
a trial date has not been set 
hull will be tried in san carlos about 105 miles northwest of 
san jose because the crimes allegedly were committed in that 
jurisdiction 
hull 69 a former indiana resident has lived in costa rica for 
20 years he has said he became a costa rican citizen eight years 
ago 
hull has acknowledged supporting the contras and has said that in 
the past he let them use his property in los chiles 81 miles 
northwest of san jose 
hull was been in custody since jan 13 when he was arrested by 
costa rican authorities since feb 14 he has been jailed in san 
carlos after spending time in a hospital for heart problems 
sources in the office of judicial investigations have said they 
acted after residents near hulls farm on the nicaraguan border 
denounced activities by him that were seen as possibly endangering 
relations between nicaragua and costa rica 
hulls attorney rita herrera said thursday said she would 
appeal the judges ruling 
she and other defense attorneys have tried unsuccessfully to have 
hull released on bail the 4th district court in san jose 
provisionally set bail at 12500 but the superior court tribunal 
in alejuela province where the trial was later moved denied bail 
because of the severity of the charges 
herrera has argued that hulls arrest was politically motivated 
hull in the past has strongly denied any connection to drug 
trafficking 
witnesses testifying before congress on illegal arms shipments to 
the contras said hulls ranch was a way station for gun smugglers 
and cocaine traffickers 
hull was among 29 people named in a civil suit filed last year by 
two journalists tony avirgan filed the suit with his wife martha 
honey after being wounded in a 1984 news conference bombing blamed 
on the defendants 
a us district juddge in miami ruled in favor of the defendants 
saying the plaintiffs failed to prove their contention that a 
conspiracy was behind the bombing 
eight people were killed in the bombing and the apparent target 
thencontra leader eden pastora was wounded

a communist rebel leader on thursday 
rejected president corazon aquinos demand that the guerrillas lay 
down their arms in exchange for peace talks and guerrillas killed 
an outspoken anticommunist mayor 
luis jalandoni foreign liaison officer of the national 
democratic front based in the netherlands said in an interview with 
a manila radio station that the rebels were willing to find a 
peaceful solution to the 20year conflict 
the front is very willing to find a solution a negotiated 
political settlement for a just and lasting peace said jalandoni 
a former priest but the condition that we should surrender is a 
precondition that is impossible 
last week mrs aquino said she was willing to renew peace talks 
if the 24000strong new peoples army lays down its arms 
the front is an umbrella organization of 12 marxist groups 
including the communist party of the philippines and its armed wing 
the new peoples army 
jalandoni said mrs aquinos stand showed the president closed 
her mind to the reality that the ndf is a political force that has 
been struggling for years that it has influence over 10000 
villages and that it cannot surrender areas and people who 
sacrificed because of their principles and programs 
the military claims jalandoni who has both dutch and filipino 
citizenship is a member of the central committee of the outlawed 
communist party jalandoni is believed to be in charge of rebel 
fundraising activities in europe 
mrs aquino opened peace talks with the front in 1986 but 
negotiations collapsed in january 1987 after she refused rebel 
powersharing demands 
last week front spokesman satur ocampo said the rebels would 
consider resuming peace talks if the aquino government agreed to 
close the six american military bases here when their lease expires 
in 1991 
also thursday police said capistrano legaspi mayor of the town 
of kinogitan in misamis oriental province was slain wednesday by 
three suspected rebel assassins 
the report said legaspi was waiting for a ride home when the 
rebels approached and opened fire in the town about 470 miles 
southeast of manila 
legaspi was an outspoken opponent of the rebel movement

mortality rates in the united states for two of 
the three leading causes of death heart disease and stroke are 
headed down the national centers for disease control said thursday 
however the secondleading cause of death cancer is going up 
the cdc said the us death rate from heart disease in 1987 was 
313 per 100000 people down from 318 the year before for stroke 
or cerebrovascular disease the rate was 61 per 100000 down from 
62 
there were 196 cancer deaths in 1987 for every 100000 americans 
up from 195 the year before 
heart disease cancer and stroke account for about twothirds of 
the 2 million deaths that occur in this country every year the 
atlantabased cdc said in its weekly report 
in actual numbers heart disease killed 762820 of the 22 
million americans who died in 1987 cancer killed 477190 and 
stroke killed 149220 a year earlier 21 million americans died 
including 765490 from heart disease 469376 from cancer and 
149643 from stroke according to dr harry rosenberg a researcher 
with the national center for health statistics 
what we are seeing is the continuation of some longterm 
trends rosenberg said 
the decline in deaths from heart disease and stroke has been 
going on for a decade said thomas thom an epidemiologist with the 
national heart lung and blood institute most experts believe the 
decline can be attributed to improvements in personal health 
greater prevention of disease improvement in medical care for heart 
or stroke patients or all of those factors thom said 
the decline is very real and very consistent he said 
theres got to be something doing it 
specifically he cited trends toward quitting smoking 
controlling high blood pressure and lowering cholesterol levels as 
well as increased physical activity and generally health 
consciousness at the same time cardiac intensive care units have 
come into widespread use in hospitals and heart surgery has become 
commonplace 
there are plenty of reasons to think all those reasons 
contributed he said 
rosenberg said the cancer rate which has been rising as those 
americans age whose lifestyles included more smoking and more 
unhealthy foods should fall in the coming years because of changing 
lifestyles among the young 
we see the beginnings of the overall decrease in cancer 
mortality in a decrease among all age groups of people younger than 
55 particularly young males he said 
among 45 to 54yearolds rosenberg said the cancer rate dropped 
from 181 per 100000 in 1979 to 166 per 100000 in 1986 he said 
preventive measures of the past two decades such as improved diet 
and less smoking contributed to that drop 
complete mortality figures from 1988 are not yet available 
rosenberg said 
the mortality rate from heart disease was showing a slight 
increase from 1987 levels in the 12 months from october 1987 to 
september 1988 he said but that might be traced in part to an 
influenza epidemic last winter which preyed upon those at increased 
risk of problems from flu such as patients with chronic heart 
disease

japan and france plan to cut imports of iranian oil 
officials said thursday but neither depicted the move as being in 
reaction to a death threat against novelist salman rushdie by irans 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
a french oil company official however said the french decision 
was linked to worsening relations with iran after khomeini irans 
revolutionary and religious patriarch attacked rushdie over his 
book the satanic verses 
many moslems find the book blasphemous 
japans cutback will be up to 20 percent over the next three 
months officials in the trade and foreign ministryies said it was 
because of a seasonal decline in demand and not motivated by the 
rushdie affair 
its true that there will be a decline in coming months but it 
has nothing to do with political issues said tsukasa kawada 
deputy director of the foreign ministrys energy resources division 
in paris an industry ministry spokesman said oil companies were 
urged to slacken imports about 10 days ago 
while france issued no formal directive on cutting oil imports a 
senior official from the industry ministrys hydrocarbons service 
suggested to french oil companies that they trim imports 
following khomeinis death threats against rushdie according to 
industry sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the suggestion was not overtly linked to the rushdie matter 
officials suggested only that a high level of imports was 
inappropriate at this time 
but one official at a major french oil company said it was 
suggested to us it would be inappropriate for us to increase our 
imports of iranian crude or to maintain them at a high level in 
the present diplomatic context 
khomeinis call on feb 14 for moslems to kill rushdie provoked 
some economic backlash in europe notably west germany all member 
nations of the european economic community recalled their 
ambassadors from tehran 
japan condemned the death edict but did not withdraw its

china will have up to 260 million surplus workers 
by the end of the century threatening serious economic disruption 
if more jobs arent found an official daily said thursday 
the economic daily said more than 200 million of the surplus 
laborers reside in overpopulated rural areas 
the report came as cities in this nation of 1 billion try to cope 
with a deluge of rural migrants looking for betterpaying city jobs 
the prosperous southern province of guangdong has put out an 
emergency appeal to the state to help it handle 25 million mostly 
rural outsiders who have flocked to the province in recent weeks 
the daily citing a report by the china rural development 
research center said chinas labor force is growing by an estimated 
10 million a year outstripping the number of new jobs 
the state statistical bureau said earlier this week that the 
urban work force increased by 36 million last year to 1357 million 
the report did not estimate how many of the surplus workers would 
be unemployed although the government has called on businesses to 
operate more efficiently most staterun plants continue to retain 
their excess workers rather than lay them off 
economists say 20 to 30 million of the urban work force is excess 
manpower which could be cut without affecting production 
in the countryside about 80 million peasants have left the farm 
to work at small rural enterprises that have shot up during the past 
decade of economic reforms 
however many of these enterprises are now in trouble or closing 
down because of inefficiency lack of energy and basic materials or 
a cutoff in credit as the government moves to slow down the 
overheated economy 
the report said that while laborers exceed job opportunities in 
chinas underdeveloped areas there is still a demand for labor in 
developed sections of the country 
it suggested an easing of the nations strict residence 
regulations to allow for greater worker mobility the country should 
also set up a special rural labor development organization to 
organize rural laborers for work on the international labor market 
it said

the eastern airlines showdown pits one of the 
airline industrys most feared bosses against a union leader who may 
be the industrys most stubborn 
texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo 48 is a queens ny 
son of spanish immigrants harvard business school graduate and 
aggressive builder of the nations largest airline company 
hes had no success dealing with machinists union district 100 
president charles e bryan 55 a west virginiaborn mechanic and 
magnetic selfeducated man who says he takes his strategies from 
zen the bible gandhi martin luther king jr and the ancient 
chinese author suntzus the art of war 
with a machinists union strike deadline set for midnight est 
friday about the only point the two driven men agree on is that 
eastern may not survive a strike 
lorenzo bought eastern three years ago with a warning that 
there aint no santa claus and his new management sent 
easterns usually tense labor relations plummeting to new lows with 
wage concession demands toughened work rules and thousands of 
layoffs firings and suspensions 
his eastern management has added to a unionbusting reputation he 
gained when he ended a labor confrontation at continental airlines 
in 1983 by taking the carrier into bankruptcy reorganization and 
getting union contracts abrogated 
texas air has outraged eastern unions by taking over easterns 
computerized reservations system collecting tens of millions of 
dollars in management fees and loans from eastern and agreeing 
to sell easterns profitable and prestigious northeast shuttle 
service to developer donald trump that 365 million sale is not 
final 
management says it has tried to work with bryan but that the 
union leader wants to run the airline himself a booklet titled 
charlie says put out recently by eastern warns if charlie 
isnt stopped he will destroy eastern 
former eastern chairman frank borman says bryan has a 
certifiably insane dream of running the airline himself and 
borman recently compared bryan to cult leader jim jones who led a 
mass suicide of followers in guyana in 1978 
bryan elected president of easterns largest union in 1980 and 
overwhelmingly reelected twice got borman to back down and give 
pay increases in 1983 on the last day of a machinists strike 
deadline 
in 1986 with eastern facing bankruptcy bryan refused to join 
the pilots and flight attendants in making wage concessions unless 
they were tied to bormans ouster easterns board of directors 
refused and sold the company to lorenzo who built tiny 
moneylosing texas international into the houstonbased texas air 
corp that took over continental airlines new york air people 
express frontier and other small carriers 
lorenzo who initially indicated he wouldnt involve himself in 
easterns labor situation ignored a postsale telegram from bryan 
asking for a meeting but last year as negotiations with the 
machinists stalemated and eastern unions fought management with 
myriad lawsuits and political lobbying lorenzo had dinner with 
bryan in houston 
the dinner only led to more disputes and bryan continued to hope 
for a buyout of eastern bryan contends that eastern has been badly 
mismanaged for years at the employees expense and that workers 
would increase productivity and service with more input into how the 
company is run 
corporate kingpins carl icahn t boone pickens and trump have 
all been approached by eastern unions about buying eastern but 
texas air which has posted record losses since taking over the 
airline has said there are no buyers on the horizon 
bryan a mechanic since 1956 at an airline whose last strike was 
in 1966 has seen his union rolls reduced from 12000 to 8500 since 
the texas air takeover 
our people have been frustrated there have been attempts to 
provoke wildcat strikes bryan said recently they have been 
brutalized by management that doesnt care about the companys 
future 
while promising a wingding of a strike bryan also worried 
that the company may not survive 
weve fought them as long as we could and weve had some 
success he said unfortunately our system doesnt seem to look 
out for the working man 
lorenzo meanwhile made a lastditch personal appeal to eastern 
pilots this week in a videotape showing a shirtsleeved lorenzo in 
a homey easy chair he urged eastern is either going to make it 
through this period make the changes that are necessary and go on 
and succeed or im afraid eastern is going to go through this 
juncture and perhaps end up in the corporate graveyard

western european aviation officials have 
urged washington to end a builtin bias against european air 
carriers in the five computerized reservation systems used by us 
airlines and travel agents 
these systems are programmed to favor us carriers though 
european airlines fly the same routes to europe and in much less 
time the european officials said thursday 
consumers suffer from not always being given ready access to 
the best flight information by us computerized reservation 
systems edward hudson secretary of the 22nation european civil 
aviation conference told reporters 
representatives of the two biggest us computerized reservation 
services apollo and sabre said the criticism came at a time when 
they were taking steps to correct the situation 
im surprised that they would be saying this now with all the 
things that have happened in the recent past said karen cook a 
spokeswoman for american airlines sabre system 
since december sabre has offered travel agents two ways of 
displaying flight information one of which is more favorable to 
european airlines ms cook said apollo plans to offer two display 
options starting later this month according to john mcintyre 
director of products marketing for covia the parent of apollo 
the european accusations echo accusations by us airlines that 
american and united air lines discriminated against other carriers 
with their reservation systems since 1984 the civil aeronautics 
board has required the systems not to give any preferential 
treatment 
hudson said he would raise the issue in a meeting with us 
department of transportation officials this month to date there 
has been a marked reluctance from the us government to open its 
ears to what has been said by the europeans he added 
reservations made through us computerized reservation systems 
often involve unnecessarily lengthy journey times with long 
overlays at connecting points because the computers favor us 
carriers hudson said 
he said they list us carriers on the first screen while flights 
of european carriers are tucked away on remote screens that booking 
agents do not check unless travellers say at what hour they want to 
leave 
the five us systems are known as apollo sabre pars datasii 
and system one hudson said none gives priority to flights to europe 
where warranted 
as an example he cited a nonstop san franciscotoparis flight 
on frances uta airline that he said is up to 5 hours faster than 
flights on major us carriers that make stopovers yet sabre puts 
the uta flight on screen 9 rather than on the first screen he said 
flights of air france british airways lufthansa alitalia and 
sas get similar treatment though they get travelers from california 
to europe hours faster than us carriers he said 
hudson said the 22 ecac nations will issue next week rules of 
conduct for western europes two main computerized reservation 
systems amadeus and galileo these rules he said give 
noneuropean carriers firstscreen priority if their flights are 
more convenient he called on the us government to do likewise

but she said that when she and her children watched married 
with children one sunday night in january she ended up shooing 
the children out of the room 
the situation comedy which began in 1987 and is foxs most 
successful show is about a bluecollar family headed by shoestore 
clerk al bundy rakolta said the first show she saw featured a mans 
visit to a lingerie store 
in the store one woman removed her bra for strangers asking 
how she looked it showed a man that worked there an older man 
walking around in a garter belt they mentioned vibrators on the 
show rakolta said 
i was thinking it was a family program because it was prime 
time 830 pm i was horrified i wanted to know what kind of 
sponsors would sponsor a show like this she said 
rakolta said she watched other episodes to see who advertised on 
one she said the father asked his children with his wife standing 
nearby what women and dog do do have in common and told them 
they get easier to pick up as they get older 
since rakolta wrote them procter amp gamble co mcdonalds corp

agencies not to buy time on the program the president of cocacola 
usa ira herbert said his company will screen future episodes more 
closely 
i must tell you that i am corporately professionally and 
personally embarrassed that one of our commercials appeared in this 
particularly unsuitable program episode herbert wrote rakolta 
fox officials defended the show the bundy family is a comedic 
counterpoint to other fictional television families who enjoy above 
average incomes greater opportunities and have more refined 
tastes wrote don r bay a fox vice president 
some episodes in the parody of life in a lower socioeconomic 
family may offend some viewers wrote gary lieberthal chairman of 
its producer columbia pictures television whose parent company is

the architect of a plan to send commercials along 
with a news show into classrooms says advertisers backing a test run 
of the program are standing firm despite growing criticism of the 
proposal 
christopher whittle head of whittle communications lp of 
knoxville tenn said eight sponsors have signed contracts to buy 
80 percent of the commercial time available during the test that 
starts monday 
no one who has signed has even called and said they were 
worried he said thursday in response to reports that a second 
major education group has gone on record opposing commercials in 
school 
whittle refused to identify the eight sponsors saying it would 
become evident who they are once the test run starts in six schools 
on march 6 
as part of the test whittle has equipped six schools with about 
50000 each in television monitors recording equipment and 
sattellite dishes so they can receive the 12minute daily news show 
he is producing for teenagers 
the schools in exchange are to run the show each school day 
the show called channel one will include two minutes of paid 
commercials the advertising has outraged some educators who say 
big business should not be allowed that kind of access to the 
classroom 
the national parentteacher association said wednesday that its 
22member executive committee opposed sending commercials into the 
schools earlier this week the national association of secondary 
school principals voted to urge principals to avoid programs that 
have commercials 
levi strauss amp co the san franciscobased apparel maker is one 
of the sponsors of the test but levis marketing manager dan chew 
said the uproar hasnt prompted the company to reconsider its 
support 
we are very sensitive to the public debate and we are 
monitoring it and listening as closely as anyone else he said 
but he said that public reaction to the idea of including ads on 
a news show for schools is only one issue on a long list of 
criteria for making a decision on whether to continue advertising 
on the show if whittle proceeds with plans to make it available next 
year in 8000 schools 
whittle said many schools would not be able to afford a topical 
daily news program like he is producing or the hardware he says 
allowing two minutes of commercials is a reasonable way to finance 
it 
he said his company has made presentations to 15 advertisers 
seeking their support for the program and that only three whom he 
declined to identify have declined 
in addition to the eight that signed contracts he said he is 
continuing negotations with four others and is hopeful that two of 
three of them will buy the remaining commercial inventory 
lou nagy spokesman for sneaker maker converse inc in north 
reading mass said converse isnt interested in being a sponsor 
though it counts on the teenage consumers that whittle is courting 
our feeling is that there are plenty of opportunities to reach 
the teenage audience and we just feel that doing it in the 
classroom is maybe overdoing it a little bit he said 
in another development thursday whittle said it had reached an 
agreement to send nonsponsored programming to the test schools from 
the pacific mountain network which represents public television 
stations in 13 western states 
an unspecified number of programs will be delivered over the same 
satellite system that carries the channel one program and schools 
are free to use the shows as they choose 
whittle already publishes a number of magazines and sponsored 
posters that are distributed in schools across the country and he 
notes that the advertising in those publications has not come under 
fire 
but critics say a sponsored television show that is being shown 
in classrooms will be more difficult than other media for students 
to ignore

chairman samuel j heymans buyout offer for 
gaf corp once a casualty of the stock market crash ended 18 
months after it was launched when shareholders accepted the 146 
billion bid 
gaf told shareholders at a brief annual meeting thursday that 94 
percent of the shares for which votes were submitted approved the 
acquisition by a management group headed by heyman 
the deal will likely be made final in two weeks when financing 
arrangements are completed gaf said 
stockholders will receive 46 in cash and an estimated 7 worth 
of subordinated debentures for each share the transaction is backed 
by 885 million in bank loans led by chase manhattan bank and 285 
million in highyield junk bonds underwritten by drexel burnham 
lambert inc and merrill lynch capital markets 
heyman and management group members are investing 100 million 
through the purchase of senior subordinated increasing rate notes 
a maker of specialty chemicals and building materials gaf in 
1988 earned 908 million or 318 a share before extraordinary 
credits on revenues of 9614 million 
as the announcement was made the trial of gaf and vice chairman 
james t sherwin continued in federal court in manhattan with the 
second day of the defense presentation 
the government accuses gaf two subsidiaries and sherwin with 
illegally trying to manipulate union carbide corp stock before gaf 
planned to sell carbide shares in 1986 
we are extremely gratified by the outcome of the shareholder 
vote heyman said in a statement it clearly demonstrates the 
success of a process which was designed from the outset to realize 
for shareholders the highest current value for their ownership 
interest in the company 
heymans first offer came in september 1987 it was valued at 
23 billion or 6650 a share and was withdrawn after the oct 
19 1987 crash after which gaf shares traded at a low of 3150 
the following december stockholders were offered 4850 a share 
and the bid was sweetened last year to its current 53 a share 
one analyst said the new ownership will have to do something to 
pay for the purchase 
one thing is very clear cash flow from the current operations 
cannot pay down the debt said charles j rose of oppenheirmer amp 
co 
its hard for me to imagine any assets being sold he said 
maybe theres a lot more of earnings potential to be realized 
he also said heyman may seek acquisitions

the defection of several advertisers from the 
television comedy married with children highlights concern 
among imageconscious corporations over tvs increasingly racy fare 
some industry insiders said 
two major advertisers quit buying time on the fox broadcasting 
co situation comedy others have spurned selected episodes for fear 
the shows frank language and references to sex would offend 
viewers executives of the advertisers said thursday 
advertising already is tough to find for tabloid tv programs 
such as geraldo that delve into kinky sex devil worship and 
similarly salacious subjects advertising executives say 
some defectors from married which is the fledgling foxs 
toprated show were influenced by an energetic letterwriting 
campaign by a detroitarea mother terry rakolta spokesmen said 
the show about a bluecollar family named bundy features 
references to sex and bathroom humor buxom women and frequent 
portrayals of the husband berating his wife 
two advertisers procter amp gamble co and american home products 
corp bought some ads on the show but have decided against further 
sponsorship spokesmen said thursday johnson amp johnson and 
mcdonalds corp officials said they had decided against running 
national advertising on the show though individual locally 
purchased ads for the two had run 
cocacola usa whose president ira herbert wrote an apology to 
mrs rakolta continues to screen married episodes for content 
but hasnt found one suitable for advertising since her complaint 
jan 15 said spokesman tony tortorici 
advertisers concerns were summed up by procter amp gamble 
spokeswoman kelly gillespie we felt that the whole theme of the 
show is basically one we do not want to be associated with we were 
concerned about the negative portrayal of american family life 
fox which purposefully appeals to the young adult audiences 
advertisers covet in its efforts to build a fourth television 
network hasnt had any trouble selling ads on the show which is 
broadcast sunday evenings said spokesman brad turell 
the show is completely sold out he said adding that news 
reports of mrs rakoltas campaign prompted calls of support from 
viewers 
we have received literally hundreds of telephone calls today 
from across the country from viewers saying that this one womans 
opinion is getting too much attention and hoping that we wont 
change the show turell said 
procter amp gamble which makes hundreds of household products 
bought ads on several married episodes last year stopped from 
october through december then sponsored two shows in january ms 
gillespie said after receiving mrs rakoltas letter officials 
reviewed the show and decided against further ads she said 
american home products which makes goods ranging from jiffy pop 
to woolite had already decided to disassociate itself from the show 
before receiving mrs rakoltas letter said spokeswoman carol 
emerling in new york 
tambrands which produces feminine hygiene products such as 
tampax planned to advertise on two married episodes but 
canceled the second after a review prompted by mrs rakoltas 
letters said paul konney a spokesman in the companys new york 
headquarters 
advertisers face a dilemma in deciding whether to sponsor racy 
shows which often attract big audiences but may offend some vocal 
consumers 
socalled tabloid tv shows like geraldo have difficulty 
attracting advertisers because of what many see as their 
exploitation of the weaker side of humanity 
a recent survey of advertisers and ad buyers found resistance to 
such shows topped by the oftenoutrageous the morton downey jr 
talk show said dean mccarthy vice president of harrington righter 
amp parsons a new york firm that helps television stations sell air 
time 
virtually all big companies have guidelines for what kind of 
shows are acceptable for their ads and most hire screening 
companies to check shows in advance for problems 
as television presses the outer limits of taste boosted by more 
lenient federal regulations and greater competition for ads with 
other media finding an appropriate spot for an ad be difficult 
said mcdonalds spokeswoman stephanie skurdy 
ours is a childrens and family business ms skurdy said 
from the companys oak brook ill headquarters it has become 
increasingly difficult to find family programming on primetime 
television 
but paul isaacson vice president of young amp rubicam a new york 
advertising agency said complaints about shows content didnt 
appear any more frequent now than they ever have 
those who seek to influence television content through pressure 
on advertisers are attempting censorship said carol sobel an 
american civil liberties union attorney 
if you dont want to watch it then dont watch it ms sobel 
said i think what is inappropriate is to force your views on 
anyone else

economists say rising interest rates have started 
to influence peoples spending decisions but purchases of clothing 
and other everday items will be among the last things affected 
there was no evidence of a slowdown in consumer spending in 
reports thursday from the nations largest retailers which showed 
many of them enjoyed healthy sales gains in february 
a continuing turnaround in womens apparel and renewed demand for 
other consumer and household goods contributed to last months gains 
for department stores discount chains and general merchandise 
vendors 
retail sales measure important aspects of consumer spending 
activity which accounts for about twothirds of all us economic 
activity 
lawrence kudlow chief economist at the investment banking firm 
bear stearns amp co said the recent rise in interest rates partly 
reflecting the federal reserve boards effort to squeeze 
inflationary pressures may be changing peoples minds about 
spending 
i think we are already in the early stages of a slowdown in 
consumer spending kudlow said you are seeing a higher savings 
rate which is the flip side of slower spending 
higher interest rates will have the most impact on purchases 
typically financed over time such as cars and home appliances 
jeffrey feiner a retail industry analyst with merrill lynch amp co 
said the effect on sales of clothing and routine items will be much 
more limited 
we still remain relatively sanguine about the retailing 
outlook given the improvement in womens apparel as well as our 
belief that retailers will maintain very strong control over 
inventories and expenses he said 
for many of the retailers february marked the start of their 
1989 financial year balance sheets showed signs of improvement last 
year analysts said due largely to unexpectedly brisk business 
before and after christmas 
february typically is a lowvolume month as merchants prepare for 
a seasonal shopping pickup in the spring but analysts detected 
favorable omens in the latest tallies 
one good sign was stronger sales of apparel apparently because 
women are finding the latest styles more appealing than last years 
fashions 
limited inc the apparel retailer said sales rose 22 percent in 
the four weeks ended feb 25 from the year before and sales at 
stores open at least a year called samestore sales went up by 
19 percent 
retailers and industry analysts say samestore sales give a more 
accurate reading of a companys performance than totals that include 
sales at newly opened stores not every retailer reports samestore 
sales 
at sears roebuck and co the nations largest retailer sales 
of sporting goods toys and auto accessories posted strong gains 
said michael bozic chairman and chief executive officer of sears 
merchandise group 
sears which on wednesday inaugurated a new lowpricing policy at 
all of its more than 800 stores said sales for the four weeks ended 
feb 25 went up 132 percent from the yearearlier level and 
samestore sales rose 66 percent 
k mart chairman and chief executive joseph e antonini said sales 
of small appliances home electronics and items in its pharmacy 
division contributed to overall sales growth 
k marts sales for the four weeks ended feb 22 grew 83 percent 
and sales at stores open a year or more were up by 35 percent 
william r howell chairman of jc penney co inc said 
promotions for valentines day and presidents day boosted sales 
particularly for mens merchandise and home furnishings 
penney said sales in the four weeks ended feb 25 increased 53 
percent and samestore sales gained 25 percent the company has 
discontinued lines such as home electronics some sporting goods and 
photographic equipment over the year and excluding those lines 
sales for february rose 98 percent 
among other retailers reporting thursday 
walmart stores inc the fastgrowing discount and general 
merchandise chain based in bentonville ark recorded a 25 percent 
sales rise in february samestore sales rose 11 percent 
minneapolisbased dayton hudson corp said sales for the four 
weeks ended feb 25 were up 11 percent over the year and samestore 
sales rose 47 percent 
the results reported thursday were from most of the biggest 
general merchandise chains and apparel retailers excluding campeau 
corp rh macy amp co and batus inc which do not release monthly 
figures unlike monthly retail sales figures released by the federal 
government they do not include sales at auto dealers supermarkets 
or restaurants

minnetonka corp maker of calvin klein 
cosmetics says it may offer itself for sale to maximize value for 
its shareholders 
comparable highmargin luxury product businesses are 
commanding very high values in the private market said robert r 
taylor minnetonkas chairman chief executive officer and largest 
individual shareholder 
this underscores our belief that it is in the best interests of 
our shareholders to explore the sale of the company he said in a 
statement thursday 
taylor said minnetonka which designs manufactures and markets 
international lines of fragrance personal care and leather 
accessory products has retained morgan stanley amp co inc as its 
financial adviser to explore a possible sale and other alternatives 
to benefit shareholders 
minnetonka on wednesday reported a 1988 profit from continuing 
operations of 158 million up 56 percent from the 101 million of 
1987 earnings per share from continuing operations were 94 cents 
up 65 percent from 57 cents the previous year 
sales for the year rose 40 percent to 2135 million from 1524 
million in 1987 
the company said its calvin klein cosmetics division accounted 
for 1577 million of total sales up 52 percent from 1987 and had 
a 66 percent increase in operating income to 277 million 
the calvin klein cosmetics division has become the leading 
contributor to minnetonkas financial performance and has 
consistently delivered exceptional growth and profitability 
taylor said 
minnetonkas 1988 results included the launching of its calvin 
klein fragrance eternity which taylor predicted could match the 
success of minnetonkas obsession fragrance both sell for 
around 185 an ounce 
sales figures for obsession and eternity are not 
available said elin schomaker a spokeswoman for the company 
taylor said the announcement that minnetonka is considering the 
possibility of a sale does not guarantee that this exploration 
will result in proposals acceptable to the company or that any 
transaction will be consummated 
we believe there is a significant gap between minnetonkas 
current share price level and the value that could be achieved in 
the private market taylor said

there are still too many fundamentals that are weak in the 
us the trader said nonetheless im not going to be selling 
dollars soon 
another trader in milan said that if the us senate rejects 
president bushs choice of john tower as secretary of defense the 
dollar would likely lose ground 
the market generally likes a strong american president but if 
towers candidacy fails the wimp factor will reemerge the

from earlier highs to finish the week marginally lower 
the us dollar finished at 12812 yen up only 005 yen from 
thursdays 12807 close it had started trading at 12858 yen and 
moved mainly between 1281012870 yen during the day 
dealers said the dollar was mainly supported by a west german 
decision thursday not to change its interest rates 
bundesbank the west german central bank said it would maintain 
its discount rate and its lombard interest rate at 40 percent and 
60 percent respectively 
because of the announcement the dollar managed to touch 12870 
yen during the morning session but fell back in afternoon

afternoon erased gains made by the us currency causing it to drop

situation is becoming more severe when compared to last year 
and that it was important to act promptly and flexibly to deter

interest rates the dealer said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
japans discount rate presently stands at 25 percent the lowest 
among major industrialized countries

earlier gains to close the week marginally lower at 3200010

the irs is temporarily softening the sting of a 
new law affecting the group health insurance of many american 
workers but opponents say the only solution is repeal 
a bill to kill the law which requires businesses to demonstrate 
that their health plans do not discriminate in favor of upperincome 
employees has been signed by 183 members of the house 
rep john lafalce dny chairman of the house small business 
committee says he expects a majority of the house 218 members 
to have signed his repeal bill within a few weeks 
one employeebenefits consultant estimates that almost half the 
nations companies with more than 1000 workers cannot say with 
certainty that their plans do not discriminate 
the internal revenue service on thursday issued 220 pages of 
regulations explaining to employers how they could comply with the 
law which is known as section 89 the law was enacted as part of 
the big tax overhaul of 1986 and amended as recently as last 
november 
although the law took effect jan 1 the irs said employers need 
take no action to comply with it before july 1 in addition a 
goodfaith effort to comply will be treated by the irs as having 
satisfied the law at least until next jan 1 
business representatives said the regulations do nothing to make 
th law more attractive 
section 89 represents a major attack on our employee benefit 
system said karen berg humanresources manager for the us 
chamber of commerce in reality its a backdoor effort to tax 
employee benefits the length and complexity of the regulations make 
it clear that section 89 should be repealed 
it is obvious that they have failed to provide understandable 
guidance for section 89 said john sloan jr president of the 
national federation of independent business 
congress enacted section 89 in an effort to extend health 
insurance to more workers the provision requires employers to apply 
complex mathematical tests to their benefits packages to prove that 
they are not biased against workers making less than 50000 a year 
many businesses complain that the law by weighting them down 
with paperwork could have the opposite effect by encouraging 
abandonment of employee health insurance 
treasury and irs officials say their discussions with accountants 
indicate most businesses will have no major problem complying with 
the law in large part that assumption reflects that the general 
principles applying to health and welfare benefits are similar to 
those that have governed employee pensions since 1974 
the regulations announced thursday on which the irs will take 
comments until may 8 apply chiefly to health insurance since that 
is the benefit affecting most employers however the transition 
rules including the date changes also apply to term life insurance 
under the law before an employers benefit plan can be 
considered qualified by the irs it must be written enforceable 
permanent and maintained exclusively for the benefit of workers if 
a plan is not qualified all employees pay tax on the benefit 
a second set of requirements is designed to prevent the plan from 
being overly beneficial to higherincome workers if an employers 
plan fails this test only the highly paid employees not 
rankandfile workers would have to pay tax on the value of the 
excess insurance coverage 
in explaining the regulations the irs scoffed at a story 
repeated often by opponents of section 89 this story holds that a 
hypothetical 20000ayear janitor whose 150000 heart surgery is 
covered by insurance would have to pay tax on the full 150000 if 
his employers health plan failed to meet qualification rules 
that result is not reached under these regulations said 
james j mcgovern irs assistant chief counsel 
the regulations state that if a plan does not qualify a worker 
making under 50001 would be liable for tax on only 10 percent of 
medical expenses that were reimbursed under the insurance plan the 
percentage would rise with income a worker earning over 150000 
would pay tax on the full reimbursement 
the irs said no penalty would be imposed for a small violation 
that was corrected within 90 days

the economy is likely to continue its record 
peacetime expansion during 1989 but the pace of growth is expected 
to slow this year under the weight of rising interest rates many 
analysts believe 
while president bush is pinning his budget and deficitreductions 
plans on optimistic assumptions for a 32 percent rate of economic 
growth during 1989 many private forecasters expect the pace to be 
closer to 27 percent 
the gross national product the broadest measure of economic 
health grew a robust 38 percent during 1988 but the pace fell to 
2 percent in the final three months of the year 
most economists said 1989 opened on a strong note but that growth 
should slow as the economy responds to a yearlong campaign by the 
federal reserve board to push up interest rates and cool the economy 
to restrain inflation 
the governments main forecasting gauge of future economic 
activity the index of leading economic indicators was expected to 
show an increase for january the report was scheduled to be 
released today 
growth will be very robust this quarter but starting next 
quarter i fully expect to see the effects of the higher interest 
rates said michael evans head of a washington consulting firm 
william dunkelberg dean of the school of business and management 
at temple university said economic reports so far this year give 
no indication that the economy is going to weaken substantially in 
the next halfyear 
the fed last week intensified its antiinflation fight boosting 
its key bank lending rate a halfpercentage point to 7 percent in 
an effort to rein in accelerating inflation at the same time major 
banks boosted their prime rate charged to their most creditworthy 
commercial customers by a halfpoint to 11 percent the second 
increase in two weeks 
the feds latest round of credittightening came as concerns 
about inflation had heightened with word that consumer prices rose 
06 percent in january and wholesale prices rose 1 percent 
todays release of the leading index marks its first issue in a 
revised format 
the revisions dropped two of 11 components from the index 
revised two others and added two new indicators of economic 
activity 
using data stretching back to 1948 the composite index has 
correctly predicted all eight recessions by dropping for at least 
three months in a row but it also forecast four recessions that 
never materialized 
larry moran a spokesman for the governments bureau of economic 
analysis said thursday the changes make the index less prone to 
afterthefact revision less apt to make false predictions of 
future downturns and more precise at predicting when downturns will 
occur 
a bureau study of how the new index would have done if it had 
been used in the past showed that its performance would have been 
similar to that of the old index 
the two new indicators are a university of michigan survey of 
consumer optimism and the measure evaluating manufacturers unfilled 
orders 
the components that were dropped changes in outstanding credit 
and the change in inventories on hand and on order were scrapped 
mainly because uptodate data has not been available when the index 
first was compiled for a particular month the index for that month 
was later revised to include the updated information

mexico announced friday it is reducing crude 
oil exports by 5 percent beginning april 1 in a coordinated move 
with other producers in an effort to buttress prices on the world 
market 
crude exports will be cut by an average of 68600 barrels a day 
from the current average of 137 million the department of energy 
and mines said in a statement 
with this mexico fully acknowledges that strengthening the oil 
market is a joint responsibility by producers and consumers since 
everyone benefits from a stable market and fair prices it said 
the statement did not give a time frame for the reduction but a 
source at pemex the state petroleum monopoly said the cut will 
probably be maintained at least until the end of the year depending 
on world market conditions 
the cut was tentatively agreed upon feb 21 at a conference by 
mexico the worlds fourth biggest producer and sixth largest 
exporter and the five other nonopec producers in london two 
weeks of consultations and negotiations followed on the details 
at the london conference mexico proposed to cut exports by 5 
percent provided the other nonopec nations did the same the 
agreement came after the 13 members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries agreed to cut exports during a meeting in 
vienna austria 
participating in the talks at the mexican embassy in london were 
mexico oman malaysia egypt china and angola the soviet union 
colombia north yemen norway and the state of alaska and the 
canadian province of alberta sent observers 
although mexico refuses to join opec it has often used the 
international cartels guidelines to set prices and export limits 
opec members alberia ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela together were estimated to be producing in 
february about 195 million barrels a day 
this was 1 million above their agreed production limit but well 
below their fourthquarter production last year opec has set a 
target price of 18 a barrel for the second quarter of this year 
mexicos production averages 25 million barrels a day and about 
half of it is exported to the united states japan its principal 
customer in the far east buys about 180000 barrels daily mexico 
also imports 56000 barrels a day from the united states for its 
northern border region to save transportation costs 
on wednesday mexico reduced prices of its light isthmus to 
western europe and the united states and its extralight olmec to 
the united states by 10 cents a barrel but kept the price of its 
heavy maya crude unchanged 
olmec which mexico began producing in mid1988 is sold only to 
the united states 
pemex establishes its prices by region using a formula based on 
average prices on socalled world spot markets where oil is 
auctioned to the highest bidder but it sells only to fast customers 
under contract of one year or more 
thus the price of maya to the us averaged 1238 a barrels 
during the first half of january while isthmus averaged 1586 and 
olmec 1680 in western europe maya averaged 1152 and isthmus 
1571 a barrel and in the far east maya averaged 1220 and isthmus 
1485 according to pemex figures

the chicago board of trade whose trading is under 
federal investigation friday announced measures to provide greater 
accountability and a better audit trail of floor trades 
the board of trades board of directors unanimously approved 
implementation of nine enhancements of the exchanges 
surveillance system said spokeswoman jane crowley 
the measures were approved after disclosure last month of a 
2year undercover federal probe into suspected illegal trading 
practices at the bot and the chicago mercantile exchange no 
indictments have yet been announced as a result of the ongoing 
investigation in which fbi agents have posed as traders to look 
into allegations of prearranged trades and other illegal practices 
the timing obviously has some ties to the investigation 
said a board of trade official who asked not to be identified but 
they board of trade directors have been making changes to improve 
the system since it went in three years ago 
crowley said most of the measures involve changes in the 
timereporting system 
traders record trades within 30minute windows on cards that are 
collected at 1030 am cst and again at the close of business in 
each trading pit 
the new measures would double the number of windows make them 
15minute sessions and require collection of traders cards hourly 
finally the clocks of all brokerage houses operating at the 
exchange would be sychronized with the board of trades floor clock 
ensuring greater uniformity in timestamping trades 
in another development both the board of trade and the merc have 
asked member traders not to respond to a wall street journal survey 
requesting opinions on the federal probe 
merc officials sent out a fivepage letter urging members to 
beware of the deviously phrased survey the letter also cites 
defects in 10 of the surveys 12 questions that merc officials 
said are calculated to produce a distorted story 
board of trade officials meanwhile told members that any survey 
responses may undermine our efforts to reinforce investor 
confidence in the integrity of our markets 
the survey asked traders for their opinions on fbi tactics on 
whether there was cheating at the exchanges and to what extent and 
the effectiveness of internal disciplinary actions 
a spokesman for dow jones amp co publisher of the journal called 
the survey a standard reporting technique

chrysler corps delay in mailing settlement 
checks in a disconnected odometer case has cost the automaker loyal 
customers some consumers said 
the automaker negotiated the settlement with officials in 45 
states more than 14 months ago the agreement came after a federal 
grand jury charged two company employees with conspiring to sell 
more than 60000 vehicles whose odometers were disconnected while 
they were driven by chrysler officials 
consumers who bought the vehicles were supposed to receive 500 
each but the checks never went in the mail 
if they had sent me the 500 i probably would have gone right 
out and bought another chrysler doris smith of grosse pointe 
said but my husband went out and bought a sterling and it runs 
like a dream they lost a longtime customer 
many consumers say they havent even received a claim form that 
they were told last august would be mailed to them shortly 
thereafter the detroit free press said friday 
shortly thereafter in court terms can mean anywhere from one 
to two years said marcia darlingaud a court employee at us 
district court in st louis 
the biggest problem at the moment is identifying all those 
entitled to receive the settlement checks darlingaud said 
she added the money is sitting in a st louis bank collecting 
interest that means the eventual settlement may be more than 500 
chrysler spokeswoman karen stewart said

wheat oats and soybean futures prices closed 
lower friday on the chicago board of trade but corn finished mixed 
in response to a lowerthanexpected forecast for argentine corn 
production 
in a day of subdued trading most of the selling was attributed 
to preweekend profittaking after thursdays steep rally in the 
soybean market which raised prices to a 4week high 
crop futures also were pressured by reports of widespread 
precipitation in the midwest and the plains and by forecasts for 
more snow and rain during the weekend 
the precipitation will help recharge soil parched by last 
summers drought and provide protective snow cover for some of the 
winter wheat crop 
support for the corn market stemmed from the argentine national 
grain boards estimate thursday of a 477 millionmetricton corn 
harvest this spring 
the estimate compares with last years harvest of 888 million 
metric tons the crop suffered heavy drought damage effectively 
eliminating argentina as a major corn exporter during the 198990 
crop year 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 432 a bushel corn was 1 cent 
lower to 2 cents higher with march at 278 a bushel oats were 2 
cents to 4 cents lower with march at 205 a bushel soybeans were 
cent to 7 cents lower with march at 767 a bushel

the anxiety of passengers and eastern airlines 
employees was evident friday at eastern terminals and in the air as 
the midnight deadline loomed for a strike against the ailing carrier 
operations seemed to be running normally at easterns terminal at 
laguardia airport in new york and there was no evidence of 
additional police presence friday morning 
but bitter employees were vocal about eastern management and 
pessimistic about the prospects for a lastminute settlement of the 
dispute between eastern and its machinists union 
theres tremendous anger at frank lorenzo the chairman of 
easterns parent texas air corp said a male flight attendant 
onboard an early morning run from new york to miami 
i would rather see the airline burn to the ground than have 
it continue under current management said the employee from queens 
ny who has worked for eastern for 11 years 
the new yorkmiami flight which had been overbooked was delayed 
nearly an hour while flight attendants offered free roundtrip 
tickets on eastern to passengers willing to give up their seats 
there were few takers but precious minutes went by as the gamblers 
left the aircraft and seats were found for the passengers replacing 
them 
at the terminal floridabound passengers worried about getting 
back to new york quizzed ticket agents some of whom at least 
seemed to be making an extra effort to be courteous and upbeat the 
checkin lines were fairly long but orderly and fastmoving 
lorenzo is in a class by himself said one agent who 
reported she had been besieged by questions from passengers she 
expressed optimism though that an 11thhour settlement could be 
reached to avert a strike as happened in 1986 when former eastern 
chairman frank borman sold the airline to lorenzo 
some passengers joked about the hardship of not being able to get 
back to new york when temperatures in florida were running at around 
80 degrees 
but others were anxious 
a young woman on the new yorkmiami flight due to take another 
eastern flight from miami to san juan puerto rico on saturday was 
worried that she and the 190member tour group she was escorting 
wouldnt make it 
if the pilots go on strike with the eastern machinists this 
airline is finished she said id hate to see another american 
company go under i would rather see their prices go up than a 
company go under 
an eastern pilot riding jump seat on the flight not working 
but transiting to his next assignment insisted that a machinists 
strike against eastern cant be effective without the support of the 
pilots the pilots union at eastern has balloted its members but 
the results havent yet been announced 
i dont think eastern management has run the airline very 
well the 10year pilot said

president bush decided today to stay out of the 
threatened eastern airlines strike rejecting a national mediation 
board recommendation and leaving the problem to company and 
machinists union negotiators who face a midnight deadline 
bush refused to use his authority under provisions of the railway 
labor act to appoint a presidential review panel to investigate the 
labor strife a step that would have automatically delayed a strike 
for 60 days 
i have decided not to accept this recommendation bush said 
in a statement released at midafternoon by the white house press 
office 
the national mediation board has for many months attempted 
unsuccessfully to bring the parties to an agreement bush said 
and i have no reason to believe that an additional investigation 
or the 60day delay that would be entailed would produce such an 
agreement 
in light of the wellpublicized threats of a strike and related 
activities he said the transportation department will monitor 
the situation and will in addition take whatever steps are needed 
to protect the safety of the traveling public 
i urge responsible labor officials not to try to influence 
resolution of this dispute by disrupting the nations transportation 
system through secondary boycotts against uninvolved parties bush 
said such boycotts would unfairly burden millions of citizens 
not only affecting necessary travel but also affecting shipments of 
consumer goods and the ability of workers to earn a living 
bush noted that secondary boycotts are not permitted in other 
areas of the economy he said that if the eastern airlines dispute 
threatens to disrupt essential transportation services he will ask 
congress to pass legislation making it unlawful to use secondary 
picketing and boycotts against neutral carriers 
we cannot allow an isolated labormanagement dispute to disrupt 
the nations transportation system the president said 
eastern meanwhile sent its machinists home this morning citing 
significant amounts of vandalism and saying the action was 
intended to prevent sabotage in the hours before the strike 
deadline a federal court order allowed the action 
federal mediators who were meeting with the negotiators at an 
undisclosed washington location said the eastern offer thursday 
brought hope of a settlement in the 17monthold dispute 
they likely will meet pretty much all day said national 
mediation board spokesman david bushnell i expect it will go 
right up to the deadline if necessary 
easterns chief operating officer in miami joe leonard said 
machinists were given a paid holiday and told to return to work for 
shifts starting at 1201 am est saturday after the strike 
deadline 
this is not a lockout and is not an attempt to affect the 
bargaining leonard said at a news conference he said management 
personnel would handle maintenance and other ground duties for the 
rest of the day 
eastern pilots rejecting an unusual videotaped offer by airline 
owner frank lorenzo in separate contract negotiations said thursday 
they would refuse to cross machinist picket lines 
other unions also pledged support in a plan to block work at 
other airlines railways and sea transport companies if a strike is 
called by the 8500member eastern local of the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers 
a federal judge in minnesota ordered against any sympathy strike 
at northwest airlines but the union was seeking orders in another 
federal court here to allow such action 
bush met in the oval office for more than a halfhour with labor 
secretary elizabeth dole and transportation secretary samuel skinner 
the airline wanted bush to stay out of it saying it is losing 1 
million a day and cant afford the delay eastern owned by texas 
air corp has pledged to keep operating if the machinists strike 
the aflcio and 33 senators led by sen edward kennedy dmass 
had asked bush to act 
aflcio president lane kirkland said other union members should 
honor the eastern pickets wherever they are legally set up 
kirkland accused lorenzo who bought texas air in 1986 of 
finding it worth his while to purchase a good company and strip 
its assets rather than operate it fairly and decently the union 
accuses lorenzo of planning to sell off eastern assets or transfer 
them to nonunion continental airlines also owned by texas air 
kirkland asked after the eastern offer what the chances of a 
strike would be if bush did not act said about a 100 percent 
chance 
kirkland and other union leaders at a news conference said they 
doubted there would be any settlement because they believe lorenzo 
wants to dismantle the airline which they said is worth about 500 
million 
the senators letter signed by 31 democrats and gop sens 
alfonse damato of new york and arlen specter of pennsylvania said 
60 us cities in 27 states depend on eastern for passenger and 
freight service 
any interruption in this service will result in a major 
disruption of interstate commerce the letter said eastern flies 
about 100000 people a day with an average of 1040 daily flights 
it has 250 airliners 
the letter noted that no president has refused to act on a 
mediation board recommendation to call a special panel in an airline 
dispute 
other airlines contend their workers would be violating nostrike 
clauses in their contracts if they honored picket lines set up by 
eastern strikers 
on thursday us district judge paul magnuson in st paul 
granted a temporary restraining order to prevent northwests 
21000member machinist union from staging a sympathy strike the 
judge said the order is in the best interest of the public to 
avoid disrupting flights 
union lawyers were asking us district judge john h pratt in 
washington to stop the airlines including northwest from blocking 
picketing of other companies which it says is allowed in a 1987 
supreme court decision affecting transportation companies 
carol perkins spokeswoman for the association of american 
railroads said the group was calling on congress to outlaw such 
secondary picketing 
w graham claytor jr president of amtrak said the commuter 
railroad would continue limited operations in the event of a 
sympathy walkout in the face of eastern picketing but only for a 
day or two if there is no picketing and eastern air service 
stops the railroad would add trains he said 
easterns machinists said the new company offer was an 
improvement but still called for pay cuts rather than pay increases 
eastern originally wanted to cut salaries and get other 
concessions from the union totaling 150 million the union wanted 
50 million in raises 
the company is still looking for major concessions but its 
not 150 million said union official wally haber in miami after 
the new offer 
eastern said the contract would reduce mechanics pay but still 
keep their salaries 13 percent higher than employees who took a 20 
percent pay cut when lorenzo took over the company in 1986 it said 
baggage handlers cuts would be no greater than those of other 
employees

energy futures prices declined in volatile 
trading friday with crude oil soaring toward the 19abarrel level 
before settling lower in a wave of technical selling 
refined petroleum products also lost ground 
it was a volatile day said peter beutel an energy analyst 
with elders futures inc 
beutel said prices started out weak following reports that 
production among the organization of petroleum exporting countries

intensifying the battle to take over prime computer 
inc mai basic four inc said friday it will wage a proxy fight for 
control of primes board of directors at the may 12 annual meeting 
mai basic announced a slate of nominees for the election which 
will fill all seven seats on the board by a majority vote of the 
stockholders represented at the meeting 
prime spokesman joseph gavaghan said the announcement was not 
unanticipated and that prime will urge shareholders to retain the 
current board 
mai basic a computer firm based in tustin calif launched a 
20pershare hostile bid for prime in midnovember the offer is 
valued at 970 million 
in a prepared statement mai basic said its slate of directors 
would be committed to selling prime a manufacturer of minicomputers 
and computeraided design and manufacturing systems 
prime which has headquarters in natick mass issued a response 
saying mai basics bid continues to be highly conditional 
unfinanced and extremely leveraged and that the price does not 
reflect the intrinsic value of prime 
mai basics takeover offer has been enjoined since dec 9 when a 
us district court judge in boston ruled that mai basic had not 
disclosed sufficient information about its financing arrangements 
with drexel burnham lambert inc 
mai basic has appealed the injunction to the us court of 
appeals 
bennett s lebow chairman of mai basic said in a prepared 
statement that it would seriously consider raising its 
20pershare allcash offer for all outstanding shares of prime in 
the context of a negotiated transaction in which mai basic four is 
provided information by prime that demonstrates that such an 
increase is warranted

ep bud johnson shakes his head 
when he looks at all the mature douglas fir timber standing on 
federal lands in the northwest and thinks about how little he can 
saw down 
there have been years when we had fires or weather problems 
but nothing that has the longrange effect this has said johnson 
president of campd lumber co in riddle ore and the fourth 
generation of his family in the lumber business theres a 
tremendous resource out here its a shame we arent using it more 
completely 
johnson likes to have two years worth of timber under contract 
but can get only seven to eight months worth 
the people who run the lumber and plywood mills throughout the 
northwest are facing a problem that just a few years ago seemed 
impossible they are running out of trees to cut at a time when 
demand is high 
business will probably be reasonably decent for those who can 
get timber said eugene ore timber consultant paul f ehinger 
what you are looking at is bankruptcies in the middle of 
prosperity because there is a good demand 
while a portland state university study blames increased 
productivity for more than half the timber jobs lost from 1976 to 
1986 ehinger blames timber supply for the closure of 22 sawmills 
and 16 plywood mills in oregon and washington since the start of 
1988 
the simple fact is there is no timber around to run these 
mills he said there are a lot of them on shaky ground today 
the squeeze is partly the result of an environmentalist battle to 
save the last of the oldgrowth forests a lag in the reforestation 
of private lands and greater demand for raw logs overseas 
as a result average prices bid for douglas fir on national 
forests rose from 15633 per thousand board feet in 1986 to 24804 
in 1988 
in the past private forests owned by big timber companies 
accounted for the bulk of northwest timber they had first pick when 
the land was up for grabs in the early 1900s and the leftovers went 
to the national forests 
the private lands largely have been cut over and reseeded but 
the next generation of trees wont be ready for 20 to 50 years that 
focuses attention on public lands particularly national forests 
where the best of the mature timber now stands 
there are big clouds on the horizon and its starting to 
rain said jay goldstein spokesman for the washington forest 
protection association in olympia wash 
as more and more federal lands are set aside for spotted owls 
and other types of wildlife and recreation areas the land available 
for perpetual commercial timber management decreases 
the national forests in washington and oregon turned out 31 
percent of the regions 152 billion board feet of raw timber in 
1987 
they are about to release management plans for the next 10 years 
and the outlook is for less timber as they struggle to juggle the 
demands of their multipleuse mandate 
the 1980s management plan allowed the annual harvest of up to 55 
billion board feet the new plan will allow 47 billion board feet 
said ron johnson a senior forest service administrator for the 
northwest 
with more land reserved for wilderness and scenery and foresters 
getting a better idea of where trees grow best the commercial 
timber lands have shrunk from 17 million acres in 1978 to 145 
million acres under the latest plans 
we always had this thing of go west young man said 
johnson now we find theres a pacific ocean and we fell into it 
what you see is what youve got and everybody is scrambling to 
get their piece of that 
oregons state forester james brown predicts overall timber 
supply will decline 10 percent by the year 2010 ehinger foresees a 
20 percent drop 
from the environmentalists point of view the shrinking timber 
harvest is good both for the forest and the northwest economy 
our timber industry has been scaled back to the ability of the 
land to produce in the long term said andy kerr of the oregon 
natural resources council

the securities and exchange commission approved 
rule changes thursday designed to give investors faster notice when 
corporate auditors turn up fraud or other irregularities 
under the previous rules a company had up to 15 days to report 
the resignation of its auditor in a dispute and an additional 30 
days after that to make public a letter from the auditor outlining 
the disagreement 
the new rule approved on a 40 vote requires companies to 
report the resignation of an auditor within five days and to file 
the auditors letter with the sec within 10 days thus tightening up 
the disclosure period from 45 days to 15 days 
the changes come more than a year after members of the house 
energy and commerce committee complained about the rule during a 
january 1988 hearing on the notorious zzzz best fraud case 
barry minkow a teenage california financial wizard parlayed a 
rugcleaning business based in his parents garage into a 
multimilliondollar publicly traded corporation 
zzzz bests independent auditor ernst amp whinney discovered 
irregularities and resigned on june 2 1986 but the firms 
suspicions werent made public until july 16 1986 in the meantime 
unwitting investors continued to buy zzzz best stock which became 
worthless 
rep ron wyden dore had been pressing for even faster 
disclosure of irregularities turned up by accountants by requiring 
the accountants to go directly to the sec with their suspicions 
but sec chairman david s ruder told wyden at a hearing last 
year the commission lacked the power to require reports directly 
from auditors ruder said he would support a change in the law 
giving the commission that power 
the commission plans to publish its new rules within several 
weeks they would become effective 30 days after that 
sec member edward fleischman expressed concern that the tightened 
deadline would create a burden on firms but the sec staff said 
there had been only about a half dozen cases within the past six 
months that would have been affected

coniston partners said friday it was dropping a 
key condition from its 14 billion offer for tw services inc and 
said it planned to wage a proxy fight for seats on the food services 
companys board 
in a letter to tw services chairman frank l salizzoni coniston 
partner principal paul e tierney jr said his group was dropping a 
condition of its 29ashare offer that the tw board approve the 
proposed merger 
the revision came a day after a chancery court judge in delaware 
refused to void tw services poisonpill antitakeover defense 
another coniston principal augustus k oliver said the court 
acted partly because of the merger approval condition he said by 
dropping that provision coniston can return to court on the poison 
pill issue 
he said coniston hoped for a speedy response to the revised offer 
from tw services 
in a statement tw services said we acknowledge receipt of the 
amended offer and the board of directors will respond in due 
course 
in the letter tierney said that in the event that tw services 
fails to respond expeditiously to negotiate in good faith with us 
or to conduct a full and fair auction of the company we intend to 
renew our motion to redeem the poison pill in chancery court 
under the poison pill tw services shareholders would be allowed 
to purchase additional stock in the company at a steep discount in 
the event of a hostile takeover with more stock outstanding the 
cost of acquiring the company would rise sharply 
tierney also said in his letter that his group intends to file 
all preliminary documents necessary to begin the process of having 
its nominess elected to the tw services board 
jim ryan a spokesman for tw services said three seats are up 
for election at the companys april 26 meeting the board currently 
has 11 members 
coniston launched a tender offer for tw services last october it 
already owns about about 19 percent of tw services 485 million 
shares 
tw services owns 1200 dennys restaurants and 400 hardees 
restaurants among other properties

the citys affirmative actionminority enterprise 
program was overturned thursday by the state supreme court which 
said officials failed to produce enough evidence of past 
discrimination to justify it 
the court also unanimously found that the minorityfemale 
business enterprise program begun in 1975 was too broadly drawn 
and failed to consider alternatives to a yearly minority 
participation goal in city contracting 
the program sets a goal of 35 percent of city contract dollars go 
to minorities city officials declined comment on the ruling and its 
implications for the program one of the nations most recognized 
and most emulated 
it is apparent the city had available to it less intrusive 
means of accomplishing the mfbes raceconscious purposes but had 
not fully explored those justice willis b hunt jr wrote for the 
sevenmember court 
it was not immediately clear whether the ruling on behalf of the 
american subcontractors association effectively dismantles the 
program 
city attorney marva brooks said an appeal is unlikely but she 
said unspecified steps would be taken to save the minority program 
mayor andrew young scheduled a news conference for noon friday to 
discuss the ruling 
rodney k strong the citys contract compliance director said 
he expected that the city would declare a bidding moratorium for a 
few months on all city contracts except for emergency situations 
while a new program is developed 
among those pleased with the ruling was william o miller 
president of the southeastern legal foundation an atlantabased 
publicinterest center that joined the lawsuit against the city 
this means city contracts in the future must be let on a truly 
competitive basis with no entrepreneur black or white receiving 
preference miller said 
atlantas program has grown steadily since it was created in 1975 
by thenmayor maynard jackson some consider it one of the nations 
most wellmonitored and carefully designed programs of its type 
the city could appeal to the us supreme court but in january 
the nations highest court overturned a similar program in richmond 
va still atlanta officials hoped their program would survive 
i think there are a number of differences between our case and 
the richmond case mayor andrew young said in january its the 
difference between a law based on the spirit of fairness and a law 
that seems to mandate minority setasides 
last year the city of atlanta awarded 294 million to 
minorityowned and operated companies 367 percent of all city 
contracting business more than 300 million in city business has 
gone to minority companies since the 35 percent minority 
participation goal was established in 1975 
fulton and dekalb counties have goals of 20 percent minority 
participation in country contracts their programs were not affected 
by the ruling thursday

president carlos andres perez on friday 
blamed rioting that killed 300 people on the crushing burden of 
foreign debt and said venezuela can keep making loan payments only 
if his austerity program succeeds 
venezuela owes foreign creditors 33 billion on friday 
president bush announced he would provide the country with a 450 
million loan to help the struggling south american nation meet its 
shortterm financial needs 
perez told reporters that the four days of disturbances caused by 
price increases could occur in other latin american countries 
the crisis latin american nations are undergoing has a name 
written with capital letters foreign debt he said at a news 
conference 
perez also bitterly criticized industrialized nations for giving 
little or no help to support democratic governments 
spain announced friday it would send a 50 million loan to help 
venezuela recover from the rioting the unrest was caused by 
governmentimposed bus fare increases which appeared to release 
pentup frustration over its austerity program 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
bush called perez on friday to express concern and support for 
perezs courageous and determined efforts to address his countrys 
economic and financial situation 
later us officials disclosed that bush was making the 450 
million loan to help ease the financial crisis facing perez 
29dayold government 
perez confirmed that at least 300 people had been killed and 
2000 injured since monday he put the number of arrests at barely 
1000 
newspaper reports estimated the death toll at 300 to 400 and 
said more than 2000 had been arrested in caracas alone 
martial law remained in effect friday with a dusktodawn curfew 
forcing stores to restrict opening hours soliers patrolled caracas 
on foot and in armored cars and there was sporadic gunfire 
however the capital of 4 million people appeared to be returning 
to normal buses and subways ran regularly and downtown streets were 
crowded joggers were seen in parks early in the morning 
long lines still formed outside grocery stores but the 
government set up distribution centers to relieve food shortages 
perez linked the bloodiest civil unrest in venezuelas history to 
the burden of foreign debt and said it was jeopardizing a new wave 
of democracy sweeping latin american 
he accused industrialized nations of inflexibility in demanding 
repayment of the regions 420 billion foreign debt without regard 
to a nations ability to pay 
i hope this painful sacrifice by our country will serve for the 
leaders of the industrial powers to reflect that we are not 
exaggerating when we say the crisis is serious he said 
perez said whether venezuela can continue to make principal and 
interest payments on its 33 billion foreign debt depends on the 
success of his austerity program 
in a questionandanswer session with reporters perez appeared 
to indicate that venezuela had already suspended the debt payments 
however a senior venezuelan official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said later that there was an honest difference of 
opinion over interpretation of perez remarks and stressed that 
venezuela would continue to make the payments at least until the end 
of the month edgard a leal the countrys chief debt negotiator 
also said venezuela would continue to make payments 
perez who came to office just one month ago was referring to 
economic austerity measures required under an agreement with the 
international monetary fund in exchange for a 43 billion loan over 
the next three years 
earlier this week the government asked the international 
monetary fund to include provisions allowing venezuela to suspend 
all payments on its debt until september venezuela also asked for 
an additional 43 billion in loans from the institution in the next 
three years 
venezuelas austerity program includes price increases for a 
range of basic goods and services including bus fares food 
gasoline and electricity 
venezuela is one of the few developing nations that has been 
servicing foreign debt perez said complaining that western banks 
had not recognized the effort by granting new loans 
oilproducing venezuela has for decades been one of the 
wealthiest and politically stable nations in latin america but a 
continuing fall in world oil prices combined with debt payments 
has depleted monetary reserves creating the economic crisis 
real wages have since then fallen by a third since 1981 and 
inflation is expected to double this year to 70 percent 
perez said venezuela could expect six months of economic 
hardship but after that he said the economy will start to expand 
he said there was no immediate threat to venezuelan stability 
but warned that prolonged economic decline could undermine the 
foundations of democracy
