until june 2 sousuke uno was seen as a successful 
japanese politician who had probably reached the pinnacle of his 
career as foreign minister 
then he became his partys lastditch choice for prime minister 
and his world quickly crumbled amid a welter of accusations about 
his private life and a crushing defeat suffered by the party he 
reluctantly led 
on monday uno said he would resign to take responsibility for 
the liberal democratic partys defeat in elections for the upper 
house of parliament leaving his deeply troubled party in its 
second leadership crisis in two months 
uno 66 will remain in office until the party chooses a new 
leader which may take weeks it took more than six weeks before 
the liberal democrats finally chose him to take over from noboru 
takeshita 
uno was not the partys first choice for weeks its elders had 
tried to persuade the scandalfree masayoshi ito to become prime 
minister but ito refused 
uno was not a party leader or a previous contender for the 
premiership and his name was not mentioned until late in the 
chase but when he emerged as the choice it appeared the party had 
made a safe but not exciting choice of a competent caretaker 
the son of a wealthy sakebrewing family uno was untainted by 
the recruit bribery scandal that had ruled out all the partys 
elite he had served in a number of cabinet posts before becoming 
foreign minister and he had diplomatic skills to represent japan at 
the approaching summit in paris of the seven industrialized 
democracies 
but less than a week after he took office on june 2 published 
allegations that he kept a paid geisha mistress began to plague him 
the allegations about his private life he did not quite deny 
them saying instead he had done nothing immoral became another 
major problem the liberal democrats struggled with as crucial 
parliamentary elections approached 
the party had suffered a steep decline in popularity from the 
recruit scandal that embroiled its elite in suspicions of 
bribetaking it also was on the defensive over a new sales tax and 
agriculture policy 
although prime ministers usually are major campaigners to boost 
their partys hopes before an election uno made few public 
appearances in advance of sundays vote for half the seats in the 
upper house 
analysts predicted he would resign if the party did poorly it 
did losing its majority in the upper house and uno quickly 
followed by taking the traditional step of resigning to take 
responsibility 
his political epitaph may be the words he reportedly uttered on 
june 27 in a plea to party leaders to let him step down i didnt 
become prime minister because i wanted to

the search for victims of united 
airlines flight 232 ended saturday with the death toll tentatively 
set at 110 united meanwhile announced it is visually inspecting 
all engines in its dc10 fleet 
we feel comfortable enough that the search has been 
terminated for victims said gary brown spokesman for the 
woodbury county emergency services 
while officials were confident that all of the bodies had been 
recovered there still was disagreement on how many were killed 
when the dc10 jetliner cartwheeled and burned wednesday at the 
sioux gateway airport united said it was 110 and the national 
transportation safety board said it was 111 
but a ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said at a news briefing 
late saturday the agency was deferring to united that doesnt 
mean we agree united is the authority on this 
a list compiled by the associated press of names supplied by 
united airlines and family friends and employers of the victims 
had put the toll of dead and missing at 111 but two people listed 
with the same last name and slightly different first names were 
determined to be the same person 
a doctor at one of the hospitals treating the injured said more 
patients could die and that the survivors might have permanent 
injuries of the 296 people on board 186 survived 
at the news briefing saturday evening ntsb spokesman jim 
burnett said the parts of rear no 2 engine that disintegrated 
during a flight from denver to chicago were well within the limits 
of time in which they had to be replaced 
burnett also said investigators interviewed flight 232s second 
officer saturday flight engineer dudley dvorak dvorak told 
inspectors he reported complete loss of fluid in all three 
hydraulic lines after the rear engine blew apart leaving capt al 
c haynes without control of wings or tail surfaces 
in another development a united airlines official said at a 
news conference here that the airline has initiated a visual 
inspection of all engines in our dc10 fleet a prudent person 
would do some additional looking and we are 
james guyette executive vice president of operations for 
united said the inspections should be completed on monday 
so far they have uncovered very very minor flaws he said 
adding that dc10 airplanes in the united fleet are not being 
grounded during the check 
in chariton iowa meanwhile an amtrak train carrying survivors 
of the united flight struck and killed a 6yearold boy as the 
youngster tried to free his bicycle that was stuck on the tracks 
jason lee howie was struck by amtraks eastbound california 
zephyr after the train had picked up several crash survivors at 
omaha neb said amtrak spokesman art lloyd who added that he did 
not know how many survivors were on board 
in sioux city the wreckage of the widebody jet remained 
sprawled over the airport saturday as ntsb crews sifted wreckage 
for clues to what caused the tail engine to disintegrate in flight 
ntsb spokesman burnett said four cranes were moved in to steady 
a giant hunk of fuselage in the cornfield next to the runway 
inspectors were able to determine that no bodies were underneath 
he said 
so far the airline has positively identified 19 dead and 
tentatively identified 29 and hopes to have 80 percent of the 
bodies positively identified by sunday guyette said great care 
has to be exercised to make sure a mistake is not made he said 
fortyfive people were still hospitalized saturday nineteen 
including four in critical condition were at st lukes medical 
center and 26 including five listed as critical were at the 
marian health center marian confirmed that one patient had died 
there overnight but would not give a name 
dr larry foster medical director for the burn unit at st 
lukes said they have 10 patients in the unit who have burns from 
2 percent to 93 percent of their bodies most suffered burns on 
face and extremities 
all four members of the flight crew including one offduty 
pilot who left his seat in the cabin and to help in the effort to 
control the plane were being treated at marian their injuries 
were not critical according to spokeswoman jennifer denning 
brown said there was no need to look for other victims at the 
airport the numbers match the numbers balance he said 
dr mike wolpert director of trauma services at marian said 
the five patients in critical condition are still in danger 
theyre not stable by any means he said 
there are a lot of broken necks and broken backs some of them 
might be permanently disabled some of them have definite brain 
swelling now but its going to be quite a while before we know if 
that damage is going to be permanent 
he said patients listed in serious or guarded condition have 
multiple fractures but are not in lifethreatening condition a 
large number of them he said have ankle injuries 
the airport is open but large pieces of the doomed jet are 
strewn over the area still in a cornfield is the large piece of 
the fuselage from which survivors were able to crawl to safety and 
the charred remains of the tail section which flipped over the 
other wreckage as the plane broke up 
theres a lot of documentation left to be done said ntsb 
spokesman ted lopatkiewicz declining to predict when investigators 
would leave the scene it takes a long time to document an 
aircraft as big as this 
the drama of the final moments in the cockpit was detailed 
friday as burnett said the offduty pilot hearing the explosion in 
engine no 2 bolted to the cockpit to see if he could help 
burnett said the offduty pilot identified as dennis fitch 
found the airplane nearly unmanageable since the tail engine 
apparently threw wreckage through the airplanes hydraulic systems 
without control of wings or tail surfaces the pilots only 
recourse was to crudely steer the plane by varying the thrust of 
the two remaining engines 
the only control mechanism that the crew had was to use engine 
thrust burnett said the offduty pilot was on his knees 
manipulating the throttle 
what you have here is a situation of two men desperately 
trying to get whatever control they can out of the aircraft he 
said 
seven minutes before he attempted an emergency landing at sioux 
gateway airport pilot al c haynes told the control tower 
whatever you do keep us away from the city burnett quoted 
haynes as telling investigators during two onehour interviews on 
friday the airport is about seven miles from downtown 
the crew also found that the airplane would only turn right 
further hindering efforts to line up with a runway

dante caputo president of the 
un general assembly on saturday denied charges he misused public 
funds while serving as argentinas foreign minister from late 1983 
until four months ago 
on friday the foreign ministry filed charges in criminal court 
alleging caputo failed to adequately explain how he spent nearly 
190000 of the 538200 he received for personal expenses while he 
was foreign minister the ministry accused him of misappropriating 
public funds 
if there is a charge the justice department should 
investigate to see what it is about caputo said saturday in a 
radio interview 
the case against caputo involves the apparent use of the same 
stamp on receipts allegedly received in new york cyprus and 
stockholm sweden the stamp was found at the foreign ministry a 
source there said along with blank copies of hotel stationery 
a ministry official was arrested in connection with the case 
police confirmed saturday he was not identified nor were the 
charges disclosed 
in an interview with radio el mundo caputo said i dont know 
anything about the contents of the charges about his alleged 
involvement he said the only thing i do with such funds is sign 
a receipt and after that i dont worry about the topic 
the complaint filed by the foreign ministry stated in part 
dante mario caputo acted as though it is up to the government 
to justify the courtesy expenses that he says were made in new 
york stockholm and cyprus presenting papers that were stamped as 
paid with one and the same stamp 
documents appear that do not meet the mimimal appearance 
of seriousness the complaint stated caputo personally received 
538200 for expenses it said and he has the legal obligation 
to account for it

a csx transportation inc freight train 
derailed saturday igniting a fire in a tank car loaded with toxic 
chemicals and in at least one house officials said more than 400 
people were evacuated 
at least seven people were evaluated at hospitals apparently 
because of problems caused by fume inhalation said saginaw county 
spokesman tom caylor they appear to be ok at this time he 
said 
fourteen of 37 cars on the csx transportation inc train 
derailed seven were empty and seven were chemical tank cars said 
csx spokesman ripley watson officials initially believed at least 
two cars were afire but later determined only one caught fire and 
was still burning 
a 1squaremile evacuation area around the derailment site was 
broadened to 10 miles forcing more than 400 people from their 
homes caylor said state police sgt thomas mynsberge said the 
evacuation order could remain in effect for two days 
an order to evacuate the southeast corner of midland was 
canceled late saturday and those residents were told to stay 
inside close their windows and turn off ventilation systems in 
their homes said midland fire chief leo gay fumes from the fire 
are drifting into more populated areas beeson said 
earlier a plume of black smoke rose from the burning cars said 
dow spokesman gary black winds were calm after the derailment just 
before noon 
at least one house was burning black said but the extent of 
damage wasnt known 
it was not clear if the house and the train car were burning in 
separate fires officials said after conducting aerial surveys 
heavy smoke and intense heat prevented firefighters from getting 
closer 
five tank cars were carrying acrylonitrile and styrene both 
used in the manufacture of rubber acrylic acid naphtha and 
chlorosilenes a product of dow corning co a joint venture 
between dow and corning glass works that produces silicon products

a top career diplomat suspected of 
collaborating with soviet agents in vienna had access to some of 
the nations most sensitive nonnuclear secrets and once ran the 
us embassy in that espionagerich city before he was sent home 
for insubordination sources said saturday 
meanwhile felix s bloch former deputy chief of mission at the 
embassy in austria has received fbi approval to leave his 
washington luxury apartment but the surveillance of bloch 
continues at a new unspecified location abc news reported 
saturday 
bloch who has not been charged with any crime is the 
highestranking us diplomat ever identified as the target of an 
intelligence investigation involving the soviet union 
the government is keeping close tabs on bloch so he wont flee 
but abc said that federal officials also are concerned that he 
might try to hurt himself 
bloch was last seen by fellow residents of his apartment 
building on thursday since then they say a heavy contingent of 
government agents whose surveillance of bloch had been obvious to 
his neighbors for weeks apparently has departed as well 
the fbi declined comment saturday about the status of its 
investigation which was brought to light the previous night by an 
abc news report which said he had been videotaped passing a 
briefcase to a soviet kgb agent in vienna 
that incident according to sources who declined to be 
identified occurred early this year more than a year after bloch 
was reassigned to a largely bureaucratic post in washington 
government sources told abc that once confronted with 
allegations of his spying bloch fell apart emotionally 
the report said bloch has been interrogated two times and 
claimed he would cooperate but one government analyst told the 
television network that blochs cooperation has been extremely 
limited 
a team of government psychologists abc said does not believe 
that bloch spied for money 
sources told abc that bloch claimed he spied because he fell 
into a soviet sex trap but investigators have discounted that story 
the los angeles times citing an anonymous us government 
official familiar with the case reported sunday that bloch was 
under suspicion of spying for a substantial period of time 
austrian foreign minister alois moch was quoted by the kurier 
newspaper in vienna as saying bloch apparently came under suspicion 
by us authorities in the 1970s the times noted 
the government has not charged bloch hoping that he will 
voluntarily tell investigators the extent of the information he 
provided to the east abc said 
in new york city former ambassador ronald s lauder a 
candidate for the republican nomination for mayor said saturday 
that he demanded in 1987 that bloch be recalled to washington 
because he went outside of channels he went around me in 
dealings with the austrian foreign ministry 
lauder said however that he had no indication that bloch an 
austrian native had been dealing with the soviets 
lauder a political appointee as ambassador who himself has been 
criticized for his service in vienna said he inherited bloch as 
his top deputy when he arrived at the embassy in april 1986 
bloch had been there for six years already and was in charge of 
the embassy during a lapse between the departure of helene von damm 
and lauders confirmation lauder said a congressional source 
meanwhile speculated that bloch was the effective daytoday chief 
of the embassy throughout the time that ms von damm also a 
political appointee and widely criticized as a social butterfly 
was there 
lauder said he grew increasingly dissatisfied with bloch over 
insubordination and demanded that he be recalled in july 1987 
the state department complied within a matter of days or weeks 
he said 
lauder said he knew nothing of the current investigation before 
hearing news reports friday he said he has since spoken with the 
state department about the case but declined elaboration 
i thought he was a poor member of the staff so i got rid of 
him if i thought he was a spy i would have had him arrested 
lauder said 
lauder said bloch did have access to a great deal of 
classified information and that he could do severe damage but 
at this point we do not know whether that has occurred 
it could have potential impact a great deal of impact on the 
united states lauder continued he had a great deal of 
access

japans governing liberal democratic party conceded 
defeat in parliamentary elections sunday after projections 
indicated it had lost its upper house majority for the first time 
in more than three decades 
this is a big defeat the conservative partys secretary 
general ryutaro hashimoto said in a televised interview i am 
very sorry 
a major loss for the liberal democrats would increase pressure 
for a general election and for a change of leadership in the 
scandalplagued party 
the japan broadcasting corp and kyodo news service said their 
projections indicated the liberal democrats were certain to lose 
their majority in the house of councillors the upper house of 
japans twochamber parliament voters were deciding half of the 
houses 252 seats in sundays balloting 
final official results were not expected until monday evening 
a heavy turnout by japans 903 eligible voters reflected strong 
feelings over a new sales tax an unpopular farm policy and stock 
and sex scandals that have eroded the popularity of the governing 
party according to opinion polls 
the situation is extremely severe hashimoto said in an 
earlier interview sunday though the final results are not in 
yet it appears our old pattern is not working 
takako doi chairwoman of the main opposition japan socialist 
party which was leading in the projections told reporters this 
is the result of the peoples choice 
by late sunday night the japan broadcasting corp projected the 
results for 88 of the 126 seats being contested in the house of 
councillors 
it said 25 would go to the liberal democrats 34 to the leftist 
socialists six to the centrist clean government party two each to 
the communists and the conservative social democrats eight to 
independents and 11 to minor parties 
kyodo news service gave similar projections and both the news 
service and the japan broadcasting corp predicted that the liberal 
democrats would not win the 54 seats they needed to maintain a 
simple majority in the upper chamber 
although the socialists were doing well in the projections a 
majority in the upper house will remain out of their reach because 
they would need to win 84 seats and they ran only 54 candidates in 
the election 
the liberal democrats went into the election with 142 seats 
compared to 43 for the socialists and 23 for the clean government 
party a political party needs 127 seats for a simply majority in 
the house of councillors and 139 seats to control all 16 permanent 
standing committees in the house 
the socialists have led efforts to create an opposition 
coalition with the clean government party the democratic 
socialists and the leftist socialist democratic federation which 
now has no seats in the upper chamber 
if the liberal democrats lose control of the upper house they 
will find it harder to pass legislation but the party holds 293 of 
the 512 seats in the more powerful lower house where elections 
need not be called until july 1990 
the liberal democrats have produced all of japans prime 
ministers since it was formed in 1955 but a poor showing by prime 
minister sousuke unos liberal democrats could increase pressure on 
uno in office less than two months to resign and lead to early 
elections for the lower house of parliament a liberal democratic 
loss there could bring japan a socialistled government since the 
lower house elects the prime minister 
the liberal democrats who represent conservative interests in 
japan have been hurt by a scandal centering around the recruit 
co a publishing conglomerate that was accused of doling out 
millions of dollars in underpriced stocks and political donations 
to obtain favors 
disclosures in the scandal led to the resignations of three 
cabinet ministers and prime minister noboru takeshita 
shortly after he succeeded takeshita june 2 reports began to 
appear that uno had kept paid geisha mistresses igniting criticism 
from womens groups 
the geisha scandal forced uno to keep a low profile during 
campaigning strengthening his image as a caretaker who will remain 
in office only until oct 31 when takeshitas term as party 
president would have expired 
farmers traditional supporters of unos party also revolted 
against its moves to open japans agricultural market wider to 
imports 
the socialists rallied voters against a new 3 percent sales tax 
that was heavily backed by the governing party 
the socialists putting forward a record number of women 
candidates took advantage of housewives anger over the tax which 
was bulldozed through parliament by the governing party last year 
despite an opposition boycott the tax part of a sweeping tax 
reform took effect april 1

archbishop desmond tutu on 
sunday accused the head of the governing national party of a 
crude attempt to create a split between the african national 
congress and its imprisoned leader nelson mandela 
tutu a black anglican active in the antiapartheid movement 
challenged an assertion by fw de klerk that the burden was on the 
anc to renounce its guerrilla campaign against the whiteled 
government as a precondition to negotiations 
de klerk expected to succeed pw botha as president after 
elections sept 6 said saturday the anc should follow the lead 
of mandela by committing itself to a peaceful settlement de klerk 
was referring to the meeting between botha and mandela earlier this 
month in which the two leaders expressed support for peaceful 
development in south africa 
de klerk has his history wrong tutu said in a statement 
our liberation movements have sought change peacefully since 
before 1910 it is his government which forced the anc and pac 
panafricanist congress to turn to violence by banning them and 
it his his government which must unban them and create conditions 
conducive to negotiations 
de klerks crude attempt to drive a wedge between mr mandela 
and the anc is deplorable and indicates he is not serious about 
negotiations tutu said 
mandela in a brief statement following his meeting with botha 
confirmed that he had endorsed peaceful development but 
stressed that no peaceful solution could be found unless the 
government negotiated with the anc and its allies in south africa 
the anc has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign in south 
africa since 1961 a year after it was outlawed mandela was jailed 
in 1962 he is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to 
overthrow the government 
the anc has rejected de klerks recent proposals for a fiveyear 
plan to give the disenfranchised black majority a formal voice in 
national politics without letting it impose its will on the white 
minority 
the national party is the overwhelming favorite to retain 
control in the white election sept 6 but a newspaper poll 
published sunday indicated that liberal and conservative opposition 
parties could do well enough to deprive the nationalists of an 
outright majority in parliament 
the poll commissioned by the nationally circulated sunday 
times said the national party would win 78 seats in parliament 
the farright conservative party 52 and the antiapartheid 
democratic party 36 if the election were held this week and there 
was an 80 percent turnout details about how the poll was conducted 
were not published 
a separate poll published sunday in the afrikaanslanguage 
newspaper rapport predicted the nationalists would win about 46 
percent of the vote the conservatives 25 percent and the 
democratic party about 29 percent

dissident fang lizhi is the guest who never comes 
to dinner he never appears at parties at the us embassy where 
he has lived since early june but somehow he manages to haunt them 
guests inevitably peer down halls and around corners in hopes of 
glimpsing the man whose invisible presence has helped bring 
uschinese relations to their lowest level since normalization in 
1979 
but even some highlevel embassy staff say they have never seen 
the short plump astrophysicist or his wife physics professor li 
shuxian who is in hiding with him 
the state department disclosed june 6 that the couple outspoken 
critics of chinas communist rulers had taken shelter in the 
embassy after the army moved in on prodemocracy protesters in 
beijing 
the chinese government issued arrest warrants for the pair 
accusing them of orchestrating the protests 
embassy officials refuse to say even which of the three walled 
embassy compounds houses the fangs 
they may live in comfort in a guest room at ambassador james 
lilleys home then again perhaps they are hidden from chinese 
staff in more secure but less homey quarters do they use the 
embassy pool at night when everyone has gone home do they watch 
cable news network television now banned elsewhere in beijing off 
the embassys satellite dish embassy staff only shrug 
most change the subject or walk away when someone mentions 
fangs name 
but now and then someone makes a joke as when counselor 
mckinney russell turned to a guest at the embassys independence 
day picnic and asked if he had met professor fang the guest took 
the bait and asked eagerly to be introduced fang of course did 
not attend 
fang probably would have enjoyed the picnic and the joke a 
friendly man with a puckish sense of humor he often laughs 
heartily during conversation 
but his calls for the allpowerful communist party to allow 
political debate and even formation of new parties are serious 
some people think china doesnt need democracy but i think 
human rights are basic for them to be realized first of all 
famous people must take a stand he said in february during a 
relative thaw that preceded the april start of the student movement 
fang gained fame internationally as chinas most articulate 
human rights spokesman but his initial renown at home came as 
chinas first physicist to specialize in black hole theory 
he became a hero to many intellectuals in 1987 when the 
communist party ousted him for making prodemocracy speeches it 
said helped incite student marches the party distributed copies of 
the speeches to be criticized during political study sessions but 
many readers secretly found themselves in agreement 
fang was not a frequent visitor at the us embassy however 
one embassy invitation caused an international stir to a banquet 
given by visiting president bush in february chinese police 
stopped fang en route and refused to let him attend 
the chinese government lodged a formal protest with the us 
embassy over that invitation and again when it gave shelter to 
fang and li 
but china mostly vented its ire in newspaper commentaries that 
branded fang a traitor and the scum of the nation and accused 
li of not having a real chinese heart 
newspapers accused the us embassy of violating international 
law by sheltering the couple the embassy was deluged with phone 
calls from chinese expressing their indignation 
an ambassador who lives near the main us embassy compound 
reportedly complained to the foreign ministry that chinese were 
standing outside shouting epithets at fang in the middle of the 
night 
chinese police who normally guard foreign embassies have 
multiplied outside the us facilities since fang and li took up 
residence and the officers now carry automatic pistols 
half a dozen uniformed and plainclothes police camp around the 
clock outside lilleys residence they sit on low stools drinking 
tea and playing cards and hang laundry from a small guard booth 
giving it the look of a squatter camp 
us security also has tightened the compound where the 
ambassador lives used to leave its gates open now they are locked 
and even americans must show their passports to enter 
the fangs options are limited they can leave the embassy and 
face arrest or stay inside as virtual prisoners the united states 
has said it would like to reach a compromise with china that would 
allow the couple to leave for a third country but china insists 
they are criminals who must be prosecuted 
neither side will say if talks are going on 
meanwhile one scientific research society has expelled fang 
and a city district peoples congress to which li was elected in 
1987 is discussing expelling her 
staff who answered the telephone at the beijing observatory 
where fang works said his name remains on the list of employees 
it is unlikely he will return to work there however as long as 
the current government is in power 
i am like a soldier who has already crossed the river theres 
no way to turn back fang said in an interview last year never 
has that been truer

all 106 opposition members in the lower 
house of parliament resigned sunday to protest prime minister rajiv 
gandhis refusal to step down over a controversial foreign arms 
deal 
the decision by the 12 opposition parties in the lok sabha the 
lawmaking branch of parliament was sparked by an auditors report 
citing inconsistencies in the 1986 purchase of 14 billion in 
swedish artillery guns 
opposition members and news reports allege officials received 
millions of dollars in kickbacks in return for securing the 
contract for the swedish company 
the move was not expected to have much effect on parliament 
since gandhis congress party commands a majority but opposition 
leaders said they hoped it would call attention to the arms deal 
and make it a major issue in the next election due by january 
never before has the office of the prime minister been brought 
into disrepute as under the present incumbent said vp singh 
leader of the janata dal peoples party we were all elected by 
the people and now we are going back to them for their verdict on 
this issue 
government officials contend the deal was sanctioned by singh 
who at that time served as finance minister in gandhis cabinet 
singh left the governing party in 1987 
the 12 opposition parties controlled 106 seats in the 544member 
lok sabha besides the janata dal they include the bharatiya 
janata party indian peoples party the telugu desam party of 
the telugus the two major communist parties and other regional 
groups 
the rest of the seats are controlled by gandhis congress party 
and independents 
after the auditors report was released tuesday opposition 
members in parliament shouted antigovernment slogans called 
gandhi a thief and demanded his resignation when he refused they 
walked out and stalled proceedings for three days 
the report said the arms purchase was flawed on technical 
considerations and cost assessment 
the arms purchase has been a major scandal for gandhis 
government because of allegations the swedish firm ab bofors paid 
kickbacks to secure the contract 
newspapers and opposition politicians say kickbacks amounting to 
at least 50 million were paid to senior government officials and 
to congress party coffers the allegations have never been proved 
opposition leaders have previously demanded gandhis resignation 
on the issue but the 44yearold prime minister has repeatedly 
said he was not involved in any wrongdoing 
a parliamentary committee that investigated the deal last year 
said there was no evidence kickbacks or commissions were paid to 
secure the sale 
opposition parties have been using the bofors issue to try to 
merge and mount a viable challenge to gandhi and the congress party 
in the general election their efforts have stalled in squabbling 
and widely publicized power struggles for nearly a year 
but nt rama rao leader of the telugu desam said the decision 
to resign from parliament proved the opposition could unite on 
major issues 
we are committed to give a clean government to the country 
he said

at least 100000 people in the united states 
now have aids 
some time in recent weeks nobody knows just when the report 
for the 100000th recorded case of aids in the united states became 
part of the data files at centers for disease control 
that case report joined hundreds of others flowing into cdc 
computers where it was combined with thousands of earlier reports 
to eventually become part of the cumulative number of us aids 
cases 
when the monthly total for july is compiled and released in late 
august cdc experts are sure that americas official count of total 
aids cases will for the first time officially pass 100000 
due to the backlog of reporting plus the fact that were 
retroactively going back and adding cases by the dozens we 
probably reached 100000 already said charles fallis a cdc 
spokesman 
but fallis who declined to arrange interviews with cdc 
epidemiology experts said theres really no way to tell which 
case is the 100000th case 
many experts including some at cdc have admitted that the aids 
case total is more of a rough estimate than a precise count 
but what the official total does emphasize is that there has 
been no retreat or slowing in the dreadful statistical march of 
aids the nightmare is following a script of disease illness and 
death that cdc epidemiology experts predicted in may 1988 
by 1992 the federal agency expects there will be a cumulative 
total of 365000 confirmed cases of aids the agency also predicts 
that within three years the total number of us residents killed 
by aids will reach 263000 a total almost five times higher than 
the total number of americans killed in the vietnam war 
but thats only part of the picture 
in order to be counted in the official cdc survey a patient 
must have a positive blood test for aids plus other symptoms such 
as opportunistic infections persistent loss of weight or 
chronically enlarged lymph nodes 
beyond these counted patients the cdc estimates that there are 
1 million to 15 million americans who are infected with the aids 
virus but have not yet developed symptoms these people are said to 
be seropositive they can spread the disease but are themselves 
not yet suffering its deadly effects 
fifty to sixty percent of people who are seropositive will 
develop at least some symptoms of aids within five years said 
fallis 
federal estimates of the cost of aids are staggering 
projections indicated that a total of 172000 aids patients 
will require medical care in 1992 at a cost expected to range from 
5 billion to 13 billion the cdc reported in may the agency 
said these figures are underestimates of the true magnitude of 
the medical costs of the aids virus because many clinical 
treatments for the disease are not reported 
patterns of aids infection are slowly changing 
whereas once aids was almost exclusively a disease of 
homosexuals the rate of discovered cases in that population group 
is slowing down in the 12 months ending june 30 homosexual and 
bisexual males represented 57 percent of the us aids cases this 
is a 2 percent drop from the previous 12 months 
fallis said experts believe this is because of changes in life 
style practices and because the population group is becoming 
saturated the number of uninfected members of this group is 
becoming too small to maintain the previous rate of new cases 
for intravenous drug users however the infection rate is 
rising for the 12 months ending june 30 23 percent of the total 
aids cases were among male and female iv drug users this is an 
increase of two percent from the previous 12 months 
aids is a contagious disease that destroys immune cells and 
renders the body unable to resist disease it is caused by the 
human immunodeficiency virus hiv which is spread most often 
through sexual intercourse with infected persons or through needles 
shared by intravenous drug users infection can also come from 
contaminated blood transfusions which is rare and babies can 
become infected from their mothers

as his struggle to rebuild the nations 
nuclear arms industry grows more urgent energy secretary james d 
watkins may be losing a grip on his most important tool public 
belief that the weapons plants can be made safe 
since he took office last march watkins and a team of senior 
department aides have been racing against time to fix decades of 
neglect in the weapons program before reactor breakdowns and other 
problems seriously undermine us defense strategy 
from the start watkins believed the key to success was 
convincing the public including workers at the plants and nearby 
residents that an era of nuclear secrecy was ended that their 
government could be trusted to run the plants safely 
to his dismay the cloud of mystery and distrust has only grown 
darker 
no significant accidents have been reported at any of the 17 
major weapons facilities in 12 states since watkins took over but 
some have been forced to close temporarily and a series of recent 
incidents has raised new health and safety questions 
in just the past week for example 
the energy departments own auditors issued a blistering 
review of management failures and predicted that unless urgent 
action is taken to correct the flaws watkins will face more 
pressure to close the plants it also said department employees may 
face criminal charges for violating environmental laws 
the fbi and the environmental protection agency dispatched 
agents to one of the weapons plants in ohio to investigate 
allegations of criminal violations of laws governing the handling 
storage and disposal of hazardous wastes 
the fbi disclosed that it is investigating allegations of 
financial fraud at the same ohio plant known as the feed materials 
production center near cincinnati 
the epa added seven major weapons facilities in new york 
california ohio tennessee south carolina and idaho to its list 
of the most polluted sites in the nation 
members of congress proposed legislation that would take away 
from watkins some responsibilities related to the weapons program 
including one measure that would transfer to the department of 
health and human services the authority to study and monitor the 
health effects of radiation on workers at the weapons plants and 
another that would empower an independent board to shut down any or 
all of the weapons plants on safety grounds 
more environmental groups called on watkins to withdraw his 
choice of victor stello the controversial operations chief of the 
nuclear regulatory commission to take over daytoday 
administration of the nuclear weapons program 
although the stello nomination has gained little public notice 
outside washington the basis of the opposition runs to the heart 
of watkins underlying dilemma 
secretary watkins has been conducting a public relations 
effort to convince the public that he is serious about 
environmental and safety problems at these facilities but actions 
like the nomination of victor stello just dont support his 
words said brian costner director of the energy research 
foundation a citizen group pushing for closure of the savannah 
river weapons plant in south carolina 
stellos critics contend he is not sensitive enough to health 
and safety issues 
watkins struggle to erase the impression that environmental and 
safety problems at the weapons plants are out of control is 
complicated by the pressure he faces to fashion a strategy for 
resuming nuclear materials production at savannah river and getting 
his waste management program off dead center 
public announcements of new waste control measures nuclear 
production schedules and a blueprint for reshaping the entire 
weapons complex are expected sometime in august 
the timing and success of watkins grand design is crucial 
the pentagon says it may have to cannibalize some warheads 
unless the savannah river nuclear reactors resume production of 
tritium soon watkins though sees risk in overhauling too quickly 
a program the general accounting office has called one of the 
more potentially dangerous industrial operations in the world 
now with some solutions apparently in sight watkins is being 
forced to fight rearguard skirmishes with the fbi and the epa 
whose surprise raids this summer on the rocky flats plutonium 
processing plant in colorado and the feed materials uranium plant 
in ohio have undercut watkins efforts to sooth public safety 
concerns 
henson moore the deputy energy secretary and other senior 
department officials have expressed dismay at the unwillingness of 
the fbi and the epa to coordinate their investigations with watkins 
what we dont need is this alarming people about health and 
safety risks by springing surprise raids that create the impression 
that the fbi thinks the energy department cant be trusted to 
monitor its own facilities moore said

just three years after he won the illinois

destitute and remorseful man his lawyer says the cash windfall 
ruined his clients life 
this is a horatio alger story in reverse a rags to riches to 
rags again attorney craig m kuhary said last week before his 
client was sentenced to three years in prison for writing bad 
checks 
in 1986 brownlee appeared ready to shed his past criminal 
record and drug abuse problem and take on a new life he applied 
for a job and pocketed 380565 in the illinois lottery 
but 80000 in charity donations some bad investments and a 
return to drugs and crime has left the 38yearold kenosha man 
virtually penniless and headed back to the familiar surroundings of 
a state prison 
i accept full responsibility for my unacceptable behavior i 
owe society a debt brownlee told circuit judge roger p murphy 
before he was sentenced friday to three years in prison and four 
years of probation 
brownlee was convicted in march on four felony counts and 
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge friday 
brownlee donated about 80000 of his winnings to charity 
according to court records but much of the rest was dissipated on 
drugs bad investments and unethical confidants 
when somebody dumps 380000 in your lap you forget what 
happened before that and start living in a fantasy world his

a higher education faculty shortage 
anticipated for the mid1990s has already arrived in fields from 
computing to health according to an annual survey of colleges and 
universities issued sunday 
half the institutions in the survey by the american council on 
education said it is taking them longer now to find qualified 
people for fulltime faculty positions than it was previously 
half also said they are having greater difficulty getting top 
applicants to accept positions when they are offered up from 25 
percent who gave that response in 1987 
elaine elkhawas an ace vice president and author of campus 
trends 1989 noted that some studies have projected shortages in 
the next decade but said her research indicates a more immediate 
problem 
the labor market for faculty is tightening right now she 
said the real dilemmas for colleges are going to be starting 
much sooner than 1995 
elkhawas said factors contributing to the problem include an 
inadequate number of doctorate holders an increasing number of 
phds going into private industry a greater proportion of 
doctoral degrees earned by foreigners accelerating retirement of 
faculty members and expanding student enrollment 
the sixth annual ace survey of senior academic administrators at 
366 institutions found that 40 percent are having trouble finding 
qualified people for fulltime positions in computer science one 
in three institutions reported similar problems in the business 
area mathematics and health professions each were cited by one in 
four schools 
half the administrators surveyed said they expect the pace of 
retirement among fulltime faculty to increase in the next few 
years at the same time half said the size of their fulltime 
faculty had grown in the last year and 71 percent said they had 
increased their overall enrollment 
elkhawas said the crunch may result in pressure for higher 
salaries in certain fields incentives to keep people from retiring 
and a highly competitive situation where universities are trying to 
entice faculty members away from each other 
class size may also be affected she said the 1989 survey 
indicates there may be an impact in that area already onethird of 
colleges and universities reported an increase in average class 
size up from 20 percent in the 1988 survey 
the physical condition of universities is also a pressing 
concern according to the survey only 32 percent of the 
administrators felt their physical plant was excellent or very 
good another third said plant renovation and renewal will be a key 
challenge in the next five years and more than half predicted their 
facilities will not be adequate to meet school needs over the next 
decade 
on another front eight in 10 institutions reported at least 
some activity to increase the enrollment and retention of minority 
students however only 25 percent said their enrollment of blacks 
hispanics and asians had risen during 198889 and only 10 percent 
reported an increase in american indian students 
its encouraging that theres a tremendous level of 
activity elkhawas said but the actual results fall short 
the same proportion of institutions reported they were making 
special efforts to increase minority faculty members but only 17 
percent offer incentives to academic departments to hire minorities 
and only 25 percent reported a net gain in minority faculty over

president mikhail s gorbachev said sunday he was 
inspired by striking coal miners and understood why they were 
skeptical about a government offer to end their eightday walkout 
but gorbachev told soviet television he disagreed with the 
tactics used by many of the nations 1 million coal miners and said 
their strike could threaten the national economy if it does not end 
he appealed to miners and all the workers of the country to 
endure the disruption caused by his reforms and help the nation 
find the wide road of our societys renewal 
gorbachev seeking to show sympathy toward the strikers while 
encouraging them to return to work said he could understand why 
miners in the donetsk coal basin voted saturday to turn down a 
government offer that met most of their demands 
the miners said they wanted assurances authorities would live up 
to the offer 
people to some extent have lost their trust said 
gorbachev 
by striking he said the miners acted very sharply but 
their actions showed workers are basically taking matters into 
their own hands and that despite all the drama of these events 
makes me greatly inspired 
a strike leader in the donetsk basin the nations largest coal 
center said miners there would appeal to the soviet legislature 
for legal guarantees to back government promises aimed at ending 
their walkout which began july 15 
nikolai balandin a member of the donetsk regional strike 
committee said a delegation of miners was scheduled to speak 
monday to the supreme soviet the standing legislature 
more than 5000 strikers demonstrated sunday on the central 
square in the city of donetsk 900 miles south of moscow and 
miners at each pit were deciding for themselves whether to resume 
work he said in a telephone interview 
the region has 121 pits with an annual production of 210 million 
tons tass reported sunday that 74 of the mines remained on strike 
29 fewer than on saturday on saturday press reports said about 
300000 miners in donetsk were on strike 
the stoppage is the biggest of a wave of miners strikes that 
began july 11 in western siberia and spread from the arctic to 
central asia 
miners reportedly remained on strike at 11 of the 13 mines in 
vorkuta in the pechora basin in the arctic and at all 12 mines in 
chervonograd in the western ukraine 
the donetsk regional strike committee reached a general 
agreement with government negotiators saturday but most miners 
there rejected it saying they did not trust the government to 
fulfill its promises of better working and living conditions 
balandin said the government commission guaranteed its 
concessions but thats a small guarantee and people dont believe 
in it the supreme soviet could give the agreement the force of 
law he said 
gorbachev and prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov assured strikers 
in a telegram saturday that their demands would be urgently 
reviewed by the supreme soviet and council of ministers with 
participation by representatives of the miners to reach the 
necessary decisions 
gorbachev repeated those assurances in the interview sunday with 
a tv journalist the interview was nationally broadcast 
the coal strikes have caused dire difficulties for power and 
steel industries among others soviet press reports say 
at the strikes peak reports indicated half the coal industrys 
1 million workers were on strike 
journalist alexander e makarsky said in a telephone interview 
from donetsk that the strike settlement there included earlier 
pension eligibility pay increases and longer vacations with extra 
holidays for miners in especially difficult or dangerous conditions 
miners in two major coal centers the karaganda region of the 
central asian republic of kazakhstan and the kuznetsk coal basin of 
western siberia have gone back into the pits but say they will 
strike again if the government reneges on its promises 
the siberian miners returned to work thursday and friday after 
they were promised pay increases more consumer goods and greater 
control over their industry

crimes between 1980 and 1987 the justice department said sunday

1987 than it was in 1980 the average sentence for nondrug crimes 
was only two months longer in 1987 than in 1980

system has responded forcefully to the increase in crime 
especially in the area of drug trafficking thornburgh said

americans favor legal abortion in their states 
by a 21 margin and nearly four in 10 say they are inclined to 
oppose antiabortion candidates for state office a national poll 
has found 
with the battle over abortion increasingly focused on state 
legislatures voters critical of antiabortion candidates 
outnumbered their supporters by nearly 21 in the media 
generalassociated press survey 
respondents also expressed continued support for the 1973 us 
supreme court ruling establishing a constitutional right to 
abortion fiftynine percent were in favor and 36 percent were 
opposed with 5 percent unsure 
support for the 1973 decision was slightly up from 53 percent in 
an mgap survey in march while the increase was within the polls 
margin of sampling error similar movement in other questions 
indicated a slight rise in prochoice sentiment since the court 
approved greater abortion restrictions on july 3 
sixtythree percent in the new poll said they would want 
abortion to be legal in their state if the court overturned its 
1973 ruling and let each state make its own abortion laws that was 
up from 57 percent in march 
the survey conducted by telephone july 716 among 1163 adults 
had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage 
points 
while majorities favored legal abortion generally respondents 
were split on many of the specific restrictions in the courts july 
3 ruling among the findings 
sixtyfive percent said it should be legal for abortions to be 
done at public hospitals but that fell to 51 percent when 
respondents were asked specifically about abortions that are not 
required to save the mothers life the supreme court said states 
can ban such abortions from public hospitals 
respondents split about evenly on whether it should be legal 
for public health employees to perform or assist in abortions the 
court said that too can be barred by the states when the mothers 
life is not at risk 
respondents strongly supported mandatory preabortion tests to 
see if fetuses that are at least 20 weeks old can survive outside 
the womb with 62 percent in favor the high court said such tests 
may be required 
by 5438 percent with 8 percent undecided respondents said it 
should be legal to use public funds to counsel women about the 
availability of abortion the court left that issue undecided 
overall 48 percent of respondents said they opposed the july 3 
ruling 43 percent favored it and 9 percent were unsure that was a 
split in opinion given the margin of error 
prochoice activists have said they will work to defeat 
antiabortion state legislators in the survey 38 percent said 
they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who was firmly 
opposed to abortion compared with 21 percent who would be more 
likely to support such a candidate an additional 38 percent said 
it wouldnt matter much and 3 percent were unsure 
at the same time twothirds of the respondents said they would 
not base their vote just on a candidates position on abortion 
as in other polls general questions on abortion produced 
divided views reflecting public discomfort with an issue that pits 
the rights of pregnant women against concern for their fetuses 
on one hand 67 percent said a woman should be allowed to have 
an abortion if she wants one and her doctor agrees to it and just 
25 percent said not with 8 percent undecided on the other hand a 
sizable 42 percent favored a constitutional amendment to ban most 
abortions fiftythree percent opposed an amendment and the rest 
were undecided 
as in past surveys younger more educated and wealthier people 
were more apt to support legal abortion as were residents of the 
northeast and the west and bigcity dwellers 
people who called themselves conservatives were far more likely 
to oppose abortion just 42 percent of conservatives supported the 
courts 1973 ruling compared with 66 percent of moderates and 80 
percent of liberals

felix lopez takes a break from 
sawing beams out of a laurel log to sit in the shade of a mango 
tree and tell how life has improved since his cooperative farm was 
expropriated from a landowner nine years ago 
orlando de sola sits in an overstuffed leather chair in a 
gleaming white mansion and laments that his land and hundreds of 
other big spreads were taken away and given to freeloaders 
the two men exemplify a dilemma facing the monthold rightist 
government of president alfredo cristiani how to deal with a land 
reform program that is anathema to the right but is too deeply 
rooted to abolish 
since 1980 the reform program has redistributed nearly 30 
percent of this massachusettssized countrys arable acreage about 
120000 peasant families have taken part in the program which was 
designed by us academics and pushed by us policymakers as 
necessary to erode support for leftist revolution 
in all 469 big farms were expropriated with compensation that 
many landlords say was insufficient the farms were organized into 
320 cooperatives of which about 50 have failed for economic 
reasons or because they were in war zones 
agriculture minister antonio cabrales says only 10 percent of 
the remaining coops are profitable critics of the reform program 
say the coops have reduced production and that peasants not 
accustomed to managing large enterprises have been unable to run 
the farms 
although the reforms economic outcome is uncertain it has been 
a political asset for the usbacked government in its 10yearold 
civil war with marxistled insurgents 
peasant organizations the centrist christian democrats and 
leftists now contend cristianis republican nationalist alliance 
or arena plans to undo land reform without appearing to do so 
cristiani and cabrales reject the accusations and say the intent 
is to reform the reform to improve production by letting 
peasant farmers themselves decide how they want to work the land 
while felix lopez is fighting to retain his land de sola says 
the government is not moving quickly enough to dismantle the 
reform he says cristiani is being a sissy 
twentyone former landowners are trying to get their land back 
through the overwhelmingly conservative courts all five cases 
decided so far have gone against the peasants lopezs cooperative 
is one of those five 
we made her tons of money lopez said of victoria amada sol 
former owner of hacienda nueva 
now were doing quite well he said enumerating the 
improvements since the farm was converted into a cooperative in 
1980 
i have worked this land for 40 years under la patrona the 
former owner we broke our backs for 20 cents a day that was 
enough for us to eat but clothes or shoes forget it 
lopez 68 exhibited his calloused hands as he spoke he 
explained that though he now could buy shoes he never got used to 
the idea and his leathery splayed feet remain bare 
each of the adobe brick and thatch or tinroofed houses of the 
farms 600 families has a large concrete basin with running water 
all have electricity the cooperative has a school with two 
teachers and pays a doctor at a clinic in lourdes 12 miles west of 
san salvador 
the farm is made up of rolling coffeecovered hills and rippling 
flat streches of corn and sugar cane 
in the summer rainy season it displays every shade of green 
from lime to dark ivy 
it is beautiful and bountiful and mrs sol wants it back she 
took her case to the supreme court which ruled that the land had 
been unlawfully expropriated 
the conservative court likewise ruled in favor of four other 
plaintiffs who argued that their holdings had not exceeded the 
1235acre limit established by the reform 
mrs sols lawyers said they could not comment on the ongoing 
case mrs sol who lives in miami did not return a phone call 
seeking comment 
despite the court decisions the arena government seems 
unwilling to pay the political cost of forced evictions 
the court has issued an eviction order only in the case of 
hacienda nueva it was effective june 23 but the government has 
taken no action 
cristiani and cabrales the agriculture minister have said 
force will not be used authorities are trying to negotiate a 
solution which may mean higher government compensation for mrs 
sol or a swap that would set up the cooperative on new land

hundreds of thousands of beirut residents 
have fled escalating shelling between syrian and christian gunners 
and police said duels sunday left six people dead and at least 20 
wounded 
if i stay ill go crazy said 23yearold radwa succar a 
moslem beautician who joined the exodus to south lebanon if we 
dont get killed from bombardment well definitely die from fear 
and depression 
by police count at least 250000 moslem and christian residents 
since friday had taken advantage of brief lulls in the fighting to 
pack and flee 
tens of thousands of others from beirut and nearby towns huddled 
in basements and bomb shelters for the third straight day with no 
electricity and little water 
this is a life of animals living in bomb shelters is not a 
joyful thing at all said chafika maalouf a 63yearold 
christian homemaker as she left suburban zalka with her husband 
son and daughterinlaw i simply cant take it anymore 
beirut was a ghost town bereft of sunday strollers and most 
traffic the few open sidewalk cafes were nearly empty 
gunners hit a fuel tanker north of the city setting it on fire 
and syrian tanks blasted a christian army position they surrounded 
in hills outside beirut 
police said christian forces fired mortars at druse towns in the 
central mountains to try to ease the pressure on their garrison at 
the strategic hilltop town of souk elgharb 15 miles southeast of 
beirut 
syrian and christian forces also traded machinegun fire across 
beiruts green line forcing the closure of the only public 
crossing between the moslem and christian sectors 
one syrian tank shell hit the house of a christian family in 
beiruts eastern suburb of hadath killing a 7yearold girl her 
10yearold brother and her grandfather a police spokesman said 
the childrens parents and another brother were in intensive 
care in a christian hospital said the spokesman who cannot be 
named under standing regulations 
among other wounded were two soldiers of gen michel aouns 
mainly christian force and four druse militiamen the spokesman 
said 
the new casualities raised the overall toll to 446 killed and 
1856 wounded since the latest round of fighting in lebanons 
14yearold civil war erupted march 8 pitting aouns 20000 troops 
against the syrian army and the druse militia 
police said the fighting eased around midday only to pick up 
more violently in the afternoon 
police identified the stricken vessel as the greekregistered 
peter argo and said it was carrying 2000 tons of gasoline to the 
besieged christian region when it was hit by shellfire six miles 
offshore 
the ship sailed toward open seas after the bombardment but 
police said it was intercepted by a syrian gunboat and escorted to 
the syriancontrolled port of tripoli in north lebanon 
no casualties were reported it was the sixth vessel to be 
struck by syrian shellfire 
the syrians who consider control of lebanon vital to their 
security maintain 40000 troops in 75 percent of lebanon under a 
1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
aoun charges the syrians have destroyed that mandate by openly 
fighting on the moslem side he has pledged to drive them from 
syria

the head of the house select committee on 
aging on sunday proposed an overhaul of the governments health 
care system that would offer coverage to all americans and cap 
overall spending for medical care 
rep edward roybal dcalif said he would introduce 
legislation monday to provide medical coverage to the 37 million 
americans who now are uninsured and to improve benefits for the 200 
million people or 85 percent of americans who are underinsured 
against catastrophic longterm illness 
in addition the legislation for the first time would set a cap 
on the nations total spending for health care limiting 
expenditures to 12 percent of the gross national product the 
broadest measure of us economic activity 
roybals plan is among many that have been proposed to establish 
a comprehensive health care program for the nation that would 
better protect uninsured and underinsured americans 
from 1980 through 1987 health care costs rose at an average 
rate of 104 percent or 33 percent faster than the gnp under the 
current system these costs are expected to reach 13 percent of gnp 
by 1995 and nearly 15 percent by the year 2000 
we are facing a serious crisis in our nations health care 
system because of incomplete access to care and increasing costs 
of care roybal said soaring health care costs in the current 
system threaten the american peoples ability to pay for 
desperately needed health care 
under the proposed legislation payments by beneficiaries would 
be limited to 20 percent of health care skilled nursing home and 
home health costs up to a maximum of 600 a person per year and 
25 percent of longterm care costs up to a maximum of 1000 per 
person a year 
both maximums would rise in tandem with per capita growth in the 
gnp 
the expanded benefits would be paid for by extending the 
medicare payroll tax to all income an employer tax based on 
compensation an expanded cigarette tax state revenues covering 
half the costs for the poor a surcharge on corporate and 
individual income taxes and a premium paid by the elderly 
approximating the current medicare premium 
the legislation which would modify the existing medicare 
program and take full effect in 1994 would establish a 
costcontainment program that includes fixed fee schedules for 
health care providers and limiting future increases to the rise in 
the per capita gnp

indian tribe voted chairman peter macdonald out of office amid

navajo tribal police thursday in window rock the 200000member 
tribes capital 
two people were killed and nine wounded in the violence the 
latest episode in the struggle for power on the 125000 squaremile 
navajo reservation which extends over parts of arizona new mexico 
and utah 
the tribal capital was quiet sunday as many of the council 
members and protesters left for the weekend because their homes are 
several hours from window rock officials said 
on saturday interim navajo tribal attorney general herb yazzie 
called for the federal government to indict macdonald on corruption 
charges and for the tribal prosecutors office to charge macdonald 
with violating tribal law 
those killed in thursdays violence were members of the 
prodineh voters organization which exists to return macdonald to 
power three police officers were among the nine wounded 
the tribal department of public safety was a macdonald ally for 
most of the three months during which he fought efforts of the new 
administration to evict him from the tribes administration 
building 
that changed near the end of april as interim chairman leonard 
haskie pursued a policy of erosion leaving macdonald on an island 
of power while taking control of the tribes purse strings and 
winning federal and judicial recognition 
haskie succeeded in replacing the police chief under new 
leadership officers on may 24 cleared macdonald loyalists out of 
the offices where they had slept to prevent just such a takeover 
lt daniel hawkins led the sweep and observers said it was no 
accident that an attack on hawkins precipitated the fracas thursday 
with tribal police coming to his defense 
the violence was not the first in the controversy early on a 
macdonald supporter attacked another man with a knife outside the 
tribal council building 
in early april haskie backers marched on successive weekends to 
window rock where macdonald supporters were waiting during the 
second demonstration police threw tear gas to disperse the crowd 
amid the larger confrontations incidents of shouting 
namecalling and bad feelings occurred almost daily 
in the councils feb 13 action against macdonald 49 of the 88 
council members voted to place the chairman on administrative leave 
for investigation of claims that his fourth term was marred by 
corruption 
although macdonald has not been charged with a crime testimony 
delivered at january hearings of the us senate select committee 
on indian affairs swayed many navajos against him witnesses 
described a system of government in which contractors seeking 
onreservation work were forced to pay thousands of dollars in 
kickbacks 
others testified that macdonald shared in the 72 million 
profit turned by two nonindian businessmen who bought a ranch and 
sold it to the tribe less than 24 hours later 
but the council insurgents overlooked the navajos respect for 
macdonalds leadership qualities resolute nature and his charisma 
many traditionalists rallied behind macdonald regardless of the 
legal or ethical issues 
macdonald knew how to play on the passions of his backers says 
duane beyal haskies press aide 
hes got a silver tongue theres no denying that beyal 
said in an interview in window rock last april in that way he 
follows in the tradition of the great chiefs but not in the other 
ways 
john chapela a window rock lawyer said macdonalds magnetism 
was so strong it could only be countered by videotapes of the 
senate hearings 
chapela said he taped the procedure and visited about onefourth 
of the navajo chapters or political wards to show voters who 
might have missed the televised sessions 
macdonald was marshaling his own support 
within days of his suspension he began visiting the chapters to 
outline his contention that indian leaders had accepted gifts since 
the dawn of tribal structure as a way to cement friendships for the 
tribe his dealings were no different macdonald said 
macdonalds fortunes waned as haskies brightened with a series 
of legal victories including an order from a tribal judge 
restraining macdonald from acting in an official capacity 
macdonald says it isnt over 
there will be more violence he said friday

six greek cypriot women alleged sunday 
that they were molested and beaten by turkish cypriot prison guards 
and police after being arrested for taking part in a protest last 
week 
they treated us like animals georgia petrou 19 told 
reporters after she and the five other women emerged from the 
turkish cypriot prison where they had been held four days all six 
showed black bruises on their bodies they said were from beatings 
by turkish cypriot police 
several hundred greek cypriots were in the fourth day of a 
sitin outside the headquarters of the 2300man un peacekeeping 
force at nicosia airport which lies on the green line dividing the 
island into the greek and turkish sectors 
they were demanding freedom for 108 greek cypriots 98 women 
and 10 men arrested by turkish cypriot police wednesday when they 
stormed across the unpatrolled buffer zone to protest the 
turkish occupation of northern cyprus 
the issue threatens to wreck talks between leaders of the rival 
communities aimed at reunifying the mediterranean island 
government spokesman akis fantis said the united nations 
security council will meet in closed session in new york on monday 
to discuss the issue 
a district court in the turkishheld sector of nicosia convicted 
the 108 greek cypriots of violating the border of the turkish 
republic of northern cyprus which only turkey recognizes 
ninetytwo women and the 10 men were given sentences of two or 
three days in jail and were fined from 100 to 200 each sixteen 
young women were given suspended sentences but only six were freed 
the others refused to sign court documents promising not to 
commit the same crime again and will remain in jail they said 
signing the statement would have implied recognition of the courts 
legitimacy 
the protesters faced a maximum penalty of 18 months and hefty 
fines but judge gonul orenen said she was passing very lenient 
sentences to prevent further deterioration in relations between the 
two communities 
margarita michail an 18yearold women who was released broke 
down and sobbed as she talked about her detainment 
we were pulled by the hair and our clothes punched and kicked 
and the turkish policemen who arrested us grabbed our breasts and 
genitals she said 
others said they were verbally abused and spat on by a crowd of 
turkish cypriot men and women while waiting to be taken into 
detention after their arrest 
ms petrou said they spent the first night on the ground in a 
sports complex the following nights they slept on the floor of a 
detention center with 40 people per room and only 18 beds 
the women wardens terrorized us telling us they would turn us 
over to men to be raped she said 
turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash and president george 
vassiliou of cyprus are scheduled to meet wednesday for another 
round in their 10 months of unsponsored talks on reunifying the 
island 
but denktash has said he may not attend because of the crisis 
oscar camilion special respresentative of un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar drove across the green 
line for talks with denktash 
the northern third of cyprus was seized by the turkish army when 
it invaded july 20 1974 following a shortlived coup in nicosia 
by supporters of union with greece an estimated 35000 turkish 
troops guard the turkish sector 
the moslem turkish cypriots who form 17 percent of the islands 
population and the christian greeks had been feuding for years 
before the invasion

the internal revenue service often called on 
to defend its competence will face a new challenge this week 
defending its integrity 
the house government operations subcommittee on consumer affairs 
opens three days of hearings tuesday into what chairman doug 
barnard jr dga called serious misconduct problems among 
senior managers of irs and a culture within the service that 
glorifies the agencys public image at the expense of aggressive 
investigation and punishment of wrongdoing 
fred goldberg the new irs commissioner said the agencys 
criminal investigation system works pretty well but he and his 
predecessor have refused to discuss the subcommittees 
investigation citing a privacyprotection law that imposes 
criminal penalties on anyone who discloses information about 
individual tax files 
some members of congress accuse the agency of hiding behind the 
law which was toughened after disclosures that nixon 
administration officials tried to use the irs to punish political 
enemies 
the subcommittee has been on the investigation for more than a 
year checking events as far back as 1984 the most notable case 
involves bribery allegations against ronald saranow former chief 
of the agencys criminal investigation division in los angeles 
he was alleged to have been bribed by officials of jeans 
manufacturer guess inc to launch an investigation of rival 
jordache enterprises the irs last year cleared saranow of 
wrongdoing 
barnards investigators say the irs not only disregarded 
important testimony against saranow but leaked information to him 
while he was still under investigation 
irs conduct also is drawing the attention of sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas chairman of the senate finance committee he said saturday 
that congress needs to assign a small group of staffers to do 
nothing but oversee irs operations 
you get into trouble with an agency when you have no checks 
and balances no oversight in the administration of it bentsen 
said in a televised interview prepared for broadcast in texas 
his finance committee staff said it is difficult for the irs 
commissioner to watch over operations of an agency that has more 
than 80 field offices and employees in every state 
although the privacy statute can require congress to overcome 
substantia hurdles in monitoring the irs it should not be changed 
because it provides valuable safeguards to american taxpayers 
the committee staff said in a memo to bentsen 
the irs cited the privacy statue in denying barnards house 
subcommittee access to taxpayer files he threatened to take the 
fight to the house but back down because of allout opposition from 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and means 
committee 
under the law only ways and means senate finance and the joint 
committee on taxation on which bentsen and rostenkowski share 
leadership may see taxpayer files 
in announcing the hearing barnard said his subcommittee has 
reason to believe that many changes are necessary at irs if 
americans are to be believe that the tax laws are being 
administered fairly 
goldberg and his top administrators say they are as ready to 
take any advice as they are unwilling to discuss specific 
allegations 
we are wide open for considering anything they have to 
suggest the fact that there is somebody out there skimming money 
leads you to the conclusion that something is wrong goldberg 
said 
changes are already being made added michael murphy senior 
deputy commissioner 
bruce b milburn assistant commissioner for criminal 
investigation defends the 3200 special agents assigned to probe 
allegations of criminality as the most thorough in the world 
because these agents are such professionals he said smart defense 
lawyers often attempt to undermine a case by casting doubt on the 
integrity of the investigator 
our integrity is the only asset we being to our job he said 
teddy r kern assistant commissioner for inspection who is in 
charge of monitoring the conduct of irs employees said that in 
1987 88 of irs 120000 employees were convicted of criminal 
charges following internal investigations he noted with 
satisfaction that barnard has acknowledged that the subcommittee 
probe has not uncovered widespread wrongdoing 
anybody who is anticipating a hudtype situation said kern 
referring to widespread influencepeddling in the department of 
housing and urban development during the reagan administration 
is going to be disappointed

forests before his may 28 1987 capture by fbi agents at an 
oklahoma motel 
he is charged with murdering a volunteer at a church in

the trial in phelps county circuit court where all 100 seats in 
the courtroom were filled throughout last week was to begin its 
second week monday 
its the talk of my shop beauty shop operator lola turner 
said last week theres still a question mark in some peoples 
minds whether hes a murderer or not they definitely feel hes a 
criminal like i do 
he had us scared there for a long time 
the trial was delayed for months by various motions and by lack 
of funding in the public defenders office to pay for browns 
defense 
personally i think hes guilty said paul miller a 
university of missourirolla student lunching in a fastfood 
restaurant with friends im getting tired of hearing about him 
though and i know others are too 
assistant state attorney general tim finnical who is seeking 
the death penalty contends that brown shot claude long 56 at the 
new apostolic church on april 1 1987 and then stole the victims 
car at the time police were hunting brown for allegedly wounding 
a rolla police officer two days earlier in a motel parking lot 
much of finnicals evidence is circumstantial as there were no 
witnesses to longs slaying however finnical said four ballistics 
experts will testify that a 357caliber magnum revolver brown 
carried when he was arrested was the same gun used to kill long 
finnical also produced several witnesses who had known or been 
robbed by brown who had been on the loose since escaping from a 
southwest missouri prison in 1984 where he was serving a fouryear 
sentence for burglary and possessing explosive weapons the manhunt 
for him began however only after the police officer was shot 
browns attorney brad kessler of st louis has labeled his 
client a smalltime burglar with a penchant for stealing guns 
but not a murderer 
kessler also has suggested that two phelps county sheriffs 
deputies might have entered the church looking for brown and 
accidentally shot long who somewhat resembled the bald 
bespectacled brown 
finnical calls the theory ridiculous 
but ridiculous defenses have worked before he said its 
up to us to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that john david brown 
did it 
kessler said prosecutors cant prove that brown was ever in the 
church 
they ask for the death penalty to bolster their tenuous 
evidence he said you ask for death to raise the stakes 
kessler said he did not know whether brown would testify 
the trial has featured some emotional testimony 
reinhard bandowski who found longs body near a water fountain 
in the church kitchen broke down and cried on the witness stand 
when finnical handed him a picture of the body 
oh the blood the brains bandowski said 
but the trial also has had its lighter moments 
lee lambert of kansas city identified brown as the man he saw in 
a stolen pickup truck parked outside his home in 1984 however 
kessler noted lambert had told police that the man had brushy 
eyebrows and an elvis presleylike haircut

a 35yearold lutheran minister has 
become the first fully independent opposition candidate elected to 
parliament in more than 40 years staterun media said sunday 
gabor roszik won 692 percent of the ballots cast in a 
byelection saturday in the town of goedoelloe about 15 miles 
northeast of budapest the mti news agency said 
roszik was supported by a coalition of three of hungarys 
strongest democratic opposition groups the hungarian democratic 
forum the league of free democrats and the youth group fidesz he 
defeated communist party candidate laszlo koeresfoei a 58yearold 
school administrator 
three other byelections saturday in the southern towns of 
szeged kecskemet and kiszkunfelegyhaza will be repeated aug 5 due 
to low turnout or the failure of candidates to get a required 
majority of the vote mti said 
state radio said hot weather kept many hungarians away from the 
polls 
the low turnout indicated that neither the opposition nor the 
party mobilized hungarians who are preoccupied with falling living 
standards and inflation of at least 18 percent 
it contrasted sharply with turnouts of more than 90 percent that 
had been claimed by the communists for past elections 
we are continuing where we left off in 1956 roszik told an 
election rally last month alluding to the shortlived revolt 
against stalinism in 1956 that was crushed by kremlin troops and 
tanks 
peter polonyi a retired museum director who earlier tried to 
run as a candidate in goedoelloe said of the race there it 
seems anyone will do as long as they are not communist party 
members indeed the stronger the attacks on the party the greater 
the candidates popularity 
saturdays byelections were the first since 1947 to offer 
voters a genuine choice between communist party candidates and 
candidates put up by independent opposition groups 
hungary held multicandidate elections for the 387member 
parliament in 1985 twentyfive percent of those elected were not 
from the communist party but all candidates in those elections had 
to be approved by the patriotic peoples front a 
communistdominated umbrella organization for social or political 
groups the communists prevented dissidents such as laszlo rajk jr 
from becoming candidates 
in kecskemet and szeged the turnout was 441 percent and 452 
percent respectively mti said meaning new elections are needed 
because a 50 percent minimum turnout is required for the ballot to 
be valid 
in kiszkunfelegyhaza 615 percent of the electorate turned out 
but none of the three candidates a lawyer running with communist 
party support a 34yearold doctor backed by the former communist 
youth league and an independent teacher got more than 50 percent 
of the vote mti said

the bush administration is not willing to 
agree to raise taxes in the future in exchange for an immediate cut 
in the capital gains tax white house budget director richard 
darman said sunday 
even though president bush has had discussions with house 
speaker thomas foley and rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of 
the ways and means chairman the president is firmly committed to 
his pledge not to raise taxes darman said on cbstvs face the 
nation 
were not talking about a deal darman said others are 
talking about it but the administration is not interested in 
that 
the office of management and budget director said the democratic 
leaders were blocking action on the capital gains tax cut that bush 
wants 
we believe that right now we have the votes for a 
satisfactory capital gains proposal in the ways and means 
committee our only problem is foley and rostenkowski wont 
actually bring it up for a vote said darman 
foley and other democrats have contended that lowering the 
capital gains tax would hurt the treasury and help the wealthy 
bush argues it would stimulate economic growth and thus be a net 
moneyraiser not a loser for the treasury 
asked how long bush intended to stick by his notaxincrease 
pledge darman said for the time being lets assume forever 
but i dont know exactly what that means 
darman called flawed a treasury department analysis that a 
capital gains tax cut would be a moneyloser after two years 
darman defended bushs newly announced space goals including a 
return to the moon and eventual manned flight to mars bush has not 
put a pricetag on them 
asked where the money would come from darman said its going 
to come from the growth of our economy and wise investment of the 
federal budget 
darman said he could think of no better investment than 
investment in space lets choose the future 
astrophysicist james van allen called bushs space plans 
extremely vague and said the idea of sending human crews to 
mars is straight out of 17th century science fiction 
both the moon and mars are of great scientific interest van 
allen said but investigating them with unmanned spacecraft would 
be a far more fruitful way to go 
the heavy hitters in the space program are the unmanned 
spacecraft which operate all day every day for in many cases 
many years said van allen 
national aeronautics and space administration chief richard h 
truly defended bushs space goals saying its one of the most 
rational sets of statements and goals that ive heard about the 
space program in a long long time 
truly a former astronaut said a balanced program of manned 
and unmanned flights is needed he bemoaned the battle between 
advocates of manned and unmanned space exploration likening it to 
cowboys circling the wagons and then firing inward 
van allen called himself one of trulys fans but insisted if 
you want to give me any specific example of a scientific or 
practical mission i will identify an unmanned method which is far 
cheaper and less expensive than the manned method

mutterings can be heard in this sawmill 
town about the southerners and how the longrunning battle over 
the regions forests could have been solved long ago without their 
interference 
theyre talking about city dwellers from urbanized southern 
ontario from such places as toronto where environmentalists have 
taken on the fight to preserve temagamis oldgrowth red and white 
pine forests the bulk of canadas population lives in southern 
areas not far from the us border 
this is canadas near north a term used to differentiate it 
from the more vast and less populated barren stretches leading to 
the arctic farther north 
in addition to environmentalists and other southerners the 
battle involves sawmill operators and forest product companies 
eager to preserve precedents of access to lumber supplies and an 
indian tribe trying to assert a land claim 
canadians have long debated how to develop their resourcerich 
rugged northern areas since the 19th century temagami has been a 
wilderness destination for canadians and americans looking for a 
remote escape 
the diverging interests have resulted in a standoff over 
temagamis majestic forests defying solution at a time when 
environmental issues have surged to the top of public concern 
nationally and internationally 
brian back of the temagami wilderness society said he hopes the 
chord of concern that the brazilian rain forests plight has struck 
in canada can be translated into intensified interest in troubles 
closer to home 
as the environmentalists tell it the logging industry supported 
by the provincial government is threatening the largest virgin pine 
forest left in ontario 
there is no comparable accessible wilderness that we know 
about back said 
tourist brochures for the region note that it is not only within 
a days drive of the eastern canadian cities of toronto and 
montreal but also of buffalo cleveland detroit and other american 
cities 
confrontations over forests also have taken place on canadas 
pacific coast most recently in the carmanah and stein valleys of 
british columbia but no dispute in the eastern part of the country 
has been as intractable or received as much attention as that in 
temagami 
the temagami wilderness society has attracted 14000 members 
brian moulder district planner for the ontario ministry of 
natural resources that oversees land use for public lands insisted 
that enough balance has been given to all interests and enough set 
aside for wilderness reserve 
theres been harvesting of trees in this district for over 
100 years he said there must be economic advantage or they 
would have quit a long time ago 
environmentalists respond that the ante was raised by the 
mechanization of the logging industry since the 1950s that required 
ever larger sawmills to be fed by clearcutting of trees instead of 
selective harvesting 
canada is the worlds largest exporter of forest products 
sending 22 percent of all forest products traded on international 
markets there are some 300 towns across the country where the 
industry serves as a mainstay 
temagami is a nondescript town of about 1100 people on canadas 
northsouth highway 11 about a fivehour drive north of toronto 
on first glance it would seem an unlikely spot as the centerpiece 
for an environmental battle but the area around it includes not 
only the forests but also a vast system of interlocking waterways 
ideal for canoeing 
the fight specifically is over whether logging roads can be 
extended to allow clearcutting in previously inaccessible areas 
a local algonquin indian group the temeaugama anishnabai 
filed a claim in 1973 for 4000 square miles of land the claim was 
rejected a decade later but development in the interim was halted 
on public lands 
appeals until recently kept any logging road from being extended 
and also allowed time for the protests to gather support and 
symbolic value as a rallying cry 
i dont like how the land is being treated michael paul an 
indian who performed the tobacco ceremony at a recent blockade of a 
logging road said at his home on bear island 
the indians rejected a 35 million settlement offer from the 
government in 1986 but recently resumed talks 
the ontario government gave the goahead for work on two logging 
road extensions to proceed after the last appeal was rejected in 
provincial court this spring although no logging has yet been 
allowed in the disputed area 
those who favor allowing more clearcutting say its effects can 
be compared to those of a forest fire clearing out growth that no 
longer is productive and setting the stage for new trees to grow 
they also say a steady supply of timber can insure that at least 
some sawmill jobs will remain in temagami if not the 150 that 
existed when the mill could operate at its peak 
the local william milne amp sons mill has been in receivership 
since last december but a scaled down version is expected to resume 
operations soon 
the wilderness advocates however argue that the old growth 
with trees dating back generations cannot be replaced they say the 
new forest that would spring up in its wake would not harbor the 
greater diversity of natural life now existing especially in the 
fragile northern environment 
theres never been an adequate evaluation of whats there 
don huff environmental director of the federation of ontario 
naturalists said theres no place else that still has this 
combination of things still relatively intact

was being examined said a spokesman for the constabulary nothing 
suspicious was found on the other two routes he said 
for seven months the ira has been disrupting rail service 
across the border the ira said in a statement in march that one 
aim of the bombers was to draw british troops out of their hilltop 
bunkers and into more vulnerable positions in the countryside 
in the central region of the province police said security 
forces found a significant arms cache including a machine gun 
assault rifle two grenades from a sovietmade rpg7 grenade 
launcher and 500 rounds of ammunition along the road between

the government on sunday said it 
foiled a plot to blow up a vital bridge that links afghanistan and 
its main weapons supplier the soviet union 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said the plan was 
discovered after afghan security forces arrested a pakistani 
citizen mukhtar gul on july 6 
speaking to a small group of reporters gul said he and two 
compatriots were recruited to destroy friendship bridge in 
hayratan 350 miles northwest of kabul 
the bridge which spans the oxus river separating afghanistan 
and the soviet union is the lifeline for the kabul government in 
its battle with moslem guerrillas 
our mission was to blow up the bridge and thus cut the supply 
line from russia to afghanistan said the 25yearold gul who 
was introduced as a medical school dropout and an expert in 
underwater diving and subversion 
gul said he worked for a pakistani government organization 
called cid he did not elaborate 
gulf said he received training in subversion from an american in 
the pakistani border city of peshawar where many of the guerrillas 
are based the american was known to him only as karim abdul hakim 
he said 
we had enough explosives and weapons to carry out our mission 
but before that i was arrested said gul speaking in urdu the 
most common language in pakistan 
it was not immediately known what happened to the other two 
pakistanis who had accompanied gul 
guls claims which he said were not made under duress could 
not be independently confirmed 
the government has often accused pakistan its southeastern 
neighbor of being directly involved in the civil war a charge 
islamabad denies 
in a statement released after the news conference the 
government said the us has been trying to use pakistan as a 
springboard of aggression for carrying out its strategic objectives 
in the region 
now the us authorities want to use afghan territory also for 
such vicious ends as well the statement said 
the united states is the main weapons supplier to the 
guerrillas known as mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors they have 
been fighting 11 years to oust the government 
the soviet union ended its nineyear military involvement in 
afghanistan on feb 15 but continues to ship huge quantities or 
arms to afghan government forces

security troops sent to quell ethnic 
rioting in soviet georgia are facing groups of heavily armed 
extremists who apparently want to provoke them into firing on 
civilians official reports said sunday 
the soviet news agency tass reported that the commanders of 
internal security troops in abkhazia a black sea enclave about 880 
miles south of moscow appealed to the local populace to resist 
extremists and bandits not to allow further bloodshed 
the commanders said they did not blame the populace for the 
slayings friday of two security soldiers whose deaths brought to 
19 the number of poeple killed in a week of rioting by ethnic 
georgians and abkhazians 
but at the same time its possible that there are forces that 
are not against creating clashes between the population and 
soldiers in order to provoke the troops into using their weapons 
which they havent done once in abkhazia the appeal said 
in sukhumi abkhazias capital public transport resumed after 
days of paralysis from a strike residents said sunday in telephone 
interviews 
but activists in georgia have proposed a general strike monday 
to protest what they see as a failure by police and troops to 
protect ethnic georgians in abkhazia 
interior ministry officers in abkhazia told pravda they had 
never seen so many weapons in the hands of the population 
the two police killed friday were shot with hunting rifles as 
they were clearing roadblocks and confiscating weapons in western 
georgia 
as a result of the continuing violence two regional party 
secretaries were fired and two government leaders in abkhazia lost 
their jobs saturday 
abkhazians and georgians blame each other for the ethnic unrest 
abkhazians who are a minority in their own region want greater 
economic independence and cultural rights while georgians want the 
fertile enclave with its seaside resorts retained as part of 
their caucasus republic 
the georgian youth newspaper molodyozh gruzii said georgian 
leaders want to develop a dialogue over problems besetting the 
region but that abkhazians want the kremlin to establish an 
outside body to take control of the region 
at least 132 people have died in ethnic unrest during the past 
month in the southern soviet republics of georgia azerbaijan 
kazakhstan uzbekistan and tadzhikistan

congress tackles military spending this week 
as president bush wages a lastditch effort to save the b2 bomber 
from moneyconscious legislators opposed to the 530 million 
aircraft 
bush had groups of members to the white house on two occasions 
last week and plans to make individual pleas this week that the 
b2 designed to penetrate soviet airspace is key to the nations 
strategic nuclear deterrence 
the president is concerned by the opposition white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters friday 
lawmakers have expressed sticker shock at the planes cost 
the pentagon has already invested about 23 billion in the program 
and wants an additional 70 billion to buy 132 copies of the plane 
the one plane that exists has made one test flight lasting 
about two hours 
elsewhere on capitol hill the focus this week remains on the 
unfolding scandal at the department of housing and urban 
development the flag desecration issue and the savings and loan 
industry bailout 
debate on the military spending bill will be highlighted by two 
amendments to the defense bill that would either end the b2 
program or severely limit it 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee is proposing paying for just two bombers in 1990 and 
1991 rather than the eight sought by the pentagon aspin believes 
congress needs more information on the radarevading plane before 
deciding whether to kill it or spend more money 
two republicans john rowland of connecticut and john kasich of 
ohio and democrat ronald dellums of california will introduce an 
amendment to complete work on the 13 bombers under way and mothball 
the production line 
rowland was one lawmaker summoned to the white house friday but 
bushs argument failed to sway him 
i was not convinced by the presidents remarks rowland 
said there are a small number of republicans and hopefully a 
large number of democrats who believe testing should be completed 
before a commitment is made to build the 132 planes rowland said 
the bush administration has proposed spending 47 billion in 
fiscal 1990 for the b2 but the house armed services committee cut 
that amount by 800 million 
defense secretary dick cheney said sunday he was hopeful that 
the administrations arguments in support of the b2 program would 
eventually prevail on capitol hill 
i think were going to do fairly well that is i think well 
come out of it with what the house armed services committee 
recommended i hope in the house well be able to defeat the 
amendments to kill it outright cheney said on abcs this week 
with david brinkley 
cheney noted that the congressional debate is partly over 
priorities the people who want to cut the b2 program arent 
suggesting that tax dollars ought to go back to the treasury or to 
the taxpayer they want to spend them on other systems 
support remains strong for the program on the senate armed 
services committee which trimmed just 300 million from the b2 
request 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the panel said sunday he 
agrees with bushs contention that failure to proceed with the b2 
could vitally affect strategic arms control efforts 
i think wed have to go back to the drawing board on arms 
control nunn said on nbcs meet the press program we have 
premised our basic arms control position on bombers being a vital 
part of our overall triad together with landbased and 
submarinelaunched missiles 
nunn described the b2 as a very stabilizing weapon because 
unlike missiles the bombers can be recalled after they have been 
put on airborne alert during a crisis 
im particularly troubled by the house of representatives 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the committee 
said friday when this plane rolled out some of the facts rolled 
out and now some people cant take the heat and theyre ducking 
under the table 
another republican on the committee sen malcolm wallop of 
wyoming said if congress chooses to limit spending instead of 
canceling the program or agreeing to the bush request it would be 
the most irresponsible path to take 
debate over the stealth aircraft overshadowed such perennial 
fights as funds for the strategic defensive initiative and the 
multiplewarhead rail garrison mx missile vs the singlewarhead 
midgetman 
the house armed services panel slashed 11 billion from bushs 
proposal of 49 billion for sdi commonly known as star wars the 
senate armed services committee cut 400 million from the 
presidents request 
both panels accepted the administrations plan to fund two 
mobile missiles with 11 billion to move the existing 50 mx 
missiles from silos to railroad cars and 100 million for the 
midgetman 
the house and senate also are expected to clash with the bush 
plan to cancel the v22 osprey the tiltrotor aircraft that takes 
off like a helicopter and can fly like a plane and the f14d 
tomcat jet fighter 
the v22 is a top priority for lawmakers from pennsylvania and 
texas where the aircraft is manufactured members from new york 
particularly long island have lobbied intensely for the f14d 
which is made by grumman corp 
in other action this week 
congress is pursuing an investigation of the scandal at the 
department of housing and urban development the house government 
operations housing subcommittee will hear from lynda murphy a 
former career hud employee about dealings with her friend deborah 
gore dean dean was executive assistant to former hud secretary 
samuel pierce but numerous witnesses have described her as almost 
a surrogate cabinet member who was heavily involved in funneling 
department money to wellplaced republicans 
the house judiciary committee plans to hold a drafting session 
to deal with responses to last months supreme courts decision 
that burning the american flag is a protected form of political 
expression the panels subcommittee on constitutional rights 
completed hearings last week on the issue congress is divided over 
whether to seek a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration 
or to address the matter through a simple change in the law 
after working behind closed doors most of last week house and 
senate negotiators working on a 166 billion bailout plan for the 
savings and loan industry will meet tuesday with hopes of nailing 
down a final package the major remaining disagreement is how to 
raise the 50 billion needed immediately to cover the loss of 
federally insured deposits in some 500 sampls at or near insolvency 
because of poor and often fraudulent lending

the kirov ballet ended its 19day season here 
with two programs of short ballets in which surprisingly 
principal dancers shone more brightly than they had in fullevening 
ballets danced earlier 
both mixedbill programs will be presented during the july 25 
aug 6 kennedy center season and the aug 18 to 27 engagement in 
costa mesa calif only the fulllength sleeping beauty and 
le corsaire are scheduled for san francisco aug 9 to 16 
the more interesting program was the second one because it 
contained two ballets choreographed by george balanchine at 10 
balanchine began studying at the imperial school of ballet which 
renamed is the kirovs school he left russia in 1924 the kirov 
didnt dance his ballets in his lifetime 
on saturday night the company danced scotch symphony as 
restaged for it by suzanne farrell one of balanchines last great 
ballerinas and theme and variations staged by francia 
russell who was a new york city ballet ballerina in the 1950s and 
60s and afterward often set balanchine ballets for european 
companies 
the kirov danced both ballets splendidly with no apparent 
problems with the style theme and variations to music by 
tchaikovsky was intended by balanchine to evoke russian ballets 
classical ballet heyday and scotch symphony to evoke 
mendelssohn also is on the classical side of balanchines 
choreographic spectrum 
yelena pankova and irina chistyakova were splendid in scotch 
symphony which seemed maybe because of a painted backdrop to 
take on more of a story than when the new york city ballet dances 
it farukh ruzimatov with exotic dark eye makeup was the 
dramatic partner of larisa lezhnina in theme and variations 
in both mixed bills viewers saw fewer balance problems than in 
earlier programs the kirov corps de ballet was matchless 
throughout the engagement 
a group of classical pas de deux was inserted in the center of 
both mixed bills yulia makhalina and konstantin zaklinsky and the 
corps de ballet were beautiful in the adagio from swan lake a 
charming trio from the fairy doll a ballerina flirting with 
two clowns as at an ice show the clowns have to be 
superproficient followed 
altynai asylmuratova and eldar aliyev made an excerpt from la 
esmeralda far more exciting than the other couple we saw galina 
mezentseva did an evocative but rather short the dying swan 
saturday nights audience was most enthusiastic during final 
curtain calls small bouquets were thrown from the boxes landing 
at the feet of dancers who were clapping back at the audience 
the first mixed bill ended with paquita and began with 
chopiniana known in the west as les sylphides zhanna 
ayupova irina sitnikova and kirill melnikov were good but natalya 
pavlovas landings werent always in time with the music 
throughout the engagement musical tempos were slower than many 
balletgoers ever had heard and sometimes during a ballet the 
tempo would slow still more several times

minnesotan will stegers international 
transantarctica expedition has reached its last stop in south 
america to await improved weather for the last leg of the flight to 
antarctica 
the soviet cargo jet carrying the st paulbased dog sled 
expedition landed saturday at punta arenas chile on the strait of 
magellan 
blowing snow and poor visibility over king george island off 
the northwest tip of the antarctic penninsula kept stegers group 
from continuing saturday storms sometimes prohibit travel to 
antarctica for as long as two weeks 
from now on its all forward a break in the weather and 
well head straight south steger told a reporter from the st 
paul pioneer press dispatch who was on the flight 
the groups arrival in punta arenas ended a taxing weeklong 
flight from minneapolisst paul aboard a soviet ilyushin76 one 
aspect of the international partnership symbolized by the 
expedition the six team members are from six nations 
corporations and individuals have donated much of the 11 
million it will cost to support them on their sevenmonth 
4000mile trek 
others have crossed antarctica on snowmobiles and giant snow 
tractors but if this group succeeds it would be the first 
unmechanized crossing 
the expedition was marred early when two of stegers 42 sled 
dogs died during an unscheduled repair layover in steamy havana 
cuba 
as unprecedented as stegers attempt to cross the width of 
antarctica will be the attempt by soviet pilots to land their bulky 
ilyushin76 on the hostile continent 
it is a pioneer flight to antarctica said arthur 
chilingarov a soviet official who is escorting the expedition 
south 
the chileanowned runway on king george island is a 4290foot 
strip cut across an isthmus overrunning it means a drop into the 
sea the strip is hardpacked ground during the austral summer but 
now it is hidden beneath 9 inches of ice 
the ilyushin76 a widebellied plane similar to the us 
militarys c141 and capable of carrying some 88000 pounds is 
more typically flown from concrete runways stretching to 8250 feet 
chief pilot stanislav bliznyuk top test pilot for the ilyushin 
air manufacturing concern has never landed one on ice

a woman carrying a severely deformed fetus was 
left with a choice of a 250mile trip to get an abortion or going 
to another state because of the supreme courts ruling on 
missouris abortion law a newspaper reported sunday 
in its ruling july 3 the us supreme court said missouri can 
bar public hospitals from performing abortions within hours of 
that decision truman medical center a public hospital in kansas 
city ordered its doctors to stop performing abortions 
the st louis postdispatch reported that a 24yearold woman 
was referred to a specialist at truman who confirmed through tests 
that the 19weekold fetus she was carrying had deformities that 
made survival outside the womb impossible a doctor familiar with 
the case told the newspaper the fetus heart was outside the chest 
wall and that its abdominal organs were outside the abdominal wall 
before the supreme court decision she would have had a 
therapeutic abortion at truman said dr howard schwartz an 
obstetrician and gynecologist who was a consultant on the case 
truman was believed to be the only site in kansas city where 
secondtrimester abortions were widely available before the supreme 
court ruling after the ruling the nearest clinic in missouri 
where the woman could have gotten a secondtrimester abortion was 
across the state in st louis a 250mile drive 
instead the woman was referred to comprehensive health for 
women a private gynecological clinic in nearby overland park 
kan a kansas city suburb about 20 miles away 
the fetus was aborted in a twoday procedure july 11 and 12 and 
the womans insurance company paid for it 
schwartz said he thought the womans abortion was the first of 
what would turn out to be many cases of missouri women crossing 
to another state or traveling to st louis to obtain abortions 
adele hughey executive director of comprehensive health said 
abortion was the womans only real option 
the condition of the fetus was totally incompatible with 
life hughey said she could have carried the fetus through the 
entire term of pregnancy knowing that the outcome would be a dead 
baby or have an abortion and then try to get pregnant again but 
by carrying the fetus to term she might have jeopardized her own 
health and also delayed another pregnancy

a us diplomat suspected of 
collaborating with the soviets first aroused american suspicions in 
the 1970s but apparently no action was taken austrias foreign 
minister was quoted as saying sunday 
the tabloid kurier quoted foreign minister alois mock as saying 
he was shattered when he heard that his close friend us 
diplomat felix s bloch was suspected of collaborating with soviet 
agents in vienna 
sources in washington said saturday that bloch who has not been 
charged with any crime had access to some of the united states 
most sensitive nonnuclear secrets bloch former deputy chief of 
mission at the us embassy in austria is the highestranking us 
diplomat ever identifed as the target of an intelligence 
investigation involving the soviet union 
mock who studied with bloch at the bologna center of 
baltimores johns hopkins university in 1957 and 1958 said he 
first heard about suspicions regarding bloch three weeks ago 
through austrian channels the tabloid said 
im deeply shaken and really shattered mock was quoted as 
saying 
he said he could not have unwittingly passed sensitive 
information to bloch i was very careful there said mock who 
on friday abruptly postponed a visit to the united states this week 
for personal reasons 
kurier quoted mock as speaking of a certain suspicion on the 
us side reaching back into the 1970s he refused to provide 
details 
but he said that if such suspicions existed its quite 
inexplicable how bloch could stay in such high posts according 
to the tabloid 
mock was in the west austrian city of bregenz on sunday and 
could not be reached for comment a man answering the telephone at 
the foreign ministry in vienna refused to comment on the report or 
to connect a reporter with a spokesman who would 
kurier said the minister described bloch as an overambitious 
career diplomat who always suffered that he had to serve under 
political appointees and never got to be an ambassador himself 
one of the ambassadors bloch served was helene von damm an 
austrianborn appointee of president reagan who caused a scandal 
in viennese society by marrying peter guertler owner of the citys 
famed hotel sacher 
ms von damm who was not reachable at her vienna residence 
sunday resigned in june 1985 citing speculation that her marriage 
constituted a conflict of interest with her diplomatic duties 
bloch came to vienna in 1980 as head of the embassys economics 
section and was later appointed deputy chief of mission he ran the 
vienna embassy after ms von damms resignation until ronald s 
lauder arrived in april 1986 
lauder said saturday that he demanded that bloch be recalled in 
the summer of 1987 because he went outside of channels he 
went around me in dealing with the austrian foreign ministry 
bloch was too close to the austrian government and extremely 
close to the foreign minister lauder said 
relations between the united states and austria were strained at 
the time of blochs recall over the us decision to place 
president kurt waldheim on a watch list of persons barred from 
entering the united states 
that decision announced in may 1987 resulted from waldheims 
world war ii past as a german soldier with the nazis in the 
balkans waldheim had kept his balkans service a secret until 1986 
when austrian and us media and the world jewish congress 
disclosed it during a bitter presidential campaign in austria 
waldheim has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the balkans 
mock who until recently was leader of the conservative peoples 
party has been one of waldheims staunchest backers and recently 
launched another effort to try to get the president removed from 
the watch list

an appellate court panel probably withdrew 
its opinion ordering topeka to do more to integrate its schools 
because the majority wants to respond to a dissenting judges 
criticism lawyers in the brown vs board of education 
desegregation case said sunday 
the 10th us court of appeals withdrawal of the opinion 
without explanation last week had baffled both sides in the case 
this is purely my speculation said rich jones a topeka 
lawyer who represents the plaintiffs in the 38yearold case but 
i think somewhere in the dissent someone is criticizing somebody 
else and the majority wants an opportunity to respond to that 
criticism 
charles mcatee of topeka one of the attorneys who argued the 
case for the school board said he would tend to agree with mr 
jones 
the other possibility mcatee said is the dissenting judge 
has persuaded one of the other two judges to join him in his view 
but quite frankly i think thats unlikely 
on friday the panel informed attorneys it was pulling back its 
june 2 ruling which had reversed a district court judges opinion 
that topeka was substantially in compliance with the landmark 1954 
us supreme court decision that ended racial segregation in the 
nations schools 
the courts notice gave no reason for the withdrawal 
the most pessimistic interpretation for the plaintiffs jones 
agreed is that the dissenter in the june ruling by the 
denverbased 10th circuit judge bobby r baldock has persuaded 
one of the two other judges monroe mckay and stephanie seymour to 
reverse their decision 
mcatee said he considered that highly unlikely 
charles n henson and other attorneys advising the topeka board 
of education will meet with school district officials and board 
members monday to outline their best interpretation of what the 
withdrawing of the june decision means 
the case dates to 1951 when the father of linda brown and other 
plaintiffs sued alleging racial segregation in topekas schools 
linda then 6 could not attend a neighborhood school because it 
was for white children only she attended an elementary school for 
black children nearly a mile away 
three years later the supreme court struck down the concept of 
separate but equal schools for blacks and whites in the united 
states 
in 1979 plaintiffs represented by jones and other lawyers asked 
that the case be reopened to see if the topeka board of education 
had lived up to the supreme courts mandate to integrate its 
schools 
after seven years of discovery and a monthlong trial in october 
1986 a judge ruled in april 1987 that remaining racial imbalances 
in topekas schools are the result of housing patterns and not the 
result of decisions by the school board he also said evidence 
showed children attending schools with higher percentages of 
minorities did not receive an inferior education 
the plaintiffs appealed that ruling to the 10th circuit which 
heard arguments in october 1987 and did not issue a ruling until 
last month 
jones noted that recent us supreme court opinions frequently 
contain a dialogue between the majority and minority and said 
judges mckay and seymour may want to respond to what baldock had to 
say 
when the majority of the threejudge 10th circuit panel issued 
its ruling it didnt wait for baldocks dissent to be included

the cabinet on sunday reaffirmed prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs plan for palestinian elections rejecting 
conditions that hardliners tried to attach to it and defusing a 
crisis that threatened the coalition government 
during the cabinet session about 1 million israeli workers 
staged a twohour strike to protest growing unemployment about 
2000 workers demonstrated outside shamirs office 
in the occupied west bank police reported an israeli taxi 
driver was stabbed three times by two palestinian passengers who 
fled on foot spokesman shalom ben hemo said police were 
investigating if the crime was tied to the uprising 
ten palestinians were wounded in clashes with the army in the 
occupied lands arab hospital officials said the army confirmed 
two palestinians were shot in the west bank and said it was 
investigating the other reports 
the plobacked underground leaders of the uprising issued a 
leaflet sunday that called for an escalation of the revolt and 
again dismissed the shamir plan as an effort to gain more time 
and more opportunities to assassinate the revolt 
the cabinet vote was worked out as a compromise with vice 
premier shimon peres head of the leftleaning labor party which 
had threatened to withdraw from the likudled coalition cabinet 
over the proposed amendments 
they included postponing the elections until the 19monthold 
palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip ends 
the cabinet which first approved the plan in may voted 214 
with one abstention to approve it without the conditions pushed by 
industry minister ariel sharon of likud and other party hardliners 
sharon joined two other likud members in voting against the 
compromise another dissenter was science minister ezer weizman of 
labor who criticized the plan for not urging peace talks between 
israel and the palestine liberation organization 
emerging from the fourhour cabinet session peres said the 
decision was something we can live with 
if the peace initiative is the only guiding line of the 
government we shall stay in the government peres told 
reporters today we clarified there is just one guideline 
labors threat to topple israels 8monthold government came on 
july 12 a week after the hardline demands were tacked onto the 
peace plan at a likud central committee meeting 
the israeli peace plan first approved by the cabinet on may 14 
calls for the 17 million palestinians in the west bank and gaza 
strip to elect representatives to negotiate with israel on limited 
selfrule in the territories 
it calls for later negotiations on the final status of the 
occupied territories 
the likud on july 5 voted to delay any elections until the 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule in the territories has 
ended it also said the 140000 palestinians in east jerusalem 
should be excluded from the vote israel annexed east jerusalem as 
part of its capital after its capture from jordan in the 1967 
middle east war 
the hardline conditions prompted denunciations by the plo and 
criticism from the united states which has been trying to persuade 
the palestinians to accept the election plan 
sundays statement made no reference to those conditions it 
said 
the peace initiative as approved by the government on may 14 
and brought before parliament is hereby approved stands as it is 
and is valid and exists without any changes or amendments 
the government continues to operate and will operate in 
accordance with the peace initiative which obligates the members of 
government as it was accepted 
israel radio reported weizman a former defense minister told 
sundays closeddoor session that he rejected the shamir plan 
because if we want peace we have to talk to the plo 
israel refuses to talk to the plo 
the cabinet also voted sunday to add 75 million to the defense 
budget for battling the uprising 
at least 518 palestinians have been killed as a result of 
israeli actions in the uprising and another 83 have been slain by 
palestinians who accused them of collaborating with israel 
thirtyseven israelis have died in the revolt

the bush administration is short some 
personnel because it has bowed to intimidation from 
ultraconservatives and singleinterest groups on appointments 
an oklahoma official complained sunday 
robert fulton oklahomas secretary of social services said 
pressure from the national right to life committee cost him a 
subcabinet post for which he was recruited by health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan 
fulton blamed a triangle of conservatives in outside groups 
congress and the white house for blocking his selection and that of 
other mainstream republicans with solid government credentials 
fulton writing in the outlook section of the washington 
post laid some of the blame at president bushs door citing his 
lack of personal involvement in dealing with subcabinet 
appointments 
bush has left them to the mercies of white house chief of 
staff john sununu said fulton 
sununu himself far to the right of the republican mainstream 
has created a substantial network of rightwing transition staff 
and other insiders whose life blood is politics rather than 
government the oklahoma official charged 
having little appreciation of the difficult challenge of 
running government they believe appointments should provide 
political rewards and always be made with an eye to the next 
election said fulton 
bush never formally nominated fulton as assistant secretary of 
hhs for the family support administration the top federal welfare 
post 
fulton said he was unable to overcome opposition from the right 
to life committee and several conservative senators who blamed him 
for allowing children born with spina bifida to be denied care at 
the childrens hospital of oklahoma 
fulton denied the charges saying he was working in washington 
when the alleged denials of care took place in 197782 and that he 
took prompt action after becoming oklahomas director of human 
services in 1983 to enhance protections for children with 
disabilities 
he said sununu the former governor of new hampshire was 
reluctant to send nominations to the senate for confirmation if 
there is apt to be vigorous opposition by a single republican 
senator 
several conservative gop lawmakers including sens jesse helms 
of north carolina and gordon humphrey of new hampshire objected to 
fulton according to his account 
on june 1 sullivan the hhs secretary called to say he had 
concluded that we were at the end of the rope and fulton 
agreed to drop his candidacy 
jettisoning my nomination was a small price for the white 
house to pay in keeping peace with some of the extremists who are 
for the moment in the presidents corner fulton said 
he said sullivan has also had his choice to run the medicare and 
medicaid programs drew e altman a new jersey official blocked 
and attorney general richard thornburgh had to abandon his choice 
for the no 2 job in the justice department new york attorney 
richard b fiske jr 
more than six months into the bush administration dozens of 
key jobs still are not filled said fulton 
the bush administration is being intimidated by 
ultraconservatives and singleissue pressure groups fulton said 
their de facto vetoes are depriving the bush 
administration of people who can help it effectively run the 
federal government he said 
at the white house spokesman steven hart declined comment on 
fultons allegations except to say we choose the nominees who 
are the right people for the job in our judgment the names go 
forward accordingly

more than 100 jewish students from 
western europe demonstrated outside a roman catholic convent at the 
edge of auschwitz on sunday and exchanged bitter words with several 
hundred poles 
it was the second weekend of protests at the carmelite convent 
but there was no repeat of the july 14 incident in which an 
american rabbi and six students were dragged away by convent 
construction workers after occupying the grounds for five hours 
israels holocaust remembrance authority sunday issued a protest 
to poland over the presence of the cloister 
the convent was founded in 1984 in a former nazi warehouse a few 
feet from the barbed wire fence and guard towers of the death camp 
where an estimated 4 million people including 25 million jews 
were put to death during world war ii 
the cloisters lawn with a 23foot wooden cross in the middle 
is a former gravel pit where prisoners were gunned down by nazi 
executioners in 1940 and 1941 
we have nothing against the carmelites but we are against 
them praying at this place said borem laurent a brussels 
resident and chairman of the union of jewish students of belgium 
the group also included students from holland switzerland and 
england 
the 107 demonstrators organized by the european union of jewish 
students sat for 20 minutes about 15 feet outside the convent gate 
several hundred area residents including couples with children 
stood nearby saying they came to defend the convent 
it is as though really they dont want to understand 
bernard suchecky said of the poles watching the protest i dont 
understand the obstinacy of marking every square inch with a 
cross 
yitzhak arad of israels holocaust remembrance authority said in 
jerusalem the event in which jews were attacked at the auschwitz 
camp could have been avoided if the church authorities concerned 
with the matter fulfilled their promise in time 
arad in a cable to wladyslaw loranc polands minister of 
religious affairs appealed for a speedy transfer of the convent 
from the auschwitz extermination camp in order to avoid such 
sorrowful cases in which either side is not interested 
an agreement signed in geneva in 1987 set a feb 22 deadline for 
moving the nuns to a planned interfaith center away from the death 
camp the deadline passed and construction on the new interfaith 
center had not started 
on friday the staterun polish news agency reported that land 
nearly 2000 feet from the auschwitz fence was purchased for the 
center this month and that construction will begin next year 
the nuns dont pray just for poles here they pray for all 
people who perished here one member of the spectating crowd told 
the demonstrators 
another yelled out theyll demand that the pope be removed 
too before long 
when the students left the nuns unlocked their gate to let out 
several people as a nun approached the fence a woman outside told 
her just call us again if someone else bothers you and we will 
come back to defend you 
the nun would not answer reporters questions

more than a year before the next 
election national democrats looked sunday in the granite state for 
a way to crack the republican lock on the states congressional 
delegation 
wed love to have a toehold up here said rep beryl 
anthony dark chairman of the democratic congressional campaign 
committee 
new hampshire is the only new england state without a democrat 
in congress both of new hampshires house members and both its 
senators are republicans the last democratic congressman norman 
damours lost in the reagan landslide of 1984 
now the man who beat damours republican rep robert smith is 
running for the senate to replace the retiring sen gordon 
humphrey rnh the prospect of an openseat race in 1990 has 
given democrats hope where there was none 
well target no more than 20 races this is one on that 
list said rep mike synar dokla who is heading up the 
democratic house candidate recruiting effort 
george bruno the former state democratic party chairman who is 
looking at the race himself assured the delegation from washington 
that this is a winnable seat 
he made that assessment even though john sununu the former new 
hampshire governor who is now president bushs chief of staff is 
expected to make a major effort on behalf of the gop 
since sununus departure the states economy has gone soft and 
along with it the tax revenue base forcing the gopcontrolled 
state house to raise a variety of fees and levies this year 
but he urged the national leaders to help local democrats unite 
and avoid a bloody primary fight 
if all of us go at it i dont think the seat is winnable 
he said 
but a primary appears nearly certain and while the national 
organization can provide up to 50000 in direct and indirect help 
it cant force local candidates to unite behind one 
anthony and synar met with four potential candidates in the 
congressional district and two of them ideological opponents 
said they almost certainly were in the race 
attorney joe keefe a mainstream democrat who ran against smith 
in last years election and was beaten by about 60 percent to 40 
percent plans to run again he did 4 points better than democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis did in new hampshire and 
says he can win without that drag on the top of the ticket 
state sen robert stephen a former state golden gloves champion 
and owner of two bobbys lamb on the run restaurants in 
manchester says he has the conservative credentials the states 
voters demand with a strong antitax record 
stephen has already formed an exploratory committee for the race 
and is raising moneyi know i can win this he told the 
congressmen 
also considering entering the primary which is more than a 
year away is stockbroker jim demers he ran for the seat in 1986 
and received 44 percent of the vote against smith 
anthony and synar also met with candidates in rhode island and 
from vermont on their first recruiting trip for the 1990 elections

chancellor helmut kohl said sunday the 
kremlin is considering establishing an ethnic german settlement in 
the soviet union to attract foreign investment 
there are intensive talks going on in the soviet party 
leadership in the politburo and in the government over whether 
settlements for minorities and the ethnic germans are an 
important minority there should be set up kohl said in a radio 
interview 
the bonnbased die welt newspaper reported in its weekend 
edition that soviet officials are engaged in discrete talks with 
western experts about the possibility of setting up free trade 
zones around leningrad in the baltic area near kaliningrad and 
in siberia 
die welt said west germany was especially interested in the 
proposal for an ethnic german settlement in the kaliningrad region 
a pocket of about 6000 square miles of the russian republic 
wedged between poland and soviet lithuania 
the port city of kaliningrad was known as koenigsberg before it 
came under soviet control after world war ii it is a closed 
region presumably because it contains strategic naval bases 
now mainly populated by ethnic russians kaliningrad was once a 
center of commerce for germanys eastern territories before the war 
large groups of germans live in the central asian republic of 
kazakhstan where they were forcibly relocated from the volga 
region and bessarabia by the late josef stalin before and during 
the war 
kohl in the interview with deutschlandfunk radio stopped short 
of saying the talks centered on the creation of an autonomous 
region for ethnic germans in the soviet union but they are 
going in this direction he said 
die welt said such a settlement in the kaliningrad region could 
lure west german and american companies to create joint ventures 
and give a new home to displaced german minorities 
kohl said about 2 million ethnic germans live in the soviet 
union 
the majority of them want to remain in the soviet union 
kohl said but they also want to retain their identity as ethnic 
germans and hope that an ethnic german territory or republic 
can again be set up there 
kohl said soviet president mikhail s gorbachev expressed a 
positive interest and favorable evaluation of such a 
development during his visit to bonn in june 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov hinted 
during the visit that one proposal called for establishing an 
ethnic german region in kaliningrad but said it was one of 
several ideas 
the establishment of such a region would serve the dual purpose 
of boosting west germansoviet business ties and stemming the flow 
of ethnic germans to west germany 
as the kremlin has relaxed restrictions on the emigration of 
those of german ancestry tens of thousands of ethnic germans have 
left their soviet homes to resettle in west germany 
west germanys constitution recognizes a right by all people of 
german nationality to return to their homeland and massive outlays 
for housing language instruction and work training have been 
required to help the soviet germans resettle 
about 50000 soviet germans arrived in west germany in 1988 
alone

the lanky strike leader smiled in 
the gloom of the west siberian hotel room puffed deeply on a 
strong russian cigarette smiled and said i never thought i 
would have this conversation 
they used to tell us that foreign corresondents wanted to come 
here to mark our factories on their maps so they could drop nuclear 
bombs on them said vyacheslav g akulov 
now you come here to cover our strike 
akulov 38 one of 26 members of the strike committee in the 
kuznetsk coal basin of western siberia is amazed at the changes 
taking place in his country 
like other strike leaders interviewed thursday and friday in 
prokopyevsk he expressed more hope than anger in explaining the 
miners demands and he radiated confidence at government 
concessions that sent the miners back to work on friday 
hundreds of thousands of miners elsewhere in the country remain 
on strike in the largest industrial job action in the soviet union 
in 60 years 
the miners like nearly everyone else in the soviet union have 
been watching nationally televised sessions of the new congress of 
peoples deputies which met in may and june and the reconstituted 
supreme soviet the standing parliament 
the lawmakers have inspired the nation with step after 
unprecedented step rejecting cabinet nominees and criticizing the 
armed forces the kgb and other former sacred cows of soviet 
communism 
on july 11 coal miners in mezhdurechensk near prokopyevsk and 
1200 miles east of moscow decided it was their turn to speak out 
and began a strike that at its height involved half the nations 1 
million coal miners and stretched from the arctic to central asia 
and the ukraine 
the miners want better benefits and higher wages so they can buy 
westernstyle goods they also want the right to strike and more 
representative trade unions 
among the lawmakers that akulov admires most is andrei d 
sakharov the nobel peace prize winner who was sent into external 
exile in 1980 for his dissident views but who has since been 
rehabilitated 
before we were told that sakharov was antisoviet and we 
believed them now we find out that he was the conscience of the 
nation one of the few people who had the courage to stand up and 
speak the truth when it was dangerous thats what we all need to 
do now said akulov 
akulov from the city of anzherosudzhensk at the northern end 
of the kuznetz basin or kuzbass is an engineer who installs steel 
supports in the deep mines of the region he has the sinewy arms 
and gaunt face of many siberian miners 
akulov who has rarely left the kuznetz basin and never before 
met a westerner says he has no trouble envisioning the demise of 
the oneparty communist system and the development of several 
parties contending for popular support 
thats like you have in the united states isnt it several 
parties present their ideas in the legislature debate them and 
find a compromise that how it should be thats what we need he 
said bringing his fists together 
akulov grinned showing several gold teeth 
if i had said these things even five years ago i would have 
been asking for a trip even deeper into siberia he said but 
its good that were tearing down the iron curtain and now can 
learn what goes on abroad 
besides their demands for higher living standards and political 
reforms the miners want a greater voice in managing their industry 
a demand they won in the agreement that sent them back to work on 
friday 
coal mines in the kuzbass will remain under the coal mining 
industry but starting jan 1 they may form regional associations 
with the right to market coal they produce above and beyond the 
government quota 
the miners hope to eliminate the state quota step by step 
said akulov and to achieve what the soviets call regional economic 
autonomy 
it is hard to say exactly where this idea came from but it 
was not born all at once he said it had been building for a 
long time 
government leaders say the idea needs to be worked out by the 
legislature but the fact they have agreed to it at all marks a 
major step in the decentralization of economic decisionmaking 
power which has been concentrated in moscow since the 1917 
bolshevik revolution

the government accepted proposals by 
president mobutu sese seko of zaire for monitoring a ceasefire in 
angolas 14yearold civil war according to an official statement 
sunday 
but usbacked guerrillas saturday requested a weeks break in 
peace talks to consult with the leaders of the rebel group the 
national union for the total independence of angola 
mobutu is mediating the negotiations in the zairean capital of 
kinshasa 
the angolan government did not release details of his proposals 
but the zairean leader said last week they included installing a 
radio link between luanda kinshasa and the guerrillas southeast 
angolan bush headquarters of jamba 
angolan armed forces chief antonio dos santos franca who headed 
the government delegation was quoted by angolas government media 
as saying rebel negotiators agreed to some of mobutus proposals 
but wanted to discuss others 
the talks which began wednesday are scheduled to resume on 
july 31 
they marked the second time the two sides have met since rebel 
leader jonas savimbi and angolan president jose eduardo dos santos 
sealed a truce with an historic handshake at a june 22 summit of 18 
african leaders in mobutus ancestral village of gbadolite 
under the gbadolite agreement a ceasefire began june 24 and 
both sides agreed to create a joint commission mediated by mobutu 
to work toward peace 
dos santos withdrew his delegation from the first round of talks 
on july 1 saying the rebels had violated the ceasefire the 
angolan state news agency continued to report guerrilla attacks as 
negotiations ended saturday 
the rebels have made counter charges of government truce 
violations 
however sources close to the government said in luanda sunday 
the talks were developing normally 
its necessary first of all to consolidate the ceasefire and 
later we can go on to discuss political questions you cant 
have negotiations on peace if the war continues dos santos 
franca was reported as saying 
since the gbadolite meeting there has been confusion over just 
what the angolan government and rebels agreed to in the accord 
the government claims savimbi pledged to leave the country 
temporarily while members of his movement are integrated into 
society 
savimbi has denied he agreed to exile however rebel spokesmen 
have rejected integration calling instead for the formation of a 
transitional government comprised of members of both sides to 
prepare for general elections 
the guerrillas have fought to share control since the marxist 
government took power shortly after angolas independence from 
portugal in 1975 
formerly the rebels biggest backer south africa pledged to 
halt aid to savimbi in a ussponsored agreement signed with cuba 
and angola in new york in december the united states continues to 
send the rebels about 15 million a year 
under the new york accord cuba has begun withdrawing its 50000 
troops helping the angolan government

fax machines can be fun particularly 
when a newspaper receives a governors private memo instead of the 
press release its supposed to get 
gov guy hunts press secretary terry abbott last week 
inadvertently sent the birmingham news a memo addressed to hunt 
instead of an intended news release via a fax machine 
ive noticed that youve been saying that last week was the 
best single week in the history of the state for economic 
development and that nichii is the largest grocery store chain in 
the world the memo said 
last week was one of the best weeks but we cant claim the 
best because the ge announcement in 1981 was 15 billion all by 
itself you probably should just stick to saying what you said last 
week at the news conference that it was one of the best weeks in 
history 
as you said in your original statement that day on the steps 
of the mansion nichii is one of the largest grocery store chains 
in the world not the largest 
abbott who the newspaper said was obviously embarrassed called 
the news and explained the error in transmission destroy the memo 
he said 
we shall eventually the newspaper replied in a story

a county planner who initially feared 
thieves had stolen a beach now believes the sand was washed away by 
the columbia river during lunch 
kim jacobsen said thursday that the gleaming white beach west of 
the dalles was missing the wasco county planner said scoop 
marks on the riverbank led her to believe someone with a barge 
and bulldozer had taken the beach 
but a biologist said friday that he watched the beach disappear 
during lunch on monday 
kevin schacher and two other biologist aides for the oregon 
department of fish and wildlife were tagging sturgeon on the 
columbia river when they decided to take a lunch break at squally 
point beach 
as they finished their sandwiches the three men heard a strange 
bubbling sound and walked toward the rivers edge 
cracks started appearing in the beach maybe a foot apart 
schacher said then a piece cracked and fell into the water then 
another and another the cracks started coming farther apart 
as the trio watched a powerful whirlpool pulled more and more 
of the sand into the river 
a surge of water as the us army corps of engineers raised and 
lowered water levels in the pool behind bonneville dam probably 
undercut the bank and caused the sand to slough away jacobsen said 
it seems less of a mystery now she said after hearing 
schachers tale

theyre at it again in bruno a year after 328 
volunteers attracted international attention by lifting a 9ton 
twostory barn by hand and carrying it more than 143 feet to a new 
location 
herman ostry the original lift planner and his friends want to 
do it again next sunday although this lift will be less strenuous 
the barn still weighs 9 tons and still rises two stories off the 
butler county countryside but the carrying and twisting wont be 
needed this time 
we need an additional eight inches of cement blocks under it 
so well be lifting it about 10 inches ostry said 
last years feat was the highlight of the centennial celebration 
for this village of 150 residents about 65 miles west of omaha 
more than 3500 people overflowed the village to watch 328 
volunteers move the massive 60yearold barn 
although this years lift is functional its also ceremonial 
occurring on the first anniversary of the lift

the new head of chinas communist party put his 
stamp of leadership on the governing party with the release sunday 
of an essay on discipline 
jiang zemin takes a hard line on fighting corruption and 
enforcing obedience to central leadership both issues that senior 
party leaders have accused his predecessor zhao ziyang of 
neglecting zhao was ousted as party leader last month after troops 
crushed the prodemocracy movement led by university students 
jiangs essay was printed in full in the magazine party building 
and summarized in leading newspapers sunday 
we must sternly observe unified party discipline namely the 
individual obeys the group the minority obeys the majority the 
lower levels obey the upper levels the whole party obeys the 
center jiang says 
we cannot allow the unchecked spread of individualism 
separatism and money worship 
the peoples daily said the essay was written in may the 
crackdown on dissent began june 34 when troops fired on unarmed 
demonstrators and drove them from beijings tiananmen square the 
government says about 200 people were killed chinese witnesses and 
western intelligence reports say as many as 3000 died 
it was the second essay by jiang to be widely disseminated in 
recent weeks in the first jiang wrote about the dangers of 
allowing businessmen to get too rich from private enterprise 
in the essay published sunday jiang said today many peoples 
thinking is lively and they dare to express various views which 
of course is a good thing 
but we party members must ponder deeply new ideological trends 
and public opinion and keep clear heads 
he made no reference to bourgeois liberalism or 
westernstyle liberal thinking which party leaders blame for the 
prodemocracy demonstrations 
there were these other developments 
the british broadcasting corp reported that explosives were 
set off in midjuly in a post office on hainan island but said it 
was not known if the blast was linked to the political turmoil 
the bbc attributed its report to a hainan radio broadcast that 
said investigators reported nitroglycerin exploded in the post 
office it gave no further details 
several explosions have been reported on trains since the 
studentled protests were crushed the worst occurred june 26 when 
dynamite exploded on a shanghaibound train killing 24 people 
an official report in the china daily said china plans to 
apply for 500 million in new loans from the world bank this year 
or early next year 
the report did not mention that the world bank has postponed 
considering an earlier application by china for loans totaling 
7802 million according to the newspaper report china wants the

voters cast ballots sunday in the first 
primary elections ever held by the ruling nationalist party as part 
of the governments program of democratic reforms 
the opposition democratic progressive party also held primaries 
to select candidates for national and local elections in december 
many members of the nationalist party had objected to the 
previous system of party leaders selecting candidates for national 
elections 
there were long lines of voters at many of the nations 1534 
polling stations which opened at 8 am and closed at 6 pm 
officials estimated that 50 percent of the eligible voters 
participated 
results were expected to be announced monday 
about 198 million nationalists and the 20000 members of the 
democratic progressive party were eligible to vote in the 
primaries taiwans population is estimated at 20 million 
the democratic progressive party was formed three years ago in 
defiance of martial law and was technically illegal until earlier 
this year when it registered with the interior ministry 
during the primary campaign critics claimed nationalist party 
leaders have a list of preferred candidates who will be nominated 
regardless of the results of the primary balloting 
there were 662 nationalist members registered to run in the 
primaries for national legislative seats provincial assembly posts 
and county and city offices 
the democratic progressives chose among 52 candidates for 48 
offices they did not run in many districts for the 101 seats in 
the legislative yuan that are at stake in the dec 2 election the 
yuan is taiwans highest lawmaking body 
in the nationalist primary candidates who win 50 percent or more 
of the vote in individual consituencies will not be guaranteed a 
place on the december ballot instead they will be listed as 
important references in the preliminary stage of the campaign 
thus allowing party elders to maintain some control over the choice 
of candidates 
candidates who win a majority of the votes in the democratic 
progressive primaries will be assured of a spot on the partys 
ticket

national convention here sunday by agreeing to explore the

needs 
now president molly yard said in an interview that the proposal 
reflected the now memberships total disgust with the 
democratic and republican parties 
we are 52 percent of the country and we have almost no 
representation ms yard said as a whole the majority is 
voting against women all the time were sick of it 
the convention also passed a resolution called a bill of 
rights for the 21st century 
the resolution called for an expansion of the bill of rights to 
include 
freedom from discrimination on the basis of race sex sexual 
orientation or age 
freedom from government interference in abortion or birth 
control and the right of women to receive public funds for 
abortions birth control and pregnancy services

states 
to pass federal legislation that will ensure abortion rights

the total hydraulic failure that sent 
united flight 232 out of control also caused the worst singleplane 
disaster in history in 1985 but pilots still dont train for it 
says a former dc10 flight instructor 
if it had only been partial hydraulic failure i think he 
could have handled it tom eanes said of capt al c haynes 
pilot of the united dc10 that crashed last week at sioux city 
iowa the disaster killed 110 of the 296 people aboard 
we train for that but we dont train for what he faced 
because the airplane isnt controllable eanes a resident of 
grand prairie texas said in a telephone interview saturday 
its incredible said retired dc10 flight engineer joe 
sullivan of richardson texas who was also interviewed by 
telephone i just cant believe it was successful 
eanes said flight 232s problems were similar to the 
catastrophic loss of hydraulic fluid that crippled a japan air 
lines boeing 747 in 1985 in that case hydraulic lines ruptured 
after the aft pressure bulkhead blew out 
the pilot of the jal airplane maneuvered for 30 minutes by 
varying thrust from different engines before the aircraft crashed 
into a mountain causing the worst singleplane air disaster ever 
as 520 people died four survived 
jack gamble boeing commercial airplane spokesman pointed out a 
difference between the two cases 
the jal pilot was trying to keep altitude because he was over 
mountainous terrain he was trying to turn and get back to an 
airport but he was over mountainous terrain it was quite a long 
distance to the airport in the dc10 case he wasnt that far from 
an alternate airport 
he jal pilot did succeed in turning he was headed back 
toward tokyo when he crashed into the mountain the problem was he 
couldnt keep altitude 
united flight 232s crew aided by an offduty pilot who rushed 
to the cockpit to help used differential engine thrust from their 
remaining two wingmounted engines to control the widebodied jet 
after its tailmounted engine apparently blew apart and destroyed 
the planes hydraulic system 
with differential engine thrust a plane will slowly turn in the 
direction of the slower engine 
without hydraulic power the crew could not manipulate control 
surfaces on the wings and tail to alter direction raise or lower 
the nose or extend wing slats and flaps that increase lift during 
takeoffs and landings 
flight 232s flight engineer told national transportation safety 
board investigators that the loss of the planes hydraulic fluid 
was immediate giving pilots no time adjust those control 
surfaces 
but the crew managed to guide the airplane to a crash landing at 
sioux gateway airport in sioux city where emergency equipment and 
medics were waiting the crash killed 110 but 186 others survived 
including the flight crew 
eanes said the united crew faced an additional problem 
the damaged tail section assymmetrical drag that is given 
equal power to both remaining engines the plane still turned to 
the right to counter that he said pilots had to overcompensate 
with the right wing engine 
that made the landing attempt even more difficult he said 
theres a certain point where you have to come off the power 
to get on the ground he obviously had to carry more power in one 
engine than the other to overcome asymmetrical drag he said 
eanes who continues to fly for a commercial airline company 
that he asked not be identified noted that without control over 
the wing slats and flaps flight 232s crew was forced to approach 
the landing at least 80 mph faster than normal so the wings 
wouldnt lose lift 
how they ever got down to a reasonable height to even attempt 
a landing is beyond my comprehension said sullivan

women made their voting power felt sunday by 
electing a record number of women to japans upper house of 
parliament in a campaign marked by a sex scandal and a politicians 
derogatory remarks about females 
preliminary returns showed 19 women elected to the house of 
councilors the less powerful chamber of japans bicameral 
legislature far surpassing the previous record of 10 women 
according to kyodo news service 
ten of those elected were supported by the japan socialist 
party led by chairwoman takako doi the partys dramatic gains 
helped strip the ruling liberal democratic party of its upper house 
majority for the first time in 34 years 
the socialists fielded 12 women candidates in the election 
twice as many as in 1986 half of the 252member upper house is 
elected every three years and elections to the more powerful lower 
house are not due until july 1990 
a record 146 women ran in the election up from 82 in the last 
upper house election 
before the election only 10 percent of upper house members were 
women the lower house has only seven women to 505 men 
the large number of women candidates reflected what is being 
called the madonna phenomenon or opposition parties fielding 
female candidates to capitalize on womens displeasure with the 
ruling party 
womens potential clout is enormous among eligible voters 
women outnumber men by 27 million and they are more likely to 
cast ballots 
the female protest vote stemmed from reports that for as long as 
10 years prime minister sousuke uno paid women including 
professional geisha entertainers to be his mistresses uno has not 
denied the allegations but maintains that he did nothing immoral 
equally damaging were comments by agriculture minister hisao 
horinouchi earlier this month that women are useless in 
politics he said their primary task in life is to keep the 
household 
horinouchi further attacked the socialists ms doi saying she 
was unfit to be prime minister because she had never married or had 
children 
he apologized for his remarks but women seized on them to 
assail the ruling party and promote oppositionbacked female 
candidates 
the votes today proved that the people believe women have the 
power to serve in parliament newly elected parliamentarian 
harumi kan said in a television interview ms kan ran with the new 
laborbased confederation group in rural tokushima prefecture 
women voters were also angered by a new 3 percent consumption 
tax forced through parliament by the liberal democrats despite 
opposition protest 
women angered by the tax because they faced higher prices in 
supermarkets rallied under the slogan every day is tax payment 
day in facing ruling party incumbents and challengers 
women candidates made a favorable impression with their stance 
against the consumption tax and household issues yoshitomo 
sakai secretarygeneral of the socialists election committee 
told kyodo 
the popularity of takako doi who made appearances in more 
than 90 places around the country also had a big impact sakai 
was quoted as saying 
kyodo reported that preliminary returns showed that two women 
were elected each from among liberal democrats komeito the no 2 
opposition clean government party and rengonokai the labor 
confederation two women who were elected ran as independents and 
another ran as a communist

a park ranger trying to 
become the first paraplegic to climb 3500foot el capitan 
completed a tough portion of one of the worlds most challenging 
rock climbs sunday 
mark wellman 29 who was disabled in a climbing accident seven 
years ago successfully tackled the shield roof along with lead 
climber mike corbett the ledge juts 40 feet out from the granite 
face of the monolith at 2000 feet above yosemite valley 
he made it over the roof in grand style he just did a super 
job gwen schneider corbetts girlfriend said sunday afternoon 
they are on the headwall now said schneider part of a 
group tracking the two climbers through a telescope theyre 
gonna sleep at the base of the groove pitch his secondmost feared 
pitch a pitch is a climbing distance measured by rope length 
the two climbers however were progressing more slowly than 
expected and on sunday were about two days behind schedule 
schneider estimated wellman and corbett would reach the top of el 
capitan on thursday instead of tuesday 
corbett who has a record 41 ascents of el capitan has been 
climbing ahead of wellman and setting up the ropes wellman then 
pulls himself up using a tbar device 
wellman was left paralyzed from the waist down when he fell 50 
feet during a climb of the 13700foot gables peak south of 
yosemite in 1982 he has since been as active as possible 
directing the parks program for disabled visitors 
although he had climbed many peaks before his accident wellman 
had never tackled el capitan considered a difficult ascent for 
fully ablebodied climbers he estimated beforehand that the climb 
would require about 7000 pullups 
wellman trained for his first el capitan climb with 35 practice 
climbs on other sheer rocks and weight training schneider said he 
also spent 100 hours making his rock chaps special pants to 
protect his legs

a senior american diplomat suspected of 
passing information to the soviets after being recalled from 
austria first aroused us suspicions more than a decade ago 
according to a close friend the austrian foreign minister 
felix s bloch the highestranking us official ever 
implicated in an espionage investigation involving the soviet 
union remained out of sight sunday even as additional bits and 
pieces emerged about his career which included a stint in east 
berlin 
more recently he was the no 2 us official at the us 
embassy in vienna serving at that post at the same time as a 
marine guard subsequently convicted of espionage at the us 
embassy in moscow 
the marine sergeant told investigators he first got involved 
with soviet spies while he was posted in vienna 
austrian foreign minister alois mock a close friend and 
collegemate of blochs was quoted sunday in a european tabloid as 
saying he first heard about the recent allegations of espionage 
three weeks ago through austrian channels 
however he said there was a certain suspicion on the us 
side reaching back into the 1970s 
president bush returning to the white house late sunday from a 
weekend in camp david md ignored reporters shouted questions 
about the investigation 
neighbors told reporters that bloch had been under obvious 
surveillance by the fbi until news accounts of the spy probe aired 
late friday and he disappeared from his plush apartment along 
with the agents who had followed him even when he walked his dog 
abc news reported sunday night that bloch was staying at a 
private home north of new york city abc footage showed two women 
identified as his wife and daughter but not of bloch 
the fbi declined comment sunday however sources had said 
earlier there were no plans to arrest bloch over the weekend 
implying that he remained under surveillance 
in 1985 a former cia agent edward l howard eluded fbi agents 
and fled to the soviet union after being charged with selling 
intelligence secrets to soviet kgb officials in austria 
because bloch had access to sensitive intelligence material 
during his sevenyear posting in austria officials expressed 
concern that he would be in a position to cause grave damage to 
us interests if he shared such secrets with foreign powers 
there were no formal charges against bloch however and us 
officials have declined in their public comments to go beyond 
confirming that he is the target of an intelligence investigation 
and no longer has access to the state department building 
the career diplomat reportedly was filmed by us officials 
earlier this year passing a brief case to a known soviet kgb agent 
in a european city 
vienna was not the only sensitive post where bloch served in 
1974 he was economic counselor in the newly opened us embassy in 
espionagefilled east berlin where he arrived from west berlin 
as events unfolded sunday what emerged was the vision of a 
disgruntled employee who as the former no 2 at the embassy in 
austria had access to a wide array of sensitive mission material 
in vienna long considered an eastwest spy crossroads those who 
knew bloch well ruled out spyswaps for money or ideology 
mock said he was deeply shaken and really shattered 
an administration source familiar with blochs career said he 
was shocked 
sources told abc which initially broke the story that bloch 
claimed he spied because he fell into a soviet sex trap but that 
investigators have discounted that story 
some sources pointed to his frustration over having been passed 
over for an ambassadorship after serving under political appointees 
in austria and running the embassy in vienna for a time 
one of the ambassadors bloch served was helene von damm an 
austrianborn political appointee by former president reagan who 
caused a scandal in viennese society by marrying peter guertler a 
hotel owner she resigned in june 1985 citing speculation that her 
marriage constituted a conflict of interest with her diplomatic 
duties bloch ran the embassy after von damm resigned until ronald 
s lauder arrived almost a year later 
lauder told reporters saturday that he demanded bloch be 
recalled in july 1987 because of insubordination the former 
ambassador said he knew nothing about espionage allegations 
adding if i thought he was a spy i would have had him 
arrested 
officials attempted to assess the damage bloch could have caused 
lauder confirmed bloch had access to classified information 
saying there is enough information that he could do severe 
damage 
sen sam nunn dga a member of the select committee on 
intelligence said sunday on nbcs meet the press that he had 
not been briefed on the case but if a highranking official of 
this nature was involved in spying for the soviet union it could be 
very damaging 
theres no doubt about the fact that the top people in the 
state department the top people in our embassy have access to 
cables from around the word said nunn they have knowledge 
about certain cia operations 
defense secretary dick cheney interviewed sunday on abcs 
this week with david brinkley declined to comment on the depth 
of the possible breach of security saying it would be pure 
speculation at this point and i really cant get into it 
a senate staffer said sunday the fbi apparently did not have 
enough evidence to arrest bloch on criminal charges

continental airlines said sunday an altercation 
aboard one of its jets occurred after the plane touched down and 
did not cause an aborted landing at logan international airport 
the airlines explanation differed from an account given by the 
massachusetts state police after interviewing the crew of flight 
358 
six people including a counsel to the new jersey senate his 
wife and four massachusetts residents were arrested at logan after 
the fight 
steven sackswilner 39 of montgomery township nj and his 
wife joanne 37 were arrested when the flight from trenton nj 
landed at 530 pm saturday according to state police cpl joseph 
howley 
they had a little brawl he said it started out as a 
husband and wife that were sort of running around the plane and 
making demands on the crew and being a general nuisance and 
hollering 
the fight between the couple occurred in the air and expanded 
to involve four other passengers police said the onboard 
confusion led the pilot of the 146passenger md80 aircraft to give 
up on his first landing try said sgt stephen kelley 
they were fighting in the aisles just prior to touch down 
kelley said the pilot was afraid that when the pilot reversed 
throttle on his englines which you do not feel when youre in 
your seat the whole troop that was fighting in the aisles would 
have wound up in the cockpit 
kelley said state police based their explanation on interviews 
with the flight crew he said the fight lasted 15 to 20 minutes 
according to the airline however the fight began and ended 
after the jet landed at logan international airport 
the jet had had to bypass its first landing because a northwest 
airlines jet was slow in taxiing out of the way said ned walker a 
continental spokesman 
i have spoken with the captain who said there was a northwest 
plane on the runway that was slow to clear and resulted in his 
decision to do what they call a goaround walker said 
michael ciccarelli a spokesman for the federal aviation 
administration in boston said sunday that the logan control tower 
heard nothing of an onboard altercation before the landing 
the airplane making a normal approach was given a routine 
goaround because the airplane landing in front of him was slow in 
clearing the runway ciccarelli said 
the faa has opened an investigation into the incident 
sackswilner the chief counsel for the republican minority in 
the new jersey senate faces charges of interference with a flight 
crew disorderly conduct and three counts of assault on a police 
officer howley said sackswilner allegedly fought back at police 
when they boarded the plane and arrested him 
all those arrested were released from the state police lockup 
pending arraignment monday in east boston district court 
mrs sackswilner and three medford residents frank j 
federico 50 his wife camella 48 their son john 22 all face 
charges of interfering with a flight crew as does johns 
19yearold girlfriend laureen belmonte of revere howley said

leftist shining path rebels shot and killed 
the mayor of a highlands town and attacked a major andean mining 
complex in separate incidents police said sunday 
freddy astete mayor of tambo 140 miles east of lima was shot 
in the head by rebels saturday astete 34 was the 51st mayor 
killed in the insurgency that has torn this impoverished nation 
since 1980 
also saturday rebels attacked the mining center of la oroya 
blowing up banks railroad tracks and an electricity generating 
station police said they said the attack paralyzed production in 
the important mining region 95 miles east of lima but that nobody 
was hurt 
the rebels have attacked 138 mining operations in the past four 
years leaving 24 people dead and costing the companies millions of 
dollars in damages and lost production according to government 
figures 
losses to the mining sector since 1980 when the shining path 
first started the attacks amount to 500 million according to the 
government 
the maoistinspired shining path began its insurgency near the 
highland city of ayacucho 235 miles southeast of lima but the 
violence has since spread throughout much of the highlands and into 
the cocagrowing area in the northeast jungles 
in the past rebels attacked the mines mainly to steal dynamite 
but recent attacks appear aimed at destroying machinery and halting 
production peru receives most of its foreign exchange from mining 
exports

investigators used infrared cameras 
sunday to search cornfields for pieces of a shattered jet engine 
from a crashed dc10 while doctors said some survivors could take 
years to recover 
at the site of wednesdays crash of united airliunes flight 232 
officials were painstakingly reassembling the jets tail section in 
hopes of determining what caused the sudden loss of hydraulic 
power loss of control and the fiery airport crash 
ted lopatkiewicz spokesman for the national transportation 
safety board said investigators were focusing on cornfields 60 
miles from the crash scene in hopes of recovering more pieces of 
the airliners tail engine which apparently exploded and severed 
hydraulic lines 
without having the fan section its obviously going to take a 
lot of time he said its always best to get all the 
wreckage 
also sunday investigators continued to interview crew members 
the flight engineer said that immediately after the explosion in 
the no 2 engine the gauges indicated the immediate loss of fluid 
in all three hydraulic systems according to ntsb spokesman jim 
burnett 
authorities were beginning the process of returning home the 
bodies of the crash victims according to a list compiled with 
information from united relatives and employers 105 people were 
confirmed dead and five were still listed as missing 
a spokesman for iowa gov terry branstad said more than 20 
bodies had been sent home by sunday 
hospital officials said 39 people remained hospitalized early 
sunday but some were being dismissed as the day progressed 
lopatkiewicz said nebraska air national guard jets were used to 
carry infrared cameras to photograph a 16squaremile area about 60 
miles from the crash site in a search for metal fragments thrown 
from the engine when it exploded 
we hope those photographs will be able to detect metal that is 
strewn in thick cornfields in that area he said 
burnett said the search for pieces had been hampered because 
some fell in areas where corn is up to 6 feet high 
the areas of the cornfields have to be searched by ground 
he said farmers have been asked to be alert for metal fragments 
the people working the fields out there have been alerted 
burnett said 
investigators said they checked maintenance records on key 
sections of the engine 
theres nothing here that gives us cause for concern at this 
point said burnett although i will say that previous 
accidents have led to reductions in cycles so its not to say that 
this is irrelevant 
the age of engine parts is expressed in cycles which comprise 
one landing and takeoff 
doctors were cautioning that crash victims face a long recovery 
and united officials said they were making plans to aid families of 
the dead 
everybody who survived that crash is going to have a lot of 
potential for problems to overcome said larry foster medical 
director of the burn unit at st lukes regional medial center 
were talking about many many months of initial care and then 
years of rehabilitation if the patient survives he said 
while foster said doctors were trying to move injured victims 
near their homes for lengthy therapy some werent willing to leave 
immediately 
i could leave tomorrow if i wanted to but i really dont feel 
like moving said helen hayes a burn victim from denver im 
very comfortable here i really dont feel like traveling for a 
while 
james guyette a united airlines spokesman said the airline had 
assigned specialists to families of crash victims and gave each a 
separate united phone number to call with questions 
well be maintaining positive contact with them he said 
we will assign a united representative to each family 
at the crash scene while investigators pieced together the 
wreckage others gathered luggage and other personal effects 
storing it in a hangar for families to retrieve 
we are taking great pains to collect everything we can 
identify them and return them guyette said

toward the man that gunned down their daughter 
our experience over the long run cannot be one of anger 
rose said anger gets us nowhere

truth of her life was that she had been a very special person and

adorned with a spray of white blue and mauve flowers gathered with 
a mauve ribbon

from her writing the young man brad silberling broke into tears 
and said he had wanted to marry schaeffer whom he called a 
sparkling soul 
he sobbed as told the mourners she always said i want you 
to hold me so close please hold her so close in your hearts 
a second rabbi likened her writings to those of another young 
woman anne frank and said both had been snuffed out by a 
senseless society 
among the mourners were schaeffers costars on her tv series

prime minister sousuke uno said monday he will 
resign to take responsibility for his partys overwhelming defeat 
in parliamentary elections 
uno who has been in office less than two months did not 
specify when he would step down in the brief announcement on 
national television 
he said he was resigning because the ultimate responsibility 
is mine for the ruling liberal democratic partys defeat in 
sundays elections in losing seats to the socialists the 
governing party lost the upper house of parliament for the first 
time in 34 years 
it was a very difficult election uno said 
uno referred to public criticism of the party over the recruit 
influencepeddling scandal a new 3 percent consumption tax and 
liberalization of agricultural imports as factors contributing to 
the defeat 
he also was severely criticized during his short tenure for 
allegedly keeping paid mistresses 
the people delivered their verdict although we were not able 
to fully debate policy issues with the opposition uno said we 
will listen modestly to the verdict and reflect on what we 
should do 
he said he would remain in office until his successor is 
selected which he said he hoped could be done promptly 
the prime ministers departure will mean the resignation of the 
entire cabinet and a restructuring of the liberal democratic 
partys leadership 
the conservative party conceded defeat on sunday 
we were beaten and all i can say is that the opposition did 
splendidly the partys secretarygeneral ryutaro hashimoto said 
this is the result of the peoples choice said opposition 
leader takako doi whose socialists gained more seats than the 
liberal democrats according to projections 
the setback was expected to increase pressure for elections for 
the more powerful lower house of parliament they are not due until 
july 1990 
voters decided half of the upper houses 252 seats in sundays 
balloting 
kyodo said monday that its projections so far showed that the 
socialists would win 42 seats and the liberal democrats 33 
eleven seats were projected for the new laborbased 
confederation group eight for the clean government party three 
for the centrist democratic socialists three for the communists 
and the rest for independents and minor parties 
the socialists needed to win 84 seats for a majority in the 
upper house but ran only 54 candidates so they led efforts to 
create an opposition coalition with the clean government party 
democratic socialists and the socialist democratic federation 
final returns were expected monday evening 
without control of the upper house the liberal democrats would 
find it harder to pass legislation the chamber can defeat bills 
and it can delay but not veto the budget and diplomatic treaties 
a loss in the lower house also threatens the liberal democrats 
hold on the prime ministry for the first time since the party was 
formed in 1955 the lower house chooses the prime minister 
a heavy turnout by japans 903 million eligible voters 
reflected strong feelings over scandals and other issues that have 
eroded the popularity of the liberal democrats 
noboru takeshita resigned as prime minister last month to take 
responsibility for the recruit scandal in which the recruit co 
publishing conglomerate was accused of doling out millions of 
dollars in underpriced stocks and political donations to obtain 
favors 
uno takeshitas successor has been battered by allegations 
that for as long as 10 years he kept paid mistresses he has not 
denied the allegations but has denied he did anything immoral 
the accusations forced uno to keep a low profile during the 
campaign 
the liberal democrats also have suffered because farmers 
traditional supporters of the party opposed government moves to 
open japans agricultural market wider to imports 
the socialists rallied voters against the new 3 percent sales 
tax that was heavily backed by the governing party 
the socialists putting forward a record number of women 
candidates took advantage of homemakers anger over the tax which 
was bulldozed through parliament by the liberal democrats last year 
despite an opposition boycott the tax took effect april 1 
although ms doi is immensely popular her party has been widely 
accused of lacking a realistic and unified platform partly because 
of a small but radical faction 
in the past it has called for japan to disband its selfdefense 
forces and scrap the usjapan security treaty under which about 
64000 us troops are stationed in japan 
socialist leaders now say they would not immediately do away 
with the armed forces and that they seek only to revise the 
treaty but ms doi and others have said all us warships entering 
japanese ports should be inspected and denied entry if nuclear arms 
are found

two burning railroad tank cars kept 
hundreds of people away from home for a second day sunday as 
hazardous materials experts decided the safest course was to let 
the chemical fires burn themselves out 
one of the cars that caught fire in the 14car derailment 
saturday burned itself out sunday afternoon but the other was 
still aflame said r lindsey leckie a spokesman for csx 
transportation inc which owns the train 
the experts believed the second fire would burn itself out 
overnight and extended the evacuation of a 15squaremile area 
until sometime monday leckie said 
monitoring around the burning tank cars found no dangerous 
levels of toxic chemicals and no longterm effects to homes or 
possessions were anticipated leckie said 
the burning cars did not threaten other chemicalladen cars in 
the 32car train leckie said earlier 
railroad officials examined the wreck from the air and members 
of the national transportation safety board arrived in the area 
about 100 miles northwest of detroit between midland and saginaw 
the derailments cause wasnt known leckie said the train was 
traveling at about 37 mph when it derailed he said the track was 
most recently inspected by the federal railroad administration and 
csx engineers last tuesday 
the accident sent a fireball and a huge column of smoke into the 
air and the fire that followed destroyed two homes no serious 
injuries were reported ten to 15 people were treated at hospitals 
for smoke inhalation and released leckie said 
officials said there was no way of knowing how many people left 
their homes since many chose to stay with friends or relatives 
rather than in shelters estimates ranged up to about 2000 people 
as evacuees filled hotels and occupied two red cross shelters 
csx was paying for motel rooms meals and emergency clothing for 
the displaced families leckie said 
the hazardous materials team found a large gash in another tank 
car which contained naphtha the highly flammable material 
apparently was the source of the fireball and probably burned 
itself out saturday leckie said 
the car that stopped burning sunday contained acrylic acid a 
chemical used to make plastics which irritates the skin and is 
toxic if inhaled the other contained chlorosilene a flammable 
liquid product made by dow corning corp a joint venture between 
dow chemical co and corning glass works 
the train was on a scheduled run from port huron to midland 
dow chemical co spokesman gary black said some of the chemicals 
on the train were going to the midland cogeneration venture in 
which dow and consumers power co are partners the project is 
converting the utility companys neverfinished nuclear power plant 
to a gasfired plant to generate electricity and steam 
some evacuees at a local high school said they were forced from 
their homes so quickly they couldnt grab a change of clothing 
residents of about 60 homes at the avondale mobile home court said 
authorities rushed them out of the park in freeland about 1 miles 
from the blaze 
they pulled us out before it got too bad we were starting to 
smell it when the police came around said robert bauder 
bauder said that when he left he looked back and saw a billow of 
black smoke so huge it was like a tornado 
the cloud was directly overhead there was the smell of burnt 
insulation said mobile home resident dale turner 
robin mobley 25 was evacuated twice saturday first to a 
midland elementary school a few hours later fumes from the fire 
headed that way and she was sent to the high school 
were resigned to at least two nights here she said ive 
been told so many stories i dont know which one to believe

sousuke uno probably wont go down in history as 
holding japans premiership for the shortest time since world war 
ii that dubious distinction now goes to tanzan ishibashi whose

the shortest 
here is a chronology of his unexpected rise and fall

decide he will replace former prime minister noboru takeshita after 
their first choice masayoshi ito declines 
june 2 parliament confirms uno as prime minister uno says he 
will follow a policy of political reform to win back popularity for 
his party following the damaging recruit influencepeddling scandal 
that forced takeshita to resign 
june 5 the sunday mainichi magazine breaks a taboo on 
disclosing details of politicians private lives and publishes an 
article alleging uno kept a paid geisha mistress the allegation 
does not hurt uno until foreign news media pick up the story and it 
is published outside japan the japanese media then give it wider 
dissemination 
june 9 uno is embarrassed in parliament when an opposition 
socialist member questions him about the geisha allegation he 
declines to respond fueling a barrage of criticism from womens 
organizations 
june 28 after more published allegations of extramarital 
affairs news reports say that uno told a party leadership meeting 
he cannot continue in office but the reports say he is persuaded 
to remain as premier 
july 1416 representing japan at the paris economic summit of 
the seven major industrialized democracies uno promises greater 
aid for the developing world and strong efforts to protect the 
environment 
july 23 elections are held for half the seats in the upper 
house of parliament amid predictions that uno will resign if his 
party fares poorly it does losing its majority for the first time 
in 34 years 
july 24 uno says he will resign but does not immediately set 
a date as was the case before the party chose him as leader there 
is no obvious candidate among the liberal democrats to replace him 
he says he will remain in office until the search ends which could

jim weaver has worked in about 500 
organizing campaigns in 38 years with the united auto workers but 
he says hes never seen anything quite like nissans response to a 
union drive at its only us plant 
as described by weaver the japanese companys tactics sound 
like a cross between jury selection and political campaigning 
about 2400 hourly workers are scheduled to vote wednesday and 
thursday on uaw representation at the 8yearold nissan motor 
manufacturing usa plant one of three nonunion us plants 
owned by japanese automakers 
tennessee is a righttowork state socalled because of laws 
that unions say limit their activity 
that might seem to make organizing in smyrna different from 
organizing in detroit but weaver said that hasnt been a problem 
for the uaw rather the challenge for the union has been to combat 
tactics by the japanese automaker that are usually not seen in this 
country 
first of all they screened their employees carefully on their 
familys union background weaver said im told they promised 
them employment for life then they started the line speed real 
slow then speeded it up 
nissan also has a hightech advantage that union organizers 
could not counter television monitors play procompany messages 
constantly in employee break rooms 
nissan officials declined to discuss the organizing effort in 
detail 
weve got a policy we just dont want to conduct this 
election in the media weve been trying to be quiet said nissan 
usa president jerry benefield 
trying to answer uaw questions is kind of like being in a 
contest between union and management but its not its a contest 
between the union and the employees 
the unions national office has beefed up its organizing staff 
in smyrna for the final two weeks of the campaign from about 10 to 
around 35 uaw workers from across the country said local uaw 
spokesman maxey irwin 
the union representatives and members of the inplant organizing 
committee went on house calls to persuade nissan employees to 
vote for the union 
worker injuries and assembly line speeds have emerged as the 
campaigns main issues nissan lawyers notified the tennessee 
department of labor that the company would appeal a state order to 
release occupational safety and health administration logs that 
detail worker injuries the state labor department issued a 
citation and levied a 5000 fine against nissan for refusal to 
release that information 
the appeals process could take three to six months long after 
the union election is held 
everybodys focusing on this as a makeorbreak situation for 
american labor but business is looking at nissans refusal to 
release the logs as a major blunder irwin said 
dr michael silverstein assistant director of health and safety 
for the uaw said in june that as many as one in five nissan 
workers was injured on the job and lost a work day because of it 
last year 
in april nissan officials reported a worker injury or illness 
rate of 89 per 100 workers for 1987 less than half the rate 
claimed by the union a company spokeswoman in june said the 
company stands by its calculations of worker injury rates she 
declined further comment 
dottie lockhart a production technician at the smyrna plant 
said she didnt know of any injuries during the four years she has 
worked there 
i cant think of anybody thats been hurt or been out of work 
or had to lose any time at all its not heaven up there but its 
not a killing job either lockhart said ive worked at harder 
places and made less money 
lockhart said production line speed is not a problem but she 
cited a new production line task with which workers had trouble 
we had a job and we thought it was too hard and we said 
something about it and nissan did something about it they changed 
the job made it better made it easier she said 
union representatives have said nissans workers make about 
7900 less a year in pay and benefits than their counterparts at 
ford motor co 
but the issue goes beyond just pay and benefits at one plant 
some argue 
steve norris executive director of the conservative tennessee 
business roundtable said the states economic potential would be 
diminished should the uaw represent nissan workers 
i think one reason many industries have located here is that 
were a righttowork state and anything we can do to preserve 
that makes tennessee more attractive

a crucial vote on the b2 bomber is due in 
congress this week but theres been little concern voiced in 
seattle about the future of a program that involves thousands of 
local workers and means billions of dollars for the boeing co 
thats a tough one tom hobson a seattle chamber of 
commerce spokesman said last week when asked whether there had 
been much discussion of the b2s fate by seattles business 
community 
to be honest i havent heard anybody locally talk about it at 
all 
for boeing advanced systems the division of seattlebased 
boeing building parts of the stealth bomber in the city talk about 
the topsecret project has been sparse and carefully phrased 
advanced systems spokesman john kvasnosky said boeings role is 
worth some billions of dollars but we havent released 
specifics 
likewise he wouldnt say exactly what b2 parts boeing makes 
and would only say in excess of 5000 boeing employees work on 
the project 
boeing is the largest of nine washington state subcontractors 
and suppliers for the b2 nationwide prime contractor northrop 
corp says tens of thousands of people at 156 companies in 46 
states are involved in the plane which is assembled at palmdale 
calif 
both the us house and senate this week take up the defense 
authorizaion bill which includes nearly 4 billion for the b2 
theres been strong opposition raised to the b2 by members of both 
parties who are balking at the 70 billion for the 132 b2s sought 
by the air force 
one of the bombers staunchest supporters is rep norm dicks 
dwash who says the program is of major importance to boeing and 
to the future of the aerospace industry 
were talking about 8700 jobs in the seattle area dicks 
said last week boeing is a major subcontractor theyre doing 
the wings on the b2 its a major revolutionary new technology 
the b2 makes extensive use of new lightweight composite 
materials in its construction in part to absorb radar waves to 
make the plane harder to detect dicks said the 22 billion to 23 
billion already spent on the b2 program not only is buying planes 
but pays for research and development into composite materials and 
aircraft design that can be used in other defense projects and in 
commercial aviation 
all of that will have enormous spinoff to the one sector where 
the us still has superiority over all of the world dicks said 
referring to the aviation industry i hate to see that lost 
deduct the research and development costs and the price of a 
single b2 comes down to about 260 million from the 530 million 
figure usually cited he said 
kvasnosky said it was premature to speculate what might happen 
to b2 workers if the program is canceled or extensively cut back 
however its likely many employees could be absorbed elsewhere 
within boeing which has been scrambling for experienced workers on 
its commercial aircraft side boeing commercial airplanes has had 
five straight years of record orders 
several aerospace industry analysts begged off commenting on 
boeing and the b2 saying there just wasnt enough hard 
information 
but paul nisbet an analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york ventured a rough guestimate that the split 
among key companies in the b2 program could be 60 to 65 percent 
for northrop 25 percent for enginemaker general electric co 15 
to 20 percent for boeing and smaller shares to ltv and hughes 
nisbet speculated that remaining work on a fully funded b2 
program could mean 8 billion to 10 billion for boeing and 
possibly close to 1 billion in profit 
boeing has not given out any financial breakdown on the b2 but 
northrop revealed that the bomber accounted for 657 million or 
about half its overall sales for its first quarter this year 
nisbet agreed with dicks that technology being developed for the 
stealth could be valuable especially on the advanced tactical 
fighter a 21st century warplane that advanced systems hopes to 
build with lockheed for the air force 
no question about it theyre blazing a trail in technology 
there wont be any more weapons systems built that wont 
incorporate some of the technology of this research 
the b2 made its first flight last week and a second bomber is 
to start flight tests next month ten more b2s are under 
construction

like the stealth bomber its helping to build 
the boeing cos lobbying effort on capitol hill to save funding 
for the secretive bomber has been until recently almost invisible 
lawmakers and congressional staff said that despite the 
seattlebased aerospace companys major stake in the b2 program 
it has only been in the past week or so that boeing lobbyists have 
contacted members 
they are weighing in now and it is timely said us rep 
norm dicks dwash a member of the defense subcommittee of the 
house appropriations committee and a b2 supporter 
the debate over the stealth bomber appropriation is scheduled to 
reach the house floor this week as members consider amendments that 
range from gutting the program to less crippling reductions in 
funding 
several congressional staffers who asked not to be identified 
said boeings lobbying is usually the most lowkeyed of all the 
aerospace defense contractors 
the difference is that boeing is diversified and has a huge 
backlog of commercial aircraft orders while the others dont 
said one staffer the defense contracts are important to boeing 
but it is not life and death 
northrop the lockheed corp and mcdonnell douglas corp all 
have more heavyhanded lobbying reputations because so much of 
their business is connected with the military the staffer said 
dicks and other lawmakers said boeing had concentrated its 
lobbying on preserving funding for the v22 osprey a short landing 
and takeoff troop carrier for the marine corps boeing helicopters 
in philadelphia is one of the prime contractors on that project 
now that we are down to it on the b2 they are working 
hard said dicks adding that he had personally contacted more 
than 150 members to urge them to support the b2 
dicks is a true believer in the stealth bomber defending it as 
a capable effective deterrent that while expensive is so 
sophisticated it will eventually render soviet air defenses useless 
dicks is also well aware of the impact it will have in 
washington state 
i tell members up front that washington state has a stake in 
this said dicks but i want to make sure they are aware of the 
national security implications 
boeing officials are typically closed mouth about their lobbying 
efforts and the stealth bomber is no exception 
we dont discuss it said george weiss a boeing spokesman 
here 
weiss did say that boeing lobbyists were contacting about 30 
congressmen adding we dont necessarily try to sell a program 
we just keep people informed 
boeing chairman frank shrontz was also reportedly making phone 
calls to key congressmen at weeks end 
one of those who met with boeing lobbyists last week was rep 
rod chandler rwash who said the pitch was about 50 percent on 
the national security need for the bomber and about 50 percent on 
its importance to seattle 
they are very effective and tried to defuse all the 
arguments said chandler adding that he also received a brochure 
on the b2 program prepared by the northrop corp the lead 
contractor 
chandler as of late last week said he was undecided how he 
will vote on the stealth funding amendments

striking eastern airlines flight attendants on 
sunday picketed the boston terminal of sister carrier continental 
airlines trying to heighten public awareness of their 4monthold 
walkout 
the picket was organized by labor consultant ray rogers whose 
tactics have been controversial in other labor actions 
about 30 flight attendants who have been on strike since march 
4 marched along with their children and other family members at 
the logan international airport terminal 
eastern and continental are subsidiaries of texas air corp 
whose chairman frank lorenzo has been the chief target of 
criticism from the stikers 
the picketers said they were particularly targeting passengers 
who took advantage of continentals special 1 fares for children 
under age 18 the special was in effect for passengers who 
purchased tickets for their children before june 
children walking the picket line carried balloons and signs with 
such messages as lorenzo is a stinker and lorenzo is a bozo 
were here to bring to the attention of the public our 
strike said dolores stewart an eastern flight attendant for 15 
years were here with our children because we have families too 
and we know of what we speak 
the strikers had a permit to picket in front of the terminal and 
passengers moved through to the busy ticket counter without 
incident many were handed leaflets by rand wilson of rogers new 
yorkbased labor consulting firm the corporate campaign the 
leaflets detailed alleged safety and service shortcomings of 
continental and eastern 
continental spokesman ned walker declined to comment on the 
picketing saying it was primarily a matter between eastern and the 
strikers 
rogers was hired by the flight attendants union in miami to help 
raise public awareness of the strike he has stirred up controversy 
in other strikes for advocating confrontational tactics 
the corporate campaign strategy involves focusing public 
attention on affiliates and major customers of a company involved 
in a strike to try to apply economic pressure to management 
eastern filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws after 
the strike severely curtailed its operations

corona extra that trendy pricey mexican 
beer you wash down with a lime has lost some appeal among us 
yuppies and forced its brewer to seek other customers namely 
lightbeer drinkers and the japanese 
in a new advertising campaign the american promoters of corona 
are peddling a new light brew theyre also stressing coronas 
tropical mexican roots and the heavier versions popularity with 
seasoned california surfers 
the us market is flat because of lifestyle changes said 
michael j mazzoni executive vice president and general manager of 
chicagobased barton beers ltd which imports corona to the 
western united states from cervecerias modelo the brewer 
theres a new emphasis on fitness and sales are flat with the 
yuppies whose purchases once enabled corona to threaten dutch 
brew heineken as the no 1 us import mazzoni said in an 
interview 
corona sells for about 5 a sixpack in the us market more 
than double what it costs in mexico it seemed to draw 
styleconscious affluent young americans like a magnet with its 
clear longneck bottles and the mexican custom of downing some 
alcoholic beverages with a squeeze of lime 
the mexican beers stagnant sales in the united states partly 
reflect a decline in alcoholic beverage drinking by many americans 
which is affecting rival brews as well 
at 24 billion cases the us beer market grew negligibly over 
1987 while imports rose just 04 percent after two years of strong 
growth 
coronas sales in the us market peaked in 1987 at nearly 25 
million cases last year sales totaled about 22 million cases 
according to statistics compiled by impact a newsletter about the 
us beverage industry heineken sold more than 34 million cases in 
the united states in both 1987 and 1988 
the mexican beers hold on the no 2 spot is secure and sales 
still far exceed 1984 when the brewer sold about 15 million cases 
in the united states but the stalled growth has provoked concern 
weve really been clobbered over the past year mazzoni 
said we need some excitement 
modelo hopes to stir something up by introducing what hardened 
beer drinkers may consider a contradiction in terms corona light 
its the final evolution in light said thomas a mcnichols 
bartons marketing director 
while total us beer consumption hasnt grown light brews are 
becoming more popular for the first time three of the five 
topselling brands are lights and the trend has carried over into 
imports 
modelo shipped its first case of corona light northward in april 
and began testmarketing in los angeles san francisco san diego 
phoenix and chicago eventually a new plant in guadalajara will 
produce up to 400000 cases of corona light a month 
there are people who say coronas already light but i cant 
tell you how many times ive heard people say wrongly theyre 
worried about its calorie content said mazzoni 
corona averages about 148 calories a bottle the brewer says 
despite rumors its as high as 400 calories the light varietys 
calorie content is 105 
modelo and its us distributors barton and gambrinis importing 
co inc of san antonio plan to duplicate marketing tactics used 
to promote corona lights heavier cousin relying at first on 
wordofmouth advertising by introducing the brand in trendy 
restaurants and bars 
the successful and voiceless corona television ads filmed in 
such tropical resorts as ixtapa also will be used to tout corona 
light mcnichols said 
the brewer also is trying to counter its slippage in the 
american market by reaching out to drinkers in japan where corona 
sells for 740 a bottle 
were going after young adults the opinion leaders and what 
we call the sensitive trend leaders said john r hamaguchi 
import marketing director for hiroya co ltd of tokyo japans 
oldest liquor merchant 
theres the opinion leader the one always with the latest 
news fashions and hairstyles and who drink corona because its a 
new thing hamaguchi said 
then theres the sensitive trend leaders coronas a very 
sophisticated item in japan especially in tokyo night clubs he 
said thats where the sensitive trend leaders go 
since it introduced corona to japan in july 1987 hiroya sold 
130000 cases of corona through 1988 making the beer the no 5 
import and 10th overall we want 1 million cases five years from 
now hamaguchi said 
unlike the western ad pitch the japanese ad campaign is full of 
words in fact it features a man singing singing about what he 
likes and how corona fits 
i like twobranch roads in the middle of the city 
a rhythm that stimulates the right side of my brain 
a melody that has lost the code begins to be heard 
if i take the right road itll lead me to the end of the ground 
if i take the left road itll lead me to the end of the sea 
in my left hand ive got a lime 
in my right hand ive got a corona 
at this moment im in the bottle of paradise

recent rains in the midwest have boosted 
the prospects for a larger corn crop and that could have important 
implications for a wide spectrum of other commodities according to 
study 
the study released friday by the university of 
missouricolumbia says the rain has increased the possibility that 
us corn farmers this fall will harvest a 118 bushelperacre corn 
crop totaling about 78 billion bushels 
previously the us department of agriculture projected a 113 
bushelperacre crop totaling about 75 billion bushels 
that 4 percent difference in yield could mean a 12 percent or 
larger drop in corn prices said abner womack director of the 
universitys food and agricultural policy research institute 
womack said that if the higher corn yields materialize the 
average prices farmers receive for the crop would drop to about 
175 a bushel from the 2 the usda had projected 
any change in corn prices is important because corn is the 
countrys most widely planted farm crop corn also is the biggest 
source of livestock feed for meat milk and egg producers 
an unexpectedly large corn crop would tend to depress prices for 
other crops that would require federal farm program officials to 
make higher price support payments which would leave less money to 
help farmers with drought relief 
no one yet knows exactly how much corn farmers will produce this 
year because whether it rains in the next two weeks could swing 
final production either way womack said 
much of the countrys crop is in the pollination stage which 
means that cool damp weather is needed so that more kernels will 
form on the corn ears that farmers will harvest this fall 
right now were leaning on the side of larger crops and lower 
prices but that still could change quickly womack said

new york somewhere over the rainbow room sometime in the next 
two months the rca building will become unmistakably the ge 
building 
the huge red neon rca signs are being dismantled from the 
top of the 70story building in favor of a red neon ge a move 
that initially did not put general electric co in a good light 
but the grumbling that greeted the announced name change last 
summer subsided the city gave its blessing and now workers are 
removing all signs of the old rca corp on the limestone 
centerpiece of rockefeller center 
a slab of granite with rca building chiseled into it was 
removed friday from one of the entrances two weeks ago workers 
started taking down the neon signs that face south west and north 
ge bought rca and its network television division nbc in 1986 
nbc which is headquartered in the building announced last july 
that the buildings name and signs would be changed the building 
is owned by rockefeller center 
i guarantee you a lot of people arent going to notice said 
sue gould a partner in the graphics firm lebowitzgoulddesign 
inc which designed the new neon signs 
it will be the same color the same glass she said the new 
letters will be in outlined block italics inspired by an old 
general electric monogram not the familiar script logo found on 
ge products 
the changeover expected to be finished by september received 
approval last fall from the city landmarks preservation commission 
which had input into the design of the new neon 
some who groaned at the thought of a new sign last summer may 
not have known that the current rca sign was installed in 1968 
replacing the original 1937 art decosign during an rca corporate 
image makeover gould noted 
several other buildings in rockefeller center also have changed 
names since the 1930s when the complex was built gould said

federal agents armed with a search warrant took a 
personal computer a printer and computer diskettes from the office 
of georgia power cos chief financial officer the company said 
georgia power spokesman david altman said internal revenue 
service agents came to the office of mike harreld the companys 
vice president and comptroller friday afternoon and left about 
three hours later with the computer equipment and software 
we dont know exactly what software they took altman 
said obviously this is related to the ongoing investigation of 
georgia powers parent firm the southern co 
the irs has been investigating allegations of tax fraud theft 
coverups and illegal political contributions by officials and 
employees at southern subsidiaries for more than three years 
the probe heated up in august when a federal grand jury in 
atlanta also began looking into the finances of southern and 
subsidiaries federal agents also raided georgia power offices at 
that time 
irs spokesman kent taylor said the agency could not confirm or 
deny that a raid occurred friday 
altman said harreld who is in charge of all the companys 
financial statements would have no comment 
we really were very surprised at the search warrant altman 
said we have been cooperating fully with the us attorneys 
office on this investigation and we find it very surprising that 
they would feel the need to use a search warrant for materials that 
they perhaps could have gotten otherwise 
the full scope of the irs and grand jury investigations has not 
been disclosed but initial reports centered on spare parts 
accounting 
two former managers at gulf power co one of the subsidiaries 
were sentenced to prison for tax fraud and a pensacola fla 
businessman was convicted of perjury last year in kickback schemes 
they were accused of stealing more then 80000 by billing gulf 
power for materials never delivered 
a third gulf power employee was fired this year after new 
kickback allegations 
the investigation has been marked by two unusual events 
ray howell a pensacola graphic designer who did contract work 
for gulf power disappeared a day before he was to testify before 
the atlanta grand jury last december 
then in april gulf power senior vice president jacob horton 
died in a pensacola plane crash while he was on his way to atlanta 
apparently to talk with corporate officials about the 
investigations 
in addition to georgia power and gulf power other southern 
subsidiaries are alabama power co and mississippi power co

despite reporting a secondquarter loss of 
13 million zenith electronics corp expects to report a profit 
for the year zenith chairman jerry k pearlman says 
the company announced friday that shifts in the value of the 
dollar and increased interest expenses caused the secondquarter 
loss 
because of our currency position and other factors we are now 
less confident that the company will be more profitable in 1989 
than in 1988 especially if the dollar stays strong pearlman 
said 
zenith the lone domestic television manufacturer and a major 
maker of personal computers said the secondquarter loss amounted 
to 49 cents per share compared with a loss of 121 million or 46 
cents per share in the second quarter of 1988 
secondquarter sales totaled 676 million up 15 percent from 
sales of 589 million in the 1988 period 
for the first six months of 1989 zenith reported a net loss of 
17 million or 64 cents per share compared with a 1988 firsthalf 
loss of 117 million or 45 cents per share sales in the first 
half totaled 135 billion up 16 percent from 116 billion in the 
1988 period 
pearlman said that this year zenith positioned itself in 
anticipation of a weakening us dollar instead the dollars 
value increased making the company unable to benefit from the 
stronger dollar for purchases made in foreign currencies 
our currency positioning which didnt permit us to operate at 
prevailing currency market rates resulted in a lost profit 
opportunity of about 5 million in the second quarter he said 
and if exchange rates remain where they are today the 
secondhalf effect could be about 20 million 
company officials said revenus from computer sales increased 12 
percent in the second quarter to 384 million from 342 million in 
1988 the increase came despite a reduction in personalcomputer 
prices to meet price reductions by competitors 
the company also reported an 18 percent increase in 
secondquarter consumer electronics revenue to 292 million from 
247 million last year reflecting higher color television and 
video recorder sales
