an orange juice producttampering case 
widened wednesday when a suburban supermarket employee found a 
juice carton punctured with a syringe needle and bearing a note 
warning of poison the third such incident this week 
the latest carton was discovered at a hughes market in canoga 
park said police officer fred nixon the needle and juice were 
sent to a lab for testing but results werent expected for about 
three days he said 
the mo method was very similar to the mo in the two 
previous cases nixon said we dont know if we have a copycat 
or what 
as in the two earlier cases in nearby woodland hills a needle 
of the type that attaches to a hypodermic syringe was stuck into 
the twoquart cardboard carton and a note suggested poison had been 
injected nixon said he described the note as a warning but 
refused to reveal its exact wording 
tests as yet incomplete tentatively cleared one of the first 
two cartons of contamination and no one drank from any of the 
cartons 
the juice brand tampered with wednesday was citrus hill in the 
two previous cases monday at a vons market and tuesday at an alpha 
beta market the brand was minute maid all three cartons were 
found outside the refrigerator cases where they are stocked and 
none of the needles in the cartons had syringes attached nixon 
said 
on wednesday hughes pulled all chilled orange juice from the 
shelves of the store where the tampering took place awaiting a 
fresh shipment said harland polk vice president for sales he 
said workers had been ordered to watch for tampering after the 
first incident 
police urged shoppers who had recently bought orange juice from 
that store to return it and they suggested inspecting juice 
cartons before buying them at any store in the area in the western 
end of the san fernando valley suburbs 25 miles northwest of 
downtown los angeles 
officials at the two stores involved in the earlier cases and at 
minute maid said they knew of no labor troubles or personal grudges 
that might have prompted the tampering and nixon said the entry of 
a second brand might discount that theory 
the note on the carton in alpha beta referred to unsafe 
packaging said store spokesman bill wade

an explosion and fire rocked a north sea 
oil rig with more than 200 workers aboard wednesday night rescuers 
said at least one person was killed and 25 people were injured 
many with severe burns 
rescuers said early thursday that one person was confirmed dead 
and that more than 200 workers had been evacuated 
police said in a statement that some workers were not yet 
accounted for but had no precise figure for the number missing 
the rig is a raging inferno said a statement from the royal 
air force rescue and coordination center at the east scottish town 
of dunfermline 
the oil extraction rig codenamed piper alpha is owned by 
occidental petroleum company and is 120 miles off the northeast 
scottish coast 
i think a lot of people have not been accounted for some 
people ended up in the sea and rescuers are trying to pull people 
from the water it is still dark out there and it is a formidable 
task said a police spokesman who declined to be identified in 
accordance with british practice 
the coast guard service said in a statement the platform has 
been abandoned but whether everybody did in fact get off and where 
they went to is the big question at the moment 
occidental petroleums scottish base at the eastern port city of 
aberdeen said in a statement that 232 workers had been aboard the 
oil rig when the explosion occurred at 930 pm 430 pm edt 
immediate evacuation procedures were implemented efforts are 
being made to contain the fire on board the occidental statement 
said 
an international force of six warships the nato alliances 
standing naval force atlantic was diverted to the scene rescuers 
said it includes vessels from britain the united states canada 
portugal the netherlands and west germany 
another british warship the blackwater was also headed for the 
scene they said 
the raf rescue center said 25 injured people many suffering 
from severe burns were picked up by the semisubmersible rig 
tharos which was alongside the piper alpha rig at the time of the 
blast the rescue center earlier had put the number of injured 
aboard the tharos at 32 but later revised that figure 
the center originally identified the tharos as an oil field 
support ship 
three raf helicopters and one coast guard helicopter were sent 
to the scene while an raf nimrod reconnaissance plane flew overhead 
one of the raf sea king helicopters is investigating reports 
of survivors in the water the raf rescue center said 
it said some of those evacuated from the piper alpha rig had 
been taken to the claymore oil field platform 10 miles west of the 
stricken rig 
an emergency medical team was flown to the scene by helicopter 
from the eastern scottish port city of aberdeen 
it was the third incident at north se oil installations in the 
past week 
last friday there was an explosion at british petroleums sullom 
voe onshore terminal on the shetland islands 
on tuesday night a fire broke out on the north sea brent alpha 
platform 
occidental petroleum is one of the major operators in the north 
sea and recently has been concentrating on new fields 
serious incidents have regularly occurred on north sea drilling 
production and accommodation platforms since the start of the 
offshore exploration boom in the 1960s structural defects 
explosions or bad weather have all been to blame 
the first blow out was in april 1977 when at least 20000 
tons of oil escaped into the sea from the oil rig bravo in the 
norwegian ekofisk field run by phillips petroleum 
the escape was capped but not before an oil slick had spread 
over 1500 square miles 
the worst north sea oil field disaster was in 1980 when 137 
crewmen on the accommodation platform alexander i keilland died 
when it capsized in storms in the ekofisk area most of the dead 
were norwegians

scientists today reported new evidence that a 
gassy wind is spurting out two opposite sides of a nearby 
galaxy at speeds up to 240 miles a second 
the wind is apparently driven by repeated supernova star 
explosions said astronomer r brent tully 
the evidence an analysis of light from the galaxy is published 
in todays issue of the british journal nature by tully and 
jonathan bland of the institute for astronomy in honolulu hawaii 
a galaxy is a cluster of stars gas and dust the study focused 
on one called m82 visible with a small telescope which lies some 
60 trillion miles away in the direction of the constellation ursa 
major 
tully said other scientists had suggested the idea of a wind 
from m82 because of previous observations no other galaxy has a 
welldocumented wind he said in a recent telephone interview 
the wind mostly hydrogen appears to be going faster and faster 
the farther it gets from the galaxy he said it apparently began 
at least 3 million years ago and maybe tens of millions of years 
ago he said

angel islands familiar eucalyptus groves 
may be cut down following a yearlong environmental study that says 
native trees would make better homes for wildlife on the island in 
san francisco bay 
the study by the state department of parks and recreation 
concludes that there would be no adverse environmental effects from 
logging 86 acres of the 50yearold trees and replacing them with 
native buckeye live oak and laurel 
in june 1987 the state announced it planned to cut down the 
eucalytpus an australian species as part of a policy to remove 
nonnative plants from state park preserves 
but the plan drew immediate protests in the san francsico bay 
area essentially were pretty unhappy with the report said 
chris womack of a marin county group called preserve our eucalyptus 
trees 
parks and recreation department director henry angonia will make 
a final decision on the angel island plan after a public hearing 
tuesday night 
the army planted the trees about 50 years ago as windbreaks if 
the logging is approved six groves of eucalyptus covering 24 acres 
would be removed this fall the island now a park once served as 
an immigration center 
the environmental study recommends that the other 62 acres be 
logged gradually to minimize the shortterm effects the state 
would preserve large older eucalyptus trees near buildings for 
their historic significance

the reagan administration says proposed 
legislation to extend constitutional protections to hundreds of 
cuban refugees being held by american immigration authorities would 
only delay the process of paroling eligible detainees 
two separate bills drafted after the riots last fall by cuban 
detainees in atlanta and oakdale la would bar the government 
from indefinitely detaining without a court hearing aliens who 
legally are excludable under immigration law but who cannot be 
deported 
the immigration and naturalization service had found many of the 
cubans who arrived in this country during the mariel boatlift in 
1980 to be unacceptable for admission to the united states but 
cuban president fidel castro refused to take them back 
those excludable aliens consisted of mental patients and people 
who had committed crimes in cuba or since their arrival in the 
united states 
the riots broke out at prisons at atlanta and oakdale after the 
united states tried to reinstate a 1984 agreement calling for the 
deportation of 2746 such mariel cubans 
deputy associate attorney general cary h copeland testifying 
wednesday before a house panel criticized one bill as too costly 
and said the other could force the government to release dangerous 
aliens into american society 
we believe we have a system that can work and will work and 
we hope you will give it an opportunity to work copeland told 
the house judiciary subcommittee on refugees and immigration law 
one bill sponsored by rep robert kastenmeier dwis would 
grant any cuban detainee denied parole by both ins and justice 
department review boards another hearing within 90 days before an 
administrative law judge 
at that hearing the detainee would be represented by an 
attorney paid for by the government and would be able to call 
witnesses and present evidence in his behalf and question witnesses 
against him 
the other bill sponsored by rep pat swindall rga would 
limit to six months the amount of time a person could be imprisoned 
by the government as an excludable alien after six months the 
person would be reclassified as a deportable alien and thus 
would be entitled to constitutional protections similar to those 
outlined in kastenmeiers bill 
copeland said the government cannot afford to provide attorneys 
to the cuban detainees and doesnt have enough administrative law 
judges to hear their appeals he said swindalls bill would 
essentially mandate that mariel cubans who were not ready for 
parole due to violent propensities be released

the soviet military chief of staff said at the 
beginning of an unprecedented tour of us military bases that he 
didnt see any similarity between the downing of an iranian 
airliner last weekend and that of a korean airliner by soviet 
forces in 1983 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev said he discussed the incident with 
his us counterpart and host adm william crowe but had 
refrained from giving advice 
yesterday adm crowe informed me about that and he told me 
about the specifics and we took some time discussing this said 
akhromeyev speaking in russian i and adm crowe are military 
professionals and i did not see fit to offer any military advice 
i would not draw any similarities between the iranian airliner 
a few days ago and the downing of a korean airliner a few years 
ago akhromeyev told a pentagon news conference 
pressed to explain the differences between the two incidents 
akhromeyev smiled and said i believe you would be more 
interested in the subjects we are discussing today as part of the 
continuing dialogue between us and soviet armed forces 
crowe and others in the briefing room laughed as akhromeyev 
ducked the question and the american admiral said a few minutes 
later that he was looking forward to facing the soviet press 
when he accepts the soviet marshals invitation to visit moscow at 
a later date 
crowe at a grim news conference sunday announcing that an us 
warship had shot down iran air flight 655 with 290 people aboard 
said there were fundamental differences between it and the 
downing of korean air lines flight 007 on sept 1 1983 
the key distinction said crowe was that the americans fired on 
the iranian jetliner in an area of combat while the soviets shot 
down kal 007 in an area free of hostilities 
the fundamental differences of course are that it was not a 
war zone crowe said of the kal incident there was not combat 
in progress there was not combat there normally over the soviet 
kamchatka penninsula where kal 007 was tracked by soviet fighters 
and shot down 
during their talks tuesday and wednesday said akhromeyev he 
and crowe agreed upon military exchanges in 1988 and 1989 
including visits by us and soviet warships to ports in the 
others country and exchanges of military historians senior 
officers and delegations 
akhromeyev will visit several us military installations during 
his tour becoming the senior soviet officer to do so at least 
since the two nations were allies during world war ii said crowe 
today akhromeyev was to witness naval flight operations and a 
firepower demonstration aboard an aircraft carrier the uss 
theodore roosevelt based in norfolk va to watch marine corps 
airground operations at camp lejeune nc see live fire 
demonstrations at fort hood texas and to peer inside a b1 bomber 
and tour missile training facilities at ellsworth air force base 
sd 
crowe also hoped to give the visiting soviet marshal a taste of 
the united states by taking him to his own alma mater the 
university of oklahoma eating barbeque visiting an indian 
reservation and watching a rodeo 
traveling with the soviet marshal were the chiefs of staff of 
the soviet ground forces aa grinkevich of the air force col 
gen ve pankin of the soviet navy adm kv makarov and of the 
equivalent of the marine corps maj gen is skuratov and the 
chief arms control specialist on the general staff col gen

james m beggs who resigned as nasas 
administrator because of federal fraud charges that later were 
withdrawn has received an apology from outgoing attorney general 
edwin meese iii it comes a year after another official refused 
such a gesture 
your fellow citizens should now be more aware than ever that 
your character is untarnished and your behavior unblemished 
meese said in a letter that was handdelivered to beggs home on 
june 29 
when the government withdrew its indictment in june last year 
beggs told reporters it would be nice if meese apologized but 
assistant atty gen william f weld head of the criminal 
division declined the invitation to embrace the language of 
apology 
weld who since has resigned his post said at the time that he 
would trust public opinion to understand that in a criminal case 
if no conviction is obtained no blemish should attach 
but meese who announced his own resignation on tuesday wrote 
beggs that he had reviewed the circumstances surrounding the 
wrongful indictment and that he truly regretted the ordeal beggs 
and his family had been put through 
i wish to offer you a profound apology on behalf of the 
federal government and the department of justice meese said he 
blamed the aborted prosecution on an inaccurate understanding and 
assessment of the underlying facts 
beggs who was executive vice president of general dynamics 
corp before he took the top post at nasa was indicted with the 
company and three of its officials in december 1985 on charges they 
defrauded the government in a weapons contract he took a leave 
that extended through the challenger explosion jan 28 1986 that 
killed seven astronauts beggs then resigned because the accident 
made it imperative that nasa have a handson administrator 
the government conceded in june 1987 it had insufficient 
evidence and withdrew its charges against all the defendants 
beggs said he was pleased and surprised by the letter ive 
had a year now to get over that ordeal he said i guess i 
pretty much put it behind me right now ive picked up my life im 
back working at various things which are interesting to me 
he said he had received a telephone call from president reagan a 
few weeks after the charges against him were dropped he told me 
how pleased he was that it worked out that way and how sorry he was 
it had resulted in my leaving the agency and the space program 
beggs said 
beggs wife mary said she appreciated the letter because it 
was so unusual nobody knows of the justice department ever 
having issued such an apology before she said 
reporters who have covered the department for the past 15 years 
could not recall any similar instance it wasnt clear whether 
meese also apologized to other defendants in the beggs case 
beggs now is chairman of spacehab a private company developing 
pressurized 10footlong modules to add to the working quarters of 
a space shuttle crew

a corn plant may curl up and die from heat and 
drought but only after its protective enzymes have put up a good 
fight says the agriculture department 
the departments agricultural research service reported 
wednesday that the two enzymes in corn and other plants help limit 
stress from heat and drought the enzymes seem to work best 
within a temperature range we call a thermal kinetic window 
researchers said that when the plants temperature rises above 
the window its ability to fight heat stress starts to fade and 
when there is a lack of water for use by the plants natural 
cooling system the enzymes become less effective and the plant 
withers and dies 
the enzymes identified by agency scientists in lubbock texas 
are glutathione reductase which stops the buildup of potentially 
lethal waste products as a plant fights heat stress and 
hydroxypyruvate reductase which is thought to protect 
photosynthesis or the plants foodmaking process during stress 
jerry l hatfield a research leader at the laboratory said 
thermal kinetic windows vary by plant species and are much narrower 
than expected for example corn has a window in a range of 77 to 
88 degrees fahrenheit cucumbers 93 to 100 wheat 62 to 73 
spinach 50 to 63 and cotton 73 to 90 
hatfield said usda plant physiologists john j burke and james 
r mahan were the first to analyze the activity of the enzymes at 
different temperatures 
one of the goals of the research is to transfer one plants 
genes for controlling an enzymes behavior into other plants 
thereby producing crops that are more tolerant to heat drought and 
other stresses than they otherwise would be hatfield said in a 
report issued here 
although such advances may be a long way off they could lead 
to crops better equipped to face such climatic changes as the 
gradual heating that may occur from the buildup of carbon dioxide 
in the earths atmosphere he said 
meanwhile a report by the governments joint agricultural 
weather facility said rain and cooler weather in the week of june 
27 to july 3 eased drought stress in the great plains delta and 
western corn belt but that the lack of moisture worsened in 
most corn belt states 
overall the corn crop was in still mostly fairtopoor 
condition the report said 
an estimated 96 percent of the nations soybeans had been 
planted by july 3 slightly behind the normal pace the crop was 
reported in mostly fair condition in the great plains and 
southeast but were said to be mostly poor in the delta states 
cooler temperatures eased livestock stress the report said 
ranchers continued culling herds as forage supplies decreased 
producers provided supplemental feed in most areas pastures were 
mostly poor and showed very little regrowth

the soviet union has come back into the us 
corn market for the first time in three months to buy 175000 
metric tons for delivery this year under a longterm supply 
agreement between the two countries says the agriculture 
department 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 175000 tons of 
corn would be about 69 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 280 per bushel at the 
farm level meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around 
19 million 
prices have shot up recently reflecting damage to this years 
crop on march 31 the last time the soviets bought a significant 
amount of us corn the farm price was about 190 per bushel 
the corn purchase announced wednesday is part of the grain the 
soviet union is committed to buy during the fifth and final year of 
the agreement which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 
million tons of us grain the pact expires sept 30 and there 
have been negotiations for a new one 
according to the agreement the annual purchases are supposed to 
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn the 
soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as 
wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting as two 
tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
with the latest purchases the soviets now have bought 436 
million tons of corn plus more than 9 million tons of wheat 
830700 tons of soybeans and 13 million tons of soybean meal

farmers in designated drought areas who donate 
all the hay cut from land in two conservation programs will not 
have their federal acreage payments reduced by the agriculture 
department 
previously farmers who harvested hay from land enrolled in the 
conservation reserve program or crp and the water bank program 
or wbp would have their annual payments reduced by 25 percent the 
following year 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng said wednesday that to be 
eligible for the exemption a producer must donate the hay through 
a designated state agency engaged in droughtrelief efforts and 
obtain certification from an official of the agency that the hay 
has been donated properly 
more than 1800 counties have been designated by usda as drought 
areas eligible for the special haying privileges 
under the two programs farmers enroll land for 10 years and 
agree not to produce crops on it they are required to plant 
protective grasses or trees to prevent erosion and are paid annual 
rental fees by the government for maintaining the acreage 
typically the fees average 40 to 50 per acre annually thus 
without the exemption hay donated to help other farmers would 
result in a loss of 10 or more per year in federal payments

attorney general edwin meese iii entered the 
justice department pressing a conservative legal agenda that 
heartened his supporters and drew fire from liberals but he is 
leaving with little of it accomplished 
the lower federal courts are more conservative than when he 
came but he failed to get two nominees he wanted on the supreme 
court and the ones who made it have at times charted an 
independent course not to his liking 
the high court has chipped away at constitutional criminal law 
protections that meese opposed but they still stand and he has 
been rebuffed on a variety of other legal issues 
he failed to articulate any cohesive rationale for what he has 
been trying to do michael glennon professor of law at the 
university of california said in a telephone interview 
some conservatives argue that the longrunning investigations of 
meese have in fact hampered president reagans efforts to move 
government policy in a lawandorder direction 
the reagan legal agenda is bigger than ed meese said daniel 
popeo of the conservative washington legal foundation i think 
the reagan legal agenda is detracted from and taken down in having 
to defend ed meeses problems 
meese in an interview wednesday on cable news network said 
i think we have depoliticized the justice department in favor of 
strong law enforcement which benefits all of the people 
if you hadnt had people like myself and others in the 
department of justice who feel the same way we wouldnt have the 
fine nominees that have been recommended to the president who 
believe as he does we should have interpreters of the 
constitution and not people who will impose their own wills in the 
guise of constitutionalism 
the outgoing attorney general who began his public career 
advocating tough action against antiwar demonstrators as a deputy 
district attorney in alameda county calif was still talking 
tough when he came to the justice department in 1985 
he accused the supreme court of weakening the constitution with 
sometimes bizarre rulings that he said were not the supreme 
law of the land among other things he said the court had erred 
in its landmark doctrine that the bill of rights protects citizens 
against state as well as federal government action 
ae dick howard professor of law at the university of 
virginia said that created a lot of hue and cry and a great 
deal of fuss i dont see that any longterm debate has resulted 
those turned out to be sort of flashes in the pan 
more importantly he said throughout the years that meese has 
been attorney general the supreme court has dealt one rebuff after 
another to important administration positions 
the most recent example was the courts decision upholding the 
independent counsel law in which chief justice william h 
rehnquist elevated by reagan with meeses backing wrote the 
courts 81 opinion only justice antonin scalia the most clearly 
conservative of the reagan appointees to the court dissented 
it seems clear rehnquists agenda is somewhat different than 
meeses said glennon as chief justice rehnquist sees it as 
his province to fit the interests of an independent and impartial 
judiciary 
the administration has also lost on cases involving abortion 
affirmative action and churchstate relations among other 
questions 
when moderate justice lewis f powell retired meese backed 
robert h bork a conservative judge of the us court of appeals 
for the post after the senate rejected the bork nomination meese 
recommended a colleague on the appeals court douglas ginsburg who 
withdrew in the face of opposition 
the eventual choice justice anthony kennedy is carving out a 
record more conservative than reagans first appointee justice 
sandra day oconnor but slightly less consistently conservative 
than scalia 
some argue that meese has made headway on issues such as the 
rule excluding illegally seized evidence and the miranda warnings 
governing pretrial police interrogation which he argued only 
helps guilty defendants 
miranda and the exclusionary rule have been nibbled away at 
bit by bit so that today they cover far less than they did eight 
years ago said glennon 
howard however said my overall sense is that the court had 
begun to back off from those policepractice cases in general even 
before reagan became president and meese became attorney general 
in one area there is agreement about meeses impact as 
attorney general he has played a pivotal role in selecting about 
200 judicial appointees 
he has captured the lower federal courts said glennon 
the meese legacy is much more enduring and i think more 
obvious more evident in the judicial appointments than in the 
supreme court decisions so far said howard

motorists in west germany must add two 
pairs of surgical gloves to the first aid kits they are required to 
carry in their automobiles under a new law designed to prevent the 
spread of aids 
transportation ministry spokesman bernd bialleck said wednesday 
that the regulation takes effect october 1 
he said it aims to halt the spread of disease especially aids 
in situations where motorists give first aid to bleeding traffic 
accident victims 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the bodys ability 
to fight disease it is fatal and a cure has not been found

a team of researchers at the national cancer 
institute has received the final goahead for a largescale study 
of cancer deaths among people living near nuclear facilities 
according to the teams leader 
dr john boice chief of radiation epidemiology at the 
institute said wednesday that the project has now been approved by 
an nci technical evaluation committee 
weve gone through three reviews and have gotten all the 
approvals he said adding that the project so far had 
encountered no major glitches 
the us study was prompted by a british survey completed last 
year which found that children and young adults up to the age of 20 
who lived near any type of nuclear facility had an increased 
incidence of leukemia 
were focusing of course on the childhood leukemias because 
thats the concern that has been raised from the english study 
boice said but were going to be looking at all malignancies 
he said the initial phase of the project began early this year 
and is expected to take 18 months to complete 
cancer mortality data are being collected for all counties 
containing or adjacent to nuclear power plants and other nuclear 
facilities using nci files that date back to 1950 
were moving forward linking the large databases together 
boice said all the materials have been collated the counties 
where all the reactors are have been located control counties 
in large part have been selected were matching counties based on 
mean income percentage urban and rural and so forth 
plans for the study which involves four nci researchers and two 
consultants also call for a final phase in which the institute 
would send teams into neighborhoods to interview people about their 
occupations and other factors which can affect cancer rates 
however boice said this would be undertaken only if in fact 
we found anything of particular interest from the initial 
statistical survey if we find that there are no elevations in 
cancer incidence theres little justification to go in and do 
indepth studies he said

a real estate developer awaiting trial in what 
prosecutors said was one of the biggest bankloan fraud cases in 
us history electrocuted himself by rigging a stripped cord to an 
outlet officials said tuesday 
the body of jr mcconnell 40 was discovered on the floor of 
the harris county jails medical ward about 350 am monday 
sheriffs lt gl moore said mcconnell was transferred to the 
medical ward after he tried to hang himself in his jail cell march 
21 with a cord from an immersion heater 
moore said this time mcconnell apparently stripped the ends of a 
threestranded electrical cord placed one end into a wall outlet 
and then used himself to make a full circuit by attaching the 
exposed end to his leg 
it was not known how mcconnell obtained the cord but such items 
are usually purchased by inmates at the jails commissary moore 
said 
moore said a note believed to be written by mcconnell was found 
on a table next to mcconnells bed 
the note was addressed to his wife mary gantt said dick 
deguerin his former attorney 
we have a note that were examining at this time moore 
said its somewhat illegible and were attempting to decipher 
what it says but it appears it might possibly be a suicide note 
following his march suicide attempt mcconnell said he was 
despondent over delays in his court proceedings 
his trial was scheduled for july 19 and he had been in jail 
since nov 17 on a 750000 bond 
mcconnell surrendered to federal authorities when he got off a 
plane from mexico after having been missing for more than a year 
he and five associates were indicted last october on charges of 
plotting to defraud texas national bankpost oak and home savings 
association of 42 million to 57 million by claiming to own 
property in which they had no interest 
loans approved by the institutions and backed by property the 
defendants did not own were funneled to mcconnell through fronts 
prosecutors alleged 
mcconnell a onetime multimillionaire said he had 35 cents in 
his pocket when he was arrested he was assigned a federal public 
defender because of lack of money 
his holdings which his wife estimated to be between 300 
million and 500 million are being liquidated under chapter 11 
and chapter 7 of us bankruptcy code 
mcconnell who made his fortune in houston amassed hundreds of 
rental properties and development projects here and in galveston 
his most ambitious project was a planned 440acre resort called 
grand beach on galveston island 
but before the resorts first building could be completed his 
empire began to crumble and mcconnell filed for protection from 
creditors in october 1986 
a courtappointed trustees report said mcconnell and the 10 
companies included in the bankruptcy filing owed 427 million 
against 281 million in assets 
two loans listed in the indictment one at a houston bank and 
another at a savings and loan were only part of a larger scheme to 
defraud lending institutions of at least 162 million authorities 
claimed

a preserved and tatooed head of a maori warrior 
that was withdrawn from a london auction after protests will be 
returned to new zealand for burial the tribal rights group 
survival international says 
the british woman who wanted to sell the fullsize head of the 
native new zealander at a bonhams auction in may will receive a 
handcarved maori club in exchange the auctioneers said tuesday 
the head believed to have been preserved in the early 1800s and 
brought to britain soon after had been expected to sell for up to 
7000 at the auction of tribal art 
it was withdrawn following complaints and threatened court 
action from the new zealand maori council and survival 
international 
sir graham latimer chairman of the maori council said he will 
take the head back to new zealand next week 
he said nancy wellerpoley of east anglia would be given the 
club as a token in appreciation of her decision to return the 
head which has been in her family for 150 years 
the head complete with a full mane of hair dark brown 
concentric circles of tatoos its original teeth and glass eyes 
added by a victorian taxidermist is mounted on a platter 
we are absolutely delighted with this dignified and happy 
solution for the maoris said a spokeswoman for bonhams which 
negotiated the deal 
robin hanburytension president of survival international said 
he hoped the agreement would discourage this sordid and immoral 
trade in human remains a trade which is deeply offensive to the 
affected tribal communities and which makes a mockery of our own 
claims to membership of a civilized society 
but the bonhams spokeswoman speaking anonymously in keeping 
with british custom said there is a risk owners will now sell such 
items under the counter rather than risk public criticism 
they will be pushed underground and nobody will ever find out 
that they are on the market she said 
survival international said preserving heads was common among 
the maori until the practice was outlawed in the 1820s 
mrs wellerpoley asked whether she was satisfied with the 
offer of the handcarved club said i wouldnt have put the head 
up for sale if i hadnt wanted the money but you have to take 
these things as they come dont you

a congressional study says the reagan 
administrations proposal to trade away potentially valuable oil 
rights in the arctic national wildlife refuge is not in the public 
interest and should be abandoned 
the assessment from the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress is being disputed by an interior 
department official who says the proposed land exchange offers the 
nation a unique chance to acquire valuable fish and wildlife 
habitat 
the gao study focused on interiors proposal to trade the 
mineral rights to 166000 acres in the refuge for surface rights to 
896000 acres owned by six alaska native corporations in seven 
other wildlife refuges in the state 
last month interior secretary donald hodel ordered the trade 
put on hold until after congress confronts the larger question of 
whether to allow development of the possibly large oil reserves in 
arctic refuges 15 million acre coastal plain 
gao said interior has valued the 896000 acres at six times 
their appraised market value and that threefourths of the land has 
only limited wildlife and habitat protection benefits 
and while interior is rating the deal as an evenup trade worth 
539 million to both sides it is impossible to calculate the value 
of the oil rights in the refuge until more exploration is done 
according to gao 
interior told gao that the actual values for the best arctic 
refuge tracts could be between zero and 65 times the estimated 
value gao said in the study released by rep george miller 
dcalif 
under the proposed land exchanges however interior neither 
required the native corporations to bid against one another 
competitively for the tracts nor retained a continuing monetary 
interest in any future oil production gao said 
gao believes that the proposed exhanges are not in the best 
interests of the government said the study urging congress to 
reject the plan if interior refuses to abandon it 
gao noted that the 539 million value assigned by interior to 
the 896000 acres in other reserves is far beyond their appraised 
value of 90 million 
about 279000 acres were given low acquisition priority or rated 
unsuitable for acquisition by interior while another 349000 acres 
are already protected from uses inconsistent with refuge programs 
according to gao 
finally about 53000 acres are most threatened by subsurface 
mineral development but interior would not acquire the the 
subsurface rights under the terms of the exchanges the study 
said 
susan recce deputy assistant interior secretary for fish and 
wildlife and parks defended the proposed trade as a unique 
perhaps onetime opportunity to acquire pockets of land owned by 
natives in federal refuges 
aleuts eskimos and tlingits are among the major groups native 
to alaska 
in a letter to gao recce pointed out that interior is forbidden 
by law from using condemnation to acquire such inholdings in 
alaska leaving the negotiating climate radically altered in 
favor of the natives 
she said that although not all the land that would acquired by 
the government is high on interiors acquisition list the agency 
presumes that all privately owned lands within a refuge are 
suitable for acquisition 
recce said there is legal uncertainty whether the 349000 acres 
are protected from private development she said that while the 
53000 acres would be open to mineral development a recent study 
suggests this land has a low potential for it 
although the alaska public lands act generally requires land 
exchanges in alaska to be on the basis of equal value the interior 
secretary can make one of unequal value if it is in the public 
interest recce noted

an agreement signed by japan and the united 
states will soothe some of the aches and pains that have plagued 
the worlds biggest agricultural trading partnership officials say 
the pact signed tuesday opens japan to more american beef and 
citrus perhaps doubling the total value of those sales by the 
early 1990s 
us trade representative clayton yeutter called it a great 
day for american agriculture a great day for japanese consumers 
nobuo matsunaga japans ambassador to the united states said 
the pact marked an end to the decadelong trade issue between the 
two governments 
sen max baucus dmont also called the agreement a big win 
for beef producers and japanese consumers but cautioned that the 
united states must ensure the agreement is carried out properly 
this is but the first step in what must be a sustained effort 
to increase beef exports baucus said in a statement constant 
pressure on japan by congress the administration and private 
groups finally paid off 
the agreement which was reached last month during negotiations 
in tokyo will open the door gradually over the next few years to 
more us beef and citrus and move away from the restrictive quota 
system that has been in effect 
earlier demands that japan allow sales of us rice were dropped 
in reaching the settlement on beef and citrus 
yeutter said he hoped japan would relent on allowing rice 
imports but that such discussions would be more appropriate in the 
current uruguay round of multilateral trade talks under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt 
matsunaga said japan has made it clear that we will not refuse 
to discuss the matter of rice in gatt negotiations on condition 
that other participating countries are prepared to discuss their 
own agricultural policies 
the commerce department has estimated that annual us beef 
exports to japan could grow to around 1 billion a year from about 
550 million now sales of oranges and juice now less than 100 
million could rise to more than 150 million it says 
yeutter said in a statement that the signing was a historic 
development for both countries 
it settles one of our most controversial bilateral disputes 
he said just as important it demonstrates that japan is 
accepting even more responsibility as a major trading nation 
yeutter noted that the agreement not only commits japan to 
increase access and eliminate nontariff barriers to trade in beef 
oranges and orange juice but reduces tariffs on a variety of other 
products including lemons grapefruit and nuts 
in a formal exchange of letters dated july 5 matsunaga said the 
government of japan intends to implement marketopening 
measures as indicated by the agreement and will be prepared to 
hold consultations annually with the united states to discuss how 
the arrangement is faring 
yeutter said in his letter that gatt officials have been 
notified of the withdrawal of a us complaint regarding japanese 
import restrictions on beef fresh oranges and orange juice the 
florida citrus industry also has withdrawn a petition calling for a 
us investigation of japanese restrictions on fresh oranges and 
juice he said 
despite longstanding disputes over us access to the japanese 
agricultural market japan continues as the leading singlecountry 
market for american farmers 
in the fiscal year that began last oct 1 for example total 
us agricultural exports are currently forecast at 335 billion 
up from less than 279 billion in 198687 
japans share is estimated at 66 billion or a fifth of this 
years total thats up from 555 billion last year according to 
usda figures 
comparatively the soviet union this year is expected to buy 
around 17 billion worth of us agricultural products which is 
up sharply from 659 million in 198687

the downing of an iranian plane by a us navy 
warship might in an earlier time have put great pressure on 
ussoviet relations but the reaction of both superpowers has 
been unusually restrained reflecting continued postsummit good 
feelings 
moscows criticism of the us action has been circumspect while 
the reagan administration is downplaying previously stated fears of 
soviet expansionism as a rationale for the us military presence 
in the gulf 
the soviets have used the incident to renew their call for the 
withdrawal of the us naval fleet from the gulf but have stopped 
short of the type of inflammatory rhetoric that the reagan 
administration used to denounce the soviet attack on a korean 
passenger plane five years ago 
the toning down of rhetoric has been evident on the us side as 
well 
just a year ago former defense secretary caspar weinberger had 
said that the united states must not retreat from the gulf because 
we simply cannot allow the kremlin to have its will over the 
region 
but now perhaps with the afterglow of president reagans visit 
to moscow still visible the administration has been citing other 
factors to defend its gulf policy 
the state department now says the the us goal in the region is 
to bring the iraniraq war to an end and to protect the security of 
us friends in the area references to the soviet union have been 
nonexistent 
all but forgotten is the almost casual way the united states 
decided in early 1987 to expand its military presence in the gulf 
when the administration decided to reflag kuwaiti tankers after a 
number of these vessels had been bombed by iranian planes the new 
policy entitled the reflagged tankers to the protection of the us 
navy 
the administration took the step as a gesture of concern after 
the soviets began helping out kuwait by leasing to the kuwaitis 
three soviet tankers 
there were some objections at the time but it was only after an 
iraqi jet in a case of mistaken identity attacked the uss stark 
in may 1987 that the wisdom of the administrations course was 
widely and sharply questioned 
the lives of 37 american sailors were lost and there was 
concern once again that use of the us military to make a symbolic 
statement in a middle east trouble spot was a riskier policy than 
it had seemed initially 
in october 1983 use of us forces in lebanon in an attempt to 
promote peace led to the deaths of 241 marines after a truck 
bombing at a military headquarters in beirut 
state department officials acknowledge that concern about soviet 
domination of the gulf has received less emphasis lately from 
administration spokesman 
the kremlin meanwhile has been showing far more restraint 
following sundays incident than the united states did in september 
1983 when the roles of the two countries were reversed 
the reagan administration reacted indignantly when soviet 
fighter planes shot down the korean passenger plane causing the 
deaths of 269 people the administration called the incident 
calculated deliberate murder 
in moscow on monday soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennadi 
gerasimov softpedaled his criticism of the united states even 
though he said the downing of the korean airliner was far more 
understandable than sundays attack on the iranian plane 
whereas the iranian plane was flying in daylight over 
international waters the korean plane had intruded into soviet 
airspace at night gerasimov said 
but the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm william j 
crowe jr said sunday the two incidents were not comparable he 
noted that the iranian plane was flying over a war zone where there 
was combat in progress and that in contrast to sundays incident 
the korean plane unlike the iranian airliner had received no 
warning before it was shot down 
the 1983 incident produced serious strains in sovietamerican 
relations poisoning the atmosphere of a meeting held shortly 
thereafter between secretary of state george p shultz and 
thensoviet foreign minister andrei gromyko 
but gerasimov has been a model of restraint since the sunday 
incident alluding to the wild antisoviet howl of 1983 he 
said that moscow has no intention of responding in kind with the 
shoe now on the other foot 
i dont think we will follow that bad example he said 
greater than 
editors note george gedda has covered foreign affairs for the 
associated press since 1968

when edwin meese iii announced his resignation 
as attorney general vice president george bush expressed the 
sentiments of a lot of republican candidates when he said ed did 
the right thing 
meese had become a symbol of what democrats loved to call the 
reagan administrations sleaze factor the effectiveness of 
that claim was demonstrated by the growing pressure from 
republicans for the attorney general to leave office before the 
fall campaign 
on tuesday meese finally took that step he told a news 
conference in california that a special counsels investigation of 
his actions fully vindicates me and that he would leave office 
the end of july only a couple of weeks before the republican 
convention that will nominate bush for president 
independent counsel james mckay found no basis for an indictment 
of meese but his report which could criticize meese on ethical 
grounds is still secret it was filed tuesday in washington 
asked if he expected to have a role in the bush presidential 
campaign meese sounded a little surprised by the suggestion 
in the bush campaign he said i would think his campaign 
is already filled if i can be of help to vice president bush in 
his campaign i certainly will 
meeses resignation was as big a contribution as he could 
possibly make to the vice presidents campaign not that his 
departure was likely to eliminate ethics as an issue for the 
democrats 
michael dukakis the democrat bush will face in the fall 
presidential election quickly responded to meeses announcement by 
saying mr meeses resignation is long overdue 
i dont think he should have been appointed attorney general in 
the first place and he should have stepped down long ago dukakis 
added this administrations inability to set high standards for 
public service will not be solved by the meese resignation 
but it certainly will give bush a welcome respite from the 
steady hammering of questions about meese 
for months bush saw polls that said voters favored dukakis for 
the presidency and at the same time was asked daily whether he 
thought meese should step down 
you are consistently asked about meeses problems bush aide 
peter teeley said two months ago meese is a liability 
bush disavowed that statement but later that month he admitted 
that he had met with the attorney general and confirmed that meese 
had promised not to do anything to hurt bushs presidential 
campaign 
it was already clear that the principal thing meese could do to 
hurt the bush campaign was to hang onto his post no matter what 
bush wasnt the only gop candidate troubled by the political 
fallout from the investigation of the attorney general 
four republican candidates for senate pete dawkins in new 
jersey george voinovich in ohio slade gorton of washington and 
bill anderson of tennessee had called on meese to resign and 
others had hinted broadly that they thought he was hurting the 
party politically 
rep lynn martin of illinois a national cochairman of the bush 
presidential campaign made no effort to hide her pleasure at the 
meese announcement 
i had suggested that he resign a month ago and met with him 
about two weeks ago so im not going to suddenly be hypocritical 
and say im shocked she said 
he meese got what he needed not leaving town under the 
cloud that he was guilty martin added on the other hand the 
question now of what are you going to do about ed meese certainly 
isnt going to be asked any more

with the democrats making final arrangements 
for their convention that will nominate michael dukakis for 
president jesse jackson is refusing to yield on platform issues or 
his claim to be the most qualified democratic vice presidential 
prospect 
the fact of the matter is i would be an asset jackson said 
on tuesday im convinced that my presence would unleash new hope 
in this country regain more people 
the others under consideration are unknown quantities beyond 
their districts and beyond their home states jackson said in 
boston 
ron brown the washington lawyer who has emerged as jacksons 
top campaign aide met with democratic party chairman paul g kirk 
jr and dukakis campaign manager susan estrich the session was at 
dukakis campaign headquarters in boston 
brown described it as a good meeting a good session but 
when asked if any agreement had been reached on platform issues on 
which jackson and dukakis differ brown said the decision is 
that we have no present intention of dropping any of them 
the issues on which they disagree are jacksons call for a tax 
increase for cuts in defense spending and for endorsement of an 
independent palestinian state 
brown said further meetings would be held to get the 
convention put together 
the two campaigns have agreed on much of the convention 
schedule including a plan for jackson to address the meeting on 
the second night tuesday july 19 
the opening night program will include a speech by former 
president jimmy carter as well as the keynote address by texas 
treasurer ann richards 
the third night of the convention will include the traditional 
roll call ballot for the presidential nomination with dukakis and 
jackson expected to be the only names put forth dukakis has far 
more than the delegate majority he needs to prevail 
the program for the closing night will include nomination of the 
vice president and then the acceptance speeches by dukakis and his 
running mate 
the three commercial television networks are expected to provide 
prime time coverage for two hours on each of the four nights 
in addition to jackson officials said it was possible that 
former democratic presidential contenders sens albert gore jr of 
tennessee and paul simon of illinois rep richard gephardt of 
missouri and former arizona gov bruce babbitt would speak tuesday 
night onetime frontrunner gary hart is not expected to address 
the convention associates say he will write a newspaper column and

president reagan says he will consider 
offering compensation to relatives of those who perished when a 
us missile blew up an iranian jetliner but experts say any such 
offer would be complicated by legal problems and sensitive 
diplomatic issues 
several congressional leaders including house speaker jim 
wright have suggested that families of the 290 victims of sundays 
attack be offered compensation as a gesture of conciliation and 
regret by the united states 
it is a matter that has to be discussed reagan said 
tuesday im waiting for the results of the investigation 
a team of navy investigators arrived in the gulf region to sift 
through information and is expected to issue a report in two to 
three weeks including the extent of potential claims 
legal offices at the state department the pentagon and the 
white house have the idea of compensation under active 
consideration according to sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
i think it would be a wise idea said sen john warner 
rva the ranking republican on the senate armed services 
committee theres a clear admission by our president that this 
was an unfortunate accident and congress likely would provide 
the money for such payments he said 
warner said such an offer perhaps negotiated through a third 
party would demonstrate good faith on the side of the united 
states and could help turn a tragic circumstance into something 
that could bring peace and stability to the volatile region 
thats something that deserves consideration said rep 
henry hyde rill any tragedy accidental or otherwise deserves 
consideration 
others on capitol hill suggested such talk was premature rep 
tom downey dny said any compensatory payments should be 
conditioned on the release of us hostages held in lebanon by 
proiranian groups 
one congressional source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said administration officials are recommending that reagan quickly 
offer compensation a principal argument for that course of action 
is that it would mute comparisons to the destruction of a korean 
air lines jet in 1983 by the soviet union which rejected all 
requests for reparations for families of the 269 people aboard 
such a decision by the president would be weighted with foreign 
policy implications and he would want to consult thoroughly with 
congress before making any compensation offer administration 
officials said 
youve got a basic policy choice with a very high profile 
said one administration legal expert who spoke only on condition 
of anonymity 
but according to administration and congressional officials a 
decision to offer compensation would by no means ensure that it 
would ultimately be received by the families of victims 
perhaps the most difficult barrier is the lack of diplomatic 
relations between the united states and iran the only formal 
direct contact between the two countries is at a tribunal in the 
hague the netherlands where commercial claims from before the 
1979 islamic revolution are still being negotiated any new 
compensation issue would be outside the scope of that tribunal 
iranians could file a claim in the international court of 
justice but the united states has in the past rejected claims of 
jurisdiction by the world court other communications between the 
two countries now are handled by switzerland 
in addition there is no assurance that the iranian government 
which has used the incident as an antiamerican rallying point 
would agree to accept payments and if money were sent to victims 
relatives through the government there are no guarantees that it 
would be properly distributed officials said 
there also is the question of legal authority for making the 
payments under international law no nation has to compensate for 
damages that result from legitimate military operations but the 
pentagon does have authority to make payments of up to 100000 per 
person in accidents 
most recently the united states denied liability for damages to 
neutral embassies in tripoli libya in a 1986 bombing raid and 
similar requests were turned down when neutral shipping was struck 
during the bombing of haiphong harbor during the vietnam war 
but if the damage resulted from a clear mistake such as the 
missile attack on the uss stark by an iraqi warplane last year that 
killed 37 sailors compensation may be paid iraq admitted error 
almost immediately and negotiations are continuing on the proper 
amount of damages 
the united states has compensated individuals for damage done by 
troops on maneuvers in central america and is paying owners of a 
fishing boat shot up by mistake in the persian gulf 
in another incident israel paid reparations to the united 
states following what israel said was a mistaken attack on the uss 
liberty in 1967 during the arabisraeli war 
in that case the payment was what lawyers term ex gratia 
made out of professed sympathy but without admitting fault or 
liability that could well be the form of any us payment to 
iranian families one official said

edwin meese iii the conservative attorney 
general with a lawandorder philosophy was a magnet for 
controversy virtually from the time he set foot in the nations 
capital but he never lost the confidence of the boss president 
reagan 
for nearly 20 years meeses life has been entwined with 
reagans career as the republican governor of california and then 
as president since reagan was elected to the white house in 1981 
meese has been at the center of power first serving as counselor 
to the president before his confirmation as attorney general in 
1985 
he is a good friend reagan said tuesday shortly after 
meese announced he planned to resign in the summer to pursue other 
opportunities 
a native of oakland calif meese helped reopen debate on 
longsettled issues which are at the heart of the liberal agenda 
from affirmative action and school busing to the rights of the 
accused 
his outspoken embrace of the conservative agenda his dogged 
determination to hang onto his job his attacks on the supreme 
court and his personal conduct seemed to attract criticism from all 
sides even from republicans 
through it all meese 56 a stocky lawyer and a police buff 
kept his composure played down his problems and seemed to enjoy 
sparring with his critics 
what is wrong with being affable meese once asked a 
colleague 
after a grueling 13month confirmation hearing to attain the 
attorney generals post meese said i am not bitter at all 
before his nomination an independent counsel had investigated 
meeses role in obtaining government jobs for financial 
benefactors the report cleared meese of any wrongdoing 
at the justice department meeses tenure was marked by turmoil 
a major problem began in late in 1986 when us attorney general 
rudolph giuliani launched a probe of wedtech corp whose 
executives allegedly doled out payoffs to influence public 
officials to assist the south bronx ny defense contractor 
by april 1987 longtime meese friend e robert wallach who got 
13 million from the company was at the center of the probe the 
next month independent counsel james mckay began examining meeses 
record of assistance to wedtech which occurred at wallachs behest 
mckays report which has not been made public was filed 
tuesday in federal court it apparently absolves meese of any 
criminal misconduct 
during mckays investigation meese clung to his post despite 
protest resignations from two of his top aides and a growing chorus 
of calls from a number of conservative congressmen for him to quit 
meese had the support of the only politician who mattered reagan 
meeses legal troubles were the final phase in the political 
life of a man who has had the highest public profile of any 
attorney general since robert kennedy 
as the nations chief law enforcement officer meese opened fire 
on the supreme court accusing the justices of weakening the 
constitution with ad hoc and bizarre rulings he said the 
decisions were not the supreme law of the land 
among other things meese said the court had gone astray by 
applying the bill of rights to the states which has led to 
legalizing abortion and insistence by the court that government and 
religion not mix 
the attorney general also attacked the miranda warning governing 
pretrial police interrogation procedures saying it only helps 
guilty defendants 
one of meeses legacies is the federal judiciary since he 
became attorney general meese has played a pivotal role is 
selecting about 200 judicial appointees 
in california meese was executive assistant and chief of staff 
to thengov reagan from 1969 through 1974 he was the governors 
legal affairs secretary for two years before that 
before joining reagans staff in sacramento meese was a deputy 
district attorney in alameda county calif in that job he 
advocated a tough response to student demonstrators opposing the 
vietnam war 
prior to reagans election as president meese was a professor 
at the university of san diego law school specializing in criminal 
justice 
meese also had his share of personal troubles in washington in 
1982 his 19yearold son scott was killed in an automobile 
crash his wife ursula held a series of jobs most recently 
serving as a 40000ayear official with the multiple sclerosis 
society the couple has a daughter dana and a son michael

pentagon officials still have not resolved 
confusion over the altitude speed or course of the iranian 
jetliner shot down by the uss vincennes over the persian gulf 
house armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis said 
after a closed briefing tuesday that pentagon officials backed away 
from their initial claim that the iranian plane was outside the 
civilian air corridor 
but a navy spokesman contacted later said that was still one of 
the hazy areas that has yet to be fully resolved 
american military officials also have not dispelled doubts about 
the altitude and speed at which the iranian a300 airbus was 
traveling after leaving bandar abbas in iran for dubai in the 
united arab emirates on the opposite side of the persian gulf 
the pentagon did say tuesday that the plane was transmitting an 
identification signal on a frequency normally used only by military 
aircraft leading the commander of the vincennes to believe he 
faced an attack from an iranian f14 fighter 
pentagon spokesman dan howard said a sixmember team headed by 
rear adm william m fogarty landed on the vincennes on tuesday to 
try to determine why the plane was making those transmissions how 
high and fast it was traveling and whether it was in the civilian 
corridor 
iran has asked for an independent investigation by a united 
nations agency the international civil aviation organization but 
the organizations president assad kotaite said we have not 
received preliminary reports regarding the circumstances from 
the parties involved except from iran 
aspin said that navy officers told him the airliner had strayed 
to the western edge of the civilian air corridor then corrected 
course heading toward the eastern edge but never left the zone 
it was in the corridor all the time aspin said 
the commercial air corridor from bandar abbas to dubai extends 
55 miles either side of a line between the two cities 
a navy spokesman lt brian cullin contacted after aspin spoke 
said the information we have is that it was four miles off track 
to the west the vincennes was to the east of the corridor 
that is one of the hazy points said cullin and will be 
reviewed by investigators 
another point of conflict involves the vincennes determination 
that the airliner was descending from 9000 to 7000 feet and 
traveling at 450 knots a flight pattern that an attacking fighter 
might follow 
air traffic controllers in dubai said the airbus was at 7800 
feet when it was hit by at least one of the two sm2 standard 
missiles fired by the american cruiser more or less the same 
altitude reported by the vincennes 
but another american warship in the area the uss sides which 
has less sophisticated radar than the vincennes reported that the 
airbus was flying at a steady 12600 feet a more common altitude 
for commercial jets and was not descending 
pentagon officials initially reported sunday that the vincennes 
had shot down an f14 hours later adm william crowe chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff acknowledged iranian claims that an 
airliner had gone down 
crowe had said the decision to fire was based in part on 
classified electronic emanations but declined to give details 
saying the information was classified 
faced with worldwide shock at the incident the pentagon 
declassified the information to strengthen its case 
the iranian airbus said howard was broadcasting in two 
modes it was squawking on mode 3 using a fourdigit number 
assigned by air traffic controllers to civilian and military air 
craft for identification 
it was also sending signals on a military mode mode 2 said 
howard and the signals that the vincennes was receiving from 
that aircraft were signals that we had previously identified or 
associated with an f14 no commercial airliners use mode2 
the mode 2 transponder he said is a special piece of 
equipment which has to be put on the aircraft and it can only be 
set on the ground

it all happened in an hour an hour among 
many at a teacher convention filled with the usual quota of debates 
on matters ranging from the political to the educational to the 
mundane 
but that hour at tuesdays session of the national education 
associations annual convention will go down as one of the weirdest 
in the 19million member unions 131year history an hour during 
which beach balls flew and a union chief turned cheerleader 
the kind of shenanigans in short that might well have earned 
one of their students a trip to the principals office 
delegates were considering a resolution supporting the cause of 
a convicted murderer named elmer geronimo pratt a former black 
panther who has been serving a life sentence at san quentin prison 
in california since 1972 his supporters insist he did not get a 
fair trial because of fbi interference his story has been told by 
cbss 60 minutes and abcs 2020 
his sister virginia pratt is an nea member and special 
education teacher at markham intermediate school in the watts 
section of los angeles 
after a brief debate the usual voice votes and standing votes 
were judged too close to call nea president mary hatwood futrell 
declared a rollcall vote of the 8227 delegates exceedingly rare 
because it is so timeconsuming 
the superdome where the teachers are meeting this week erupted 
in repeated human waves during the hourlong wait while votes were 
tallied beach balls appeared out of nowhere some flying up to the 
podium where futrell playfully hit them back 
when futrell announced that us attorney general edwin meese 
iii had decided to resign the teachers cheered wildly 
at one point delegates demanded that futrell dance or sing to 
pass the time she demurred 
why dont you do the wave again she suggested they gladly 
obliged then broke into a loud chorus of when the saints go 
marching in 
futrell then shared a secret this doesnt appear on my 
resume she said but i used to be a cheerleader this 
brought loud demands for a demonstration 
i accept the challenge she said and led the group in an 
impromptu chant we want a pay raise how bout you 
shortly after 5 pm an hour after the resolution came up the 
vote was in 3415 against 3219 in favor 293 abstentions 
many who voted against it explained they simply lacked the facts 
to make a judgment 
the man may be innocent but we just dont know that said 
teacher karla steer of provo utah 
asked whether tuesdays convention session would be remembered 
as unusually weird nea spokesman and 24year veteran howard 
carroll said i dont know theyre always pretty weird but 
yeah it was bizarre the more i think about it

attorney general edwin meese iii transferred 
many of his assets into mutual funds in 1987 after the breakup of 
a controversial financial partnership he had with an investment 
manager linked to scandalplagued wedtech corp his financial 
disclosure report shows 
the new 10page form issued tuesday shows that meese funneled 
from 50000 to 100000 into a merrill lynch cma money fund 
account last aug 5 
the report also shows that he invested from 15000 to 50000 
in each of two mutual funds last october pacific dunlop ltd and 
muniinsured fund inc 
in addition meese invested 15000 to 50000 in the merrill 
lynch pacific fund last october selling it for an undisclosed loss 
in december 
meese opened the various fund accounts after dissolving a 
partnership with a corporation operated by w franklyn chinn who 
has been indicted on racketeering charges in the wedtech scandal 
chinn turned a 40000 profit for meese on a 50000 investment 
in just 18 months through a series of stock trades chinn using 
his contacts in the brokerage industry obtained hardtoget 
brandnew stock issues and sold them for meese later the same day 
usually at a substantial profit 
meeses financial arrangements with chinn constituted part of 
the investigation of the nearly 14monthlong criminal 
investigation of the attorney general by independent counsel james 
mckay sources familiar with the probe have said speaking on 
condition of anonymity mckay concluded his probe tuesday by filing 
an 830page report with a federal court signaling that he is 
unable to come up with sufficient evidence to seek an indictment of 
the attorney general 
as white house counselor meese in 1981 and 1982 assisted 
wedtech by directing his staff to ensure that the army gave the 
south bronx ny defense contractor a fair hearing from the army 
when wedtech was trying to win a 32 million nobid contract to 
build small engines the firm ultimately got the work 
in 1985 meese formed the limited partnership with chinn at the 
suggestion of meeses longtime friend e robert wallach it was 
wallach who originally urged meese to become involved with wedtech 
and the san francisco lawyer eventually was paid over 1 million in 
cash and wedtech stock by the defense contractor wallach also is 
under a racketeering indictment in the wedtech scandal 
in addition to breaking up the partnership with chinn in 1987 
meese also sold stock in regional bell telephone companies last 
september meeses stock in six of the regional bells was valued at 
from 1000 to 5000 stock in a seventh was valued at less than 
1000 
meeses phone stock provided another focus of mckays 
investigation the attorney general met with executives of four of 
the regional bell companies who wanted the justice department to 
reverse its stand and recommend that the regional bells be allowed 
to engage in a number of new types of business after meeting with 
the bell executives in 1985 and 1986 meese obtained a white house 
waiver which permitted him to participate in the matter which he 
did by approving the soughtfor reversal of the justice 
departments position

a federal judge has declared unconstitutional 
a reagan administration policy of barring aid money for private 
organizations that promote abortion as a form of worldwide family 
planning 
us district judge june l green ruled that the policy first 
announced in 1984 at a united nations conference on population in 
mexico city violated the free speech and association rights of a 
usbased organization that promotes family planning projects in 
third world nations 
the policy announced by thenundersecretary of state james l 
buckley has drawn accusations from third world nations that the 
united states is interfering with the familyplanning policies of 
those countries 
in an opinion issued friday but not made public until monday 
the judge ordered the agency for international development to stop 
enforcing the policy 
but green said aid could bar foreign organizations that receive 
us aid from using the money to finance abortion services 
the ruling was made on a 3yearold lawsuit by three 
familyplanning organizations that operate programs in the third 
world including dkt memorial fund ltd which is based in new york 
green ruled that parivar seva santha of new delhi and 
population services family planning programmes ltd of london 
lacked legal standing to press their constitutional claims because 
they are foreign organizations 
but she said the regulations impair the associational rights 
of dkt under the first amemdment 
aid is in essence coercing the plaintiffs to refrain from 
abortionrelated programs if they wish to receive aid funding even 
though they are using their own funds for the abortionrelated 
programs she added 
aid spokesman jerry lipson said the agency had not seen the 
opinion but he said aid will certainly recommend that the 
justice department appeal any aspect of the courts ruling that is 
unfavorable to the agency and that hey do so on an expedited 
basis 
we believe that the policy and aids implementing procedures 
fully comply with the constitution and we are confident that the 
government will be successful on appeal 
richard frank an attorney for the plaintiffs said the 
decision means that population activities abroad will not be 
hampered as they have been in the past 
it also will remove substantial irritants in the foreign 
relations between the united states and certain other countries 
that object to the united states trying to tell their 
organizations what their organizations should do with their own 
money he said 
the three groups had planned to seek aid funds to operate a 
familyplanning program in india but became ineligible to receive 
us aid when the policy was announced 
under the policy aid gives money to foreign governments that 
support abortion but the funds are placed in a segregated account 
and cannot be used for that purpose 
the policy requires that nongovernment groups certify they do 
not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family 
planning in aidrecipient countries and do not provide financial 
support to other groups that do 
green ordered aid to drop the requirement 
but aid may require the groups to certify that they will not 
use aid funds to perform or actively promote abortions 
us contributions to foreign groups could be made through 
segregated accounts as aid is doing presently in its 
governmenttogovernment dealings she said 
under the order usbased groups will no longer be required to 
certify that the funds they receive wont be used to support 
foreign organizations that promote abortion

delegates to the episcopal churchs 69th general 
convention are moving to pave the way for a woman bishop yet avoid 
a schism with those who object 
the 200member house of bishops on tuesday voted 13518 to 
approve two resolutions that would soften the impact of the 
elevation of a woman 
the church has no women bishops even though about 900 women 
have been ordained as priests since 1976 some church leaders say 
one could be elected within six months conservative members have 
said the consecration of a woman bishop could cause a split in the 
church 
tuesdays vote came while fellow anglican leaders in the church 
of england in london voted in favor of proposals to admit women to 
the priesthood despite opposition from those who warned of a 
schism 
one resolution approved by the american bishops calls for 
respect of the position of those disagreeing with the ordination of 
women bishops and the other provides for male clergy to attend the 
needs of dissenting parishioners 
i am of two minds im pleased that it represents a larger 
number of different groups within the church made a commitment for 
women but it concerns me that such an exception has to be made for 
women bishops in the episcopal church said the rev annette 
braunlee of cleveland 
it says that there is something about us that is 
threatening she said 
the proposal now goes to the 900member house of deputies 
aidsrelated issues also were on tuesdays agenda 
the house of deputies unanimously approved an aids 
antidiscrimination resolution and debated other proposals 
including teaching and paying for aids education 
the antidiscrimination measure prohibiting discrimination in 
the church on the basis of aids aids related complex or hiv 
infection was scheduled for debate in the house of bishops 
we have to give the healing gifts to all said john fryer a 
psychiatrist from philadelphia who founded the philadelphia aids 
program jesus healed without moral judgment 
the 3000 delegates to the general convention meet every three 
years to set policy for the 26 millionmember church the 
convention runs through monday

the pentagon says the iranian jetliner shot 
down in the persian gulf was broadcasting identification signals on 
two frequencies one of them reserved exclusively for military 
aircraft 
every commercial and military aircraft operating in the united 
states or overseas is supposed to carry what is known as a 
transponder according to pentagon and civilian authorities 
when a radar beam or other radio signal hits the plane it 
activates the transponder to broadcast an identification code under 
a system known as identify friend or foe designed to prevent 
attacks on friendly or civilian aircraft 
a sixmember investigating team headed by rear adm william m 
fogarty arrived in the persian gulf on tuesday and will review 
tapes aboard the american warship the uss vincennes to shed light 
on the tragedy officials said 
commercial and military aircraft normally broadcast on what the 
pentagon calls mode 3 sending a reading of their altitude and a 
fourdigit identification code that is arbitrarily assigned to them 
by air traffic controllers 
only military aircraft broadcast on modes 1 2 and 4 said lt 
brian cullin a spokesman for the navy 
mode 1 is a twodigit signal which describes the mission and 
country of origin of the aircraft said cullin the message is not 
encrypted or put into code that cannot be read by the enemy and 
does not give the type of aircraft involved he said 
mode 2 is not encrypted either and identifies the type of 
airplane the country of origin and the planes unit cullin said 
daniel howard the pentagon spokesman told reporters that the 
iranian aircraft was broadcasting in two modes 
it was squawking on mode3 he said it was also 
sending signals on a military mode mode2 and the signals that 
the vincennes was receiving from that aircraft were signals 
that we had previously identified or associated with an f14 no 
commercial airliners use mode2 
the mode 2 transponder he said is a special piece of 
equipment which has to be put on the aircraft and it can only be 
set on the ground 
another type of transponder designated mode 4 by the pentagon 
is classified and encrypted said cullin the navy spokesman 
futher details were not available 
all four modes of the iff use a mark12 transponder which 
transmits and receives on the dband frequency range which is 
1000 to 2000 megahertz the reply signals use different 
frequencies and package their information in pulses of differing 
lengths said cullin 
it is impossible for normal civilian aircraft to broadcast the 
information that would be carried by a mode 2 transmission 
according to pentagon and civilian authorities 
the transponder would have to be altered by the addition of 
circuit boards or other equipment in order to transmit in mode 2 
according to navy and civilian experts 
bill reed a spokesman at alliedsignal incs bendix 
communications division in towson md says airliners are normally 
equipped with two transponders one as a backup bendix 
manufactures transponders but it was not known whether it supplied 
the ones used by the iranian a300 airbus 
identifying friend or foe is a challenge its a process of 
elimination if youve eliminated all the other possibilities you 
are left with only one choice i cant verify hes a friend so 
therefore hes an enemy reed said 
another civilian expert said that mode 2 and mode 3 transmitters 
are basically incompatible 
a military one would send out a signal that would be 
incomprehensible to a civilian air traffic controller said the 
civilian expert who spoke on condition of anonymity on your 
typical us airliner you would not find a military transponder 
a spokesman for the airbus manufacturer in france said the 
airliner was delivered to iran air six years ago with two 
transponders aboard that should have responded to identification 
requests from the cruiser 
the airbus spokesman david velupillai did not specify whether 
the transponders were calibrated to broadcast at civilian or 
military frequency

here is a transcript of attorney 
general edwin meese iiis news conference tuesday 
i have a statement to make and then ill be glad to answer any 
questions 
the independent counsel today filed his statutory report after 
an investigation that has lasted approximately 14 months and has 
gone into many subjects heard dozens of witnesses and scrutinized 
thousands of documents including all of my personal financial 
records since 1981 
the filing of the report by the independent counsel in line 
with his previously stated finding confirms that after an 
exhaustive investigation he has determined that there is no basis 
for criminal proceedings with respect to any of the matters that he 
has examined 
i am gratified by this result but not surprised 
i knew from the beginning of this investigation that my conduct 
has been at all times lawful and that if the truth were told 
there would be no grounds for any criminal action 
this past year has been enormously difficult for my family and 
me 
we have been subjected to a barrage of unfair misleading and 
false information circulated through the media 
i answered any and all questions that the independent counsel 
put to me in grand jury sessions and through depositions throughout 
the year 
but i have not yet been able to publicly confront the misleading 
and false allegations because of the ongoing independent counsels 
investigation 
now that the report has been filed however i will begin to 
present a full public response 
my attorneys and i will study the independent counsels report 
which we have not yet received but which we hope to receive today 
or tomorrow and we will prepare an appropriate and timely reply 
as the law provides 
when the court determines what portion if any of the report 
should be made public i trust that my written response will 
accompany that publication 
i will then make myself available to answer any and all 
questions 
i look forward to that opportunity because i am confident that 
when the public is able to hear both sides of the story not just 
the prosecutors view presented by the independent counsel it 
will be clear to all that i have acted lawfully and properly 
now that the independent counsel has finished his task and one 
of the most exhaustive thorough and costly investigations of any 
public official has been completed the false allegations have been 
put to rest it is therefore an appropriate time for me to announce 
certain decisions with respect to my personal future 
over the past two months i have indicated publicly that when i 
have achieved several objectives in the department of justice and 
have set the record straight and when it is in the interest of my 
family and myself that i return to private life i would leave the 
post of attorney general 
i have stated that i would not resign under a cloud or until i 
was completely vindicated 
i have refused to bend to the constant drumbeat of political and 
media pressure because i have a responsibility to uphold which 
involves an important principle not only for myself and this 
administration but for future government officials who are 
subjected to untrue allegations 
as i have said before to allow myself to be hounded out of 
office by false accusations or allegations unjust political 
attacks and media clamor would undermine the integrity of our 
system and would abandon the principles of justice which i have 
championed throughout my life

with the successful conclusion of the investigation and the 
burden of false allegations now lifted i can look ahead to 
returning to private life where i intend to continue making a 
contribution to society 
accordingly i have informed the president that i will be 
leaving the administration towards the end of july or early in 
august in order to accept new opportunities in the private sector 
between now and my departure i will vigorously pursue the 
agenda that i have established at the department of justice 
i am proud of that agenda and of the accomplishments that have 
been realized by the department and the administration 
i deeply believe that president reagans administration has 
regained the proper course for law enforcement and for the true 
administration of justice in the united states 
i am particularly proud of our successes in the long and 
difficult war on drugs and of the appointment of a large number of 
highly qualified judges who will return this countrys judicial 
system to the path intended by the founding fathers 
during these past difficult months my family and i have been 
sustained by hundreds of messages of friendship and support from 
friends and colleagues and in many cases from strangers who have 
extended their encouragement and good wishes 
i am particularly grateful to the president for his unwavering 
support which has been so important to me 
i also want to thank vice president bush for his fairness and 
decency in regard to this matter 
finally let me say that it has been an honor and a privilege 
for me to work with and for president reagan 
under his leadership this administration has had an outstanding 
historical impact on the direction of our country and the welfare 
of our people 
i am proud to have a part in establishing that legacy 
now id be happy to take any questions anyone might have 
yes 
q mr attorney general is there any truth to the rumor that 
either robert bork or elliot richardson may replace you 
a i dont think theres any truth to any rumor about a 
replacement because i just talked with the president a few minutes 
ago 
q is there any coincidence in the fact that you will be leaving 
your position as attorney general just before the republican 
national convention 
a no its a coincidence purely 
it just happens that i in looking at a variety of things that 
im considering to do determined that the end of july or the early 
part of august would be the most propitious time for my own 
personal plans and the president agreed to that 
q what opportunities are you 
a there are a number of things 
ive had several opportunities presented to me over the past few 
months and i felt it was not appropriate to pursue those or decide 
on anything until i had talked with the president and made public 
my announcement of leaving 
now that that has been accomplished i will be pursuing some of 
these opportunities making some decisions and ill let you know 
my specific plans within a short while

a mans 3 million trust fund set up for his 
hometown as an early christmas present in 1986 is finally bringing 
dollars and cents to this financially troubled southwest missouri 
community 
recipients though grateful say the first checks from the trust 
set up by david delarue are smaller than they anticipated when the 
fund was announced in 1986 
payments made july 1 totaled about 150000 said donald place 
who handles the trust at the hibernia bank of san francisco when 
he established the fund with stocks in december 1986 delarue a 
san francisco stock analyst and former bolivar resident estimated 
it would pay about 240000 each year 
elizabeth simmons whose handicapped workshop enterprises 
unlimited received a 1500 check said she would use the money to 
buy materials 
we sure can use it on our daytoday expenses mrs simmons 
said we really are appreciative of it 
mrs simmons had anticipated an initial payment of about 2400 
to help make a down payment on the building she rents for the 
workshop she employs handicapped adults to do lowskill 
laborintensive projects such as cutting lumber and stuffing 
envelopes 
proceeds of the trust are shared by bolivar polk county of 
which bolivar is the seat and polk county schools 
bolivar also distributes some of the funds to the local 
hospital police and fire departments the sports and recreation 
department which was created after the gift was announced and 
mrs simmons handicapped workshop 
delarue made the gift as a gesture of thanks to the community 
where he grew up which has been plagued with financial 
difficulties 
the citys share of the first payment about 18000 was less 
than half what officials had expected bolivar mayor joe lemmon 
said the trustee had some bad luck due in part to the october 
stock market crash 
but were thankful for every penny of it lemmon said 
adding that the money will be used for an as yet undetermined 
community project 
place would not comment on the reason for the reduced amount of 
the checks 
polk county had budgeted 36000 from the delarue trust but 
received about 31000 said county presiding commissioner howard 
hayter 
we had just put it in the general revenue to take care of our 
bills hayter said a budgets an estimate maybe something 
else will go over to offset the deficit if not were just going 
to be short 
the trust will make income payments each july until 2100 when 
the principal will be given to the city 
there were no payments in the first year because administrative 
costs swallowed the small amount of income the fund generated 
earlier this year delarue said hibernia officials had erred in 
the timing of some stock sales he also criticized what he said was 
a practice of selling the original stocks at a loss to buy safe but 
lowgrowth stocks 
polk county officials had considered moving the trust from the 
san francisco bank to a missouri institution but lemmon said 
tuesday that they had decided to work with hibernia 
changing trustees would be almost impossible unless the 
officer wants to turn it over lemmon said that is probably 
not even a probability

q do you admit 
q are you going to offer yourself to the bush campaign 
a in the bush campaign i would think that his campaign is 
already pretty well filled 
i certainly not in a fulltime way 
if i can be of help to vice president bush in his campaign i 
certainly will once im in private life 
q general meese in the report that was filed with the 
inaudible said to be indications that there were some ethical 
questions which could be looked into but not criminal questions 
inaudible your own stock when you were dealing with the 
deregulations of the telephone companies and some of the other 
matters are you aware of those and are you concerned about the 
internal justice department investigation 
a well nobody has seen the report so i dont know what and 
how anybody could know whats in it 
even my own lawyers when i last talked with them just before 
coming down here had not seen the report 
so i dont know whats in it 
but i think the important thing to remember is that the single 
duty of the independent counsel was to determine whether any of 
these allegations that had been made the false allegations i 
referred to formed the basis for criminal proceeding 
the independent counsel found that there was no basis for 
criminal proceeding 
so he has accomplished that task 
anything that may be in the report is mere commentary and 
opinion 
if it raises any questions ill be glad to answer those 
yes 
q mr meese are the standards to which we can hold public 
officials currently legal then or is there a less stringent 
ethical standard that we should 
a well i dont think theres a less stringent ethical standard 
i think public officials should be held to the highest ethical 
standards 
and i believe certainly that in my case i have kept those 
standards 
yes 
q didnt you create the appearance of preferential treatment 
for help you gave wallach on the pipeline 
a well as far as those individual issues i said that as soon 
as the report is made public ill answer those questions 
i can only say that certainly there was no indication of 
preferential treatment of any sort and i will go into that more 
fully when i can when i am when the report and my response are 
published and i can comment in full publicly 
q you indicated that the court would make a decision which 
portions if any of the report would be public would you under 
any circumstance oppose making that report and your response public 
a i dont know because i dont know whats in the report so i 
theres no way i can answer any question like that 
q then how do you know that youve been proven vindicated 
a because if if the as i say the only purpose of the 
independent counsel his only duty is to find out if theres any 
basis for criminal proceedings 
by filing a report as opposed to an indictment he makes clear 
his decision that theres no basis for criminal proceedings

q mr meese 
q but that doesnt answer i mean you spoke that you would 
leave office only if completely vindicated 
a right 
q how do you know youve been completely vindicated i mean if 
you dont know if there are ethical questions i mean 
a because as i say the only purpose of the independent 
counsel is to determine whether criminal proceedings he has no 
his opinion or whatever it might be on ethical issues is not a 
matter of his duties 
so the fact that these allegations have been proved false and 
theres no criminal proceedings fully vindicates me 
q but arent the proceedings pretty general or is that the 
only level that you view as being vindicated no other ethical 
a well thats the only thats the only thats the only 
basis on which any allegations had been made that there was some 
kind of criminal misconduct 
q if theres any of these ethical questions perhaps that are 
turned over to the office of professional responsibility within the 
justice department will you cooperate with those steps 
a well i dont know that there will be 
but obviously as ive said before i will publicly answer any 
questions that anybody has about any aspect of my conduct 
and as ive also said before im sure that a fairminded 
public when they hear my responses to any questions that might 
arise will agree that everything that i have done has been purely 
lawful and proper 
q have you been waiting for this report to announce your 
resignation 
a actually ive been thinking about my future and as these 
opportunities have come forward i have determined over the course 
of a few weeks here that it would be advantageous for me to return 
to private life before the administration ends 
i have made the final decision on that really over the last week 
or weekend actually and based upon also my conversation with the 
president and getting his permission 
q why is it advantageous why not serve out the remainder of 
the few months left 
a well i think when i discuss my plans it should be made 
clear it should make itself clear as to why its advantageous to 
leave before the administration ends 
q mr meese did you know about the 150000 from rappaport to 
wallach which went into a pooled investment account for you and 
others and didnt you benefit from that account 
a well again im going to answer all of these questions when 
im able to speak fully but in no way did i benefit from any 
150000 from mr rappaport nor did it go into any pooled 
investment account in which i was a beneficiary

q can you comment are you seeking a judicial appointment 
a i beg your pardon 
q are you seeking or considering a judicial appointment 
a no im not seeking or considering a judicial appointment 
i had that opportunity many years ago and ive never waivered in 
my personal feelings that a judicial career is not something id be 
interested in 
q mr meese inaudible your investment partnership with 
franklyn chinn in june 1985 when you learned he was a consultant to 
wedtech 
a well again im going to be answering these questions fully 
let me just say that there was no reason to because i had 
nothing to do with wedtech at that time or at any time for that 
matter 
q mr meese did you create the appearance of impropriety on 
lifting restrictions on the baby bell companies when you and your 
wife owned stock in them 
a no 
q do you think that some of the recent departures from justice 
some of those folks should have waited for this report before they 
inaudible 
a well we only had two people who departed 
and i think thats a decision they had to make 
i must say that the work in the department has gone along 
certainly equally well even if they did depart 
so i dont see thats been a big thing one way or the other 
q mr meese is bob wallach still your friend 
a well again you know ive been asked that question many 
times and what i have always said is that every time i answer that 
question somebody tries to misinterpret it 
so i will not answer that question at the present time 
particularly because he has an ongoing legal matter 
q mr meese there have been allegations of lack of leadership 
at justice department over the last year or so and in news reports 
over the weekend we heard from people in the justice department who 
have been charged with prosecuting defense fraud who say theyre 
not getting enough direction from the top in sorting out and 
prioritizing can you respond to that 
a those comments were not from people in the justice department 
i think that was in the gao study 
but certainly if there has been i think the top people or a 
top person in the criminal division has left some time ago 
i think that whatever problems there may have been there have 
been corrected by the new assistant attorney general in charge of 
the criminal division 
q mr meese 
a yes 
q when will you have inaudible the report 
a i dont knw 
itll depend on when my lawyers get it 
and i would assume after they get it then i will have an 
opportunity to hear from them about it 
q your lawyers have it already 
a what 
q there were some reports that your lawyers have it already 
a not to my knowledge 
at least when i talked with them the last word i had before i 
came down here about 20 minutes before i came down here was that 
they expected to receive it today but hadnt received it at that 
time 
it may be that they have

q inaudible 
a at the appropriate time when my response can be filed with 
it certainly 
q oh i see 
a well obviously we wouldnt want to have half the story 
would you 
q if the inaudible panel was not to include your response as 
an appendix would you still agree to have the report published 
a well thats hypothetical because i think under the law 
they have to put forward the whole thing 
theres no legal basis to keep our response private if the 
report is made public 
q attorney general meese is there anything else premature 
about your announcement being vindicated when you havent seen the 
report your attorneys havent seen the report 
a well the report 
q whats different today than yesterday you knew the report 
was going to be filed did you not 
a well the fact that the report is filed 
you see up until the filing of the report at any time the 
independent counsel could have concluded the opposite that an 
indictment would be filed 
and it is the fact the only duty as i mentioned earlier the 
only function of the independent counsel is to decide whether 
criminal proceedings are warranted 
by filing a report instead of an indictment he has made the 
definitive judgment that there are no criminal proceedings and 
therefore vindication naturally follows 
q sir who would you like to see replace inaudible 
a thats an issue for the president to decide 
we have plenty of time obviously since i wont be leaving for 
several weeks we have plenty of time to work on that and im sure 
that ill have as a matter of fact i will be talking with the 
president about that in the near future 
q inaudible 
a well i certainly would give him the benefit of my thoughts 
on the subject but the appointment should be as it was in my 
case entirely up to him 
q when did you inform the president of your decision 
a i talked with him earlier today 
q what time 
a gosh i dont know 
probably around 1 oclock our time here or thereabouts 
q mr meese based on your experience what would you suggest 
to your predecessor to avoid the controversy 
a my predecessor 
q im sorry your successor to avoid the controversy swirling 
around your your leadership in justice 
a well i think the controversy it would be dont have 
political opponents and dont do anything nobody will get mad at 
you then 
q what was the presidents reaction to your suggestion that 
youre 
a well i dont usually characterize my conversations with the 
president but let me say that the president wanted to be sure that 
i felt that this was something that was in my best interests and on 
the basis that i felt that it was then he said that he would agree

q have you given any consideration to the concern about the 
socalled sleaze factor and the impact that will have on mr bushs 
campaign in the fall inaudible 
a i dont think thats going to have any impact whatsoever 
certainly theres no basis for any sleaze factor accurately 
being portrayed to this administration 
there have been occasional instances of individuals but by and 
large i would say that our administration will stand up with any 
as far as honesty and integrity particularly when we have had to 
battle so many false allegations by political opponents because we 
were doing things different from traditional administrations in 
washington 
so i dont think thats a factor that should be a bother at all 
if people are honest about it 
and i must say that if you have to look at those kinds of 
factors i think that the other party is certainly as vulnerable 
many more times over than our party ever would be 
q isnt it entirely possible though that you will be leaving 
office in late july or early august not under a criminal 
misconduct cloud inaudible but perhaps under an ethics cloud 
a no i dont think so 
as i say ill answer any questions anybody has and i think 
ill be very satisfied with the public view based on all my answers 
q is there a specific date on which your resignation is 
effective 
a no ive just indicated generally when im leaving because 
obviously part of it will pertain to the decisions i made as to the 
next course of action 
q will you be returning to california 
a again there are a lot of decisions to be made and i havent 
finalized any at this point 
yes 
q why are you here can you chat about your purpose for being in 
california 
a oh yeah im here i was earlier today as some of the 
people here know i went up with the campaign against marijuana 
planting 
i have been for some time they had asked me to come out and 
see that project so i attended a briefing this morning at the 
california division of law enforcement in which that whole plan was 
outlined and many of the members of the executive committee of the 
program were there 
and then we went up into the hills saw an actual plot that had 
been raided and which will be eradicated and destroyed 
it was mainly to find out about this program in more detail 
ive been briefed on it each year but this is the first chance 
ive had to get to california 
ive been to other places before to watch the program there 
talk with the people involved but this is the first time ive had 
a chance to be here in california and observe the program firsthand 
here 
and im very pleased with the result 
its been an excellent program and a very important one both 
from a domestic and an international standpoint in terms of our 
antinarcotic program 
q attorney general you couldnt be much farther away from 
washington to announce your resignation was that planned 
a no 
q was there any specific reason for being this far away from 
the capital 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP880706-0042 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
a no it was just this has been a longscheduled visit 
i was here not only for the marijuana campaign but also 
yesterday i spoke here in sacramento to the international 
association for identification a group of law enforcement 
scientific and forensic specialists 
thats been planned for several months 
and so it was just happenstance that i happened to be here on 
the day that the report indicating thered be no criminal 
proceedings was filed 
q has anyone from the bush campaign ever suggested that you 
step down 
a no 
q will you be writing a book about your washington experience 
a laughs i dont know 
well see what happens 
again there are a lot of things ive got to think about and so 
we will consider a lot of possibilities 
so i couldnt tell you whether i will or not 
q as ag you supported a plan in central america to use a 
defoilant i believe called spike against cocaine growers theres 
been some controversy about that because of its highly toxic 
nature not just with cocaine but with other plants would you 
support the continuation of that plan 
a i certainly would because its not highly toxic 
as a matter of fact its a herbicide that is used in the 
western united states every day by farmers and by agricultural 
experts 
so i think theres no real danger from it 
and obviously we have already taken soil tests to be sure that 
it would not be environmentally harmful in the areas of south 
america actually where it was proposed to be used 
so i support it 
i also support extensive environmental testing to be sure its 
safe 
but assuming that it is based on the previous tests i think it 
would be an excellent means of helping those countries eradicate 
in this case the coca plants and do what their presidents have 
told me they want to do and that is get their countries out of 
being source locations for these narcotics that are coming to the 
united states and to europe 
q inaudible manufacturer has balked at that apparently one 
of the reasons is they didnt want the drug lords down there to get 
after inaudible how did you respond to their balking 
a well their socalled balking is something thats being 
discussed with them now 
it had nothing to do with environmental damage 
i think it was fear perhaps for their employees or operations 
if that was the case then those are problems we just have to 
work out 
but i dont think tht anybody any firm that is manufacturing a 
safe product that can be used in the war against drugs has the 
right or the certainly not the should not have the moral 
opportunity to withdraw from the fight against narcotics 
i think itd be a terrible thing if people who could help end 
the tremendous suffering from narcotics would not let their 
products be used 
i think that would be a moral black mark against any such 
company that did that

q has anyone in the republican party suggested to you that it 
would be in the best interest of the party for you to step down 
a no as a matter of fact this decision is something i made 
totally on my own without any pressure from anybody 
q would you have resigned at this time 
a what 
q would you have resigned at this time anyway 
a i think given the opportunities that ive been presented 
and the total circumstances i think probably yes 
q are you concerned that the special prosecutor will turn over 
to the justice department the inaudible 
a well im not concerned at all as a matter of fact again 
as ive said ill be happy to answer any questions anybody might 
have 
q is there any one area case of law that you will point to 
with pride from your administration when your opponents attempt to 
detract from your regime 
a well i think there are many of them 
i think that during my term as attorney general we have 
certainly enhanced the position and responsibilities of the us 
attorneys and improved the capabilities of all of our field forces 
i think the law enforcement cooperation between federal agencies 
and state and local agencies has attained the highest level in the 
history of the country 
i think that what we have done against drugs the coordination 
of the effort against drugs and the cooperation between federal 
agencies as well as their cooperation with state and local 
agencies in the drug matter has never been this high again in 
the history of the country 
so all of these are areas 
there are many more 
we can go into almost every i set something like 25 different 
objectives when i started in the attorney generals office in each 
one of those weve made considerable progress or actually 
completely achieved the objective 
ok thank you

friends and foes of edwin meese iii agree with 
the attorney generals decision to quit but differ over whether he 
served president reagan with distinction or dishonor 
the administrations most controversial active cabinet member 
announced tuesday he will leave in late july or early august and 
proclaimed that an 830page independent counsels report on his 
conduct completely vindicates me 
sources said independent counsel james mckay decided not to seek 
criminal charges against meese for his ties with the 
scandalplagued wedtech corp or any other activity 
but critics warned the attorney generals backers not to be too 
exuberant because the reports conclusions about his ethical 
conduct could still be devastating 
sen patrick j leahy dvt one of meeses critics on the 
judiciary committee said the damage has already been done to 
the justice department by meeses conduct 
i didnt think anything could get him to leave certainly 
everybodys been telling him hes doing enormous damage to the 
department he said 
but sen orrin g hatch of utah a republican supporter of meese 
on the judiciary panel indicated meese decided to quit after 
learning the report would recommend against filing criminal charges 
all he wanted to do was hang in there just to vindicate 
himself and then resign hatch said 
i dont know of anybody else whos been kicked around as much 
as ed meese and his family have been in this town hes gone 
through unholy hell for the last number of years said hatch 
sen carl levin dmich whose governmental affairs 
subcommittee issued a critical report on meeses ethics was one of 
those urging the attorney general to be cautious until a federal 
court releases the stillsecret report 
he said an ethical cloud will hang over meese until the 
report is made public 
generally the resignation announcement gave longtime meese 
critics a new excuse to attack him and his backers another chance 
to defend the nations chief law enforcement officer 
any student in an introductory course in american politics 
knows that simply staying out of prison cannot be the standard for 
remaining as the attorney general said rep john conyers jr 
dmich 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio a judiciary committee member 
called meese an embarrassment to the united states his 
resignation is long overdue and should have come months ago 
the ranking republican on the senate judiciary committee strom 
thurmond of south carolina commended meese for serving the country 
in a highly capable manner 
while meeses actions rarely bring neutral comments rep harris 
fawell rill appeared to come close saying the fellow has 
been charged with a lot of hearsay allegations none of which the 
special counsel has been able to establish but on the other hand 
the perception is not good 
there were differences over the effect meeses decision will 
have on the fall presidential campaign 
i would guess that no one welcomes his resignation more than 
george bush and the republican candidates right now said sen 
paul simon dill who ran unsuccessfully for his partys 
presidential nomination 
hatch predicted meeses critics will try to keep meese in 
front of the public eye and blow this thing out of proportion 
even with the vindication 
the vice president who will be nominated as the gop 
presidential candidate in august would only say ed did the 
right thing and i wish him well 
rep henry hyde rill said the resignation takes him out of 
the equation now as a figure of controversy in the upcoming 
elections 
michael dukakis the certain democratic presidential candidate 
called meeses resignation long overdue 
i dont think he should have been appointed attorney general 
in the first place and he should have stepped down long ago he 
said but this administrations inability to set high standards 
for public service will not be solved by the meese resignation we 
need a president who believes in public service who will set those 
high standards and make our government something americans can be 
proud of once again 
sen phil gramm rtexas said meese made a wise decision in 
using the vindication of the independent counsels investigation to 
put this controversy behind him the way is now cleared he 
said for the appointment of an attorney general who can do his job 
without the burden of this controversy upon his shoulders 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo chairwoman of a civil service 
subcommittee that has criticized the ethical standards of the 
reagan administration said hopefully this will help them put 
some people in to bring a little dignity and vigor back

the us navys downing of iran air flight 
655 will likely fuel debate on a proposed un naval peacekeeping 
force the soviets are pushing as a way to diminish washingtons 
presence in the persian gulf 
the attack sunday on the airliner with 290 people aboard will 
also complicate un efforts to mediate between iran and iraq and 
bring about a ceasefire in their 7yearold conflict 
last september in his annual report un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar called for new innovative forms of 
peacekeeping perhaps including a un naval force to protect 
civilian shipping and maintain maritime peace 
but washington which has deployed the navy in the gulf to 
assert its strategic interests and protect neutral commercial 
shipping has said it is not leaving the oilrich strategic 
waterway 
still the us naval presence in the gulf is increasingly 
controversial and sundays jetliner downing during the latest in 
a series of usiranian clashes demonstrates the volatility of 
the region and the problems us forces face in trying to keep the 
peace 
the soviet union its allies iran and other nations argue that 
far from keeping the peace the us presence inflames tensions 
in commenting on the disaster the official soviet press agency 
tass said the tragedy has borne out once again that the united 
states naval fleet must leave the persian gulf without delay 
the pentagon said the us warship that shot down the iran air 
airbus mistook it for an iranian f14 jet fighter 
iran has requested a security council meeting that is expected 
early next week and would likely see the soviets press their call 
for withdrawal of all us military forces from the gulf and 
introducing an international naval force under un command 
the councils five permanent members are the united states the 
soviet union britain china and france 
the two superpowers have not participated in other un 
peacekeeping operations because they were perceived as putting 
their national strategic interests first the soviet union now 
wants to change that 
since last september soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze has been saying that the time has come for a un 
naval peacekeeping force 
under the principles of un peacekeeping such a force can only 
operate with the consent of the parties concerned 
it must be impartial and not favor either side and it must not 
use force except as a last resort and only in selfdefense 
but the united nations and its peacekeeping forces are facing a 
financial crisis and the prospects of funding a new naval force are 
bleak and compounded by us resistance 
the attack sunday will also hurt efforts to end the iraniraq 
war 
un officials and diplomats say the attack on the airbus has 
generated sympathy for iran and hardened irans determination not 
to stop fighting until iraq is branded the aggressor 
that demand has been a major roadblock in getting iran to accept 
a ceasefire in the bloody conflict

the government promised to make wednesdays 
general elections free of violence and fraud and opposition 
parties mobilized thousands of pollwatchers nationwide to hold the 
government to its word 
the final tally wasnt expected before the end of the week but 
the outcome is virtually certain the governing institutional 
revolutionary party hasnt lost a presidential election since its 
founding in 1929 
voters will choose a new president and members of congress at 
55000 polling places across the country under guard by thousands 
of troops 
polling stations open at 8 am 10 am edt and counting is to 
begin when they close 10 hours later many parties plan to begin 
releasing unofficial results on election night 
civilians were barred from carrying arms and most workers were 
to have the day off bars also were ordered closed for election day 
president miguel de la madrid in a nationally televised speech 
monday night pledged to guarantee clean legal and peaceful 
elections saying it is a commitment of the government of the 
republic to comply strictly with the law 
carlos salinas de gortari is the candidate of the pri as the 
governing party is known by its spanish initials his winning the 
election is already presumed and the only suspense lies in his 
margin of victory and the aftermath 
salinas de gortari a 40yearold harvardtrained economist was 
expected to break pri tradition and win with less than the nearly 
70 percent accorded de la madrid 
opposition parties on the left and on the right of pri have 
turned this campaign into a vigorous race and put the governing 
partys legitimacy on the line by making allegations of fraud the 
dominant issue and attempting an ambitious monitoring effort 
several opposition parties said they would send thousands to 
polling stations across mexico to ensure honest elections 
some like 54yearold businessman manuel j clouthier of the 
rightist national action party or pan vowed to lead campaigns of 
civil disobedience if the elections were crooked 
a double slaying saturday cast a pall over a campaign that for 
the most part has been a war of words 
four bullets to the head killed one of candidate cuauhtemoc 
cardenas top strategists francisco ovando hernandez on his way 
home from a political meeting cardenas is a maverick reformer who 
quit the pri to run as the candidate of a predominantly leftist 
coalition 
ovandos aide ramon gil heraldez also was shot and killed and 
documents on the national democratic fronts election monitoring 
vanished from their car 
cardenas 54 spent tuesday mourning ovando a longtime friend 
and political ally who served as his attorney general when cardenas 
was governor of the central state of michoacan 
jorge obrador capellini mexico city judicial police director 
said tuesday that an investigation determined that the killing was 
in revenge for ovandos battles against organized crime while 
michoacan attorney general 
he said he ruled out a political motive for the murder police 
are investigating about 15 suspects but none have been arrested he 
said 
a gallup poll of 2960 mexican voters last month showed cardenas 
running a strong second to salinas de gortari according to the 
poll the responses indicated that salinas de gortari would get 
about 56 percent of the vote cardenas 23 percent and clouthier 19 
percent 
the remaining 2 percent were undecided or favored the two other 
candidates rosario ibarra de piedra a human rights activist 
running on the ticket of the small radical revolutionary workers 
party and gumersindo magana negrete the conservative roman 
catholic activist who is the candidate of the mexican democratic 
party the margin of error was 3 percent 
the poll was conducted in late may and early june and was 
commissioned by eco inc a los angelesbased company affiliated 
with televisa a private mexican television station with ties to 
the government 
clouthier and his freemarket economics are popular in northern 
mexico cardenas base of support is in his home state and in 
sprawling mexico city home to a quarter of the nations 80 million 
people 
the pris strength lies in organized labor among the 
traditional folk of the countryside and in the many labor business 
and social organizations it controls it also is the only party 
with organizations nationwide 
on tuesday the liberal newspaper la jornada published a poll 
showing salinas de gortari could receive 50 percent of the vote 
cardenas 276 percent and clouthier 183 percent it had a 5 
percent margin of error 
more than 38 million people are registered to vote in mexico 
where a oneterm president takes office every six years on dec 1 
the 64 senators two from each of the 31 states and the federal 
district also serve single sixyear terms deputies serve 
threeyear terms 
in a nation where one party has dominated politics for 
generations voter apathy is common for weeks the government and 
party leaders had been urging people to vote and to do so 
peacefully 
even the roman catholic church broke its long silence on 
politics exhorting the faithful to do their civic duty and the 
government to hold clean elections

jim bakker and ptl officials disputed the 
reception the former television evangelist received when he 
appeared at the ministrys heritage usa theme park over the holiday 
weekend 
bakker said tuesday that ptl chief of security gene ervin asked 
him and his wife tammy to stay away from fourth of july 
ceremonies at heritage usa monday night after earlier weekend 
appearances caused a commotion 
bakker said ervin told him that ptl trustee mc red benton 
was worried because of the amount of people that would gather 
around us that it would be dangerous 
but ervin said i only advised them that if they came on the 
property we didnt want any type of disturbance that was it 
there was no talk about prohibiting them from the property 
bakker who is seeking to buy back heritage usa said he and his 
wife drew 2400 supporters in afternoon visits sunday and monday 
on sunday night he said he and tammy went out for ice cream and 
were surrounded by supporters at a shopping mall connected to the 
heritage grand hotel 
it was so overwhelming bakker said they started saying 
we want you back they followed us to our car we decided to go 
home 
but ervin said th crowd of between 150 and 200 people included 
many who do not support their return 
there was some hecklers and jeers coming from the crowd some 
elderly people were shoved bumped and pushed around he said 
it caused what i considered a safety hazard 
ervin also said bakker told him his supporters could riot upon 
his command a claim the evangelist denied

if the united states offers reparations to the 
families of people killed in the attack on an iranian jetliner the 
amount is likely to be far less than us courts typically award in 
liability cases lawyers say 
and if the us does not voluntarily offer reparations the 
relatives of the 290 victims will have difficulty staking a claim 
for compensation in the courts according to experts in 
international law 
if the facts are as the navy has said i would be surprised 
if the iranians would have a claim said don wallace jr a 
professor of international law at georgetown university in 
washington and director of the international law institute 
there is no remedy that i can think of offhand agreed 
steven c nelson a minneapolis lawyer who is chairmanelect of the 
american bar associations section on international law and 
practice 
some members of congress have called on the united states to 
offer voluntary reparations to the relatives without conceding any 
wrongdoing lawyers familiar with such ex gratia payments 
predict that the payout would be modest by us standards 
if we said ok well pay 20000 per person and did it 
quickly thats probably the sensible way to do it said andrew 
lowenfeld a professor of international law at new york university 
that is the amount specified by an international treaty the 
hague protocol to which iran is a signatory 
another lawyer lee s kreindler who specializes in aviation 
cases estimated that such payments might run as high as 150000 
per passenger but he said i would not expect offers to be made 
in the magnitude of offers that are made in domestic us air 
accidents 
as far as suing for compensation most lawyers say the 
survivors standing to demand compensation is tenuous at best 
the problem for the survivors is that the us government is 
protected by sovereign immunity from claims by foreigners although 
there are exceptions to that such as claims under the federal 
tort claims act they would appear to be ruled out in the iranian 
case because the accident occurred during combat 
its not simple negligence said lowenfeld the tort claims 
act he said would apply in a case in which youre crossing 
fifth avenue and a postal truck runs a red light and hits you 
another possibility is that the iranians could file a claim with 
the international court of justice as nicaragua did after the 
united states mined its harbors in that case however the us 
simply rejected the jurisdiction of the world court and presumably 
it would do so again 
this is the ultimate problem under international law theres 
no sheriff nelson said 
kreindler said he believes the iranians may have a case either 
against the united states or against the airline his clients have 
included relatives of the passengers of the korean air lines plane 
that was shot down by the soviet union in 1983 their case against 
the soviets was rejected their case against kal is pending before 
the us supreme court 
ill take the case kreindler said of the iranian crash i 
think theres going to be a recovery if somebody makes a claim

thousands of armenians have gone on strike in two 
southern republics closing a major airport in armenia and bringing 
to a halt industry in a disputed area of adjacent azerbaijan 
according to the official press 
the report indicated the protesters were angered at how their 
leaders had represented their demands to the national communist 
party conference in moscow 
earlier tuesday dissidents in the northern baltic republic of 
estonia said they had gathered more than 6000 signatures calling 
for freedom for three imprisoned estonian nationalists 
the soviet government daily izvestia said the strike in armenia 
began monday a day after thousands of people met in the theater 
square of yerevan the capital of the southern republic 
the armenians called for a strike after hearing the comments of 
armenias representatives to the party conference that ended 
friday the leaders had urged caution and restraint 
most armenians want a region of azerbaijan called 
nagornokarabakh annexed to armenia the mountain enclaves 
predominantly armenian population has been agitating since february 
to be united with neighboring armenia 
armenia supports the demand azerbaijan opposes it 
in february at least 32 people were killed in riots over 
annexation which broke out in sumgait azerbaijan 
most armenians are christian most azeris moslem 
in its report tuesday izvestia said most flights in and out of 
yerevan were canceled and the airport was filled with stranded 
travelers 
like yesterday the report said a series of the citys 
industrial concerns arent working or are working with less than a 
full work force 
the newspaper said that in stepanakert the largest city in 
nagornokarabakh many industries and institutions were shut down 
on sunday izvestia said thousands of people gathered on the 
yerevan city square to watch a television broadcast by delegates to 
the fourday party conference in moscow 
during the conference armenian party leader suren arutyunyan 
said authorities could not normalize the situation in armenia 
where large demonstrations frequently have occurred in support of 
the annexation demand 
he proposed that the conference take up unspecified amendments 
to the soviet constitution 
delegates who spoke sunday supported arutyunyans call for 
restraint and went directly to the square to talk to the crowd 
izvestia said that after a stormy debate a committee was 
formed and called for a general strike 
the committee demanded that the soviet supreme court take over 
the trials of those charged in the sumgait violence most of the 
victims were armenians and full disclosure about the alleged 
poisoning of workers at a factory in the town of masis 
izvestia provided no more information about the masis incident 
except to say an investigation was under way 
solving ethnic disputes and increasing the economic autonomy of 
the countrys republics are two of the key issues in mikhail s 
gorbachevs program to restructure the soviet state and economy 
the dispute between azerbaijan and aremenia has given an 
immediacy to these issues indeed the party conference called for 
greater attention to republics calls for economic autonomy but it 
said authorities would not tolerate efforts to whip up ethnic 
tensions 
in addition to azerbaijan and armenia delegates from the baltic 
states of latvia lithuania and estonia also brought up ethnic 
questions at the conference 
on tuesday about a dozen protesters demanding freedom for three 
estonian political prisoners said they had gathered more than 6000 
signatures during a fiveday demonstration in tallinn estonia 
one of the protesters eve parnaste said the three prisoners 
had been demanding publication of a secret 1939 nonaggression pact 
between nazi germany and the soviet union that placed the baltic 
republics of estonia lithuania and latvia under moscows control 
we will continue the demonstration until they are freed or 
until the authorities give us an exact date for their release 
she said during the protest outside the estonian supreme court 
building 
all three were arrested this year charged with spreading 
antisoviet propaganda or slandering the soviet state

whether the governing institutional 
revolutionary party is capable of gracefully accepting defeat could 
be decided in this large and rebellious northern state 
nationally party candidate carlos salinas de gotari is expected 
to win the presidency but it is generally agreed that it will be 
by the lowest margin ever perhaps as low as 54 percent 
in chihuahua a traditional stronghold of the conservative 
national action party and also a state where the governing party 
has been known to rig elections the institutional revolutionary 
party has for the first time admitted it could lose four of six 
congressional districts 
national action party leaders said this week that the state 
government has agreed to changes in the electoral procedure that 
give them some hopes for a clean election 
but i will tell you thursday morning whether this was a fair 
election said guillermo prieto a national action party 
candidate favored to win a congressional seat 
the opposition party has one congressional district in chihuahua 
in 1983 shortly after president miguel de la madrid took office 
and promised respect for opposition electoral triumphs state 
elections in chihuahua gave the national action party seven 
municipalities 
it was a shortlived experiment in 1986 in elections widely 
believed to have been rigged the governing party won back all of 
the municipalities 
if the institutional revolutionary party loses the four 
congressional districts in the two largest cities chihuahua and 
ciudad juarez at least one of the senate seats could be in danger 
too 
national action party officials said the state government had 
agreed to several of the opposition groups demands to improve the 
electoral process including the use of a better indelible ink than 
that recommended by the national government 
the electoral commission also agreed to move 300 voting booths 
into schools instead of private homes where they originally had 
been scheduled 
the state government is trying to improve its image prieto 
said it does not want any conflicts 
there are 13 million registered voters in the state about 60 
per cent of them are expected to vote

the national health service britains cherished 
cradletogave health care system has officially hit middle age 
and at 40 years old the 41billionayear giant is showing signs 
of a midlife crisis 
parties and political shouting matches marked the services 
birthday tuesday 
in parliament prime minister margaret thatcher shouting above 
opposition jeers denied she is bent on dismantling the cornerstone 
of the welfare state 
labor lawmakers recalled with pride the day that a socialist 
dream was realized with the establishment of a service designed to 
give free health care to every briton rich or poor 
the national health service is the socialism that people want 
and understand labor party deputy leader roy hattersley told an 
anniversary rally in glasgow scotland 
for their part health authorities threw parties for the 
nations first babies born free on july 5 1948 the day the 
postworld war ii labor party governments system of socialized 
medicine took effect 
from costing about 1 billion in 1949 the national health 
service bill has soared to about 41 billion a year it narrowly 
outstrips defense spending and is the second biggest item of state 
spending behind social security 
with 12 million staff from cleaners to brain surgeons the 
service is also the biggest employer in western europe 
it provides treatment from flu shots to heart transplants for a 
million patients a year only 10 percent of britons choose private 
treatment 
doctors who pioneered the system recalled tuesday how its birth 
ended the fear of being ill and penniless 
i remember the patients i had tried to visit at home who might 
not answer the door because a young doctors visit wasnt worth the 
cost they could ill afford said sir anthony alment who went on 
to become president of the royal college of obstetricians and 
gynecologists 
despite soaring expenditures the waiting list for hospital beds 
is about 700000 there are periodic national furors such as last 
winter when a child died after a long wait for heart surgery at a 
birmingham hospital 
since she came to power in 1979 the health service has been a 
sensitive topic for mrs thatcher 
mrs thatcher regularly reels off statistics showing that health 
spending has risen by nearly onethird since she took office but a 
common perception of cuts by the conservatives remains 
she has ordered a wideranging review of the health service 
which is due to be released this autumn 
the move and ideas being bandied about such as hospital stay 
charges and tax breaks for private health insurance have increased 
suspicions that she is aiming to reduce state health care to a 
secondrate system for the poorest 
britain spends less than most other western democracies on 
health about 6 percent of its gross national product compared 
with 105 percent consumed by the united states mainly private 
system and 92 percent in west germany 
the conservative government argues the figures are a tribute to 
the efficiency of the british system 
the british medical association the doctors main professional 
body disagrees 
there is in our view a major crisis in the health service 
association chairman dr john marks said this week urging the 
government to increase its funding of the service the 
government of course maintains there is no such crisis most of 
us like most of our patients prefer the evidence of our own 
eyes

vote fraud has become both art and science in 
mexico where voters sometimes register with vanishing ink and 
polling places may mysteriously move to new locations 
most of the tampering is blamed on supporters of the governing 
institutional revolutionary party which has won every presidential 
election since the party was founded in 1929 
for todays general election however thousands of opposition 
supporters planned to oversee polling places in the most ambitious 
effort yet to prevent fraud the dominant issue of the campaign 
the opposition credits the governing partys string of victories 
at least in part to fraud the institutional revolutionary party 
insists it has won honestly because of its overwhelming popularity 
and masterful organization 
president miguel de la madrid in a nationally broadcast message 
monday pledged to guarantee fair elections he said it is a 
commitment of the government of the republic to comply strictly 
with the law 
carlos salinas de gortari the governing party candidate is 
favored to defeat the two other major candidates manuel j 
clouthier of the national action party and cuauhtemoc cardenas of 
the national democratic front 
in hopes of neutralizing vote fraud this year a citizen 
watchdog group with opposition backing has issued a handbook for 
poll workers 
in it the democratic assembly for effective suffrage outlines 
what it says are 20 ways to cheat 
it explains things like strolling ballot boxes or polling 
places which move from their assigned sites confounding opposition 
supporters looking for a place to vote 
it warns of galloping armies of voters who dash from one 
polling place to the next using phony registration cards or 
signing in with ink that later fades erasing signs of multiple 
voting 
beware the manual warns of vote tacos ballots crammed 
with extra ballots 
during the counting process it says expert forgers go to work 
on phony tally sheets in secret falsification bunkers 
the bunkers the manual says work in tandem with clandestine 
alchemy workshops where experts at computer terminals linked to 
the interior ministry the national voter registry and 
institutional revolutionary party offices monitor the tallies from 
each polling place 
political parties are allowed to have workers on duty at the 
polls and the manual tries to give them what it calls antidotes 
to fraud 
these generally boil down to vigilance and to alerting the 
public if something seems amiss 
but the watchdog group admits helplessness in its ability to 
monitor the governments computerized electoral roll and the voter 
credentials it issues 
neither the citizens nor the opposition parties possess the 
technological capability to outdo the national voter registry in 
its ability to perform an endless series of tricks and produce 
unlimited versions of the electoral roll

the food and drug administration says 
consumers should be careful not to indiscriminately use the 
prescription acne drug retina to reduce wrinkles 
along with the consumer warning issued by the agency on tuesday 
came a warning that the agency is beginning a crackdown on 
unlicensed manufacturers that have started to advertise and 
distribute bogus drugs identified as retina 
use of all these products amounts to an expensive therapeutic 
gamble fda commissioner frank e young said in a statement 
longterm animal studies and wellcontrolled clinical trials 
involving larger numbers of patients in various age groups are 
needed to assess the risks and benefits of retina as a wrinkle 
reducer young said 
retina manufactured by ortho pharmaceutical corp of raritan 
nj has long been approved to treated acne and normally is 
applied to small areas of the skin for limited periods of time but 
the drug received nationwide attention earlier this year when a 
research article published in a mainstream medical journal 
suggested it could reduce or reverse wrinkling due to aging and sun 
damage

british commandos who killed three unarmed ira 
guerrillas in gibraltar four months ago will not attend the inquest 
there because doing so could endanger their lives newspaper 
reports said today 
the times of london said the seven commandos involved will not 
go because gibraltar coroner felix pizzarello in a preliminary 
ruling tuesday rejected conditions drawn up by prime minister 
margaret thatchers government for concealing their identities 
the seven belong to the british armys special air service 
regiment the elite undercover unit is hated by the irish 
republican army because of its deadly efficiency in killing 
guerrillas inside and outside northern ireland 
the times quoted unidentified government sources as saying the 
government decided not to send the agents to gibraltar because they 
could not possibly risk being seen by anyone else other than the 
coroner 
the thatcher government had demanded the men only be interviewed 
by pizzarello the coroner refused to comply 
speaking during a visit to northern ireland defense secretary 
george younger said tuesday it was for the seven commandos and 
their lawyers to decide whether or not to attend the inquest which 
pizzarello ruled will open in gibraltar on sept 6 
but the times said today effectively the government has 
already decided that they should not appear 
legislator michael mates said he was distressed that pizzarello 
had suggested no harm could come to the agents if they were seen 
and identified by lawyers at the inquest 
mates a member of mrs thatchers conservative party and 
chairman of the house of commons allparty defense select 
committee said it was possible the lawyers could be intimidated by 
the ira into giving descriptions of the commandos 
the seven soldiers cannot be forced to attend because though 
gibraltar off the southern tip of spain is a british colony it has 
its own local government and courts system and the inquest is 
outside mainland british jurisdiction 
the ira admitted that guerrillas mairead farrell daniel mccann 
and sean savage were on active service in gibraltar when they 
were killed by the commandos on march 6 
active service is an ira euphemism for gun and bomb attacks 
british authorities said they were plotting a car bomb attack on 
a british army parade 
the mainly roman catholic ira wants to end british rule in 
predominantly protestant northern ireland and unite it with 
overwhelmingly catholic irish republic under socialist rule 
prime minister charles haugheys government in the republic of 
ireland has criticized the slayings on grounds the commandos 
apparently made no attempt to arrest the guerrillas 
the slayings triggered violence in catholic areas of northern 
ireland in which two british soldiers and seven other people were 
killed 
alleged eyewitnesses said in a thames television documentary 
that the guerrillas were shot as two apparently tried to surrender 
and the third attempted to flee 
this appeared to contradict a statement by foreign secretary sir 
geoffrey howe the day after the shootings he told parliament the 
three were challenged as they walked toward the nearby spanish 
border and were slain because they made movements which led 
security personnel to believe their lives were in danger

the foreign ministry has denounced as 
grotesque the european parliaments decision to monitor chiles 
presidential vote 
a ministry statement read by spokesman carlos ducci said the 
parliaments members exhibited ignorance and a distorted 
appreciation of the chilean institutional process 
the parliament on tuesday approved a proposal by french deputy 
frances andres savi and agreed to create a special mission to 
monitor the chilean political campaign and balloting 
the action represents a shocking attempt to unnaturally 
intervene in the chilean peoples own affairs the ministry said 
it is grotesque 
chiles military government plans a yesorno ballot later this 
year on a single presidential candidate to be picked by the heads 
of the armed forces and national police 
it will be the first presidential ballot since president augusto 
pinochet the rightwing army commander seized power in a 1973 
coup 
no precise date has yet been established nor has a candidate 
been picked pinochet is expected to be the nominee 
pinochets critics along with the local roman catholic church 
have charged that his government is not giving proponents of a 
no vote equal access to television and other mass media 
they also accuse him of using government resources to promote a 
yes vote and suppress dissent 
several opponents have called on the international community to 
pressure pinochet into providing fairer election conditions

caribbean leaders say us drug 
policy has allowed washington to meddle in the affairs of other 
nations including panama and caribbean countries 
the prime ministers meeting tuesday for the ninth summit of the 
caribbean community and common market condemned drug trafficking 
but criticized us efforts to halt it said lester bird deputy 
prime minister of antiguabarbuda and spokesman for the closeddoor 
meetings 
bird said ministers determined that the question of the 
justice department in the united states seemingly wishing to have 
its writ to run sovereign countries outside its territory is a 
development which is of deep concern to the heads of government 
he said that while the ministers specifically discussed the case 
of panama they also were concerned about similar situations 
developing in caribbean nations 
the leaders plan to send a statement to president reagan 
expressing our concern for what we see is a derrogation from the 
rule of law within our territories bird said 
caribbean nations are poor and unable to wage a fullscale 
battle against drugs and need outside help the leaders agreed the 
issue mentioned only briefly was to be discussed further today 
bird said 
prime minister sir lynden pindling of the bahamas has been 
investigated by a florida grand jury in connection with allegations 
of drug trafficking in the bahamas 
the united states has used economic sanctions in its attempt to 
make panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega step down as that 
countrys de facto leader noriega was indicted in florida earlier 
this year for alleged drug trafficking 
the caribbean common market formed in 1973 to promote trade 
among its members includes antiguabarbuda bahamas barbados

the sleek g15 computer had all the 
latest features a reeltoreel tape drive and punchedpaper 
software in two refrigeratorsized units and a teletype all in 
decorator robins egg blue 
in 1954 it was a state of the art marvel of compactness and 
practibility and at 50000 a bargain to boot its inventor says 
it just may have been the first personal computer 
i like to think so it was the first one you could put in a 
regular office and let one person handle the g15s creator 
harry d huskey said tuesday 
the smithsonian institution agrees it is acquiring huskys own 
model of the computer manufactured by bendix 
we think it was a landmark device in shaping the computer 
industry said david allison chief curator of the smithsonians 
computer information and society exhibit planned for march 1990 
it was the packaging of the hardware that made it important 
he said 
huskey 71 developed the g15 over a period of several years 
beginning in 1952 while he was at wayne university in detroit on a 
years leave from the us bureau of standards he later sold the 
design to bendix 
this was back at a time when the computers that worked were 
all large ones in the milliondollar class huskey recalled in a 
telephone interview huskey used a magnetic drum similar to todays 
floppy disks for a memory instead of vacuum tubes then in use 
his computer was dubbed g15 g for general use and 15 to make 
prospective buyers think there were more models huskey said 
bendix which thought it would sell only about 200 actually sold 
400 
bendix was so happy at time the chrome fittings on the 400th 
g15 were gold plated huskey said he said he doesnt know what 
happened to that model

a rare french donkey born on the fourth 
of july has been dubbed lafayette by its owners in honor of the 
french general who served in the continental army in the american 
revolution 
he looks like a toy and has tiny feet owner sharon 
vanderlip said of the newborn hes really sweet he follows you 
all around the place kind of like a puppy 
vanderlip believes that the 50pound lafayette is the first 
poitou donkey born in the united states there are only 40 poitous 
worldwide she said 
this really is a critical moment in time for this breed so it 
was a very exciting experience so far he looks healthy but 
weve got our fingers crossed she said 
vanderlip and her husband jack both veterinarians in san diego 
county have four other poitous sonette lafayettes mother 
tartarin his father a third male named tabarin and a second 
female tosca all were imported from france 
sonette now 4 drew attention in late 1984 when us 
agriculture department officials ordered her destroyed or deported 
for failing tests designed to detect equine disease 
the vanderlips and others criticized the nearly eightdecade old 
testing procedures as outdated and unfair to donkeys and other 
exotic equines which have an unusual substance in their blood the 
outcry prompted a change in testing methods and allowed sonette to 
remain in the united states 
vanderlip said she and her husband had hoped for a female for 
breeding purposes but added were happy we have a live baby and 
will take what we get what we will do is breed sonette again and 
try for a female again

delegates to the national communist party 
conference want state and collective farms to operate with less 
meddling from party and government bureaucrats 
the delegates called for less interference in farm operations in 
a resolution adopted at the conference last week and published 
tuesday 
among the most frequent criticisms during the conference was the 
refrain that despite three years of economic reform programs few 
improvements in living standards are reaching average people 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said the biggest single 
problem was improving food supplies in a country of chronic 
shortages and frequent rationing 
in the resolution delegates told party and government agencies 
to let farms work out their own arrangements with workers and 
cooperatives 
any attempts to command collective and state farms should be 
stopped immediately the resolution said adding that the farms 
are capable of solving their problems independently 
soviet officials had said before the conference that gorbachev 
hoped for a quick boost in farm production by encouraging state and 
collective farms to lease land to individuals and families who 
would be permitted to grow what they wish and keep most of their 
profits 
some experiments suggest family farming could boost soviet 
agricultural productivity by several times 
the delegates in their resolution on perestroika or 
restructuring as gorbachev calls his reform program said the 
shortest way to solve the food problem is to tap the potential of 
the collective and state farms in full 
the farms could do this the resolution said by spreading 
diverse forms of contract and lease arrangements and building a 
farflung network of cooperatives both in relations with other 
enterprises and sections of the economy 
attacking the oftencriticized soviet labor force for working 
too little and producing shoddy goods the resolution said the 
party must overcome the tendency to pay everyone the same wage 
regardless of who performs best 
the soviet system of full employment low rent heavily 
subsidized basic foods and fully paid health care is often cited 
for discouraging individual initiative and tolerating poor 
performance 
we must make people much more interested in a better end 
result the resolution said utterly overcome equalization 
tendencies adhere more boldly and everywhere to the principle of 
compensating work in accordance with its quantity and especially 
quality to rule out a possiblity of living a comfortable life 
while doing shoddy work 
in a separate document attacking petty patronism and 
unresponsive inconsiderate and overcautious bureaucrats the 
delegates proposed to tie managers salaries to the 
costeffective results of the work performed by individual 
industries enterprises organizations and territories 
the delegates issued what amounts to a license for the 
statecontrolled press to root out manifestations of bureaucratic 
attitudes 
apparently offering encouragement to wouldbe humorists the 
resolution added the potential of the genre of satire should be 
fully used in combating the negative phenomena

a coalition of mainly liberal farm 
groups said they fear droughtinspired profit gouging by large 
agribusiness companies could lead to severe shortages in national 
food supplies 
whats on the line in this drought is the future of the family 
farm system said dixon terry a greenfield farmer and spokesman 
for the iowa farm unity coalition the coalition is made up of 
farm church and labor groups 
what looks to be the worst drought of the century is made 
worse by a failure of farm policy terry said tuesday as the 
group urged federal officials to investigate the handling of grain 
reserve programs 
terry and other leaders of the group held a news conference in 
front of a federal office building in des moines to underscore farm 
policies they said have aggravated troubles for farmers 
particularly livestock producers 
they called for an immediate end to subsidies designed to boost 
exports with that money shifted to drought assistance 
in those subsidy programs the government makes up the 
difference between what grain sells for in the united states and 
what it costs in other countries 
the coalition claims such programs keep prices low permitting 
large sales and profits from grain reserves by grain giants such as 
cargill and conggra on the highly competitive international market 
terry said reserves have been drained at the time when they may be 
needed by droughtstricken livestock farmers who are short of feed 
at conagras omaha neb headquarters spokeswoman lynn phares 
said we have seen no big new profits in grain merchandising 
because of the drought 
she said her company tends to do well when farmers do well not 
when times are tough in agriculture 
a spokesman at minneapolisbased cargill declined to comment 
weve given away farm commodities on a firesale basis 
terry said after all this cost to the taxpayers we may have a 
need for these commodities 
gary lamb a chelsea farmer and president of the iowa farmers 
union warned we could see dramatic shortages in food supplies 
around the country

prime minister dr mahathir 
mohamad today suspended five supreme court judges in another move 
indicating a growing rift between the prime minister and the 
judiciary 
the five were the same judges who on saturday issued an order 
that an international tribunal appointed by the king last month to 
investigate and remove malaysias highest ranking judge cease 
giving any recommendation report or advice on the case to the 
king 
mahathir suspended lord president mohamed salleh abas on may 31 
saying the yang dipertuan agong king sultan mahmood iskandar had 
so requested 
he said the king had asked that a tribunal be appointed to 
investigate salleh after salleh wrote to the king early this year 
with the suspension of the five today and the lord president on 
may only five judges remain on the supreme court bench 
salleh said he complained in a may 29 letter to the king about 
mahathirs constant attacks on the judiciary he also said that 
during a meeting with mahathir on may 27 the prime minister told 
him he had been biased on some cases connected with mahathirs 
united malays national organization political party 
mahathir has denied referring to the political party issue in 
the talks 
in february the high court ruled that mahathirs party was 
illegal because it had branches that were not registered with the 
authorities as required by law since then mahathir has set up a 
new party called new umno and has been busy recruiting his old 
members 
all judges are appointed by the king who is a constitutional 
monarch like britains queen elizabeth in consultation with the 
prime minister only the king can remove judges from office 
the international tribunal can only make recommendations 
the malaysian bar council expressed shock concern and 
dismay over the suspension

a man convicted in san 
franciscos zebra killings lost a fourth bid for freedom after 
telling a parole board he will never confess to the 1970s murder 
spree that left 14 people dead 
the threemember board of prison terms denied parole for manuel 
moore 40 after a 2hour hearing tuesday at the california mens 
colony in san luis obispo 
the panel said moore presents an unreasonable risk of danger 
and concluded that he committed the crimes in an especially 
heinous cruel coldblooded and calculated manner panel member 
ray jaurequi said 
another man convicted in the killings larry green faces a 
parole hearing later today 
the panel characterized the crimes as a murderous rampage that 
terrorized the san francisco bay area 
moore who is serving a life term and cannot seek parole for 
another three years maintained his innocence throughout the 
hearing 
im not going to say i did something when i didnt do it 
moore said you all can keep whipping me and whipping me im not 
going to submit i dont care how much you whip me and beat me 
ill pick myself up every time and tell you i didnt do it 
a prosecutor said moore has never admitted guilt nor expressed 
remorse for the random street killings of whites that left 14 dead 
and eight injured in the winter of 197374 
i have no doubt he would do it again if he was set free this 
is the same man who went out on the streets of san francisco 
shooting people he hasnt changed said assistant district 
attorney theresa welch of san francisco 
moore green jc simon and jessie lee cooks were convicted in 
1976 of murder conspiracy and assault after a yearlong trial 
they were charged in only some of the zebra attacks but all 14 
murders and eight assaults were introduced at the yearlong trial 
because of the conspiracy charges all received life sentences 
the murder victims included a woman who was beheaded with a 
machete an 81yearold man and a 19yearold college student 
carrying a teddy bear as a christmas present 
one survivor was san francisco mayor art agnos who was shot and 
wounded on on dec 13 1973 agnos was a private citizen at the 
time 
the case took its name from the z or zebra police radio 
frequency that was used during the investigation of the killings 
prosecutors argued that the attacks were the work of a black racist 
cult bent on slaying whites

china announced regulations today designed to 
lure taiwanese investors to the mainland to tap the potential 
here and make money 
the word comes a day before taiwans governing nationalist party 
holds a crucial congress at which it will discuss relaxing its ban 
on trade with the mainland 
the 22 regulations consolidate rules on tax breaks and other 
incentives already offered by many coastal provinces and cities 
closest to taiwan whose residents have covertly invested millions 
of dollars on the mainland 
we welcome taiwan business people to come and tap the 
potential here and make money and we would like to learn from 
their expertise yuan mu spokesman for the state council 
chinas cabinet told a news conference in the great hall of the 
people 
it is profitable for taiwan residents to come and invest 
here he said the cost of production in taiwan is rising some 
taiwanese capital needs to find outlets to other parts of the 
world 
taiwan has been estranged from the mainland since 1949 when the 
nationalists under chiang kaishek lost a civil war to the 
communists chiang and thousands of followers fled to taiwan about 
100 miles off the southeast coast and set up a rival government 
after decades of banning all contacts with the mainland the 
nationalists last year began allowing taiwan residents to visit 
close relatives there this spring taiwan began to permit mail 
exchanges via the international red cross 
although taiwan still bars trade and investment ties many 
taiwanese businessmen secretly have invested in their mainland 
ancestral homes twoway indirect trade totalled about 151 
billion last year 
the nationalist congress is to consider allowing the indirect 
import of raw materials such as coal from the mainland 
the communist governments investment regulations clearly were 
timed to provoke debate at the session and encourage younger 
nationalists to press for faster liberalization 
beijing regards relatively prosperous taiwan as a valuable 
source of needed capital and technology and has said repeatedly it 
is willing to forget the civil war legacy of hatred 
the regulations generally treat taiwanese the same as any 
foreign investor though shen jueren vice minister of the ministry 
of foreign economic relations and trade told the news conference 
that terms are slightly more favorable 
they guarantee the right to remit profits in convertible 
currency promise that no assets will be nationalized and exempt 
taiwanfunded enterprises from import and export taxes when they 
manufacture goods for export 
taiwanese may develop land in coastal areas of the mainland set 
up wholly owned companies enter into joint ventures with mainland 
companies buy stock or shares in mainland companies and engage in 
compensation trade the regulations say

a bombers incompetence probably saved salem 
from explosions that could have damaged six bridges serving this 
southern indiana city as well as offices and businesses 
authorities said 
at least 13 improperly wired bombs were discovered tuesday but 
only three of them had ignited producing only smoke and small 
fires army bomb disposal units defused the others there were no 
injuries and no suspects 
they used black powder as the cap and it didnt detonate 
said paul lyles emergency management director for the washington 
county department of civil defense luckily the guy who put it 
there didnt know much about explosives 
the bomber either lacked the expertise to properly wire the 
bombs or did not have an essential component said capt ronald v 
downing an army spokesman he did not elaborate 
the devices which contained timers attached to as many as 26 
sticks of gelatin dynamite were all packaged in paper grocery 
sacks and concealed next to bridges or buildings in this town of 
6000 people 
mayor frank newkirk sr who found one of the bombs next to a 
bridge said it was obviously an act of terrorism in my book 
certainly done by a wacko 
morris strange who lives across from the service station said 
he arrived home to find officials surrounding it as they searched 
for more bombs 
of course i was scared you dont expect this to happen in any 
town in the us this isnt the middle east strange said 
a transient found under one of the bridges was taken in for 
questioning but later released police said 
we have no indications of any motive at this time we have no 
suspects said state police sgt marvin jenkins due to the 
fact no one has been injured and theres no property damage yet 
were very strongly hoping this is just a poor joke 
portions of the city which is surrounded by the blue river and 
brock creek were evacuated and sealed off as bomb squads from fort 
benjamin harrison in indianapolis and fort knox in kentucky defused 
the bombs 
the devices were turned over to agents of the bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms which was investigating along with the army

israel will investigate a complaint that its 
security agents posed as an abc news crew so they could arrest a 
palestinian youth a government spokesman said today 
the television network made the allegation public on tuesday and 
demanded an investigation 
we are going to check the whole issue said avi pazner an 
aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir i can not tell now what 
our response will be 
my first reaction was amazement over the strange way in which 
the complaint was passed pazner added a messenger brought it 
to my house at 2 am i find it strange that somebody has ordered 
the complaint to be delivered at such an hour as if a war has 
started 
dean reynolds abcs israel correspondent said the network 
learned about the incident on june 26 two days after it allegedly 
occurred and complained to the israeli police army and prime 
ministers office 
he said the network decided to make the complaint public after 
receiving no satisfactory response 
there have been other reports of this happening to other 
agencies reynolds said the central issue here is the danger 
it puts my cameramen in should palestinians think his crew is 
israeli security agents 
abc news president roone arledge sent a protest by telex tuesday 
to shamir 
abc world news tonight reported tuesday that the phony news crew 
had arrested a 17yearold youth named nizar dakdouk of the 
occupied west bank village of salfit 
abc news said it learned that the impostors were members of 
the israeli secret security service shin bet 
israeli troops demolished dakdouks home on june 16 saying the 
youth had thrown a firebomb at a bus the report said 
the youth and his mother complained the next day on israeli 
television that if he was suspected of something the army should 
have arrested him before blowing up the house abc said 
a week after the tv appearance israeli civilians posing as abc 
news personnel arrived at the dakdouk familys temporary housing in 
two cars and said they wanted to interview dakdouk and his brother 
on the site of the destroyed house the report said the boys 
agreed to go 
at the site one of the cars sped off with dakdouk and he was 
later arrested abc said

the massachusetts supreme court has unanimously 
thrown out a probate court judges order that a mentally retarded 
patient at a state school should undergo testing for aids 
the patient identified by the fictitious name anthony had 
not been tested since the judges order was stayed by a state 
appeals court judge pending the high courts decision the order 
also applied to another unidentified male patient who allegedly was 
anthonys sexual partner 
the supreme court said probate judge eliot k cohen exceeded his 
guardianship authority when he ordered the walter e fernald state 
school in worcester county to have the patients tested 
denise mcwilliams who is both anthonys attorney and director 
of the aids law project at the gay and lesbian advocates and 
defenders organization in cambridge said she was pleased with the 
decision but said it was very limited in its terms 
the justices she noted did not consider larger issues 
concerning state legal requirements on written informed consent 
from patients before tests for acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
can be made and their results disseminated 
the justices said they didnt take up those issues because it 
is clear that the probate and family court judge did not have 
authority to assume control of the department and to order the 
department to conduct tests on anthony and another party 
the judge in effect and incorrectly usurped the function of 
the executive branch of the state government according to the 
courts decision 
mary breslauer spokeswoman for the attorney generals office 
which represented the state department that operates the 
institution said it was gratified that the high court agreed 
with our position that the trial judge had overstepped his boundary 
by ordering an aids test 
cohen had ordered anthony and the other patient to be tested for 
aids even though that was not the issue before him 
the state had asked cohen to amend an earlier courtordered 
medical plan for anthony so he could have a venereal wart removed 
by the time cohen heard the case the wart had disappeared and all 
parties concerned from anthonys physician to department 
officials asked that the request be dismissed 
but cohen concluded in his ruling that the wart the 
unrestrictive setting at the mental health facility and anthonys 
alleged homosexual activity were conducive to aids and the 
potential spread thereof 
cohen ordered anthony and the other patient to undergo the aids 
test contending state officials had averted facing the issue of 
determining if a major health problem exists at the facility 
but state officials and others at anthonys hearing said that 
neither anthony nor any other resident of the facility showed 
symptoms of aids that the facility was developing an aids 
education program and that aids testing was not medically 
advisable for anthony the high court said

president corazon aquino said today 
she will let ferdinand marcos return to the philippines so he can 
stand trial on charges of stealing billions of dollars during his 
20year rule 
mrs aquino made the remark shortly before todays cabinet 
meeting 
when asked by reporters if she would allow marcos her ousted 
predecessor to return to defend himself she replied yes of 
course 
as i have said if due process will be observed then 
naturally the decision of the court will be respected she added 
officials of the presidential commission on good government have 
said they expect to file criminal charges against marcos by 
january the task of the commission is to recover up to 10 billion 
that marcos and his family allegedly stole from the government or 
acquired in other illegal ways during his rule 
commission chairman ramon diaz told reporters today he was 
waiting for swiss authorities to release information on marcos 
swiss bank accounts which are to be used as evidence against the 
deposed president swiss officials have said they can release the 
information only after prosecution begins 
the philippines does not allow trial in absentia so marcos 
would have to be allowed into the country to stand trial since 
february 1986 he has lived in exile in hawaii 
after we receive the evidence from swiss banks then we will 
file the case diaz said when the criminal case is filed 
mrs aquino is not going to put any obstacle to call in marcos 
home to manila because he has to face the courts 
mrs aquino has so far refused to allow the former president to 
return for security reasons she came to power after marcos was 
ousted during a civilianmilitary revolt in february 1986

most effective leaders in the us senate any time he wants me to 
be there ill be there

odds in senate debate have in common their struggle to overcome 
their environments

to fly the plane towards some sensitive strategic center of the 
zionist enemy and to blow it up there with us inside 
witnesses told the court that four gunmen dressed as airport 
security guards drove a small van to the pan am jet 
they said the four charged the plane and demanded it fly to 
cyprus to pick up palestinian comrades early in the hijacking the 
threeman cockpit crew escaped through an emergency hatch 
after shooting an indianamerican passenger the tension reached 
a climax around 930 pm when an onboard generator ran out of 
fuel plunging the cabin into darkness 
fearing an attack the gunmen began spraying the inside with 
bullets as pakistani security forces stormed the plane 
throughout their trial the five blamed the pakistani commandos 
for the killings 
judge syed zafar babar discounted that argument but found the 
defendants guilty of just 11 deaths saying there was insufficient 
evidence to convict them of more 
pan am was targeted because of its american origins

yasser arafats palestinian guerrillas 
held talks with arab mediators today about abandoning their last 
beirut stronghold the bourj elbarajneh refugee camp to end a 
bloody power struggle with a syrianbacked militia police said 
col saeed mousas fatahuprising faction stopped shelling the 
camp while arafats fatah fighters negotiated with algerian 
officials syrian army officers and leaders of leftist lebanese 
militias police said 
scattered clashes were reported on the edges of the camp 
at least 158 people have been killed and 618 wounded since 
fighting broke out may 1 for control of bourj elbarajneh and the 
nearby chatilla camp 
the struggle involves two palestinian militias arafats fatah 
and mousas dissidents who in 1983 broke away from arafat 
a police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
mediators were working on a plan to evacuate from the camp the 
last group of arafats guerrillas estimated at 100 
the loss of chatilla and the likely evacuation of bourj 
elbarajneh are a serious setback for arafat who has been trying 
to rebuild his power base in lebanon since he was forced out of 
beirut in israels 1982 invasion 
a fatah official in bourj elbarajneh who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the fatah guerrillas have accepted the evacuation 
idea in principle but are demanding guarantees that they will not 
be attacked when then leave the camp 
he said about 150 fatah fighters have already left the camp 
peacefully since the latest bout of fighting erupted monday 
a fatahuprising spokesman abufadi hammad said arafats men 
will only be allowed to evacuate after they hand over their 
weapons 
the fatah spokesman said the guerrillas still in bourj 
elbarajneh will probably be taken to palestine liberation 
organization bases near the port city of sidon about 25 miles 
south of beirut 
mousas fighters based in the syriancontrolled mountains 
overlooking beirut heavily outgunned arafats men when they 
overran chatilla june 27 using artillery rockets and heavy 
mortars 
arafats men dislodged mousas fighters from the camps soon 
after the power struggle flared in may but the syrianbacked 
fatahuprising faction regrouped and counterattacked in ferocious 
bombardments of the camps from positions in the mountains though 
arafats men were able to repulse more than 20 assaults by mousas 
guerrillas they have steadily lost ground 
fatah officials said 80 percent of bourj elbarajneh has been 
wrecked in the last two months only an estimated 3000 of the 
camps 20000 residents remain 
the fighting between the palestinian factions was preceded by 
nearly six years of attacks by israelis lebanese christian 
militias and syrianbacked shiite moslems in which thousands of 
people were killed or wounded 
mousa broke away from arafats plo in a syrianbacked mutiny in 
may 1983 and set up headquarters in the syrian capital of damascus 
the latest fighting flared after the plo chairman visited 
damascus in april to try to end his fiveyear feud with syrian 
president hafez assad over who would control the palestinian 
movement 
arafat has accused the syrian government of fomenting the battle 
in beirut to assert its control on the moslem sector of the city

a judge has reserved decision on the 
governments latest request in its campaign to reform the teamsters 
assistant us attorney randy mastro on tuesday sought a 
preliminary injunction to protect the membership from their own 
leadership 
the government wants liaison officers appointed and empowered to 
discipline teamsters corruption and appoint trustees for 
corrupt locals 
but teamsters attorney john r climaco asked us district judge 
david edelstein to give the union more time to counter what we 
consider the false and shameful allegations by the government 
edelstein did not indicate when he would rule on the government 
request 
last week the government claiming the teamsters were dominated 
by the mafia filed a civil racketeering lawsuit seeking to place 
the 16 millionmember union under a courtappointed trustee who 
would oversee free and fair elections 
the lawsuit also sought to oust any member of the unions 
18member executive board found to have committed or aided the 
commission of racketeering activities

the pentagon says the iranian airliner shot 
down by a navy ship in the persian gulf was broadcasting on a 
military channel although officials privately acknowledge the jet 
was in commercial airspace at the time of the incident 
the reagan administration said tuesday that capt will c rogers 
iii of the cruiser uss vincennes thought his ship was under attack 
in part because of conflicting identification signals sent from the 
iran air a300 airbus 
pentagon spokesman daniel howard said some of the signals were 
on a military frequency identified with f14 fighter jets 
but while the administration was defending the decision to fire 
on the airliner sentiment grew for us reparations to relatives 
of the disasters victims and officials were being buffeted by 
calls for a speedy gesture of conciliation on the world stage 
on the record administration officials said there had been no 
discussion of awarding reparations but sources who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity said the idea was under active consideration 
at the state department the pentagon and the white house 
reagan did not rule out reparations saying it is a matter 
that has to be discussed once a us investigative team 
dispatched to the gulf completes its work 
but airbus spokesman david velupillai said from the southern 
french town of toulouse that the jet involved in the incident was 
delivered to iran air six years ago with two transponders aboard 
that should have responded to identification requests from the 
vincennes 
iranian airliner pilots however denied that flight 655 would 
have been sending on a military channel 
in london on tuesday capt massoud razavi a senior iran air 
pilot denied us claims that the downed a300 was transmitting on 
two transponders including a frequency used previously for 
military information 
he told a news conference at the iranian embassy the 
transponder we are using is the standard transponder and we use 
mode a which is the civilian code the code is given by dubai 
where the jet was headed and it is preset into the transponder 
before takeoff 
capt mehroujan gharib an iran air boeing 747 supervisory pilot 
and safety officer replied no at the same conference when 
asked if iran air civilian planes sometimes used a military 
frequency 
iran has accused the united states of intentionally shooting 
down the widebodied jet which was flying over the persian gulf 
with 290 people aboard president reagan and other us officials 
have described it as a tragic accident 
one congressional source said administration officials are 
recommending that reagan quickly make an offer of compensation on a 
humanitarian basis in part to differentiate the united states from 
the soviet union which rebuffed all requests for reparations 
following its 1983 destruction of a korean air lines jetliner with 
269 people aboard 
some us officials however noted that the iranian government 
has used the incident as an antiamerican rallying point and said 
it might be reluctant to cooperate with any us humanitarian 
effort 
irans military commanderinchief parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani continued the drumbeat of hostile rhetoric tuesday 
declaring on tehran radio we cannot allow ourselves to refrain 
from taking revenge the choice of timing is up to us and not to 
america 
in other developments 
a man purporting to speak for islamic jihad claimed the 
proiranian faction would kill one of two american hostages it was 
holding in lebanon but police in beirut said the deadline passed 
without incident it was not possible to authenticate the call 
peggy say sister of hostage terry anderson said she had been 
told that he might be released over the july 4th weekend but those 
hopes were dashed by sundays attack in the persian gulf anderson 
40 chief middle east correspondent for the associated press has 
been held the longest of 18 foreign captives in lebanon 
secretary of state george p shultz disclosed tuesday that 
before the airbus was shot down iranian officials had sent 
messages through third parties indicating a desire to open a direct 
dialogue with the united states and that the united states had 
responded positively the new york times reported in todays 
editions 
weve had a number of these probes from iran through 
various third parties saying that theyd like to talk with us and 
weve responded to those shultz said as he began a 2week trip 
to nine pacific and east asian nations since there have been 
several we have said were ready for one and were prepared for 
an authoritative discussion 
howard the pentagons top spokesman said the iranian aircraft 
was broadcasting in two modes and that one of those had been 
previously identified or associated with an f14 jet fighter 
the most potent attack plane in irans arsenal 
but other information that surfaced tuesday cast doubt on 
initial pentagon reports that the plane was outside commercial 
airspace and was descending toward the vincennes as an attacking 
warplane would do 
house armed services chairman les aspin dwis said military 
officials told his panel during a closeddoor briefing that the 
airliner never left a commercial air corridor officials also 
disclosed that another american ship in the area concluded the 
iranian a300 airbus maintained a steady altitude of 12600 feet 
rather than descending toward the vincennes 
senior members of congress called on reagan to make a 
humanitarian gesture by offering compensation to families that lost 
relatives aboard the jetliner 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said that if reparations 
would assuage the grief of the other aggrieved party surely we 
could do that congress would support that if it were requested 
i think it would be a wise idea said sen john warner 
rva the top republican on the senate armed services committee 
theres a clear admission by our president that this was an 
unfortunate accident and congress likely would provide the money 
for such payments he said 
apparently the most relevant law is one that provides for 
compensation in combatrelated situations it empowers the 
pentagon to settle claims for such losses the iranian jetliner was 
shot down over waters patrolled by us warships protecting tankers 
carrying oil to europe and japan 
while the commanders have orders to fire if attacked and have 
done so the united states is not at war with iran 
amid the swirl of questions about how the administration will 
make amends for the air disaster officials disclosed that reagan 
had sent a carefully worded diplomatic message to irans leaders 
urging an end to the 8yearold iraniraq war 
reagans message sent sunday through swiss intermediaries 
expressed deep regret about the incident it was not an 
intentional act he said in the message 
reagans message to tehran came amid an outpouring of dismay and 
some outrage from friends and foes around the world 
radio moscow condemned the us attack as deliberate mass 
murder in cold blood president mohammad zia alhaq of pakistan 
a us ally called the incident both highly regrettable and 
reprehensible

britain and iran have completed a deal to exchange 
compensation for damage to each others embassies in violent 
incidents about eight years ago the foreign office announced today 
it insisted the agreement did not mean britain was paying a 
price for better relations 
iran is to net nearly 2 million in the deal which foreign 
office officials and mohammed besti the iranian charge daffaires 
in london completed tuesday after three weeks of negotiations a 
foreign office spokesman said 
observers speculated that irans willingness to negotiate 
signaled a desire to improve its relations with britain which were 
severely strained last year when a british diplomat was beaten up 
in tehran and london withdrew its staff 
the spokesman said britain will pay iran 34 million in 
compensation for damaging the iranian embassy in london which 
british commandos stormed and gutted in 1980 to free hostages held 
by opponents of the iranian government 
iran will pay britain 167 million dollars for damage caused by 
crowds to the british embassy in tehran following the seizure of 
the american embassy and its staff in 1979 the spokesman said 
the spokesman who requested anonymity denied the compensation 
was aimed at freeing british hostages in lebanon 
you should not look at this agreement in the context of us 
trying to pay a price for better relations with the iranians he 
said we have said we want better relations with iran it is an 
important country 
the deal was announced only two days after iran severely 
criticized prime minister margaret thatchers refusal to condemn 
the united states for downing an iranian airliner over the persian 
gulf 
the united states said its forces mistook the civilian jetliner 
for an iranian jet fighter

here is a sampling of editorial page reaction to edwin meese 
iiis announcement tuesday that he is resigning as us attorney 
general 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
edwin meese iii has wisely decided to declare victory and 
retreat never mind that the attorney generals pathetic claims of 
exoneration ring hollow his promise to leave office within a month 
will allow the administration to begin the tedious task of 
rebuilding a justice department laid low by the faulty judgment of 
its boss 
exoneration the special prosecutor simply indicated he will not 
seek to indict the attorney general this should not be confused 
with a vote of confidence 
the truth is he has been presiding for some time over a justice 
department that was steadily losing respected attorneys the 
reasons for this integrity drain had little to do with the barrage 
of misleading and false allegations cited by meese at his press 
conference rather the exodus was caused by the real very real 
ethical questions regarding the attorney generals conduct 
in short meese undermined the system the sooner he goes the 
sooner it may recover 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
attorney general edwin meese iiis resignation will bring to an 
end one of the saddest periods in the history of the department of 
justice 
the department has been in a state of drift conflict within and 
without and the appearance of and perhaps the fact of 
impropriety at the top all this centered on mr meeses 
activities we have to say it is good to see him go at last 
that report fully vindicates me the attorney general said 
well see the report is still secret it is reported to be 
critical of mr meeses ethical standards all the public knows is 
that the independent counsel decided not to seek an indictment of 
the attorney general what a standard for vindication not 
indicted 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
in his own time and on his own terms attorney general edwin 
meese finally has heeded the chorus calling for his resignation 
 
meeses announcement came just hours after the filing of special 
prosecutor james mckays report on the attorney generals conduct 
which apparently found insufficient basis for prosecution in 
meeses eyes that finding cleared the way for resignation with 
full honor the absence of an indictment meese said fully 
vindicates me the question the report raised about his ethical 
behavior amount to mere commentary and opinon 
that list of unlawyerly high jinks apparently was not enough to 
spur an indictment yet surely it is enough to prompt an attorney 
general to step down americans needed no guidance from a special 
prosecutor to conclude that meese was unscrupulous and imprudent 
many have known from the start what meese will not admit even now 
to deserve the job an attorney general must not only skirt 
criminality he must avoid dishonor 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
whats right about this is that the justice department will no 
longer be headed by someone distracted by so many embarrassing 
ethical and political questions 
his performance was badly flawed he bungled the irancontra 
investigation giving oliver north the time he needed to shred 
documents he let his friend robert wallach manipulate the 
machinery of government for a middle east pipeline project a legal 
and political abuse whatever the independent counsel concludes 
about its criminality 
a crook he was not but that is not the only basis for holding 
high office he did not earn the presidents bouquet yesterday that 
he was a darn good attorney general his friend ronald reagan 
gave more faithful loyalty down than ed meese gave lawyerly loyalty 
up 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
in announcing tuesday that he will step down as us attorney 
general in late july or early august edwin meese was able to 
satisfy his personal goal of leaving the reagan administration with 
what he considers a clear name 
politically his departure enables vice president george bush to 
go forward with his presidential campaign with less of the 
socalled sleaze factor created by the meese controversy and 
it takes mr meese out of the limelight before the republican 
national convention 
it was a relief for the administration that no criminal charges 
were brought against mr meese as a result of the investigation 
that ended tuesday 
there is a lesson here for the next president whether it be 
george bush or michael dukakis mr meese has been described by the 
president as a loyal and good friend the nations top lawyer 
should not be selected on the basis of friendship or because the 
person was a valued campaign adviser but because that person is 
highly respected in the legal field 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
details of the independent counsels report have not been made 
public indications however are that the investigation unearthed 
no grounds for a criminal indictment in that sense mr meese was 
able to accompany his resignation wath a claim of vindication 
the main question though was not whether the attorney general 
had committed crimes in office it was rather whether he had set 
appropriate standards of ethical conduct for other federal 
officails to emultate 
most americans are willing to excuse one or two misjudgments on 
the part of their high public officials but attorney general meese 
had arrived at the point where answering allegations claimed too 
much of his time and his attention the burden had become too 
weighty 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
he leaves office having been mightily investigated and not 
indicted is that the measure of a successful attorney general a 
man who has served his country and his president with distinction 
hardly it is the minimum 
while not rising to the level of rulebreaking or actual crime 
mr meeses repeated intervention on behalf of friends his sloppy 
personal financial dealings and his apparent lack of understanding 
of the need for exemplary not just lawful behavior in office have 
been continuously troubling 
surely mr meese and his family will be glad to leave 
washington they have been the target of a great deal of public 
abuse and have suffered more than one private tragedy during their 
years here it is understandable that he is relieved by the 
independent counsels decision but he has done the right thing by 
resigning now 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
by announcing his intention to resign within a few weeks as us 
attorney general edwin meese has finally acceded to the wishes of 
the enemies of his president as well as many of the presidents 
friends politics is a hard calling and mr meese had become a 
political liability to his president and his cause he picked a 
good time to leave 
mr meese observed that since there was no finding of grounds 
for criminal action against him the investigation by special 
counsel mckay fully vindicated him that is something of an 
overstatement had mr meese not announced his resignation the 
justice departments own office of professional responsibility 
would likely have had to conduct yet another debilitating 
investigation on the basis of the mckay report 
yet his continued presence in washington would have been an 
undeniable liability for the reagan administration in its remaining 
months not to mention the presidential campaign of fellow 
republican george bush in the end mr meeses inability to steer 
clear of political hazards cost him his job it also created a 
stain on the administration he so zealously sought to serve

the designated heir to ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini called for attacks on us targets worldwide to avenge the 
downing of an iranian passenger jet carrying 290 people commercial 
flights were canceled in the area of the attack 
before dawn today iranian gunboats raided a merchant vessel in 
the strait of hormuz gateway to the persian gulf and set the ship 
ablaze shipping executives said 
the executives identified the ship as the atlantic ocean and 
said it had a korean crew they had no further details 
us military investigators today reportedly interviewed the 
commander and senior officers of the uss vincennes as an official 
inquiry into the shooting of the airbus 300 began all 290 people 
on board iran air flight 655 were killed 
ayatollah hussein ali montazeri khomeinis heirapparent urged 
irans patriarch in a letter to order terrorist attacks against 
us targets worldwide 
in the letter montazeri asked khomeini 87 to call on 
revolutionary cells to unleash their wrath on american 
financial political and military targets everywhere 
tehran radio reported that president ali khamenei sent letters 
to heads of state claiming iran has the right to avenge the blood 
of innocent children men and women 
khamenei asked other nations to condemn the united states for 
the downing of flight 655 which he said roused a wave of rage in 
iran 
in the persian gulf airport sources said commercial flights 
were canceled or diverted in several countries because of the 
downing of the jet 
iran air stopped its daily flights from the iranian airport of 
bandar abbas to dubai airport airline sources said the route is 
the same that flight 655 took when it was hit 
us officials said the warship shot down the iranian jetliner 
because its officers believed the plane was an iranian f14 fighter 
jet a key goal of the inquiry will be to establish why the system 
did not distinguish between the widebodied airliner and a military 
jet 
under a 15day deadline and a tight lid of secrecy the 
sixmember team went to work hours after arriving in the gulf late 
tuesday military sources said 
the group led by rear adm william m fogarty a senior staff 
officer at us central command headquarters in tampa fla 
includes a military lawyer and technical experts who will analyze 
computer tapes communications records and other data 
the navy refused to give the current location of the 9600ton 
vincennes in new york the iranian mission to the united nations 
said tuesday that the doomed airliner had signaled that it was a 
civilian plane in toronto an iranian official said the airbus was 
still climbing when it was hit and had not received any us 
warnings 
us officials have said the plane did not signal it was a 
civilian airliner that it was descending as it approached the 
vincennes following a typical attack pattern and that seven 
warnings were sent to the plane on both military and civilian 
channels 
american sources in the gulf speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that us warships had at least twice been involved 
in mixups with civilian planes before 
one officer said that about a month ago an airliner thought a 
us warship was trying to order it to change course when the ship 
was talking by radio to a different plane 
another us military source said a us frigate making its 
first trip into the gulf through the strait of hormuz in midjune 
briefly locked its weapons radar on an airliner but quickly 
realized the mistake 
these crews are always nervous when they come into the gulf 
for the first time said the source and one thing they dont 
seem to get the word on is how much commercial air traffic there is 
out here 
iran accuses the united states of supporting iraq in the persian 
gulf war which began in september 1980 the united states 
official position is that it is neutral and its forces are in the 
gulf to protect neutral shipping which iran has been attacking

research on the contenders and seeking input from party leaders 
brountas was to remain in the nations capital for several days 
meanwhile dukakis came under attack today on his home turf 
republican sen arlen specter of pennsylvania called a news 
conference on the statehouse steps to criticize a massachusetts 
program that until it was amended earlier this year allowed 
inmates serving life sentences without chance for parole to be 
furloughed one such inmate raped a maryland woman after escaping 
while on furlough 
specter appeared at the request of likely republican nominee 
george bush and said he planned a similar event thursday in 
denver i think it raises a question as to his overall 
judgment specter said of dukakis support of the furlough 
program 
the dukakis campaign had local law enforcement officials 
prosecutors and sen john f kerry on hand to counter specter 
kerry and specter engaged in a goodnatured give and take but kerry 
had harsh words for bush saying he has been a failure in leading 
the reagan administrations antidrug efforts 
dukakis was scheduled to meet with several civil rights leaders 
this afternoon and was to address the greek orthodox ecumenical 
congress which is meeting in boston the certain republican 
nominee vice president george bush was to visit dukakis home 
turf thursday to address the same group 
dukakis also plans to travel to arizona friday during a 
threeday campaign swing through the west to meet privately with 
former rival and exarizona gov bruce babbitt the trip will also 
include campaigning in texas with bentsen 
campaign aides said dukakis would seek babbitts advice but that 
the former governor was not being considered for the vice 
presidential nomination 
gore waved to reporters but declined comment when he emerged 
from dukakis brookline home after spending an hour with the 
governor tuesday night the tennessee senator was critical of 
dukakis at times during the primary season but endorsed him last 
month during a dukakis campaign swing in the south 
gephardt dmo spent an hour with dukakis earlier tuesday at 
the statehouse he declined to discuss specifics of their 
conversation but said he would accept the vice presidential 
nomination if dukakis offered it to him 
before leaving town on tuesday jackson said he was the most 
qualified of the candidates for second billing behind dukakis and 
called other contenders unknown quantities 
jackson left behind top aide ron brown who met with dukakis 
campaign manager susan estrich and democratic national committee 
chairman paul kirk to discuss convention logistics 
democratic officials were discussing a tentative convention 
framework in which jackson would deliver a prime time television 
speech on tuesday night the second night of the party sessions 
sources said 
the governor has made attorney general edwin meese a frequent 
target during his campaign rhetoric and was quick to respond to 
word that meese was resigning 
i think the meese resignation is long overdue dukakis told 
reporters as he left his office for the day i never thought he 
should have been appointed in the first place 
dukakis said the meese resignation would not affect his 
criticism of the ethical standards of the reagan administration and 
he said bush had to answer for those problems 
the meese resignation itself is not going to solve this 
administrations problems dukakis said this administration 
has had one scandal after another one resignation after another 
dukakis has tried to carefully juggle his duties as governor 
with his candidacy but a new poll suggested his run for the white 
house may have affected his onceoverwhelming support at home 
the poll conducted by krc research of cambridge for the boston 
herald and wbztv found that 55 percent of the 400 likely 
massachusetts general election voters polled gave dukakis a 
favorable rating compared to 71 percent in january 1987 before 
he announced his presidential candidacy the poll which had a 
margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points said 
dukakis unfavorability rating has jumped from 17 percent in 
january 1987 to 36 percent 
the survey indicated voters were not happy with the way dukakis 
has handled the states recent budget problems but still showed 
him leading bush in massachusetts 51 percent to 37 percent

several thousand workers from 
yugoslavias largest rubber and shoe plant today forced their way 
inside the federal parliament building but police forced them out 
a half hour later witnesses and the tanjug news agency said 
in an action unprecedented in communist yugoslavias postwar 
history about 4000 demonstrators clashed with security police in 
front of the parliament building police were unable to stop the 
protestors from entering 
the workers are demanding a 100 percent pay increase 30 percent 
reduction of the plants administration better working conditions 
and full rather than partial payment of june wages 
the workers said their average wages amount to 150000 dinars 
or 6250 the average yugoslav salary is the equivalent of 120 
the demonstrators filled the halls of the domed classicalstyle 
building demanding negotiations with top government officials and 
chanting slogans calling for changes in the leadership 
after about half an hour police and parliament security 
officers forced them to leave no weapons were used and no injuries 
were reported tanjug and witnesses said 
tanjug said the demonstrators waited outside the building for 
the president of parliament dusan popovski to come out and 
address them 
the demonstrators demanded the resignation of nenad krekic 
yugoslavias finance minister krekic was the director of their 
plant two years ago and the workers hold him responsible for their 
situation 
about 5000 demonstrators representing about 10000 strikers of 
the borovo plant traveled on foot and by bus from borovo a 
central yugoslav town 62 miles west of belgrade they began 
arriving in the capital during the night and continued coming 
during the morning 
the demonstrators were met at a downtown trade union building by 
a government delegation that included zvonimir hrabar state trade 
union president and spasoje medenica vice president of the 
federal parliament 
they promised us everything except the pay hike which is our 
main demand one borovo worker zorica radic told the associated 
press 
we refuse to move from here and will continue the protest 
until our demands are met she said 
more than 10000 people mostly borovo workers demonstrated 
tuesday in vukovar the administrative center of the region about 
three miles south of borovo they chanted down with the 
government and demanded higher wages witnesses said 
the demand for pay increases clashes with the governments 
austerity measures that link wages to productivity in order to cut 
inflation currently at about 175 percent and to improve overall 
economic performance 
yugoslav officials claim there is no alternative to the program 
made in conjunction with the international monetary fund if the 
country wants to pay off its 21 billion foreign debt 
how can we survive and do heavy physical work if the prices go 
up and the wages are the same level or even go down one of the 
workers who arrived in belgrade said 
we will not continue to work and there will be a lot of 
trouble if our wages are not hiked he said 
another 2000 workers of the vertilen textile factory in 
varazdin about 30 miles north of zagreb also were on strike 
they marched on the towns streets today chanting we want 
bread and work and demanded that the factory temporarily closed 
for producing losses be reopened 
yugoslavia registered an alltime record of 1600 strikes last 
year involving more than 300000 workers but most of those work 
stoppages were staged inside factory gates

democrat michael dukakis talked privately today with indiana 
rep lee hamilton the latest in the parade of vice presidential 
candidates vice president george bush said he would not apologize 
to iran for the us military action that left 290 civilians dead 
en route to dallas for a speech to hispanic leaders bush was 
asked by reporters if the united states should apologize for 
shooting down an iranian civilian plane no but we probably 
ought to do what we did which is to officially express regret 
which i guess should happen when you have the loss of innocent 
life 
but as for an apology bush said i wouldnt because of the 
facts what happened 
dukakis wrapped up another round in his search for a vice 
presidential running mate meeting in boston with hamilton who 
told reporters afterward i would accept it first of all if he 
thought i could be helpful hamilton won praise for his handling 
of the select irancontra committee and has been advising dukakis 
informally on foreign policy 
dukakis efforts in choosing a vice presidential candidate 
occurred against the backdrop of a budget crisis at home in 
massachusetts the money crunch forced him to agree to new taxes 
an issue that was quickly seized upon by the republicans 
dukakis also came under criticism from president reagan who on 
tuesday also gave the vice president his strongest vote of 
confidence yet 
bush is the kind of man i want to follow me reagan told a 
group of conservatives at the old executive office building he 
said bush would continue the conservative revolution begun under 
reagan 
bush was traveling to his adopted home state of texas today for 
a meeting of the league of united latinamerican citizens the 
largest hispanic civil rights organization in the country 
dukakis on tuesday brought in sen albert gore jr of tennessee 
and rep richard gephardt of missouri for facetoface talks in 
boston gephardt said hed take the job if it were offered but 
gore would not comment 
the former dukakis rivals treated him harshly during the heat of 
the primary campaign but both eventually endorsed the massachusetts 
governor 
dukakis is also to travel to arizona friday to meet with another 
former rival bruce babbitt aides said dukakis was seeking 
babbitts advice but was not considering him for the vice 
presidential nomination 
jesse jackson who spent the july fourth holiday with dukakis 
dismissed contenders other than himself 
the others under consideration are unknown quantities beyond 
their districts and beyond their home states jackson said in 
boston before leaving for new york where he was holding a series 
of editorial board meetings today 
the private sessions with prospective running mates fueled 
speculation that the certain democratic nominee was moving closer 
to naming a second 
while dukakis conducted interviews at home his closest adviser 
paul brountas began a fourday stay in washington campaign aides 
said brountas was conducting research on the vice presidential 
contenders and talking with party leaders 
attorney general edwin meese iiis resignation tuesday was 
welcome news to the bush campaign which viewed the attorney 
generals legal problems as a liability although bush never 
publicly criticized meese or called for his resignation he issued 
a statement saying ed did the right thing and i wish him well 
dukakis who has frequently made an issue of ethics problems in 
the reagan administration called the meese resignation long 
overdue 
this administrations inability to set high standards for 
public service will not be solved by the meese resignation he 
said this administration has had one scandal after another one 
resignation after another 
dukakis in turn came under fire from reagan who in addressing 
the conservatives referred to dukakis not by name but as a 
governor it was clear which governor he was talking about 
though 
the american people understand what liberalism means and dont 
like it so our opponents plan to go to the voters incognito 
theyre putting on political trenchcoats and sunglasses reagan 
said referring to the sparse democratic platform described by 
republicans as deliberately vague 
how other than liberal would you characterize a governor who 
in the last five years increased his states spending twice as fast 
as the federal governments and more than a third faster than the 
average for all the other states reagan asked 
dukakis while trying to find a running mate also is facing one 
of the most serious budget crises of his career as governor of 
massachusetts and met tuesday with legislators in his statehouse 
office 
although fiscal year 1988 expired last thursday there is still 
no plan in place to close the yearend deficit senate ways and 
means chairwoman patricia mcgovern confirmed tuesday that the 1988 
budget is at least 450 million in deficit due to disappointing 
tax collections in june 
there is also no budget in place for the new fiscal year making 
it difficult for the administration to run the government 
democratic officials meanwhile are discussing a plan under 
which jackson would give a prime time televised speech on the 
second night of the partys national convention as would the other 
democrats who lost out to dukakis in the fight for the partys 
presidential nomination 
under the outline former president jimmy carter would speak 
during prime time on monday night the same evening as a keynote 
speech by texas treasurer ann richards and remarks by party 
chairman paul kirk according to officials who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity 
kirk met tuesday with representatives of dukakis and jacksons 
campaigns but ron brown who is heading jacksons convention 
operation said the decision is that we have no present intention 
of dropping any of the outstanding platform issues which jackson 
has threatened to carry to the convention floor

four years after vietnam veterans settled a 
lawsuit against manufacturers of the herbicide agent orange a 
federal judge has set into motion the distribution of 240 million 
to be used for disability payments and other assistance 
us district judge jack b weinstein of brooklyn announced 
plans tuesday for handing out the settlement money which was freed 
after the us supreme court last week removed the last legal 
obstacle in the lengthy agent orange litigation 
cash payments and other benefits could be available early next 
year according to the distribution agreement 
the class action initiated in 1978 was settled in may 1984 
when seven chemical companies that manufactured agent orange agreed 
to pay 180 million the settlement money has grown to 240 million 
through interest during the appeals process 
the distribution plan has two major components a 170 million 
program to provide cash benefits to longterm totally disabled 
veterans and to the families of veterans whose deaths were believed 
to have been linked to agent orange and a 52 million program to 
fund social service projects that benefit veterans and their 
families 
in addition 5 million will be distributed to vietnam veterans 
in australia and new zealand another 13 million will be used to 
pay lawyers fees and costs for administering the distribution plan 
agent orange was used as a defoliant in southeast asia during 
the 1960s by the us military 
the herbicide contains the highly toxic dioxin and veterans 
contend that exposure to it causes cancer and other illnesses 
the chemical companies have said there is no scientific proof 
linking dioxin exposure to human illness and the settlement does 
not include an admission of fault by the manufacturers 
the companies sued were monsanto dow uniroyal hercules th 
agriculture and nutrition diamond shamrock and thompson 
to date about 250000 people have filed preliminary claims for 
compensation weinstein set a jan 1 1989 deadline for 
applications 
of the claims to date only about 40000 to 60000 may be 
eligible for the payments said john gomperts an attorney working 
on the settlement 
gomperts said the first payments could be sent out within six 
months 
projections estimate the disability benefits would average 
5700 to 12800 to be paid over a number of years 
a veteran would have to prove total disability and that he 
or she was exposed to agent orange while in vietnam 
the death payments estimated from 1800 to 3400 would be 
paid to families in a lump sum 
the assistance program will issue grants and distribute money to 
social service projects over a sevento10year period with an 
emphasis on projects to benefit vietnam veterans children with 
birth defects 
ten million dollars from the assistance programs 52 million 
budget would be placed into a special reserve for 25 years to cover 
possible claims in state courts and also to compensate injured 
vietnam veterans exposed to agent orange should future evidence 
indicate a legally cognizable link between exposure to the 
herbicide and specific ailments 
weinstein also ruled that 2440 veterans who opted out of the 
settlement on the advice of their lawyers could be reinstated as 
members of the class and receive benefits from the fund 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
veterans can receive information about the agent orange 
settlement fund by calling a tollfree number in new york state 
the number is 18008321303 outside of new york the number is

pentagon officials raised the possibility 
that a military identification signal received by the cruiser 
vincennes may have been sent by a military jet and not the iranian 
commercial airliner shot down by one of the ships missiles rep 
les aspin said today 
but a navy spokesman lt brian cullin said we do not 
believe there was another aircraft in the area 
aspin chairman of the house armed services committee said that 
possibility was raised tuesday by defense department officials who 
met behind closed doors with house members to discuss sundays 
attack by the vincennes in which all 290 people on the iranair 
jetliner died 
pentagon spokesman dan howard said tuesday the vincennes 
sophisticated electronic equipment had picked up transmissions from 
iran air flight 655 on a military frequency leading the crew of 
the cruiser to think it was firing at an iranian f14 fighter 
the pentagon officials who briefed the house members said they 
were examining a wide range of possibilities about what happened 
aspin said today 
we pressed them on the military transmission angle the fact 
that the vincennes said it was receiving on a military channel 
from the airliner he said 
we were told that there were three possibilities one is that 
the airbus had in fact been broadcasting on both civilian and 
military frequencies the second is the fact that people on the 
vincennes made a mistake in reading the information and the third 
is that there was a second plane that was a military plane he 
said 
the possibility exists that there was a military plane that 
was somehow masked by the airliner he said 
the identification friend or foe iff system used by the 
vincennes as part of the identification process is good but it 
also has a lot of limitations said aspin a wisconsin democrat 
for one thing its not very good at determining altitudes 
aspin said he said that if there were a second plane its 
existence could be one explanation of the wide divergence between 
reports about the altitude of the airbus 
the vincennes thought the airbus was at about 7000 feet but 
howard said tuesday that the uss sides another ship in the area 
had tracked the jetliners altitude at above 12000 feet 
the vincennes efforts to identify the plane were hampered by the 
lack of an airborne radar system in the vicinity said adm william 
crowe the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who on sunday 
acknowledged that downed plane was an airliner 
there was no air cover crowe said sunday the united states 
does operate e2 hawkeye and airborne warning and control awacs 
reconnaissance aircraft with sophisticated lookdown radar in the 
region but they were not aloft at the time of the incident 
crowe was asked on sunday whether any other iranian aircraft 
were in the area and said there was an f4 up later whether it 
had been up all the time or earlier were not able to determine 
it didnt play a part in this the f4s and f14s were 
among the usmade weapons sold to iran during the reign of shah 
mohammed reza pahlavi who was overthrown in 1979

the states highest court has ruled 
west virginias gun law unconstitutional which some authorities 
say means people may legally carry concealed weapons 
the state supreme court ruling effectively invalidated 
prohibition against carrying dangerous and deadly weapons state 
police superintendent wf donohoe said tuesday 
however all other firearmsrelated charges are still valid 
such as brandishing assault with a deadly weapon etc he said 
a department of public safety spokesman said authorities are 
worried about an increase in gunrelated crimes 
absolutely people are carrying weapons indiscriminately 
people are going to be shot with tempers flying there are going to 
be increases in assaults with police officers increases in deaths 
in domestic situations said trooper ric robinson 
it in general puts everyone in a far more dangerous posture 
the court unanimously ruled friday that a 1986 state 
constitutional amendment invalidated a 1975 law requiring permits 
for people carrying concealed weapons 
the amendment overwhelmingly passed by voters guarantees that 
a person has the right to keep and bear arms for the defense of 
self family home and state and for lawful hunting and 
recreational use 
supporters including the national rifle association said it 
simply reinforced existing rights and was not a threat to state gun 
laws 
donohoe said the ruling leaves some areas unclear 
it is still an unanswered question as to whether the law is 
still enforceable against nonfirearm dangerous and deadly weapons 
such as dirks bowieknives and billy clubs he said 
the supreme court ruling stemmed from the 1987 arrest of a man 
on drunken driving charges when princeton police tried to charge 
him with carrying a concealed weapon magistrate harold l buckner 
cited the constitutional amendment and refused to issue the warrant 
a circuit judge upheld buckner and the state supreme court 
agreed justices also ruled that the legislature can issue new gun 
control laws which would stand up under the ruling 
senate judiciary chairman larry tucker a democrat says he 
thinks police can handle the situation until next regular session 
in january the state already has had three special sessions this 
year and it would be a waste of money to come back again said 
tucker 
under the stricken law west virginians were allowed to carry 
firearms without permits only to and from a place of purchase or 
repair an authorized shooting range or during hunting seasons 
violation meant a mandatory sixmonth jail sentence for first 
offenders a second offense was a felony 
robinson said those constraints are gone if you want to take 
a pistol and stick it in your pocket your purse your swim trunks 
the supreme court decision allows that 
but he said he did not think most west virginians now were 
packing guns id say most people are not aware of the 
decision he said

a 69yearold woman who waged a 14year 
court battle to be a boy scout leader says shes going to form her 
own troop now that the scouts have lifted a ban against woman 
volunteers 
catherine pollard plans to organize her new troop in september 
in milford where about 1000 children and adults already 
participate in scouting programs 
the milford volunteer fire co voted in april to sponsor a boy 
scout troop and will allow the group to meet at its headquarters 
as soon as the word of mouth gets out i dont expect itll 
take long pollard said tuesday 
pollard took legal action after her application for a leadership 
position was denied by the boy scouts in 1974 and 1976 
she was rejected by the scouts even though she had run a milford 
troop from 1973 to 1975 when no men volunteered the boy scouts 
contended that a woman was not a good role model for young boys 
enrolled in scouting 
pollard successfully challenged the action before the state 
commission on human rights and opportunities but that ruling was 
later reversed in state courts the state supreme court in july 
1987 upheld a lowercourt ruling that boys need the guidance of men 
in the difficult process of maturing to adulthood 
but in february the boy scouts of america did away with all 
gender restrictions on volunteer positions abandoning its 
78yearold policy that banned women from six leadership roles

abc said today it will run the first part of the 
30hour miniseries war and remembrance in november earlier 
than originally planned because of the strike by the writers guild 
of america 
all three major networks are struggling to come up with original 
programming this fall since the fourmonthlong strike has delayed 
production of new series nbc will have the summer olympics in 
september 
war and remembrance based on the herman wouk novel is the 
sequel to winds of war a miniseries which ran on abc in 1983

hours of the miniseries will be shown over 11 days beginning 
sunday nov 13 stoddard had previously said the miniseries would 
run in february the remainder will be shown in the 1989 television 
season 
when we began planning for war and remembrance five years 
ago the problems of production logistics budgeting and scheduling 
seemed insurmountable but in retrospect im very glad we didnt 
pass it up said stoddard who termed the dan curtisproduced and 
directed film a masterwork 
we never imagined that the films premiere would be affected 
by a labor dispute but in our determination to provide best 
possible entertainment this fall we now will be leading with our 
most excitement television event 
war and remembrance is expected to be the last of the 
bigtime multipart miniseries for a long time the last 
amerika also on abc was a disappointment in the ratings 
networks are favoring instead fourhour miniseries that can be run 
in two nights 
winds of war followed career navy officer victor pug 
henry mitchum and his family through events leading up to world 
war ii war and remembrance begins a week after the bombing of 
pearl harbor and follows henry and his family through the war

oil traders say the uncertainty caused in the 
persian gulf by the us destruction of an iranian jetliner is less 
worrisome for price prospects than discord among the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries 
irans vows of vengeance against the united states had little 
effect tuesday on the oil markets and experts said they saw little 
chance that heightened hostilities in the gulf would constrict 
shipping or inflate crude prices the 13nation opec cartel was 
once able to dictate prices through its ability to constrict 
supplies 
on the new york mercantile exchange a sensitive barometer of 
world prices the contract for august delivery of west texas 
intermediate crude oil rose 15 cents a barrel tuesday to 1509 in 
light trading crude prices rose further this morning to 1531 
but traders ascribed the rise to shortterm speculative buying 
many emphasized that the market remained depressed because of 
worldwide oversupply and said the outlook for prices was down 
demand is small and supply is great and as we see it right 
now no ones going to listen to what the iranians say said 
thomas mckiernan head of mckiernan amp co an energyfutures 
trading concern in new york 
others said traders were preoccupied with evidence that two 
members of opec the united arab emirates and iraq were ignoring 
output restraints selling into a market already glutted with oil 
the markets concerned with the possibility we may be drifting 
into another price war situation based on the fact that you now 
have two members of opec that are overtly flouting their quotas 
said morris greenberg director of energy analysis at the wefa 
group a forecasting firm in bala cynwyd pa 
for the other members its difficult to justify sticking to 
their quotas greenberg said as a result it can lead to a 
situation where you have a complete breakdown 
the 15abarrel range where prices are now is 3 less than 
opecs target and is the lowest level this year greenberg said he 
saw the possibility of 14abarrel oil shortly and 12abarrel 
oil if opec cannot discipline itself

a doctor accused of giving an anticonvulsion 
drug to pregnant women without their knowledge is fighting back 
with a 26 million slander lawsuit saying the treatment was not 
secret and was aimed at helping his patients 
hospital officials have accused physicians lawrence lavine and 
antonio aldrete of secretly giving injections of the drug dilantin 
to as many as 240 women nearly all of them pregnant as part of 
an improper experiment 
but in a lawsuit tuesday lavine accused dr agnes lattimer 
medical director of cook county hospital of slander for calling 
the dilantin injections a violation of hospital policy and for 
labeling them unethical 
they lavine and aldrete did what doctors do all the time 
try to ensure the health of their patients and because of the 
outcry now the hospital is going to crucify them said lavines 
attorney richard brauer 
lattimer declined comment on the lawsuit tuesday afternoon i 
cannot discuss this issue since it is a legal matter she said 
brauer said the doctors gave the dilantin in the course of 
treating the women shortly before their babies were delivered and 
not as an experiment 
he contended that informed written consent was obtained from 
every patient treated while hospital officials have contended that 
many patients were given the drug without their knowledge or 
consent 
the doctors who face a disciplinary hearing july 18 
administered the anticonvulsants for four months beginning last 
september after receiving approval from the hospitals medical 
staff for a study involving 50 women undergoing emergency caesarean 
section 
one of the women allegedly given the drug at cook county has 
filed a lawsuit against the cook county board the hospital the 
doctors and other staff members 
brauer said giving anticonvulsants to pregnant women with 
epilepsy just before they go into labor has been accepted medical 
procedure since 1938 
brauer said the doctors were aware of the medical literature 
on dilantin and knew well in advance it would be helpful across 
the range of pregnancy especially in cases where inadequate 
prenatal care appeared likely to cause fetal distress from 
insufficient oxygen at delivery 
because of the frequency of fetal distress he said the rate of 
infant mortality at cook county was 3 times higher than in the 
general population 
and it became so obvious the babies were born healthier the 
mothers suffered less that instead of risking the health of 
their patients they used the anticonvulsants where they were 
appropriate he said 
after media reports on the practice in late may lattimer said 
the doctors had gone beyond the scope of the experiment 
a week later she told the chicago suntimes it was wrong for 
the physicians to violate the ethical principles as well as the 
rules and regulations of the hospital

a hearing examiner is considering recommending 
that a contract between the us postal service and texas 
billionnaire h ross perot be ordered suspended it has been 
challenged by wouldbe competitors who did not get to bid 
whatever recommendation is made will go before a judge at the 
general services administration board of contract appeals with a 
decision likely soon a board official said today 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
examiner is expected to recommend that the contract be suspended 
the hearing examiner catherine hyatt declined to comment on 
the matter 
at a hearing tuesday perot and officials of the postal service 
refused to comply with requests to provide documents or have 
individuals testify before the board the gsa board official said 
postal officials acknowledged that they declined to cooperate 
with the agency arguing that it lacks jurisdiction over the postal 
service 
suspension of the perot contract was sought by electronic data 
systems corp perots former company which is now a part of 
general motors and by planning research corp of mclean va 
those firms argued that the postal service should have sought 
competitive bids before awarding the contract to perot 
the contract is in two phases the first is a 500000 agreement 
calling for perot to analyze postal operations and recommend ways 
to save money it was announced june 2 and immediately drew 
criticism from a variety of sources 
after the first 90day phase there was to be a second part in 
which perot would be paid a percentage of any savings the service 
realized from implementing his recommendations 
the senate meanwhile has requested the general accounting 
office to invesitigate terms of the deal and directed the postal 
service to delay phase two of the contract while that analysis is 
underway 
the senate vote called on the gao to look into the contract and 
report to the senate within 45 days it also called on the postal 
service to delay implementation of any second phase of the contract 
for 45 days to give the senate time to study the gao report 
thus if the study suggests changes in postal operations 
implementation could be delayed by at least a month by the senate 
action

philadelphia a 36yearold neurosurgeon who was born and grew 
up in detroits inner city told a group of minority high school 
students attending an ivy league summer seminar to focus on 
indepth not superficial learning 
you young people are particularly the ones who can make a 
difference in american society dr benjamin solomon carson said 
tuesday you are the ones who can erase some of the 
misconceptions not just by getting in the door but by being the 
best at what you do 
carson chief of pediatric neurosurgery at johns hopkins 
university and hospital in baltimore led a 70member medical team 
in 1987 that separated 7monthold west german twins who were 
joined at the head the operation over the labor day weekend took 
22 hours 
the struggle for civil rights carson said is now in phase 
two 
those blessed with intellectual gifts must use them he 
said set your sights on a goal and pursue it relentlessly 
he was the keynote speaker tuesday night at the opening banquet 
for the leadership education and development program at the 
wharton school at the university of pennsylvania 
lead is designed to introduce minority high school juniors to 
business concepts during fourweek summer sessions on several 
college campuses thirty students from across the nation are 
participating in the program at penn 
carson was born and grew up in detroits inner city his mother 
who married at 13 had only a thirdgrade education his father 
left the family when carson was 8 years old his mother reared two 
sons alone 
carson said he moved from the bottom of his class in elementary 
school to earning the highest academic average at his predominantly 
white junior high school 
however even after he realized he was gifted intellectually 
his temper and peer pressure almost diverted him from his goal he 
said 
i was the kind of person who got mad if you even looked at me 
the wrong way he said when i was 14 i stabbed a boy he was 
wearing a belt with a really big buckle the knife glanced off of 
it if it wasnt for that buckle i wouldnt be here tonight 
carson said the episode was a major turning point in his life 
another factor that determined his success was his mothers 
insistence that he and his brother read he said 
my mother allowed us to watch only two or three hours of 
television per week he said she required us to read at least 
two books each week and submit book reviews to her it wasnt 
until later that we learned she couldnt read them 
carson graduated from yale in 1973 received his medical degree 
from the university of michigan in 1977 and became chief of 
pediatric neurosurgery at johns hopkins in 1985

president reagans spokesman said today the 
white house has begun the process of selecting someone to succeed 
attorney general edwin meese iii at the justice department 
meese meanwhile arrived for a personal chat with reagan 
and spokesman marlin fitzwater said that the attorney general had 
resigned voluntarily 
asked whether meese could have remained if he had wished 
fitzwater replied absolutely the president has expressed full 
confidence in ed meese at all times 
describing the attorney generals call to reagan notifying the 
president that he was stepping down the spokesman said the 
president said ok if thats your determination 
fitzwater said reagan did not try to dissuade his longtime 
friend respecting meeses wish to step aside 
fitzwater holding his daily white house news briefing said 
reagan this morning briefly discussed the search for a 
successor with chief of staff kenneth duberstein and white house 
counsel ab culvahouse 
we are beginning the search immediately the spokesman said 
officials are looking for someone with courage strength and 
integrity he said 
if a new attorney general has not been confirmed by the time 
meese leaves in late july or early august fitzwater said the 
administration probably would install solicitor general charles 
fried in the job on an acting basis fried is outranked by two 
justice department newcomers deputy attorney general harold 
christensen and associate attorney general francis keating neither 
of whom has been confirmed 
even though meese told reagan some time ago that he wanted 
to leave office before the end of the administration his 
resignation announcement apparently caught the white house off 
guard 
the president even admitted tuesday shortly after meese made 
his plans clear that he had nobody in mind to take his 
longtime friends place at the helm of the justice department 
another indication that the white house was surprised by meeses 
announcement came late tuesday when it took officials 3 hours to 
prepare a threeparagraph formal statement from the president about 
meeses decision 
normally when the white house is informed in advance of such a 
step the formal statements are released within short order of the 
announcement 
some details provided by white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
about how meese informed reagan indicate that the president as 
well as the senior white house staff were somewhat taken aback by 
the timing of the announcement 
fitzwater said reagan took meeses call at about 4 pm just as 
reagan was leaving the white house for a helicopter ride to walter 
reed army medical center to visit hospitalized salvadoran president 
jose napoleon duarte 
the spokesman said reagan spoke with meese for a minute or 
two in the white house physicians office which is just steps 
from the exit to the helicopter pad 
the attorney general said he had determined that he would like 
to resign and return to private life adding that he would like to 
make the announcement very soon fitzwater said 
the spokesman quoted reagan as telling meese he would accept the 
resignation if thats your determination 
fitzwater added that reagan later said the attorney general 
had told him some time ago that he might want to leave before the 
end of the administration and that the president left the 
timing up to him 
the spokesman did not indicate when meese first told reagan he 
might want to leave 
upon his return to the white house reagan defended his longtime 
california friend as a darn good attorney general and did not 
mention the controversies that have swirled about his years in 
office 
in his statement reagan said meese can look back with 
satisfaction on the contribution hed made to the department of 
justice 
for more than two decades now ed has been a good friend and a 
close adviser his gift for developing and succinctly summarizing 
policy options is one of the most unique i have encountered in my 
experience in government reagan said 
reagans chief of staff kenneth duberstein was besieged by 
reporters questioning him about the resignation 
asked if reagan tried to talk meese out of it the chief of 
staff said it was his determination ed when he called was 
determined

mexicans turned out today to vote for a new 
president and congress in an election that is expected to leave the 
governing party in power but also illustrate its eroding influence 
virtually all industry and commerce closed for the day the 
polls opened at 8 am for 14 hours 
the institutional revolutionary party or pri has won every 
presidential election since it was founded in 1929 but its 
candidate carlos salinas de gortari 40 faced the partys 
stiffest competition in years 
he was expected to win but the party is likely to face a 
tougher challenge convincing mexicans and international observers 
that the results are credible 
cuauhtemoc cardenas on the left and manuel j clouthier of the 
conservative national action party the strongest contenders both 
made alleged vote fraud by the governing party a major campaign 
issue 
they vowed to challenge the results if tampering was suspected 
the other candidates rosario ibarra de piedra of the small 
radical revolutionary workers party and gumersindo magana of the 
conservative mexican democratic party issued similar warnings 
salinas de gortari said he wanted an honest election and 
prefered to win by a smaller credible margin rather than trying to 
beat the margin of his predecessor 
president miguel de la madrid won 70 percent of the vote in 
1982 his term expires dec 1 and under the constitution cannot be 
reelected 
in the northern city of chihuahua about 350 people waited in 
line at a polling station in a neighborhood traditionally 
supporting the governing party 
armando and maria de jesus lucero and their daughter mireya 
were first in line and said they had been waiting since 530 am 
we have always voted armando said we dont mind waiting 
lines also formed in mexico city people read newspapers or 
chatted while they waited for the polls to open 
in addition to president voters will elect 500 members of the 
chamber of deputies to threeyear terms and 64 senators to sixyear 
terms 
unofficial results are expected a few hours after polls close 
this evening partial results from the federal electoral commission 
are expected late today and official final results next week 
the campaign was marred saturday by the gunshot slayings of 
francisco xavier ovando a longtime cardenas collaborator and 
strategist in his campaign and an assistant to ovando 
jorge obrador capellini mexico city judicial police director 
said tuesday that the shootings were not politically motivated 
he said ovando was killed in revenge for fighting organized 
crime while serving as michoacan attorney general when cardenas was 
governor of the state 
capellinio said police have 15 suspects in the slaying but have 
made no arrests 
the campaigns of cardenas and the other opposition candidates 
injected new life into mexican politics one effect political 
analysts say may be to draw more of the 38 million registered 
voters to the polls about 25 percent did not vote in the 1982 
election 
the governing party after years of facing weak opposition or 
none at all was up against a clear right and left a situation 
that led salinas de gotari to run as representative of the 
progressive center 
the splintered left except for mrs ibarra consolidated behind 
the 54yearold cardenas who once led a dissident movement in the 
governing partys left wing 
cardenas is representing the national democratic front on a 
platform of renewed nationalism and is aided by the affection 
mexicans still feel for his father the late president lazaro 
cardenas 
his popularity surged near the end of the campaign when heberto 
castillo of the mexican socialist party withdrew from the race and 
gave cardenas his support 
irritation over inflation unemployment deterioration of the 
environment government corruption and the lack of an alternative 
wrote political scientist lorenzo meyer has spilled into a 
demand ever more open and shared by larger groups for change in 
the political structures 
salinas de gortari a harvardeducated economist was 
handicapped by having been de la madrids budget director and 
author of his economic austerity program he has pledged to 
modernize the countrys economic and political systems 
cardenas has said he would stop the government from selling 
stateowned companies he also favors suspending payments on the 
104 billion foreign debt while it is renegotiated 
clouthier would return even more stateowned companies to the 
private sector and ask farmers if they want the current system of 
cooperative farms or private property 
much political analysts say will depend on what parties 
particularly the looselybound left do after the election 
the country will not be the same after the round of today and 
its consequences wrote columnist miguel angel granados chapa in 
the weekly punto but nor will its nature change so vastly in one 
shift of the rudder

authorities today arrested scores of 
antiabortion demonstrators who blocked the doors of a womens 
clinic in a protest at which they weepingly displayed a 19weekold 
fetus 
about 400 abortion opponents gathered at the northeast womens 
center the day after a previous demonstration at a clinic in paoli 
resulted in 591 arrests 
the protesters blocked doors to the womens center in defiance 
of a federal court order and arrests began after the order was 
read to them and they refused to disperse they submitted 
peacefully to officers and were carried away in sheriffs 
department buses 32 at a time 
the demonstrators were to be charged with defiant trespass a 
charge that carries a maximum penalty of a 300 fine and 90 days in 
jail police said 
were going to prevent them from doing any abortions said 
juli loesch a spokeswoman for operation rescue a coalition based 
in binghamton ny that organized the protest we think that 
saving one life makes thousands and thousands of sacrifices 
worthwhile 
seven patients were already inside the clinic before the 
demonstrators began arriving said frances sheehan a prochoice 
activist 
randall a terry national director of operation rescue 
displayed the fetus in a box draped with cloth 
it is an aborted baby said lowell patterson an operation 
rescue spokesman we are challenging the media to show it we 
believe if we could get that in print the attitudes toward 
abortion would change we believe the pictures are what upset 
people so much 
patterson said he did not know the source of the fetus or 
whether it had been purchased 
the demonstrators gathering here for three days blockaded the 
womens suburban clinic on tuesday in violation of two court 
orders demonstrators who refused to leave surrendered quietly to 
deputies who carried them away on stretchers 
ms loesch declared the demonstration mission accomplished 
tuesday evening 
when the government has to choose between jailing tens of 
thousands of good decent citizens or making child killing illegal 
theyll make child killing illegal said terry 
clinic administrator shelley miller said the protest would not 
stop abortions 
we know abortions will always exist she said i dont 
think this protest will change that 
the philadelphiabased womens law project returned to federal 
court tuesday to request fines of up to 25000 for the violation 
of an order barring protesters from blocking clinic entrances said 
attorney susan cary nicholas 
us district judge clarence c newcomer who issued the order 
thursday denied the request pending further motions but left his 
order unchanged ms nicholas said 
newcomers order and a chester county order were read to 
protesters before arrests began deputies transported the 
protesters by bus to nearby conestoga senior high school where 
they were videotaped and charged with defiant trespassing 
the charge carries a maximum penalty of a 300 fine and 90 days 
in jail said chester county district attorney james p macelree 
ii plans to press more serious misdemeanor charges were dropped in 
return for an agreement by protesters not to return to the clinic 
after their arrests baynard said 
protesters had gathered from about 20 states and all were 
prepared to go to jail terry said 
banners hanging from the clinic roof read fund abortions for 
women in need and pledgeapicket references to attempts by 
proabortion groups to turn the demonstration into a fundraising 
vehicle for their cause 
the pledge drive was started to put a damper on the protesters 
enthusiasm since prochoice supporters were asked to pledge money 
based on the number of demonstrators said frances sheehan 
executive director of the clara bell duvall education fund 
the money will go to the greater philadelphia womens medical 
fund which pays abortion costs for lowincome women she said 
the total amount pledged per head as of tuesday was 350 with 
a nickel per person as the average pledge she said

nine colleges hope to stem a growing shortage 
of black public school teachers with a 3 million effort to 
convince minorities they have a future in the classroom 
six historically black colleges in five southeastern states will 
work with three traditionally white universities to provide 
enrichment and leadership programs aimed at increasing the supply 
of minority teachers 
there is a decline nationwide of minorities going into 
teaching said billy black president of albany state college 
one of the schools participating in the program the idea is to 
develop programs to reverse that trend 
blacks currently make up an estimated 162 percent of the total 
public school population in the region and 69 percent of the 
teaching force 
in seven years predictions are that minorities will make up 30 
percent of all public school students but only 5 percent of the 
teachers 
of the estimated 15 million new teachers needed by the 
mid1990s at least 500000 should be minorities to serve the needs 
of minority students black said 
historically black albany state is a part of the university 
system of georgia other black schools taking part in the program 
are the tuskegee university in tuskegee ala bethunecookman 
college daytona beach fla xavier university of new orleans 
grambling state university in grambling la and johnson c smith 
university of charlotte nc 
the three traditionally white universities taking part are 
harvard university in cambridge mass vanderbilt university in 
nashville tenn and columbia university in new york city 
the consortium will offer a teacher cadet program designed to 
increase the confidence of black students and boost their academic 
skills summer enrichment programs that promote teaching as a 
career and summer scholars programs that enables black students to 
study at harvard 
also planned are faculty exchange and enrichment programs 
minority leadership centers that offer advanced degrees school 
administrators and research efforts aimed at increasing the supply 
of minority teachers 
the programs are being coordinated by the atlantabased southern 
education foundation the bellsouth foundation of atlanta and the 
pew charitable trusts of philadelphia have provided 175 million 
in funding sef hopes to get an additional 125 million from other 
sources 
katherine kinnick of the southern education foundation said 
there are several possible explanations for the black teacher 
shortage including that other careers offer higher pay and that 
the pool of potential teachers is shrinking because fewer blacks 
are going to college

the government has decided to lower the price it 
will pay farmers for rice this year a government spokesman said 
wednesday 
after a heated debate the governing liberal democratic party 
and the agricultural ministry decided to recommend that farmers be 
paid 128 per 132 pounds 46 percent lower than last years price 
said chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi 
the price will be proposed to the rice council which advises 
the agriculture minister he said the council will consider the 
proposal and make its recommendation to agriculture minister 
takashi sato for a final decision 
distribution of rice in japan is controlled by the government 
which buys rice from the farmers and releases it to the market as 
needed 
the government also postponed introduction of a new method of 
calculating the producers rice price the agriculture ministry 
says the current method which considers all farmers in calculating 
the price sets too high a figure 
the ministry wants to use only farms of more than 37 acres in 
calculating the price said isoshi kajii an agriculture professor 
at tokyo agriculture and engineering university 
because large farms are more cost efficient the new method 
will enable the government to reduce the rice price further he 
said 
kajii said the government delayed introducing the new measure 
for one year as a political move to tame the anger of farmers 
who opposed japans recent opening of beef and citrus markets to 
the united states 
in fiscal 1986 japanese farmers produced 116 million tons of 
rice while japanese people consumed only 108 million tons 
according to the food agency the agency also said japan stockpiled 
18 millon tons of rice as of october

delegates he has vowed to continue the political and social 
liberalization begun by chiang chingkuo the son of chiang 
kaishek who led the island until his death in january 
his success could depend on the new party and government lineup 
which will determine how fast the kuomintang moves forward with 
political economic and social change 
the congress will elect a 180member party central committee 
that will name a policymaking central standing committee a 
cabinet overhaul is likely after the meeting 
oldguard conservatives who fled to taiwan in 1949 with chiang 
kaishek after losing a civil war to the communists on the chinese 
mainland dominate both party committees many are expected to step 
down to make way for a new generation of leaders more sensitive to 
public opinion in taiwan 
lee 65 said he hoped the delegates would be expressing and 
stating in full during the meeting whatever opinion they may have 
only in this way can they convey fully the wishes of the public 
and set a truly democratic example for our party 
since its founding on mainland china in 1894 by sun yatsen the 
father of modern china power in the kuomintang has flowed from the 
top down while the party exercised authoritarian rule 
but chiang chingkuo in the years before his death lifted 
38yearold martial law allowed the formation of opposition 
parties and sought to increase the power of native taiwanese who 
constitute about 85 percent of the islands nearly 20 million 
people 
this is the first party congress in which delegates were not 
handpicked by top officials and in which a central committee 
election was not restricted to candidates proposed by the party 
leader 
lu kuoming 36 and an electronics engineer from san jose 
calif was among the 180 delegates from overseas he acknowledged 
the congress would be a turning point but said it wasnt 
likely all party elders would retire 
the congress will take up party policy toward communist china 
both the nationalists and communists claim to be the legitimate 
government of both the chinese mainland and taiwan the 
nationalists reject all official contacts with beijing and have no 
plans to drop their stated goal of national reunification 
last year chiang chingkuo ended a 38yearold ban on travel to 
mainland china to allow family reunions

antiapartheid activists 
wednesday announced plans for an openair concert near soweto to 
celebrate nelson mandelas 70th birthday 
the concert for peace to feature some of south africas top 
black musicians is scheduled to run for nine hours on july 17 the 
day before the jailed black leaders birthday 
one of the scheduled performers is guitaristsinger ray phiri 
who performed with paul simon on the hit album graceland 
mandela was a leader of the african national congress before his 
arrest in 1962 the outlawed anc has been waging a guerrilla 
campaign to topple the whitedominated government in pretoria 
organizers expressed hope that the government which prohibits 
unauthorized outdoor political meetings and has restricted groups 
sympathetic to the anc would allow the concert to take place 
if you put your foot in it youll be in trouble said 
aubrey mokoena head of the organizing committee addressing 
himself to any officials who might consider halting the event 
plans for the concert were announced at a news conference 
attended by mandelas wife winnie and youngest daughter zindzi 
the government has given them permission for a sixhour birthday 
reunion with mandela at cape towns pollsmoor prison the longest 
such meeting allowed since mandela has been in jail 
asked how she felt about the impending reunion zindzi replied 
id like to see my father under normal circumstances at home 
i wouldnt like to pat the government on the back she 
added international pressure forced them to take a lenient 
step 
mandelas approaching birthday has intensified the international 
campaign for his release last month more than 70000 people 
gathered in london for a concert honoring mandela that was 
broadcast to about 60 countries 
mandela is widely considered the most popular leader among south 
africas disenfranchised black majority 
while serving a fiveyear sentence for incitement and leaving 
the country illegally he was charged with sabotage and conspiracy 
to topple the government he and seven colleagues were sentenced in 
1964 to life imprisonment 
relatives of several of mandelas codefendants attended the 
news conference and greeted the gathering with clenchedfist 
salutes 
mokoena said organizers felt it was important to honor mandela 
despite stateofemergency restrictions on many groups and 
individuals espousing the ancs goals of a oneman onevote system 
and abolition of the apartheid laws which create a racially 
segregated society 
even if we are operating in diminishing legal space we feel 
as a people weve got to come out and honor this great man 
mokoena said 
organizers said 14 wellknown entertainers would perform free of 
charge along with amateur black performers they said 25000 to 
30000 people were expected to attend and proceeds from the 250 
tickets would go to charity

to readers for money it says it needs to keep publishing and fight 
a 94 million court judgment 
the boulderbased magazine is appealing the award to the family 
of a woman whose killer was hired through a soldier of fortune 
classified advertisement 
a jury in houston made the award in march in the lawsuit filed 
by gary wayne black 18 and his grandmother marjorie eimann 64 
they sought 225 million

the magazine in 1984

this will not be an easy battle the editors wrote in the 
july issue there are many liberals and those of leftist 
persuasion who would like to see sof go under and theyre 
marshaling their forces to that end

unchallenged then we surely open the door to big brother and his 
minions of the thought police the editors said

us rep jim moody withdrew today from the 
democratic primary for the senate seat being vacated by william 
proxmire saying he couldnt raise enough money to compete with 
millionaire opponent herbert kohl 
moody said he would run in the sept 13 primary in an attempt to 
gain reelection to the house seat he has held since 1982 
the 52yearold congressman said he had considered withdrawing 
from the senate race after a newspaper poll published sunday showed 
kohl owner of the milwaukee bucks basketball team had made 
substantial gains since he unexpectedly entered the race 
events of the last week made it clear i cannot succeed no 
matter what i did moody said at a news conference money is 
now determining this senate race i cannot compete with 
millions of dollars even though every fiber of my body wants to 
run 
moodys withdrawal reduced the number of major democratic 
candidates to five two republicans have declared their candidacy 
for their partys nomination 
the general election gives state republicans the opportunity to 
fill both senate seats republican robert w kasten jr was elected 
to his second term in 1986 proxmire who is retiring has held his 
seat for 20 years 
moodys decision caused some confusion in the 5th congressional 
district race two of the other five candidates said they wouldnt 
have run if moody hadnt assured them that he had decided to give 
up his seat 
other democrats in the senate primary said moody was pressured 
to quit because kohl who is from milwaukee had undermined moodys 
electoral base with an unprecedented twomonth bombardment of 
television commercials 
the poll published sunday in the milwaukee journal showed former 
gov anthony s earl leading the democratic field among likely 
voters with 31 percent while kohl was in second place with 28 
percent moody was third with 12 percent 
former deputy wisconsin attorney general edward r garvey also 
had 12 percent while secretary of state douglas j la follette had 
8 percent 
la follette said kohls television budget has disrupted 
political tradition in the state 
i feel badly that big money tv hype are determining who the 
candidates will be in this race la follette said 
kohl 53 dismissed the notion that his wealth had forced moody 
from the race to say that people of wisconsin can be bought is 
something that ive never considered a messenger without a message 
cant win 
kohl heir to a supermarket fortune and owner of the national 
basketball associations bucks since 1985 is a former state 
democratic chairman he has never held elective public office

the washington post on the resignation of attorney general edwin 
meese 
he leaves office having been mightily investigated and not 
indicted is that the measure of a successful attorney general a 
man who has served his country and his president with distinction 
hardly it is the minimum 
while not rising to the level of rulebreaking or actual crime 
mr meeses repeated intervention on behalf of friends his sloppy 
personal financial dealings and his apparent lack of understanding 
of the need for exemplary not just lawful behavior in office have 
been continuously troubling 
surely mr meese and his family will be glad to leave 
washington they have been the target of a great deal of public 
abuse and have suffered more than one private tragedy during their 
years here it is understandable that he is relieved by the 
independent counsels decision but he has done the right thing by 
resigning now

tragic drowning of iran air flight 655 wont be available for at 
least two weeks but it is not too soon for the united states to 
think about an appropriate humanitarian response 
president reagan used the right words when he called the 
incident a terrible human tragedy but mr reagans condolences 
were muffled by the whir of helicopter blades in the background 
and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm william j 
crowe jr buried his statement of regret in the midst of a 
briefing on the military details 
us officials are studying the question of compensation but a 
state department spokeswoman said it is premature 
there is no shame nor is there necessarily an admission of 
guilt in offering compensation to the families such a gesture 
would represent america at its best

portland maine pressherald on a waiting period for sale of 
handguns 
the house judiciary committee approved a measure requiring a 
national sevenday waiting period in sales of pistols its 
unlikely it will pass of course the gun lobby is terribly 
powerful but it is nonetheless a sensible and reasonable idea 
the rationale behind the waiting period is to give police time 
to check as to whether the prospective purchaser has a criminal 
record or mental problems the idea is to try to keep handguns out 
of the hands of criminal and the mentally ill 
the proposal this time has a powerful ally president reagan 
who himself was shot by an assassin carrying a handgun is a 
supporter of the waiting period he drew not only on his own 
experience but on his task force on violent crime which made the 
waiting period one of its core recommendations

missouri gov john ashcroft says he is ready to take swift 
action to bring drought relief to missouri farmers state rep bob 
holden d136th district of springfield wants a special session of 
the general assembly to take up the relief question 
both ideas make sense the sweet smell of rain may have 
delivered temporary relief to droughtstricken missouri livestock 
but it did nothing to help farmers who culled their herds before 
the rains 
missouri would be far better off to grapple with the issues of 
drought relief when they can accomplish some good than to wait 
until it is too late 
a bipartisan relief program may be the best investment missouri

the us supreme court decision upholding the power of 
independent counsels to prosecute upper echelon government 
employees could be bad news for several current and former reagan 
administration officials 
moreover the decisions broader influence will help to maintain 
the balance of power and ensure the governments system of checks 
and balances two of the chief arguments opponents used against 
the law 
the supreme court correctly recognized the importance of the 
ethics in government act the special prosecutor is necessary to 
thwart abuses of executive power by guaranteeing integrity in 
investigations into possible criminal activity by highlevel 
officials without such a law the current situation would require

much human folly inadvertent or inexcusable went into the 
making of the awful tragedy that befell iran air flight 655 the 
minutebyminute log of the usiranian clash that culminated in 
the loss of 290 lives brings heartache to americans and adds even 
more fury to the rhetoric of tehrans revolutionary leadership 
the mistakes so obviously made by both sides during those 
fateful 45 minutes will now be added to the 9 years of war 
slaughter hostagetaking fanaticism hatred intrigue and 
cynicism that have marked the rule of the ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini 
from the moment the reagan administration decided in early 1987 
to reflag kuwaiti oil tankers with the stars and stripes thereby 
taking on the burden of protecting them within the iraniraq war 
zone the danger of catastrophe was apparent 
while we continue to question the rationale of the large us 
naval presence in the gulf we fully understand why the officers of 
the uss vincennes felt it necessary to fire missiles at an aircraft 
they believed was zeroing in on their ship 
us investigations will have to determine just what 
information was available to the vincennes and precisely when 
to provide credibility these probes need international oversight 
in the meantime the united states should not be grudging either in 
offering official apologies or reparations

unions will take more delegates to the 
democratic national convention this month than they did in 1984 
with their early endorsement of walter mondale and its largely 
because of jesse jackson labor activists say 
preliminary totals from the 90union aflcio and the independent 
national education association show a record 1003 or 24 percent of 
the conventions 4162 delegates coming from the ranks of the labor 
movement 
in 1984 the two groups which represent some 17 million 
workers had 903 or 229 percent of the 3933 delegates at the 
democratic convention in san francisco 
of the 723 union members or officials on the aflcios roster of 
delegates for this years convention 564 percent are committed to 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis who has wrapped up the 
nomination and 266 percent are pledged to jackson 
without jacksons constant wooing of labor support through 
hundreds of appearances on picket lines and in local union halls 
and his populist appeal political activists in the movement doubt 
they would be carrying as large a delegation to atlanta 
there is a genuine surprise within labor at how well we have 
done said allen zack of the 1 millionmember united food and 
commercial workers union its the heavy influence of labor 
delegates in the jackson camp people really went out and scrambled 
to get on his slate 
four years ago when its early endorsement of mondale earned 
labor the tag special interest from mondales primary 
opponents the aflcio had a total of 642 delegates at the san 
francisco convention 
labor leaders looked upon jackson and thensen gary hart of 
colorado as spoilers to mondales campaign hart tried to make 
amends in early 1987 before withdrawing his candidacy in the wake 
of an uproar over the weekend he spent with a miami model 
jackson began the reconciliation effort a year earlier at a 
private meeting in chicago with the aflcios committee on 
political education he quietly raised 200000 for a black voter 
registration drive in the south that was instrumental in returning 
the senate to democratic control that fall 
i have a lot more respect for him than i did in 1984 said 
loretta bowen political director for the communications workers of 
america hes no longer running aganst the party as for the gut 
issues that affect organized labor he articulated them better than 
any other candidate 
joan baggett political director for the bricklayers union 
agreed that having jackson in the equation helped 
because jackson was able to stay in the race until the end 
there was no repeat of the mondalehart battle in 1986 where one 
was perceived as being prolabor and the other antilabor she said 
the assumption that the labor movement would come out on the 
short end of the stick sans endorsement was wrong all along 
said peter laarman of the united auto workers the idea was to 
make it clear in a way that was not offensive or counterproductive 
but simply a reflection of reality labor is a part of the 
process 
laarman said the uaw will have 101 delegates at the atlanta 
convention compared with 82 at san francisco four years ago other 
large union delegations this year will be the nea with 280 
delegates the american federation of state county and municipal 
employees with 159 and the american federation of teachers with 
152 
despite the expectation of some minor fights over the partys 
platform most union activists expect the convention and labors 
role in it to be relatively quiet 
weve got the choir but if were not asked to sing a chorus 
were not going to said lorrie mchugh a spokeswoman for the 
aflcio

after a fiveyear decline in whale activity in 
massachusetts bay the leviathans seem to be making a strong return 
from more remote sections off the new england coast 
their migration back has delighted tourists and fascinated 
researchers sharing the waters of the stellwagen bank one of the 
nations top areas for recreational and scientific whale 
observations 
mason weinrich director of the cetacean research unit in 
gloucester saw nearly 50 humpback whales surface in stellwagen 
earlier this week it was more whales than he logged in any of the 
past several years 
theres no question there are more whales out there than in 
recent years said weinrich who has been studying stellwagen 
whales since the late 1970s but were not really sure how 
long the whales will stay around 
marine experts say a plentiful supply of small fish and 
microorganisms have drawn the large number of humpback minke and 
other whales from feedings grounds 50 miles east of nantucket back 
to stellwagen located less than 30 miles offshore from boston 
the tiny sand lance a pencilthin fish preferred by several 
species of whales is being noticed in dense concentrations in the 
stellwagen area say experts in addition the small shrimp and 
plankton that right whales strain through their balene plates are 
abundant this year 
some experts theorize the whales return to stellwagen is linked 
to heavy commercial fishing of mackerel and herring which eat sand 
lances 
all the elements are right at the moment for the whales 
said john nicolas biologist at the national marine fisheries 
service in woods hole 
nicolas estimates there may be as many as 100 humpback whales in 
the stellwagen bank and a smaller number minke finback and sei 
whales for the past several years only a few lone humpbacks 
remained in stellwagen by midsummer 
since the mid1980s most of the whales had followed the sand 
lances to the great south canal off nantucket which is too distant 
and the seas are too rough for tourist whale watch voyages 
the humpback whales seen in stellwagen are part of a larger herd 
that feeds from rhode island to maine other humpback herds are 
located off nova scotia greenland and iceland said weinrich 
its been pretty discouraging the last couple years said 
lisa frohock office manager at gloucester whale watch which 
operates a 100foot vessel so far this year its been great we 
go out and the whales are all around 
al avellar owner of the dolphin whale watch fleet in 
provincetown gives a less scientific explanation to the whales 
return 
its like an oldfashioned summer hot and sunny said 
avellar whose boats are taking up to 1000 people to stellwagen 
each day they went away about three weeks ago but theyre 
back

first came shock at the news that a us warship in the persian 
gulf had shot down an iranian airliner with the apparent loss of 
all 290 people aboard then came bewilderment over how such an 
appalling mistake could be made the guidedmissile cruiser 
vincennes has been advertised as the latest in hightech surface 
vessels a 1 billion dollar weapons platform that supposedly can 
identify hundreds of targets at once and simultaneously engage in 
antiair antisubmarine and antiship warfare 
radar we are told cannot distinguish between a plane the 
size of an f14 and a plane like the airbus that is nearly three 
times as large both show up as identical blips on the radar 
screen italy says that one of it naval ships in the area 
confirmed through its own radar scans the us account that the 
airbus was flying at least four miles outside the corridor reserved 
for commercial traffic the italian ship also heard radio warnings 
from the vincennes to the airliner the unanswered question is 
whether the airliner heard them 
many questions about this terrible event remain to be 
answered the biggest and most overdue is what has been the point 
and what if anything has been gained by the reagan administrations 
increasingly onesided intervention in the persian gulf war which 
has seen it militarily confronting iran even as it ignores iraqs 
attacks of thirdcountry ships and its indiscriminate use of poison 
gas on land against this background iran is now able to allege 
that the shooting down of its airliner was deliberate and to know 
that many in the world will believe the claim

the albuquerque nm tribune editorial on the iraniraq war 
the downing of an iranian civilian airliner with 290 persons 
aboard by an american warship in the persian gulf sunday was a 
dreadful tragedy that underscores the need to end the senseless 
iraniraq war 
president reagan was right to express promptly his deep regret 
over the shooting down of the iran air jetliner by commanders of 
the cruiser vincennes who believed it was an iranian f14 warplane 
about to attack their ship 
the united states should offer compensation to the tehran regime 
and to the families of the victims aboard the illfated airbus 
the deplorable error should convince the religious fanatics 
ruling iran that it is time to settle the eightyear bloodletting 
with iraq continuing the war will merely add thousands of young 
corpses to the hundreds of thousands who have died uselessly before 
them

milwaukee sentinel on the court martial in the navy drowning 
case 
the decision to recommend a general courtmartial for one of the 
men allegedly involved in the death of appleton wis airman 
recruit lee w mirecki is an appropriate and necessary action to 
establish a clear record on his ghastly demise 
five others charged in the drowning have been offered the option 
nonjudicial punishment but that hardly offsets the crimes of 
involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery that 
allegedly occurred 
information given by others in the rescue swimming class in 
which mirecki was participating when he died suggest this was not a 
mere case of overzealousness on the part of the instructors 
petty officer michael w combe who has been recommended for 
courtmartial was said to have held the recruits head under water 
after mirecki panicked and asked to quit the course 
other recruits were ordered to turn their backs and sing the 
national anthem during the incident 
the full truth must be known

the honolulu advertiser on the shooting down of the iranian 
airliner 
the shooting down of an iranian commercial jetliner by a us 
navy warship in the persian gulf is a tragic mistake that darkens 
more than just americas independence day weekend 
most americans will set their reaction by president reagans 
statement calling the incident a terrible human tragedy but 
that it resulted from proper defensive action by a warship that 
believed it was facing an attacking iranian fighter during a 
running sea battle 
still the president was also putting the best possible face on 
a bad situation where the united states will pay a price of 
uncertain kind and dimensions 
besides the formal apology there must be compensation for 
families of the 290 people killed aboard the iran air jetliner 
that is a decent minimum

spartanburg sc heraldjournal on angola 
angolas offer to negotiate withdrawal of cuban troops from its 
territory is a significant change of stance that could signal 
increased stability in the whole of strifetorn southern africa 
for the first time the marxistoriented angolan governments 
offer to repatriate its cuban mercenaries is not linked to a demand 
that the united states halt its support for the antigovernment 
guerrillas led by jonas savimbi 
angolas new offer confirms that the soviet union which has 
provided funds and arms for the cubans is weary of the 13yearold 
civil war and is anxious to withdraw as soon as possible 
pragmatically angolan officials are still demanding three 
concessions from south africa that south african troops be 
withdrawn from angola that south africa stop giving aid to savimbi 
and that southwest africa namibia be granted independence 
south africas minister of foreign affairs pik botha 
startled political observers by declaring that south africa was 
ready to grant independence to southwest africa if cuban troops 
were removed from angola 
with the scenario for southern africa looking more hopeful 
than it has for years the united states must continue to press for 
national reconciliation in angola as the first step toward 
stabilization of the whole region

the ponca city okla news on arms reduction 
once again as party platforms are being discussed there are 
those advocating all kinds of unilateral disarmament on the part of 
the united states 
the theory expressed is that if the united states leads the way 
by reducing its weapons russia and the other countries will follow 
suit 
thats a beautiful thought but there is no evidence in 
history to suggest that it would work that way 
unilateral disarmament should not be a part of any partys 
platform lest it should suggest a weakness to those who seek power 
over us costly as it is we must continue to maintain defenses 
that can stand up if called on against any offense the world has to 
offer

the old man looked out at the sea and began 
the story of how he came to be skipper of ernest hemingways yacht 
for more than 20 years 
there was a storm and i heard someone yelling for help 
gregorio fuentes said it was 1928 on dry tortugas it was 
hemingway and he and his companions were out of food 
gregorio fuentes who is 90 now pointed a wrinkled finger at a 
picture of the famous writer on the wall and glanced at it from 
time to time as he told his tale 
the old sailor sat on a shabby flowered overstuffed chair in 
the living room of his cottage in this pastelwashed fishing 
village his wife of 67 years dolores was in the kitchen nearby 
he said he gave the novelist two bottles of rum and arranged for 
the yacht to be towed back to key west then we waved goodbye and 
he said he wed see each other in cuba 
fuentes went to work on merchant ships in europe after that and 
when he returned home a decade later was told an american had been 
looking for him 
it was hemingway with the offer to be captain of the pilar 
fuentes held the job until the authors suicide in 1961 
when that happened fuentes was on a warship for the cuban 
government fidel castro had gained control of the island 90 miles 
from florida in 1959 and cubans were on alert for an american 
invasion 
i read in the newspaper that he died fuentes said reaching 
for a large cuban cigar he was a friend i understood he had a 
disease he couldnt live with that its better what he did 
his former association with the famous writer has made fuentes a 
minor celebrity in cuba where hemingways home in san francisco de 
paulo is a museum hemingways favorite hangouts in havana la 
floridita and bodeguita del medio are popular tourist attractions 
a new harbor for visiting yachts has been named hemingway 
marina a hotel near the docks is called el viejo y el mar 
spanish for the old man and the sea 
everyone adored him fuentes said asked about hemingways 
reputation for womanizing he laughed and said a man who doesnt 
love women is not a man 
fuentes remembers the day but not the date the writer began 
work on the the old man and the sea which was published in 
1952 and made into a movie in 1957 
we were sailing and he was reading fuentes said he would 
read and then look at me then he said did you see a boat 
it was a small skiff and he told me to see if it needed help 
there was an old man pulling in a marlin and a young boy the man 
yelled for us to get away but the boy was nice hemingway told me 
to give them supplies milk pineapples oranges and crackers 
he said the novelist knew it would take time to reel in the 
fighting marlin and offering help was typical of hemingway whom he 
described as generous and courageous with a fine sense of humor 
the writers portrait of santiago the main character in the 
old man and the sea could be that of fuentes today 
the old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back 
of his neck heningway wrote the brown blotches of the 
benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the 
tropic sea were on his cheeks everything about him was old except 
his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful 
and undefeated 
fuentes brushed back a strand of white hair and said hemingway 
went to work on the book immediately writing on the yacht for 28 
days and nights 
then the constant clatter of the typewriter stopped because the 
author said he had to return to shore to pay the people who worked 
for him 
he always thought of other people fuentes said 
cojimar was the setting of the movie which starred spencer 
tracy 
fuentes has spent nearly 70 years in the fishing village beside 
the ruins of spanish colonial fort about 70000 people live here 
now but he recalls when there were only 200 families 
a bust of hemingway is in a gazebo by the ocean cast from the 
bronze fittings of fishing boats and donated by local fishermen 
youngsters hurl out lines from the wharf nearby 
hemingways former captain was born in the canaries the spanish 
islands off the hump of africa and left home at age 11 on a ship 
that eventually reached cuba 
it was my dream to see the world he said and he did 
he still enjoys a cigar and a glass of rum and tells a visitor 
of the lesson life has taught him we live in the same world we 
can all get along

vice president george bush promised today to name 
a hispanic to his cabinet if elected president saying its time 
its long overdue 
the certain republican nominee said he wanted to make a pledge 
a pledge that i have never made before to anyone to any group 
he noted that women blacks and other minorities have been named 
to cabinet positions 
if i become president my cabinet will be composed of the very 
best men and women at least one of whom finally will be a 
hispanic american 
its time its time its long overdue bush said in a 
speech prepared for delivery to the league of united latin american 
citizens 
bush was greeted on his arrival at the airport by a marachi band 
and the leadership of lulac an umbrella organization of hispanic 
groups 
bush jokingly said they do have a terrible mistake they have 
a few democrats that are members of lulac 
in his speech bush made clear that he wants to recruit 
hispanics away from the democratic party 
i truly feel that a lot of you in this audience ought to 
consider joining the party i represent this year bush said i 
think you belong with us and dont let anyone take you or your 
support for granted 
trying to draw a contrast bush said its fair to say that 
the other party has a tendency to take those actions that slow or 
stop growth they tend to increase taxes while my party tends to 
resist 
they tend to increase regulation while my party tilts toward 
greater regulatory freedom 
the other party has a recent tendency to pursue foreign policy 
goals in a manner that encourages the more troubling impulses of 
our adversaries the vice president said my party has a 
tendency to deal with communism and other destabilizing forces in a 
manner that combines sophistication with strength 
earlier today bush said he would not apologize to iran for the 
shooting down of a civilian airliner and he said it was too early 
to decide whether the united states should pay compensation to the 
victims families 
bush spoke with reporters as his plane air force two taxied 
for takeoff from andrews air force base on a campaign trip to 
dallas asked if the united states should apologize he said no 
but we probably ought to do what we did which is to officially 
express regret which i guess should happen when you have the loss 
of innocent life 
but as for an apology bush said i wouldnt because of the 
facts what happened 
president reagan sent a diplomatic message sunday to irans 
leaders expressing deep regret for the military action that 
brought down a civilian plane killing all aboard reagan was asked 
tuesday if he ha apologized sufficiently to iran and he responded 
yes 
bush said it was too early to consider reparations to the 
victims families wait til we know all the facts he said

dallas morning news on white house cocaine use 
the news that several white house staffers had been 
disciplined for cocaine use brought some jibes that first lady 
nancy reagan needs to implement the just say no program in her 
own backyard 
but the continuing washington investigation demonstrated how 
pervasive the drug abuse problem is in this country three members 
of the secret services uniformed division at the white house were 
placed on administrative leave and two national security council 
employees were fired in the drug investigation 
evidence continues to mount that no segment of the population is 
exempt from the substance abuse problem a federal call for drug 
testing of interstate truck drivers in june was accompanied by some 
hairraising information about research in several states one test 
in tennessee showed that 15 percent of the drivers tested positive 
for marijuana cocaine or prescription stimulants 36 percent of 
1300 truckers surveyed in florida said they sometimes drove under 
the influence of drugs 
the sobering thought is how much worse it might be if the drugs 
in question were legalized

the westerly ri sun on using blimps to hunt drug smugglers 
air force surveillance planes designed to find and track 
highspeed military aircraft have not been of much use against the 
slowmoving lowaltitude planes used by drug traffickers better 
performance can reasonably be expected from a balloon newly 
tethered near the mexican border in southern arizona 
the blimps radar range is about 160 miles permitting detection 
of aircraft in an 80000 squaremile area 
the goal of customs officials is to deploy six such balloons 
along the southwest border even when they are all fully 
operational that will be no guarantee against lowflying smuggler 
aircraft this new approach does promise however to make 
things considerably more difficult for the traffickers

the jersey journal of jersey city nj on increased federal 
funding for drug treatment 
one of the latest to call for expanded drug abuse treatment is 
the board of directors of the american medical association 
the board also urged a change in the rules to make it easier for 
drug users to get on methadone programs increased funding would be 
needed to make a change in the rules effective 
while a prosperous state like new jersey which suffers 
especially hard from aids among drug users must not shirk its 
share of the additional burden its important to see expanded 
federal funding for treatment as well there are some congressional 
proposals for such an expansion and they deserve very high priority

journalamerican bellevue wash on special prosecutors 
the supreme courts decision upholding the law on independent 
prosecutors has been characterized as a defeat for the reagan 
administration which it is but it will surely have a more 
important effect in the long run 
in a 71 decision the court held that a 1978 law providing for 
appointment by judges of special prosecutors to investigate 
suspected crimes does not violate the constitutions provision for 
separation of the executive and legislative branches of government 
that law was enacted in the wake of the watergate scandal to 
prevent any future president from copying president nixon who 
tried to halt the breakdown of his administration by ordering the 
special prosecutors dismissal 
the ruling vindicates the ethics in government act both in 
purpose and legality and leaves the nation with assurance that 
justice at the highest levels of government need not be tainted by 
politics

agency 
a group of republican senators is sponsoring a bill to elevate 
the environmental protection agency to a cabinetlevel department 
the threat to the biosphere is such regrettably that its an 
idea whose time has come 
the president must have more direct involvement in environmental 
issues than has been the case argues sen david durenberger 
rminn a prime sponsor of the bill cabinet officers help set 
broad policies for the nation as is the agency does not have a 
close direct relationship with the president nor does the head of 
the agency have the access to the president that a cabinet member 
would have 
but with such threats looming as severe damage to the planet 
caused by burning fossil fuels environmental concerns must be made 
a top governmental and presidential priority damage from the 
greenhouse effect will touch on nearly every aspect of human life 
that makes it imperative that those responsible for overseeing the 
nations environmental affairs be part of the cabinets policy 
discussions on energy agriculture transportation commerce and 
health and human services to name some key cabinet departments

the dallas times herald on mikhail s gorbachev and the party 
congress 
communist orthodoxy has been taken to the woodshed in a 
remarkable speech before a special party conclave in moscow 
mikhail gorbachev said many of the marxist concepts of the past 
such as a strong central government and tightly controlled 
production of consumer goods must be trashed 
the soviet leader called for a new system that draws on western 
models he wants a president to head the soviet government 
one that is more answerable to the public and less to the communist 
party whose membership includes only 20 million of the countrys 
270 million people 
he advocates a congress of ussr peoples deputies that is 
reflective of peoples concerns and he envisions local governments 
that have powers to tax businesses to provide services 
blasting past soviet regimes he declared the tendency to 
encompass every nook of life with detailed centralized planning and 
control literally straitjacketed society 
like humptydumpty mr gorbachev may yet take a great fall 
many soviet conservatives are totally opposed to his reforms 
but if he succeeds even partially the world should be a more 
peaceful palce soviet citizens who can demand and get good shoes 
are less likely to be thinking about fomenting revolution elsewhere

democratic presidential hopeful michael dukakis said he wanted a 
female to deliver the keynote address at the national convention 
and the party preferred someone who could appeal to southern 
voters particularly in texas 
state treasurer ann richards certainly meets those 
qualifications but in naming her as the keynote speaker the 
democrats are getting more than a gender and a geographic locale 
richards is a dedicated public servant an accomplished orator 
and as one democratic official accurately described her a fiery 
populist her speech promises to be an oldfashioned stemwinder 
and calls to mind the success of the only woman whos given the 
keynote address texas barbara jordan in 1976

a justice department unit may decide to pursue 
an ethics examination of attorney general edwin meese iii despite 
the fact that he is resigning a department spokesman acknowledged 
today 
the office of professional responsibility may open a case 
anytime it wishes for present or former department employees if 
mike shaheen feels that its called for department spokesman 
patrick korten said when questioned about the possibility that the 
office which is headed by shaheen might do so in regard to meese 
korten said that i dont personally see what purpose it would 
serve in this particular case to carry out such an ethics review 
but thats entirely up to shaheen 
when pressed to explain why it would serve no purpose korten 
said that the main task of opr is to ensure the integrity and 
adherence to laws and regulations by department officials a 
reference to the fact that meese is leaving in late july or early 
august 
on tuesday department aides close to meese speaking on 
condition of anonymity said there would be no ethics review of the 
attorney general because he is stepping down but today other 
department sources said that such assertions are flatly incorrect 
and that an ethics review of meese was a distinct possibility 
those sources also speaking on condition of anonymity said opr 
has in the past launched reviews of employees who are leaving and 
followed those reviews through to a conclusion after the employees 
left and korten subsequently acknowledged that opr investigators 
certainly have the authority to do that 
meanwhile meese said that any questions raised about his ethics 
in a courtappointed investigators 830page probe of his conduct 
would be just excess verbiage 
nonetheless meese said he would respond 
asked about reports that independent counsel james mckays 
report delivered in secret to a federal judge hours before meese 
resigned tuesday paints an unflattering portrait of the attorney 
general but does not suggest any illegal activities were committed 
meese said 
thats really immaterial because whatever may be in the report 
along that line would only be commentary in his opinion it would 
have no legal force 
meese making the rounds of network televisions three major 
morning news programs said mckays only charter had been to 
determine if the attorney general violated any laws 
he has now found that there was no criminal conduct of any 
sort on my part meese said so anything else that might be 
said is merely surplusage 
asked if presenting material that suggests unethical behavior 
was in his opinion excess verbiage meese replied 
certainly it is its not his job to go into ethical questions 
or ethical issues at all 
noting that mckay is expected to turn the results of his probe 
over to the justice department for an ethics review meese said he 
doubted that any department probe would be conducted 
i know of nothing of that sort he said 
opr had been prepared to examine possible improper conduct by 
the attorney general in a review that could have resulted in a 
recommendation to president reagan that meese be fired 
meese said he would respond personally to any suggestions of 
unethical conduct raised by mckays 14month investigaton 
mckay began his investigation after four executives of wedtech 
corp pleaded guilty in connection with alleged bribes paid to 
public officials and began cooperating with authorities 
detailing his decision to leave office meese said he spoke to 
reagan before the president left for last months economic summit 
meeting in canada telling reagan that he thought it would be in 
my best interests to leave the government before the 
presidents term expires next january 
he said if it was in my best interests and i felt it was 
then he could understand that and he would go along with it 
meese said 
then on tuesday meese called the white house and spoke with 
reagan as he was on his way out the door again he said that if 
that was my wish he would be agreeable 
within 30 minutes or so meese announced his resignation at a 
news conference in sacramento calif 
asked today if he was leaving under a cloud meese said i 
dont believe there is any cloud at all 
asked if he was leaving the department in the lurch given that 
a number of toplevel posts are filled by recent appointees yet to 
face senate confirmation hearings meese said not at all 
he said the people in those slots including his top deputies 
have extensive legal experience 
the new deputy attorney general harold christensen and 
criminal division chief edward dennis have been on the job for 
little more than a month while the departments no 3 official 
associate attorney general francis keating has been at work just 
two months 
reagan asked tuesday whom he would name to succeed meese told 
reporters i have nobbody in mind 
meese asked if he had been pushed out said nobody tried to 
shove me and nobody could shove me as a matter of fact 
reagan who has stood by meese during the criminal investigation 
and persistent calls from critics for his resignation issued a 
statement saying ed meese has served the american people loyally 
and well 
the attorney general declined to answer when asked if his 
longtime friend e robert wallach had manipulated him he said he 
would not answer because wallach is under indictment for alleged 
racketeering in the wedtech scandal 
asked if he been naive meese responded i would hope not 
mckay looked into meeses ties to scandalplagued wedtech corp 
a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline and his meetings with regional bell 
telephone executives when he held 14000 in phone company stock 
the independent prosecutor also investigated an arrangement in 
which members of a washington real estate family arranged to pay a 
40000ayear salary for meeses wife and then won an office lease 
renewal with the justice department 
each aspect of mckays investigation involved meeses 
relationship with wallach who is under indictment for alleged 
racketeering in the wedtech scandal 
wallach interviewed tuesday evening on cnns larry king 
live program said mckay spoke to over 100 witnesses reviewed 
thousands and thousands of documents and came up without a single 
scintilla of evidence of wrongdoing on eds part and i submit 
therefore on my part 
meese decided to resign in part out of the realization that he 
faces a new and intense round of public criticism when the report 
by mckay is publicly issued in a few weeks said justice department 
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
by resigning after it has become clear that he will not be 
indicted but before the massive report details his activities 
meese can declare that he has been vindicated said the sources 
republicans many of whom saw meese as a political liability for 
the coming elections were generally pleased by his decision to 
leave now his announcement brought expressions of relief from 
george bushs presidential campaign and a terse statement from the 
vice president himself 
ed did the right thing and i wish him well bush said in 
remarks read over the phone by a staff member 
meese 56 said he will return to private life and that i have 
had several opportunities presented to me over the past few 
months he did not elaborate 
meese has been attorney general since feb 25 1985 and before 
that was white house counselor his friendship with reagan dates 
back to their days together in california where reagan was 
governor

washington ap the interior department launched an effort 
wednesday to enlist employees and users of its public lands as 
eyes and ears in a steppedup campaign against illegal drugs 
one of the biggest problems we face on federal lands is 
knowing when and where drug activity occurs secretary donald p 
hodel said at a news conference 
employees of the departments landmanagement agencies the 
national park service bureau of land management the bureau of 
indian affairs the bureau of reclamation and the fish and wildlife 
service will be given increased training in spotting signs of 
drug use hodel said 
he used the example of a bottle cap which you or i might not 
think anything of but which might have been used to heat a small 
amount of a drug solution and to a trained ranger might alert 
him that something was going on in the vicinity 
departmental pilots may be asked to keep an eye out for 
marijuana stands he said 
the department has sent public service commercials asking for 
public alertness to drug use and transactions to 600 television 
stations and new signs will be added at parks and other 
facilities hodel said 
the department administers 500 million acres of land ore than a 
fifth of the nation if the forest service an agriculture 
department office that like the interior department has encountered 
marijuana growing on its lands were added the total would be 
about 30 percent of the nation 
the departments domains include tracts from parks in and near 
washington dc where drugs like crack and pcp are frequently 
traded all the way to some of the most remote areas of the nation 
like vast tracts of alaska where drug activities are unlikely to 
be a concern 
though the department wants park rangers to be more alert i 
dont read them as going out of their way to raid visitor 
campsites looking for drugs hodel said 
instead the rangers would be the eyes and ears for law 
enforcement officers 
the secretary said subordinates had developed an estimate that 
the department spends 11 million a year on antidrug activites by 
its 4300 law enforcement officers and 30 undercover agents though

lawyers for the justice department and an 
environmental group urged a federal appeals court wednesday to 
dissolve an injunction that has let louisiana shrimpers avoid using 
turtle excluder devices in their nets 
the injunction was issued by us district judge patrick carr in 
april just as louisiana was getting ready to open its waters for 
the spring season carr forbade enforcement of the federal 
regulation until courts ruled on an appeal by the state attorney 
general and the concerned shrimpers of louisiana 
turtle excluders installed where a trawl narrows down to a 
pocket provide a trap door through which turtles are ejected 
shrimpers contend shrimp also escape through the trap door when 
the device isnt blocked by debris that prevents anything entering 
the pocket 
its in the middle of the shrimp season and you are asking us 
to lift the injunction so that literally overnight they would have 
to start using turtle excluder devices asked judge jerry e 
smith one of three judges who heard the plea in the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals 
there is no surprise for them responded attorney david 
hayes representing the center for environmental education hayes 
said that with the onagain offagain history of the federal 
regulation shrimpers have teds ready for installation 
although the turtle excluders protect all sea turtles the main 
concern is the disappearing kemp ridley 
john sheppard of the louisiana attorney generals office argued 
that the teds reduce the shrimp catch and do little to protect 
endangered sea turtles 
he said dredging and development of beachfront property kill far 
more turtles than shrimp nets 
there are all sorts of depredations on the turtle population 
why discriminate against the shrimper he said 
the court gave no indication when it would rule

minnesotas two largest newspapers are on 
trial for revealing the identity of a man who leaked court 
documents in 1982 about the 12yearold shoplifting conviction of a 
candidate for lieutenant governor 
in his opening statement tuesday an attorney for dan cohen said 
he would put the daytoday decisionmaking at the minneapolis star 
and tribune and the st paul pioneer press dispatch on trial before 
a jury 
cohen is being punished for revealing factual information 
about a powerful political candidate said attorney elliot 
rothenberg all he did was turn over authentic court records 
attorneys for the newspapers were scheduled to make their 
opening statements wednesday in hennepin county district court 
cohen in his breachofcontract lawsuit claims the newspapers 
violated agreements not to identify him as the source of 
information about marlene johnsons record for shoplifting 6 worth 
of merchandise 
johnson was the dfl candidate for lieutenant governor on a 
ticket led by rudy perpich she and perpich won the 1982 election 
and have held the offices since 1983 
on oct 27 1982 reporters lori sturdevant of the minneapolis 
newspaper and bill salisbury of the st paul newspaper separately 
accepted court documents from cohen about the 1970 shoplifing 
conviction which was vacated in 1971 with no sentence on 
condition that cohens identity would not be revealed 
later that day editors of both newspapers overruled their 
reporters and decided to name cohen as the source two other news 
organizations the associated press and wccotv received the 
same information from cohen but did not identify him 
the day the stories appeared cohen was fired from his 
35000ayear job as a public relations executive with an 
advertising agency rothenberg said 
editors at both papers have said cohens name was revealed 
because the importance of keeping readers fully informed of 
election developments outweighed continuing his confidentiality 
attorneys for the papers have argued that the newspapers did not 
have a viable oral contract with cohen 
the minneapolis newspaper has since changed its name to the star 
tribune 
rothenberg said cohen was a good friend of 
independentrepublican gubernatorial candidate wheelock whitney who 
had helped write position papers in his official capacity at the 
advertising agency 
the trial is expected to last two weeks

hundreds of haitians gathered at a federal 
courthouse today as a judge opened a hearing on the fate of 14000 
farm laborers facing expulsion from the united states because they 
lack work permits 
senior us district judge c clyde atkins ordered the hearing 
moved to a larger courtroom to accommodate the crowd 
a request for an injunction against the immigration and 
naturalization service was filed by the roman catholic archdiocese 
of palm beach the haitian refugee center and individual 
farmworkers 
the case directly affects an estimated 14000 haitians mexicans 
and other foreign workers in florida alabama and georgia 
attorneys in the case said and could apply across the country 
at issue is the ins refusal to accept affidavits from the 
farmworkers and their employers swearing they have worked the 90 
hours required to receive a special agricultural work permit under 
the new immigration law 
without the permits they cannot legally remain in the united 
states and many are already under expulsion orders 
ira kurzban attorney for the farmworkers said the ins is 
defying congress wishes by demanding documentary proof of 
employment which farmworkers do not have because many had been in 
the country illegally 
the government has imposed an impossible burden of proof 
said the complaint kurzban said the burden of proof should be on 
the ins to disprove the affidavits 
the ins has also held hearings on the permits without 
translators present kurzban said and is not granting required 
temporary work permits during the appeal process 
ins attorney david bernal said the rigorous proof is necessary 
to support the affidavits because it has been determined there 
was fraud in this area 
bernal told atkins that the burden of providing a translator was 
not the governments responsibility and that most farmworkers 
brought someone with them to the ins hearings in any case 
the ins also argued that the district court had no jurisdiction 
because congress specifically said only federal appeals courts 
could hear challenges to the law but kurzban said the suit is 
challenging only ins procedures not the law itself

25member volunteer force have been fired by township trustees 
climaxing a dispute over working conditions and other demands 
the wayne township trustees surprised spectators and 
firefighters at a public meeting tuesday night by announcing the 
mass firings in addition to fire chief charles nause the only 
fulltime paid department member about 25 volunteer firefighters 
and emergency medical technicians were discharged 
the volunteers had walked off the job briefly more than a month 
ago and expected the trustees to announce a settlement of the 
dispute at the meeting 
patricia pack a spokeswoman for the firefighters who was among 
those fired said wednesday the trustees are gambling with the 
townships 5000 residents the firefighters she said plan to 
challenge the firings 
we will get a lawyer said ms pack an emergency medical 
technician im a little shocked it seems to me the trustees of 
wayne township are playing russian roulette with the lives of the 
people of the township 
the trustees said clermont county and surrounding towns would 
provide emergency services in the meantime 
the firefighters comprise a corporation that contracts with the 
township to provide emergency services in return for insurance and 
workmens compensation coverage no contract had been agreed to 
this year 
the trustees who own the firefighters equipment and emergency 
services building forbade the firefighters to return to the 
building or remove personal belongings ms pack said 
the township is located 20 miles east of cincinnati 
the trustees said in a letter that the firefighters were fired 
because of unreasonable demands and failure to get along with the 
trustees they gave no reason for firing nause ms pack said 
the firefighters had demanded a fulltime paid chief insurance 
coverage for supervising emergency medical technicians and a new 
emergency vehicle to replace an old deteriorating one 
the firefighters returned to work after nause was restored to a 
fulltime chief he had been cut to parttime status last january

michael dukakis has a passion for order but 
choosing a vice presidential candidate is proving anything but an 
orderly process he can carry out with a minimum of public scrutiny 
not until he clinched the democratic presidential nomination on 
june 7 would dukakis even discuss the process by which he would 
choose a running mate and then it was only to say it would be a 
good thoughtful deliberative process 
but with interviews in boston on tuesday and wednesday of three 
prospective running mates the dukakis search began to resemble the 
parade to north oaks minn four years ago when walter f mondale 
was looking for someone to complete the democratic ticket 
looking back on his experience mondale conceded that i dont 
think it built confidence 
the 1984 democratic nominee suggested that dukakis pursue a 
different way of looking at vice presidential candidates and 
dukakis started out determined to take mondales advice campaign 
aides were forbidden to talk about the process 
dukakis did avoid the biggest mondale mistake his 
determination to make it clear he was considering women as well as 
men blacks as well as whites the mondale list included three 
women among them the final choice rep geraldine ferraro of new 
york two blacks and a hispanic and one white male 
while it was as mondale would say not a bad idea it 
reinforced the perception that he was too eager to cater to various 
special interest groups 
ironically mondales historymaking choice all but guaranteed 
that the democratic vice presidential candidate this year would be 
a white male 
im going to cast my net far and wide said the 
massachusetts governor nobodys ruled in nobodys ruled out 
was a favorite response to questions about whether this or that 
individual was under consideration 
the first major leak was that dukakis had all but settled on 
sen bill bradley of new jersey for the no 2 spot on the ticket 
dukakis quashed that report with a statement saying that only he 
and confidant paul brountas the lawyer in charge of the search 
could speak with any authority about who might be in or out of 
contention 
but if dukakis seriously believed he could control the 
information about how he was going about choosing a running mate 
he underestimated the intensity of the scrutiny it would undergo as 
well as the impossibility of muzzling jesse jackson 
the first indication of who were the serious contenders for the 
no 2 spot came when brountas began asking individuals for detailed 
personal and financial information 
inevitably names began to come out among the first were sens 
bob graham of florida and john glenn of ohio 
the dukakis campaign must have known that those names would come 
out 
less predictable and more embarrassing was that at the same time 
there were leaks of the names of prospects who had turned him down 
bradley and sen sam nunn of georgia and house majority leader 
tom foley of washington 
when dukakis visited the capitol last week for a day of meetings 
with members of congress he eluded reporters most of the day but 
then told them he had met individually with graham glenn nunn and 
sen lloyd bentsen of texas nunn later said he had told the 
governor he was not interested 
but those amounted to the first of the interviews 
traveling to boston this week were sen albert gore jr of 
tennessee and reps richard gephardt of missouri and lee hamilton 
of indiana gephardt and hamilton told reporters they would happily 
accept an offer to run with dukakis gore ducked all questions 
the entire process has been played out to background music 
provided by jackson who has insisted he deserves consideration for 
the vice presidential nomination 
he called the other contenders unknown quantities and 
suggested that his qualifications were far more impressive 
at the same time jackson wouldnt say if hed accept the job if 
offered at one point he said hed made up his mind but had told no 
one including dukakis of his decision

a ship carrying more than 70 tons of 
wellpackaged marijuana arrived in port today after being seized on 
the high seas by a coast guard cutter for not flying a flag and 
refusing orders to stop 
the coast guard cutter boutwell sporting a makeshift flag 
showing a marijuana leaf with a red line diagonally across it 
towed the panamanianregistered encounter bay to a seattle pier 
our best estimate is there is somewhere in excess of 72 tons 
of marijuana on board said the boutwells captain cecil allison 
he described the drug as very high grade with very few stems and 
very few seeds 
allison said the marijuana with a street value estimated at 
about 280 million consisted of about 8000 bales packed in four 
large shipping containers each bale in a blue nylon sack 
contained eight packets of marijuana vacuumsealed in double 
plastic wrappings 
you would like to get some of your freezedried food packed 
this well the captain said 
the marijuana vessel a 180foot converted offshore oil rig 
supply ship was under tight security as agents of the us drug 
enforcment administration secured the ships cargo and the 
18member crew 
crew members were being fingerprinted aboard the boutwell before 
a scheduled appearance before a us magistrate this afternoon 
thirteen of the crew were from indonesia thailand and 
singapore the other five included three from the united states and 
one each from britain and new zealand the coast guard said 
the crew members were cooperative but all refused to talk about 
the drug shipment allison said 
if it can be proved the ship was bound for the united states 
they could face felony charges of a few years to life in prison 
depending on prior convictions and sentencing guidelines said gary 
liming special agentincharge of the drug enforcement 
administration in seattle 
the owner of the encounter bay was listed as countess shipping 
corp of panama 
liming said the pot was probably from the far east possibly 
thailand with california the eventual destination 
with an estimated street value of 2000 per pound the 
marijuana is worth about 280 million making it one of the largest 
drug seizures in maritime history and the biggest on the west 
coast said coast guard lt eldo delong 
sixty rounds were fired from a 50caliber machine gun aboard 
the 378foot boutwell into the encounter bays engine room after 
the vessel refused to stop 
permission to board the ship was obtained from the panamanian 
embassy after suspicions were raised when it was spotted in 
international waters off the central washington coast from a coast 
guard c130 aircraft delong said 
it wasnt flying a flag the name and home port werent 
readily visible and its kind of unusual to see this type of 
vessel in this area he explained 
authorities had no idea about the vessels cargo before 
boarding he said

delegates of the rightwing herut party 
chose top candidates wednesday for novembers election and former 
defense minister ariel sharon edged out a rival backed by prime 
minister yitzhak shamir 
a dozen riot police guarded the convention at this seaside 
resort apparently to prevent clashes among heruts three camps 
headed by sharon cabinet minister moshe arens and deputy prime 
minister david levy a convention two years ago was aborted after 
fistfights between party members 
more than 2000 party delegates chose among 35 candidates for 
the second through eighth slots on the party slate first place is 
reserved for shamir leader of herut the senior partner in the 
likud bloc 
likud and its main rival the leftofcenter labor party are 
running neckandneck in polls 
to prevent fighting among the three camps shamir recommended 
levy for second place arens for third and sharon for fourth arens 
is a shamir ally while sharon and levy have sought to wrest party 
leadership from shamir 
the delegates gave levy the second spot but sharon came in 
third ahead of arens a former ambassador to the united states 
shamir denied the results were a personal setback there was 
no disloyalty by anyone he told israel army radio he also noted 
that placement on the slate would not affect candidates future 
cabinet posts 
arens said the vote went against our agreement noting that 
he voted according to shamirs recommendations but arens told 
reporters he was not bitter 
sharon who is trade and industry minister played down the 
importance of the results these are not votes that will 
determine the future leader of the party he told israel 
television there is no reason to create unnecessary tension 
levy who made his political fortune as an advocate of the once 
underprivileged north africanborn israelis was thronged by 
supporters who showered him with kisses 
he criticized shamir for trying to influence the vote saying 
im sorry the prime minister saw the need to make 
recommendations 
the delegates also gave top slots to two newcomers to party 
politics former un ambassador binyamin netanyahu and former 
prime minister menachem begins son benjamin netanyahu came in 
sixth and begin was ranked eighth 
the poolside convention was held in a carnivallike atmosphere 
the rankandfile showered voting delegates with buttons and 
stickers bearing the names of candidates north africanstyle music 
blasted from an opensided tent staked by levy backers sharon 
supporters walking by the pool shouted slogans through megaphones 
the balloting was part of a complicated selection process to put 
together a slate for the parliamentary elections 
israeli voters choose a party not individual candidates and 
each party is apportioned parliament seats according to the number 
of votes it wins 
last week herut chose 35 candidates and in wednesdays vote 
those candidates were ranked based on 1984 election results the 
top 30 candidates have a realistic chance of winning a seat 
two more rounds of voting were to follow to determine slots nine 
through 22 
the remaining candidates will be ranked according to the number 
of votes they got in last weeks balloting 
the liberal party the junior partner in likud has already 
selected its 12 parliamentary candidates who according to an 
agreement with herut will be given roughly every third slot on the 
likud list

republican sen arlen specter invaded michael 
dukakis home turf wednesday to criticize the likely democratic 
presidential nominees record on crime but specter was in turn 
ambushed by dukakis allies 
the pennsylvania senator appearing at the massachusetts 
statehouse at the request of likely republican nominee george bush 
arrived to find dukakis supporters including the states current 
and former attorneys general several county prosecutors and police 
chiefs and state officials involved in anticrime and antidrug 
programs 
also specter didnt travel up from washington alone democratic 
sen john f kerry who also served under dukakis as lieutenant 
governor took the same flight to boston so he could be on hand to 
defend dukakis 
specters main target was dukakis support of a state program 
that allowed inmates sentenced to life in prison without parole to 
be released on furloughs 
one such inmate raped a maryland woman leading to tighter 
eligibility standards that dukakis originally opposed but later 
signed into law after they were given overwhelming approval by the 
legislature 
bush has made the maryland incident a staple in his pitch to 
portray dukakis as soft on crime and specter was here to continue 
that effort saying dukakis support for giving furloughs to 
noparole inmates raises a question as to his overall judgment 
kerry standing close by would have none of that 
he moved up to the microphone exchanged pleasantries with 
specter and proceeded to denounce bush as a donothing vice 
president who failed as the leader of reagan administration 
antidrug efforts 
cocaine is more readily available on the streets of america 
today than at any time in history kerry told reporters this 
nation does not need a silent leader in the war on drugs and the 
fight against crime kerry said to cheers from partisan onlookers 
kerry then defended the massachusetts furlough program saying 
its eligibility standards were stricter than many state programs 
and the federal prison system 
it was specters turn to steal back the microphone that was 
supposed to be his to begin with 
governor dukakis furlough system is indefensible he said 
kerry said the furlough program in massachusetts is tougher 
than the federal program 
he also contended specters appearance was designed to draw 
attention from the resignation of embattled attorney general edwin 
meese iii and called it an effort to obfuscate to try to hide 
this administrations failures in law enforcement 
specter kept his cool though visibly annoyed that the dukakis 
allies had imposed on his show 
state attorney general james shannon introduced specter but also 
made sure to refer to the declining crime rate in massachusetts 
when shannon a democrat had gone on long enough for specter the 
senator tried to pry away the microphone and a specter aide reached 
out for shannon 
thats not necessary specter told the aide before turning 
to shannon but this is my news conference

a hearing on the fate of 14000 farmworkers facing 
expulsion from the united states opened wednesday with a farm owner 
saying the government acted arbitrarily in granting work permits to 
haitians and other foreigners 
martha taylor a cherry tomato and pepper farmer from hendry 
county said she employs 80 to 120 mostly mexican farmworkers and 
at one point provided affidavits for some of them 
of 18 workers during that particular period 11 got their 
green cards and there were seven denials mrs taylor said all 
had the same proof 
mrs taylor testified before senior us district judge c clyde 
atkins who moved the hearing to a larger courtroom to accommodate 
hundreds of haitians who gathered peacefully outside the courthouse 
the suit filed by the roman catholic diocese of palm beach 
county the haitian refugee center and individual migrant workers 
accuses immigration authorities of improperly refusing agricultural 
work permits to foreigners 
without the permits which can be granted only to laborers who 
worked at least 90 hours in the fields within a certain period 
they can be expelled from the country 
the case directly affects an estimated 14000 haitians mexicans 
and other foreign workers in florida alabama and georgia 
attorneys in the case say and could apply across the country 
attorneys for the us immigration and naturalization service 
say they have refused to issue permits on the basis of sworn 
affidavits alone because the program is rife with fraud 
however ira kurzban an attorney for the laborers argued that 
the ins stand violates congress intentions in passing the new 
immigration law 
kurzban said the ins is requiring documentary evidence such as 
pay stubs or employment records even though congress stated 
affidavits would be sufficient 
the government has imposed an impossible burden of proof on 
the farm workers many of whom were paid without tax deductions he 
said 
garry leffert an attorney from martinsburg wva who has 
represented many farm workers testified that crew chiefs often 
failed to keep records of payments 
along with the refusal to accept the affidavits the suit 
charges that the ins has held hearings on the permits without 
translators present and is not granting required temporary work 
permits during the appeal process 
the hearing was adjourned until thursday

the shooting down of an iranian airliner 
by the us navy appears to help radicals in the tehran power 
struggle but some major players are preaching moderation and 
diplomacy 
threats of total war and worldwide terrorism have issued from 
iran since the american cruiser vincennes shot the jetliner down 
sunday just after a skirmish with iranian attack boats killing all 
290 people aboard 
in contrast however hashemi rafsanjani seems to be more 
interested in turning the tragedy to political advantage 
rafsanjani the parliament speaker and military commander is 
believed to be second in power to ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the 
87yearold revolutionary patriarch 
clear differences about how iran should react to the destruction 
of iran air flight 655 have emerged in public comments by various 
iranian leaders 
they reflect the political turbulence in iran since radical 
gains in the aprilmay parliamentary elections and several 
battlefield victories by iraq with which the iranians have been at 
war since september 1980 
ayatollah hussein ali montazeri designated successor to 
khomeini urged the patriarch to activate revolutionary cells 
inside and outside iran to strike at americaa financial 
military and political targets everywhere 
khomeini who periodically is rumored to be near death called 
for allout war against the americans offering his worthless 
life to the struggle 
rafsanjani who has begun advocating an end to irans isolation 
said we cannot allow ourselves to refrain from taking revenge 
but seemed to suggest violent reprisals would be selfdefeating 
with this added comment 
perhaps the americans would like it if some amateurish action 
were taken in some corner of the world so that once again they can 
remove the wave of propaganda which is now heaped on americas head 
and divert it in another direction 
he said the united states cannot be forgiven even if the 
airliner was shot down by mistake as the americans say and 
declared we are sure that the world will take a serious decision 
with regard to this incident 
all quarters in iran demand withdrawal of us naval forces in 
the gulf which they view as forming a second front in their war 
with iraq 
it is not always easy to discern maneuvers in the opaque iranian 
political arena but rafsanjani suddently has become the champion 
of bringing iran back into the world 
in a surprisingly frank interview on irans staterun television 
last saturday he admitted irans revolutionary fervor had 
alienated many countries and said 
one of the wrong things we did in the revolutionary 
atmosphere was constantly to make enemies we pushed those who 
have could been neutral into hostility it is part of the new plan 
that in foreign policy we should behave so as to avoid needlessly 
ceding ground to the enemy 
on the surface the wave of rage president ali khamenei 
reported in iran has bolstered such antiwestern leaders as 
interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi a middleranking cleric 
with close ties to shiite moslem extremists in lebanon 
western intelligence sources say mohtashemi controlled the 
islamic zealots behind the 1983 suicide bombings in beirut that 
killed hundreds of american and french servicemen while ambassador 
to syria in 1985 he lost an eye and two fingers on his right hand 
when he opened a parcel bomb in damascus 
mohtashemi publicly called rafsanjanis efforts defeatist 
prompting president khamenei to say iranian leaders should not 
create confusion 
rafsanjani has broached the possibility of a nonmilitary 
solution to the war that would involve iraq accepting justice 
and admitting it started the conflict with an invasion in september 
1980 the invasion followed several border skirmishes 
we have left open a nonmilitary solution he said last 
month after khomeini made him military commanderinchief to 
rebuild an effective fighting machine from irans demoralized 
forces we do not insist on the military option but we are 
pessimistic about the nonmilitary one 
some analysts suspect rafsanjani seeks a few military victories 
so facesaving settlement of the war will be possible

the increasing frankness of chinese filmmakers in 
showing sex and violence has led the government to consider rating 
movies unsuitable for children an official report said wednesday 
the china youth news quoted film bureau chief teng jinxian as 
saying some modern movies contain scenes that are unhealthy for 
children but vital to the plot or development of character 
one example is red sorghum which shared 1988 bestpicture 
honors in chinas golden rooster awards announced tuesday the 
story includes a rape although it is not shown explicitly and 
shows a man being skinned to death at the order of japanese 
soldiers during world war ii 
rather than cut the scenes teng said the bureau may label the 
movie unsuitable for children he did not say if theaters would be 
required to bar children from attending such films 
only in recent years have chinese films contained strong sexual 
elements the strong streak of puritanism in chinas communist 
rulers long required all movies to show only wholesome characters 
loyally serving the nation

its not what you say but how big you say 
it spotswood officials told a church group that put up an 
antiabortion billboard 
but a church attorney looked at the billboard another way and a 
judge agreed 
superior court judge john c bachman issued a temporary 
restraining order tuesday forbidding the borough from acting 
against immaculate conception church or the sign he set a sept 6 
hearing on the matter 
the knights of columbus council 4907 put up the sign on the 
roman catholic churchs lawn in june it shows a baby and says 
kill her now its murder kill her before birth its 
abortion 
its a freedomofspeech issue robert rafano the attorney 
representing the church and council said wednesday 
borough zoning officer jack mcdonald said he doesnt care what 
message is on the sign as long as the sign is legal now he said 
the 72squarefoot billboard exceeds the size limit of 25 square 
feet 
but rafano argued the ordinance does not mention signs with a 
public message and the law does not apply 
how can we exercize freedom of speech if people cant read our 
message he said 
mcdonald acknowledged that borough officials began to look into 
the billboard after someone complained anonymously to police 
the complainant said the antiabortion message is distasteful 
and offensive and the picture of the baby on the sign is 
distraction to traffic he said but the size is in violation 
of the zoning ordinance 
the content has nothing to do with anything as far as im 
concerned 
on june 14 the borough issued a notice to the church that said 
the billboards size violated the zoning ordinance facing a 
summons the church sued

corn plants continue curling up and showing 
other signs of stress from heat and drought and scientists think 
they know why the agriculture department said wednesday 
the departments agricultural research service reported that two 
enzymes in corn and other plants help limit stress from heat and 
drought within a temperature range we call a thermal kinetic 
window 
researchers said that when the plants temperature rises above 
the window its ability to fight heat stress starts to fade and 
when there is a lack of water for use by the plants natural 
cooling system the enzymes become less effective and the plant 
withers and dies 
the enzymes identified by agency scientists in lubbock texas 
are glutathione reductase which stops the buildup of potentially 
lethal waste products as a plant fights heat stress and 
hydroxypyruvate reductase which is thought to protect 
photosynthesis or the plants foodmaking process during stress 
jerry l hatfield a research leader at the laboratory said 
thermal kinetic windows vary by plant species and are much narrower 
than expected for example corn has a window in a range of 77 to 
88 degrees fahrenheit cucumbers 93 to 100 wheat 62 to 73 
spinach 50 to 63 and cotton 73 to 90 
one of the goals of the research is to transfer one plants 
genes for controlling an enzymes behavior into other plants 
thereby producing crops that are more tolerant to heat drought and 
other stresses than they otherwise would be hatfield said in a 
report issued here 
although such advances may be a long way off they could lead 
to crops better equipped to face such climatic changes as the 
gradual heating that may occur from the buildup of carbon dioxide 
in the earths atmosphere he said 
meanwhile a report by the governments joint agricultural 
weather facility said rain and cooler weather in the week of june 
27 to july 3 eased drought stress in the great plains delta and 
western corn belt but that the lack of moisture worsened in 
most corn belt states 
overall the corn crop was in still mostly fairtopoor 
condition the report said 
an estimated 96 percent of the nations soybeans had been 
planted by july 3 slightly behind the normal pace the crop was 
reported in mostly fair condition in the great plains and 
southeast but were said to be mostly poor in the delta states 
cooler temperatures eased livestock stress the report said 
ranchers continued culling herds as forage supplies decreased 
producers provided supplemental feed in most areas pastures were 
mostly poor and showed very little regrowth

prosperity is continuing in the united states 
and other industrial countries but poverty is on the rise in the 
third world the world bank said wednesday 
a healthy growth is now expected this year in the industrial 
countries stanley fischer the banks chief economist said at a 
news conference the value of the dollar has stabilized and has 
even begun to rise slightly 
the banks study world development report 1988 predicted 
that if the united states and other leading governments follow what 
the bank sees as the right policies the average income of their 
citizens will grow by 26 percent a year between 1987 and 1995 
the right policies it said included credible action to 
reduce the us federal budget deficit and creation of more demand 
for goods in japan west germany and industrializing countries such 
as south korea and taiwan 
it gave the average us income for 1986 as 17480 for japan 
as 12840 and for a poor african country like tanzania 250 
but it calculated that countries in subsaharan africa will see 
their incomes grow by only 07 percent annually 
in some developing countries the prolonged economic slump is 
already more severe than it was during the great depression of the 
1930s in the industrial countries the report said the tide 
of poverty and misery in those countries is rising not receding 
the world bank which is owned by 151 countries tries to raise 
living standards in the poor ones by providing loans on easy terms 
it lends about 17 billion a year and wants to increase that by 10 
percent annually the ambition could be hampered by reluctance in 
congress to contribute to an increase of the banks capital 
the report said much must be done to reverse the way things are 
going in the poorer countries 
since 1980 matters have turned from bad to worse it said 
in most third world countries growth has slowed wages have 
dropped job creation has faltered and farm prices and government 
spending on social services both have declined 
the number of people below the poverty line increased at least 
up to 19834 in brazil chile ghana jamaica peru and the 
philippines the report added 
there has been a sharp reversal in the trend toward improved 
standards of child health nutrition and education in 21 out of 
35 lowincome developing countries the daily calorie supply 
was lower in 1985 than in 1965 between 1979 and 1982 life 
expectancy declined in nine subsaharan countries in zimbabwe 
deaths from malnutrition among infants and children doubled during 
19804 
bank officials saw improvement in the poor countries as 
depending heavily on what happens in the rich ones 
the report predicted that if the policies it recommends are not 
followed incomes in the industrial countries will grow by only 18 
percent a year between 1987 and 1995 slightly less than earlier 
in the decade in that case it saw third world incomes growing at 
22 percent and not at all in africa below the sahara 
growth traditionally is more rapid in developing countries than 
in the industrialized ones 
the report blamed military spending for worsening the situation 
evidence increasingly points to high military spending as 
contributing to fiscal and debt crises complicating stabilization 
and adjustment and negatively affecting economic growth and 
development it said 
whatever benefits might arise from such spending must be 
carefully weighed against these heavy costs

optimism over upcoming cambodian peace 
talks has been overshadowed by a lack of compromise on two key 
issues the future of the khmer rouge and the formation of a new 
government 
foreign ministers of southeast asian countries said a trend 
toward dialogue has created more optimism than ever before about 
ending the 9yearold war between cambodian guerrillas and the 
vietnamese occupying the country 
thailands prime minister prem tinsulanonda told the annual 
conference of the association of southeast asian nations that 
peace is at hand he said the region soon can focus on 
economic development and usher in a new era of peace and 
prosperity 
the ministers ended the conference tuesday and are to start 
talks thursday with western leaders including secretary of state 
george shultz theyre expected to ask for help in guaranteeing a 
settlement in cambodia 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 after bloody border 
clashes with the communist khmer rouge regime which killed 
hundreds of thousands of its people from 197578 vietnamese forces 
installed a sympathetic government and are battling a guerrilla 
coalition of the khmer rouge and forces of former cambodian leaders 
prince norodom sihanouk and son sann 
the cambodian factions vietnam laos and asean countries are 
to attend informal peace talks in indonesia on july 25 but they 
face the same hurdles that abruptly halted earlier talks between 
sihanouk and hun sen prime minister of the provietnam cambodian 
government 
indonesias foreign minister ali alatas organizer of the talks 
told the associated press monday that many obstacles to an 
agreement remain although the parties agree on the final outcome 
they differ widely on how to get there he said 
one problem is the khmer rouge 
the provietnamese governments spk news agency on wednesday 
called the group the greatest obstacle to a settlement worries 
of a return of the khmer rouge the strongest guerrilla force have 
intensified with vietnams pullout of 50000 troops this year and 
stated plans to withdraw the remaining 50000 by 1990 
some diplomats say the khmer rouge is storing arms avoiding 
direct military clashes and infiltrating villages to prepare 
allout attacks in 1990 
vietnam and the hun sen government insist that the khmer rouge 
be dismantled as a military and political organization and that 
leader pol pot and his top aides not be allowed any role in 
cambodias future because of their genocide and threat to 
vietnams security 
official vietnamese radio said tuesday the troop pullout opened 
the door to a negotiated settlement but the second key problem 
pol pot remains it quoted vietnams foreign minister nguyen co 
thach as saying the world community has a responsibility to ensure 
the khmer rouge does not return to power 
the khmer rouge armed mainly by china has remained silent on 
the demands regarding its leadership 
but china recently called for formation of a coalition 
government and a freeze on all force levels until elections are 
held 
sihanouk told the asean ministers the khmer rouge has agreed to 
his proposal to dissolve the resistance coalition and the 
provietnamese government at the same time in sihanouks scheme 
the four factions would form a provisional government after 
vietnams complete pullout and organize general elections leading 
to a neutral nation 
hun sen has flatly rejected dissolution of his government and 
said the guerrilla factions must instead join his regime 
the spk commentary said the hun sen government has controlled 
all the countrys territory since 1979 and its dissolution would 
mean the return of the khmer rouge regime 
a resistance radio broadcast tuesday said free elections could 
not be held under the auspices of the hun sen government 
the radio said hun sens refusal to budge on this point showed 
it wanted to impose the communist regime and also that vietnam 
does not yet have the good will to find a solution to the cambodian 
problem

barbership quartets are upbeat about a 
resurgence of interest in their music and theyre singing out loud 
and clear on the 50th anniversary of their international society 
more than 10000 people have registered for this weeks 
international convention of the society for the preservation and 
encouragement of barbershop quartet singing in america 
i think we are gaining some respect again across the 
country said james warner a memphis attorney and international 
president of the 38000member organization 
we are developing programs for young men in some high schools 
and its found increasing acceptance he said were not using 
it as a recruitment device but as an attempt to reach out to young 
men in that area he said 
barbershop quartets which popped up mainly on the east coast at 
the turn of the century and were popular during the vaudeville era 
use fourpart harmonies to carry tunes the lead singer carries the 
melody a tenor harmonizes and a baritone and a bass carry the 
lower chords there is no instrumental accompaniment 
competition begins thursday with 51 quartets battling for five 
finalist positions sixteen choruses comprised of 50 men also will 
vie for five finalist positions 
the finals are scheduled for saturday with one gold one silver 
and three bronze medals being awarded in each category and the gold 
medal winner becoming the international champion 
this is the olympics of barbershop singing and all of them 
have had to battle on the local level to get here warner said 
it will be a tough competition because there is a lot of prestige 
that goes with the medals 
on wednesday crooners warmed up gathering in hotel rooms and 
hallways to belt out such barbershop classics as sweet adeline 
greg zinke 27 a member of the northeast extension of 
pemberton nj said he began singing in a quartet after being 
around his fathers group 
zinke who works in a tool and die shop in high bridge nj 
said he opted for barbershop quartet singing instead of rock n 
roll because of the selection of clean simple old songs 
you dont have to be a fantastic singer to do this i think 
thats what makes it so nice for the guy off the street who admires 
the music he can come sing it too he said 
for a long time barbershop quartet singing was in a decline as 
the vaudeville era came to an end with the advent of motion 
pictures and other forms of music after world war i 
in 1938 owen c cash a tax attorney in tulsa okla and 
rupert hall another tulsa businessman formed the society to 
preserve the old music 
their group helped revive interest and there are now 2000 
quartets and 800 choruses divided into 16 regions in the united 
states and canada and other groups in england sweden west 
germany holland and new zealand 
doctors lawyers researchers plumbers electricians are among 
the barbershop quartet singers but ironically few barbers are 
members of the organization warner said 
it easy to sing and its portable said 35yearold roger 
payne of manhattan all you have to have is your pitch pipe and 
three other guys and you dont have to call anybody to move your 
piano it interacts with the audience in a real entertainmentkind 
of way

in a secret exchange with united nations 
officials the state department has explored reports that rioting 
palestinian arabs on the israeliheld west bank and in gaza were 
financed through a un agency but the reports were denied and 
the case is closed two us officials said wednesday 
while channeling aid to the palestinians who began their 
uprising last december may not be illegal allowing the un relief 
works agency to be used that way would upset israel the officials 
said in separate interviews 
we didnt like it either one of the officials said 
unrwa is not supposed to be a conduit for funds legal or 
illegal its not what unrwa is about 
but the other official said the us concern was based entirely 
on israeli sensitivity 
the officials discussed the secret inquiry only on condition 
they would not be identified 
the un agency distributes assistance to tens of thousands of 
palestinian refugees who live in camps on the west bank and in 
gaza more than 17000 palestinians work for unrwa in the 
territories 
the reports reached the state department about a month ago and 
prompted cabled inquires to the un agencys headquarters in 
vienna where they were flatly denied we dont have a problem 
a us official said but it doesnt mean it cant happen again 
with israels implicit approval an arab fund supervised by 
jordan and the palestine liberation organization had provided aid 
to palestinians in the israeliheld territories apart from un 
assistance but after the outbreak of violence last december 
israel sought to impose controls on the assistance 
the arab league meeting last month in algeria responded by 
deciding to provide 129 million to the palestinians including 
demonstrators and rioters to support the uprising some 200 
palestinians and 3 israelis have died in clashes that some israeli 
officials say were ordered by the plo in an attempt to destabilize 
the jewish state 
in asking unrwa authorities for an explanation we went in not 
with a reprimand but with a question one of the officials said 
the reports were denied we accepted it 
he added its an issue israelis are very sensitive about 
the official said the report did not specify the amount of money 
said to be passing to the palestinians through the un agency 
he said the state department inquiry was handled in a pretty 
restricted channel but was now becoming known because of the 
cable traffic between washington and vienna

donations for construction of a 37000 
monument honoring the uss vincennes have spurted since the warship 
downed an iranian passenger jetliner according to the chairman of 
the fundraising committee 
more than 500 in donations arrived in wednesdays mail said 
james funk fundraising chairman of the monument project last 
week the first week of the drive only 161 was donated he said 
i believe the increase came from both exposure to the facts 
about the four ships named vincennes and as an expression of the 
peoples support of the present situation the current ship is in 
funk said 
fundraisers already have collected about twothirds of the 
money needed to build a 37000 monument honoring the uss vincennes 
and three other navy ships of the same name 
the uss vincennes association which includes veterans of the 
four ships will pay half of that cost and has already raised more 
than 14000 local businesses have donated more than 10000 
toward the citys half funk said 
officials say 290 civilians died sunday when the vincennes an 
aegisclass guided missile cruiser shot down the commercial 
airliner the action came after the pilot failed to respond to 
several radio challenges on civilian and military frequencies 
the warship is the fourth to bear the vincennes name the 
southwestern indiana city plans to construct a pyramid of granite 
to commemorate the four ships each side of the pyramid will bear a 
silhouette and history of one of the ships 
the first ship a wooden sloopofwar was launched in 1826 and 
was the first navy ship to circumnavigate the globe during a 
fouryear worldwide voyage that began in 1838 artifacts were 
gathered that became the foundation of the smithsonian institution 
the second ship a heavy cruiser ca44 was commissioned in 
1937 and sunk by japanese gunfire aug 9 1942 off savo island 
during the battle for guadalcanal 
the third ship a light cruiser cl64 was commissioned jan 
21 1944 and served in the pacific the ship received six battle 
stars and was decommissioned in 1946 it was sunk for use as a 
target ship but the bell was salvaged and is on display at 
vincennes city hall

fired white house aide oliver l north and his 
defense lawyers attended a closed hearing wednesday to argue their 
requests to use secret documents as evidence in the irancontra 
conspiracy case 
the hearing before us district judge gerhard a gesell was 
closed both to the public and to prosecutors to protect the 
secrecy of the documents and norths defense strategy 
gesell convened the hearing to begin the process of reviewing 
norths requests and determine if the material culled from the mass 
of secret documents collected by prosecutors is relevant to the 
case 
north has been given until july 11 to file a list of secret 
documents he proposes to use in defending charges he conspired to 
illegally divert profits from the usiran arms sales to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
after the judge determines which if any of the documents may 
be used as evidence gesell will conduct closed proceedings with 
government attorneys present to determine whether the material can 
be released at a public trial 
separate trials have been ordered for north former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim 
and retired air force maj gen richard v secord 
the judge has not set a trial date for north saying the case is 
not ready to be tried because of the lack of progress in 
declassifying the 200000 pages of classified documents collected 
by independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
in a brief filing walsh reported no further progress in 
discussions with government agencies about ways to delete sensitive 
portions of documents he intends to introduce into evidence 
a number of the issues raised by those documents particularly 
those that relate to geographical locations are under ongoing 
consideration at high levels at those agencies walsh said in the 
filing 
but he said no matter how those issues are resolved we 
believe that the case can proceed with appropriate editing of 
classified material or in a few cases substitutions for the 
documents with statements of what they would prove 
fewer than 10 documents contain material so sensitive that walsh 
said he would ask the judge to allow prosecutors to show them only 
to the court and jury 
walsh said most of the problems relate to the use of symbols to 
protect names places and countries the more difficult problem 
arising from the protection of sources and intelligence activities 
can for the most part be solved by editing of material that is 
irrelevant to the case he said 
walsh also reported that edward sg dennis acting assistant 
attorney general in charge of the justice departments criminal 
division has been designated to speak for the reagan 
administration on issues dealing with classified material 
the task should be made easier because walsh has withdrawn 226 
of the 628 classified documents he originally planned to use as 
evidence according to court papers 
the original list of 628 documents was submitted to the court 
before gesell ordered four separate trials

police reopened an investigation into the 1968 
death of the second wife of melvyn paisley a central figure in the 
pentagon procurement investigation because of discrepancies 
between his story and an autopsy report authorities said wednesday 
the autopsy and a separate medical investigators report that 
contains paisleys account include inconsistencies said maj 
terry allman head of the king county police criminal investigation 
division 
the may 7 1968 death of 30yearold mary lou paisley was ruled 
accidental at the time 
allman would not detail any discrepancies but said the fact 
that a woman had taken a drink along with two sleeping pills and 
a woman of fairly small stature and then gotten up in the middle 
of the night to paint and was found facedown in a rag seemed 
rather odd 
medical examiner records from 1968 show paisley told 
investigators his wife had an alcoholic drink and took two of his 
doriden sleeping pills before going to bed the night of her death 
several hours later the records quote him as saying he awoke 
to find his wife face down in the bathroom on a towel containing 
carbon tetrachloride a cleaning solvent for paintbrushes 
he said she apparently had gotten restless and got up and was 
painting pictures and was cleaning up her brushes when she 
apparently was overcome by the fumes the medical examiners 
report said 
the autopsy report is confidential but king county medical 
examiner dr donald reay said there was no trace of sleeping pills 
alcohol or carbon tetrachloride in the dead womans blood lab 
tests may not have been sensitive enough to detect small amounts 
but there is no way of knowing now for sure he said 
next to cause of death the coroners report has a question 
mark followed by drug hypersensitivity 
there is nothing in there that indicates violence chemical 
violence or physical violence reay told the seattle times 
its the absence of findings that would allow one to draw 
conclusions thats what makes this a puzzling case 
melvyn paisley is a former assistant navy secretary and 
exboeing co executive who has been accused of bribing pentagon 
officials and steering military contracts to companies he later 
served as a private consultant 
i think the general publicity about the man piqued our 
interest and we went back and looked at the limited information in 
the case county police spokesman dick larson said wednesday 
lack of police records however could stymie investigators he 
said 
thats one of the problems the documents were destroyed 
he said 
officers would be questioned who investigated the case and are 
no longer with the department but still alive 
paisleys attorney lawrence barcella of washington dc did 
not immediately return a phone call from the associated press on 
wednesday but told seattle newspapers police are going to waste 
valuable time and resources 
since the death of mrs paisley paisleys second wife paisley 
has married and divorced a third wife and now is married a fourth 
time 
paisley told me the police tried to pin it on him said 
james durst of bellevue who worked with paisley at boeing he 
said they gave him a bad time for several months but let him go 
because there was nothing wrong

a proposed bill to increase 
penalties for violation of segregation laws and to facilitate 
evictions and confiscation of property came under criticism 
wednesday 
the progovernment newspaper the citizen called on parliament 
to reconsider the group areas amendment proposed last week its 
penalties are excessively harsh it is open to abuse it is harmful 
to race relations and it is bound to cause further damage to the 
countrys image abroad said an editorial in the englishlanguage 
paper 
the bill would allow inspectors to search for violators of the 
racial segregation laws and magistrates to penalize people for not 
appearing in court when accused by anyone of a violation it would 
require eviction even when there was no housing available in the 
violators own group area the law provides no appeal of a 
magistrates decision and allows the government to confiscate 
houses and apartments that are rented to people in the wrong race 
classification 
the bill also increases the penalties for violation of racial 
segregation laws from 250 fines or three months in jail to 5000 
fines or five years in prison 
it contains some fearsome provisions hardly distinguishable 
from the nazi treatment of jews said business day a daily 
newspaper that generally reflects the views of the business 
community 
one explanation for the latest official policy on group areas 
is that government has lost its wits which is a possibility 
for the moment we assume they are sane but wrong the paper 
said 
both papers suggested that the government was trying to put up a 
tough image to win conservative rightwing votes in the october 
municipal elections 
the proposed legislation on segregation was accompanied by 
another bill that would allow for the first time the mixing of 
races in designated residential areas 
some white neighborhoods in major south african cities have over 
the years become illegally mixed as whites moved to the suburbs 
while blacks coloreds and indians moved into the city 
newspapers politicans and lawyers predicted increased tension 
and bad publicity if the government tried to reverse the tide in 
such entrenched mixed areas by enforcing the proposed law 
the proposed bill is to be debated in the next session of 
parliament beginning aug 22 business day predicted neither the 
mixedrace nor the indian chambers of parliament would approve it 
but the ruling nationalist party has a majority in the white 
chamber of parliament and controls the presidents council which 
can pass legislation opposed by the two smaller nonwhite chambers 
in the southern port city of durban which has large indian 
population two groups opposing the bill set the stage for major 
civil confrontations and court actions 
the white liberation movement a suprematist group said if 
the proper powers do not take the necessary steps themselves to 
enforce the laws we will ensure that the offenders are removed 
it said there were 9000 people living illegally in durban but 
the local branch of lawyers for human rights said 150 attorneys in 
the area would provide free legal representation to fight every 
case 
these people have nowhere to go the lawyers said there 
is no room in black areas and flats are lying vacant in white 
areas 
the government said it will take decades to construct homes for 
the concentration of blacks in urban areas where a nowdisavowed 
government policy once limited the availability of housing to keep 
them away

the parsonage formerly occupied by ptl 
ministry founder jim bakker and his family has been sold to a new 
jersey businessman who bid 685000 for the luxurious lakeside home 
ptl attorney edwin allman conducted the auction between only two 
bidders at the world outreach center at heritage usa on tuesday 
ptl originally had agreed to sell the bakker house to robert m 
rubino for 625000 allman said in us bankruptcy court on june 
29 however judge rufus reynolds told allman to conduct an auction 
after a competing bid of 666000 from an unnamed houston man was 
announced in court 
hes a delightful businessman who will be moving to tega 
cay allman said of rubino tega cay is a community beside lake 
wylie and a few miles from ptls heritage usa complex 
rubino owned several pizza restaurants and other real estate in 
and around new jersey allman said 
the 10266squarefoot house has four bedrooms 5 bathrooms a 
36foot long swimming pool a whirlpool a guardhouse a playhouse 
a boat dock a marble entry foyer an exercise room a music room 
and a kitchen crammed with appliances and cherry cabinetry 
the sale of the bakker house ended more than three months of 
effort by ptl officials to sell the vacant property 
ptl tried to sell the bakkers house and 10 other pieces of 
property at an auction in tega cay on april 12 
at that time thenptl trustee david clark said he hoped to 
raise 1 million from the sale of the bakker house alone to help 
the ministry reorganize however that auction failed to garner 
even an opening bid as high as 500000 for the house 
allman said in bankruptcy court that a recent assessment of the 
property had determined the fair market value of the bakkers house 
to be 650000 
we were satisfied with the price paid for the house allman 
said 
the bakkers did not file an objection to the sale of their 
former residence and were not present for the auction 
tammy bakker however cried for several minutes at the june 29 
bankruptcy hearing as the sale of the house was discussed 
its a house i loved because we raised our children in it 
she said after the hearing 
the bakkers again are living along lake wylie this time in a 
house rented for them by supporters in their bid to regain the 
ministry bakker founded then lost last year in a sexandmoney 
scandal 
bakker stepped down in march 1987 as it was revealed he had sex 
in 1980 with a church secretary jessica hahn and paid a reported 
363700 in hush money to silence her 
donations to the ministry then fell amid revelations of a lavish 
lifestyle led by the bakkers and other ptl officials and the 
ministry now is in bankruptcy court seeking to reorganize sell off 
assets and repay about 130 million in debt

farmers in designated drought areas who donate 
all the hay cut from land in two conservation programs will not 
have their federal acreage payments reduced agriculture secretary 
richard e lyng announced wednesday 
previously farmers who harvested hay from land enrolled in the 
conservation reserve program or crp and the water bank program 
or wbp would have their annual payments reduced by 25 percent the 
following year 
lyng said that to be eligible for the exemption a producer must 
donate the hay through a designated state agency engaged in 
droughtrelief efforts and obtain certification from an official of 
the agency that the hay has been donated properly 
more than 1800 counties have been designated by usda as drought 
areas eligible for the special haying privileges 
under the two programs farmers enroll land for 10 years and 
agree not to produce crops on it they are required to plant 
protective grasses or trees to prevent erosion and are paid annual 
rental fees by the government for maintaining the acreage 
typically the fees average 40 to 50 per acre annually thus 
without the exemption hay donated to help other farmers would 
result in a loss of 10 or more per year in federal payments

the former commander of the uss stark said 
wednesday that the downing of an iranian commercial jet by a navy 
warship was not necessarily similar to the iraqi jet attack on his 
ship that killed 37 sailors and forced him out of the service 
the co commanding officer had a hard time said glenn r 
brindel of the decision by capt will c rogers iii of the uss 
vincennes to shoot down the oncoming iranian air airbus a300 he 
called the shots the way he had to 
some people are trying to draw parallels between the two 
incidents i dont necessarily concur with that 
brindel said he did not wish to comment further 
brindels ship was hit in the persian gulf by two exocet 
missiles fired from an iraqi jet 12 miles away the frigate had 
little warning before the missiles struck the ships phalanx 
antiaircraft system was not engaged at the time of the attack 
the vincennes a sophisticated aegisclass cruiser was 
receiving confusing radio signals from the airbus making 
identification of the craft difficult at the same time the 
vincennes and another navy warship were engaging several iranian 
gunboats that had fired on one of the vincennes helicopters 
when the aircraft did not respond to several warnings from the 
vincennes navy officials said rogers ordered two missiles launched 
at the plane based on the information available the captain said 
he believed the plane to be an f14 
iranian authorities said 290 people were aboard there were no 
survivors 
in the 1987 attack on the stark a navy investigation found that 
the ship was never ready or capable of repelling an attack and 
recommended that brindel then a captain be courtmartialed 
instead the navy allowed brindel to retire at the rank of 
commander after he was given a letter of reprimand 
adm frank b kelso commanderinchief of the atlantic fleet 
said the decision not to follow the recommendation of investigators 
was based in part on the surprise nature of the attack and the 
heroic response of brindel and his crew in saving the ship 
brindel now sells real estate in virginia beach va

bergamasco 29 was charged with misdemeanor child abuse for 
taping a cardboard pig nose to the crying sevenyearold boys 
face tying his hands behind his back and placing him on the porch 
of their apartment building on june 28 with a sign reading 
im dumb pig sic ugly is what you will become everytime you 
lie and steal look at me squeel sic my hands are tied because i 
cannot be trusted this is a lesson to be learned look laugh

her son to understand for if only 30 minutes that lying and 
stealing make you ugly like pinocchio

was no need to tie him up she said 
bergamasco said in her statement that her mother had used the 
technique and also placed her childrens hands over hot stove

new one 
according to the agreement the annual purchases are supposed to 
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn the

armenian activists said wednesday that soviet army 
paratroopers fired on protesters trying to shut down yerevans 
airport and killed up to five people a soviet official denied 
there had been any clashes or deaths 
the rumors that an armenian were killed are groundless 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfilyev told a news conference 
but perfilyev and the activists agreed that some 2000 people 
had tried to shut down zvartnots airport and that troops quashed 
what the activists said was a political protest in the southern 
republic related to a simmering territorial dispute 
since february yerevan has been the scene of massive 
demonstrations by armenians demanding annexation of 
nagornokarabakh a mostly armenian region of neighboring 
azerbaijan until now the protests reportedly have been peaceful 
the communist party daily pravda said that during a tuesday 
rally in yerevans theater square someone began calling for a 
blockade of zvartnots airport and that a large column of people 
headed toward it on foot 
pravda said planes were allowed to land but that demonstrators 
grossly disrupted order and prevented them from taking off 
again hundreds of passengers were stranded it said 
the evening television news program vremya said 3000 people 
took part in the protest and that 60 flights were grounded along 
with 14000 passengers 
perfilyev told the tass news agency that more than 400 people 
swarmed into the airports terminal while another 1500 gathered 
outside 
he said the demonstrators impeded the sale of tickets and the 
collection of luggage ventured onto the landing strip stopped 
passengers from entering the terminal and paralyzed the work of 
the airport dispatcher 
for an hour internal security troops with bullhorns ordered the 
protesters to leave then intervened to evict them they were 
forced out but there were no clashes or fights perfilyev said 
protesters then began hurling rocks and bottles and 36 people 
had to seek medical assistance perfiliyev said 
the government daily izvestia said the demonstrators demanded 
that the airport staff shut down operations 
an intervention by the forces of order became necessary the 
paper said unfortunately in the clashes that ensued some 
violators of law and order suffered as well as several 
policemen it gave no further details 
armenian activists in moscow however said witnesses had 
telephoned them from yerevan to say that army troops carrying 
machine guns and backed by tanks had begun firing without warning 
on the protesters 
all of a sudden they started shooting artist kuryun g 
nagapetyan told about 50 people who gathered for an evening rally 
outside moscows redbrick armenian church they were carrying 
clubs like policemen in the west and they beat people right and 
left 
three students were killed when officers shot them with 
pistols nagapetyan said he said 37 other people reportedly were 
hospitalized 
alexei mananikov an editor of the unofficial moscow journal 
glasnost said khachik kazaryan 22 was killed in a confrontation 
between protesters and soldiers at the airport 
he said sources in yerevan told him that as many as 40 people 
had been wounded by soldiers trying to reopen the airport 
lev g gambaryan another armenian who lives in moscow told 
the rally that reports from yerevan on wednesday indicated two 
children age 6 and 10 had also died of gunshot wounds but he and 
nagapetyan said it was not certain whether the two reported deaths 
were new or among the three previously reported 
gambaryan said the soldiers numbered about 100 and were members 
of an elite parachute detachment from the regular army and not 
troops under the command of the interior ministry 
nagapetyan blamed provocateurs brought in from azerbaijan 
for launching the call to go to the airport he said armenians were 
swayed by them because they believed planes were ferrying in 
paratroopers tanks and machine guns to quash their protests 
ethnic armenians who predominate in nagornokarabakh demand 
that the mountainous region be taken away from azerbaijan and given 
to armenia armenia supports the demand but azerbaijan has 
rejected it and the issue has gone to officials in moscow 
in february rioting erupted in the azerbaijani city of sumgait 
officials say 32 people 26 armenians and six azerbaijanis were 
killed the area has been tense ever since with periodic 
widespread strikes 
at the news conference perfilyev said a man had been hurt as a 
result of hooliganism in the town of masis about six miles 
from yerevan and died after being hospitalized but this has 
nothing to do with events at the airport he said 
a general strike began in yerevan on monday following a large 
meeting the day before on the citys main square newspapers 
reported tuesday 
activists met sunday with delegates to the communist party 
conference that ended friday in moscow apparently dissatisfied 
with the armenian delegations presentation of the dispute over 
nagornokarabakh they called a strike 
vremya said hundreds of thousands of armenians thronged 
yerevans streets wednesday as a general strike begun monday 
continued 
izvestia said mass transit was still shut down and that the 
situation wednesday was worse than the previous day when 26 
factories and economic agencies in the caucasus republic were idled

democrat michael dukakis meeting with his fourth 
prospective running mate in three days interviewed indiana rep 
lee hamilton wednesday in what hamilton called a very relaxed 
session the congressman said hed accept if asked 
dukakis also met with civil rights leaders as part of his 
continuing effort to expand his support among blacks among 20 
national and local black leaders at the meeting were naacp 
executive director benjamin hooks national urban league president 
john jacob the rev joseph lowery of the southern christian 
leadership conference and coretta scott king the widow of martin 
luther king jr 
still later dukakis was to address the greek orthodox 
ecumenical congress which was holding its convention in boston 
the likely republican nominee vice president george bush was to 
address the same group on thursday 
hamilton was the eighth man interviewed by the allbutcertain 
democratic nominee as part of the search for a vice presidential 
running mate one of the eight georgia sen sam nunn has said he 
is not interested 
after a 50minute meeting with dukakis at the massachusetts 
statehouse hamilton fired back a quick yes when asked if he 
would accept the vice presidential nomination 
i would accept it first of all if he thinks i can be 
helpful the indiana democrat added 
hamilton said he had a very relaxed and wideranging 
discussion with dukakis with the main topics being the vice 
presidency and foreign policy 
others being considered for the no 2 spot on the ticket are 
jesse jackson sens albert gore of tennessee john glenn of ohio 
lloyd bentsen of texas and bob graham of florida and rep richard 
gephardt of missouri 
dukakis dined with jackson monday night and met with gore and 
gephardt on tuesday he interviewed the others in washington last 
week 
paul brountas dukakis campaign chairman was to remain in 
washington through friday gathering information on the contenders 
and talking with party leaders 
the meeting with the civil rights leaders was described by 
participants as upbeat and more substantive than a recent session 
the same group had with bush members of the black delegation said 
they were particularly pleased with dukakis pledge to make full 
employment a priority 
i cannot recall an issue he disagreed with us on hooks said 
whether blacks will support dukakis without jackson on the 
ticket is largely up to jackson hooks said i think that they 
basically will follow though some will be disappointed they 
will follow his leadership he said 
dukakis in addition to his political chores also had several 
meetings wednesday on staterelated business including his effort 
to balance the budget for the fiscal year that ended last week and 
to draft a balanced budget for the new fiscal year 
bush had a surrogate invade dukakis home turf wednesday to 
criticize a massachusetts furlough program that allowed the release 
of a firstdegree murderer who then escaped and raped a maryland 
woman 
but the surrogate pennsylvania sen arlen specter was ambushed 
by dukakis supporters including sen john f kerry the states 
current and former attorney general several county prosecutors and 
several police chiefs 
specter said bush was a tougher crimefighter than dukakis and 
said the governors support of the furlough program even after the 
maryland incident raises a question as to his overall judgment 
however kerry stepped in to defend dukakis and said bush has 
been a failure as the leader of the reagan administrations 
anticrime and antidrug efforts 
kerry dmass said the specter appearance in boston the day 
after attorney general edwin meese iii announced he was resigning 
was designed to hide the reality of what the justice department 
of ronald reagan and george bush has not done or what they have 
done

attorney general edwin meese iii says his 
legal fees for the first 7 months of an independent counsels 
investigation may run as high as 250000 an amount which the 
government may have to pay 
on his financial disclosure form for 1987 issued this week 
meese listed his legal fees to the washington law firm of miller 
cassidy larroca amp lewin as a liability in the range of 100000 to 
250000 two lawyers in the firm continue to represent meese who 
was under investigation from may 11 1987 until tuesday by 
independent counsel james mckay 
mckay ended his probe by filing an 830page report with the 
panel of federal appeals court judges which appointed him an act 
which signifies that meese wont be indicted meese announced 
tuesday that he was resigning effective later this summer 
under the ethics in government act meese may apply for federal 
payment of his legal fees and meese did so in a previous 
independent counsel investigation of his activities in 1984 the 
law provides for reimbursement of fees incurred by public officials 
who arent indicted in criminal investigations conducted by an 
independent counsel 
it is unclear whether meese has been making payments to his 
lawyers nathan lewin and james rocap 
rocap declined to discuss the financial arrangements in his and 
lewins representation of meese 
three years ago the appeals court judges awarded meese almost 
twothirds of the 720824 he sought to pay his legal bills in the 
investigation of his activities by independent counsel jacob stein 
who determined that meese had committed no indictable offenses 
while he was president reagans counselor 
of the 472190 award 357515 represented legal fees for 
services provided by leonard garment who is with the firm of 
dickstein shapiro amp morin 
a total of 37805 was awarded in expenses incurred by garments 
firm and 76870 was determined as the total of legal fees to be 
paid to the other lawyer in the case longtime meese friend e 
robert wallach wallach is now under indictment in the wedtech 
scandal and it was wallachs close ties to meese that triggered the 
latest independent counsel probe

the federal deposit insurance corp has struck 
out in its initial effort to sell nearly 1 billion in bad loans 
acquired in the largestever government bank bailout officials 
said wednesday 
steven seelig associate director of the fdics division of 
liquidation said a plan approved by the fdic board in february to 
publicly offer the loans from continental illinois corp in six 
large portfolios failed but he said efforts would begin 
immediately to sell the loans in smaller packages 
in the unprecedented bailout the fdic in 1984 pumped 45 
billion 35 billion of it borrowed from the federal reserve 
system into the chicagobased bank to prevent the failure of what 
was then the nations seventhlargest bank 
as part of the rescue the fdic which insures accounts in 
commercial banks up to 100000 took over many of continental 
illinois problem loans and acquired ownership of the banks stock 
it expects to recoup all but 17 billion of the bailout money by 
selling the loans and the stock 
seelig told the fdic board that the agency staff attempted to 
sell the last of the nonperforming loans originally worth 865 
million for a minimum of 299 million 
despite 274 expressions of interest seelig said the fdic found 
only 17 bidders financially qualified to buy the loans only five 
of those actually submitted bids all of which were too low 
the market for large complex troubled credit is thin and 
requires sophisticated buyers he said 
some of the potential buyers were looking to make a quick profit 
by buying the loans cheap and immediately reselling them rather 
than holding the loans and working on collections seelig said 
however he said the fivemonth effort to market the loans in 
large groups turned up investors who could buy smaller batches at 
the fdics asking price 
fdic chairman l william seidman noting a september 1989 
deadline for repayment of the federal reserves 35 billion loan 
said i hope you can move ahead with all deliberate speed

rep jim moody withdrew from the democratic 
primary for us senate on wednesday saying he could not compete 
against millionaire herbert kohl to be the successor to william 
proxmire who is retiring 
the deicison by moody who said he would seek reelection to his 
5th district seat angered some fellow democrats who had planned 
their political futures based on his senate candidacy 
former state democratic party chairman matthew j flynn said he 
would stay in the congressional race despite moodys decision at 
least four other democrats had entered the race but some said they 
might now reconsider 
moodys announcement came three days after a milwaukee journal 
poll showed him well behind former gov anthony earl and kohl in 
the race for the democratic nomination to be decided at a primary 
election sept 13 
the survey showed earl leading among likely voters with 31 
percent while kohl had 28 percent and moody 12 percent former 
deputy wisconsin attorney general edward r garvey also had 12 
percent while secretary of state douglas j la follette had 8 
percent 
money is now determining this senate race i was faced with 
the reality of wiping out my life savings and going deeply into 
debt and that would still not be enough moody said 
kohl who owns professional basketballs milwaukee bucks 
dismissed the notion that his wealth had forced moody from the 
race to say that people of wisconsin can be bought is something 
that ive never considered kohl said a messenger without a 
message cant win 
kohl heir to a supermarket fortune is a former state 
democratic chairman but has never held elective public office 
moody should have little difficulty getting the necessary 
signatures on petitions to qualify for a house candidacy by the 
july 12 deadline said campaign manager michael elconin

a small british television production firm said 
wednesday it is buying mtm the production company cofounded by 
actress mary tyler moore in what both described as a move to tune 
into each others markets 
the independent television south plc will pay 320 million for 
the us firm known for quality series such as st elsewhere 
and hill street blues which have large followings in europe 
although they are out of production 
tvs chief executive james gatward told reporters that mtm had 
a very long desire to come to europe i needed to create an 
entity in the states so we came together 
mtm founded in 1970 takes its name from miss moores initials 
im very excited about it i think its a great opportunity 
for mtm to grow especially in the european market miss moore 
told a news conference in beverly hills calif 
im thrilled with the kind of production tvs has given us in 
the past and i think its just a natural coupling of these two 
companies she said 
executives from both firms denied the purchase meant the end of 
mtm entertainment incs creative heyday saying the british firm 
wont interfere with mtms awardwinning style 
we dont look on this as an acquisition we see it as a 
merger bob klosterman financial vice president of the private 
los angelesbased mtm told the associated press after a news 
conference to announce the purchase 
they dont intend to come over and tell us how to do it no 
more than we intend to do the same he said 
tvs says it is britains fourthlargest independent company in 
terms of advertising revenue and fifthlargest in population 
reached however although it blankets southern england the most 
prosperous area of britain it is not among the top five companies 
that dictate commercial network schedules 
it says buying mtm will make it britains largest independent tv 
company 
tvs productions are aired by independent television and channel 
4 britains two national commercial channels the noncommercial 
british broadcasting corp runs the other two channels 
tvs said it will finance the deal by issuing 777 million in 
shares then raising 242 million in cash by offering 82 million 
in convertible preference shares and borrowing 65 million 
two french companies the canal and sa pay television firm 
and the generale dimages sa communications group will pay a 
total of 99 million for shares in return for a 10 percent stake 
each 
through the purchase tvs becomes tvs entertainment plc and 
gains mtms library of productions worth 310 million along with 
its us distribution network 
mtms pretax profits for the year ending in may were 43 
million up from 41 million the previous year 
klosterman said the purchase arose after mtm planned a share 
flotation last year to get our feet wet and then come into the 
foreign market but was withdrawn after the october crash 
gatward said tvs plans to coproduce one series a year such as 
a proposed project to be set in france starring british and 
american actors most programs will be produced separately he said

a federal appeals court on wednesday upheld 
the racketeering convictions of 10 members of a neonazi group for 
actions that included murdering a jewish talkshow host and 
stealing 4 million to finance a racist revolution 
by a 30 vote the 9th us circuit court of appeals rejected a 
variety of defense challenges to the convictions of members of a 
group called the order 
a federal jury in seattle found the members guilty in december 
1985 of racketeering and conspiracy charges in a campaign to 
overthrow the us government 
among the acts that made up the racketeering charge were the 
1984 machinegun slaying the next month of alan berg a denver 
radio host who had criticized racist groups and holdups of armored 
trucks that netted 535000 in seattle in april 1984 and 38 
million in ukiah calif in july 1984 
the groups founder robert mathews died in december 1984 when 
a flare fired by fbi agents during a gun battle set fire to his 
cottage in whidbey island wash members of the group were arrested 
over the next few months in 13 states 
the 10 convicted in seattle were sentenced to 40 years in prison 
for racketeering and conspiracy with additional years for other 
individual crimes twelve other members pleaded guilty 
in addition bruce pierce identified by authorities as mathews 
successor and fellow member david eden lane have been convicted in 
a colorado federal court on federal charges related to bergs 
murder 
in wednesdays ruling the court rejected arguments by pierce 
and lane that the inclusion of the murder allegations in the 
racketeering charges deprived them of their constitutional right to 
testify in their own defense because the testimony could be used 
against them in a possible future murder case in state court 
the two men were faced with the same difficult choice that 
is required of any defendant who might face a later related 
prosecution in state court said the opinion by judge charles 
wiggins he said their decision on whether to testify was not 
coerced by the government 
wiggins also said the consecutive 20year sentences for 
racketeering and conspiracy were within constitutional bounds 
given the enormity of the crime 
on another issue wiggins said the prosecutor acted improperly 
when he used a display board to write a summary of the evidence 
while questioning one defendant with the first letter of each 
word spelling out guilty but said the error was harmless in 
light of the overwhelming evidence in the case

us military leaders changed their minds and 
decided the downed iranian aircraft was a jetliner rather than an 
f14 fighter because an analysis of intelligence data showed an 
a300 airbus was in the water and no iranian warplanes were aloft at 
the time sources said wednesday 
immediately after the persian gulf incident which took place on 
sunday at 251 am edt iran claimed that the united states had 
shot down iran air flight 655 with 290 people aboard 
within hours the pentagon issued a statement saying that the 
uss vincennes reported it downed an iranian f14 aircraft 
that was approaching in a hostile manner after the vincennes and 
another american warship had fought off an attack by iranian 
gunboats 
as the rest of the world grappled to make sense of these 
conflicting assessments sunday morning the joint chiefs of staff 
assembled in the pentagon and sifted through the evidence 
intelligence data was coming in and it showed that there were 
no f14s operating in the area said one source who like others 
demanded anonymity 
the biggest piece of evidence was the wreckage of the airbus and 
efforts by iranian vessels aircraft and divers to recover the 
bodies according to public statements released since the incident 
and interviews with administration sources 
additionally us military officials determined that no iranian 
f14s had been operating in the area this led the pentagon to 
conclude that the downed aircraft was the airliner as claimed by 
iran 
this new conclusion was announced by the chairman of the joint 
chiefs adm william crowe who appeared at a hastily called 
pentagon news conference at 130 pm edt sunday crowe announced 
that the vincennes had indeed shot down a civilian airliner rather 
than an f14 fighter 
six investigators headed by rear adm william m fogarty 
arrived in the gulf on wednesday to interview the skipper of the 
vincennes capt will c rogers iii and plumb the electronic 
innards of the ships sophisticated aegis radar and tracking system 
much of the intelligence that led the pentagon and field 
commanders to determine that the plane was an airliner and not a 
fighter was not available to rogers when he fired two sm2 standard 
missiles at the iranian aircraft officials said 
the intelligence collected after the incident included radio 
signals from airplanes and ground stations plus a limited and not 
always reliable network of informers on the ground said one source 
this type of information takes a little time to decode and 
sift through and was not immediately available to rogers or 
other american commanders in the gulf said the source 
in the hours after the airliner went down that information was 
fed to the local commander of us forces in the gulf rear adm 
anthony less aboard his flagship the uss coronado which is based 
at bahrain in the gulf 
less was in radio contact with rogers aboard the vincennes and 
authorized him to fire the standards when the airbus was 20 miles 
away rogers waited until the plane was nine miles away officials 
said 
during the incident and afterward less was in radio contact 
with headquarters for american forces in the persian gulf the us 
central command at macdill air force base in tampa fla which in 
turn was in radio contact with the pentagon 
pentagon spokesman dan howard told reporters tuesday that the 
conclusion that the plane was an airliner was reached in concert 
communications were back and forth through centcom central 
command and it was reached in concert and conjunction with centcom 
and with the information we were receiving from the area 
the process of sifting through the information and determining 
exactly what happened will be the responsibility primarily of the 
investigating team headed by fogarty it is expected to complete 
its report in two or three weeks howard said

sales of the suzuki samurai plunged 706 percent 
in june from a year earlier the automaker said wednesday in its 
first sales report since consumers union charged that the vehicle 
tips over too easily 
american suzuki motor corp said it sold 2199 samurais in june 
down from 7479 in june 1987 
junes sales were the lowest since december 1985 the month 
after the cars us introduction sales had been running at more 
than 6000 a month from march through may 
the dramatic decline demonstrated the influence of consumers 
union as well as the impact of television news which showed clips 
of the samurai tipping over onto its outriggers in test runs 
suzuki said it was not surprised by the decline and expected 
sales to increase in coming months a spokesman said suzuki 
continued to express absolute confidence in the safety of the 
samurai 
asked for comment consumers union spokesman david berliner 
said if it is a reflection in any way of the public giving 
credence to our findings then i think that is a good sign 
consumers union the nonprofit publisher of consumer reports 
magazine based in mount vernon has said suzuki should recall the 
vehicle and give refunds to owners 
consumers union said june 2 that the samurai tends to roll over 
when the driver swerves to avoid an accident it gave the vehicle 
its first not acceptable rating in 10 years 
suzuki said consumers unions testing procedures biased and 
completely inaccurate 
suzuki is not at this time planning on withdrawing the 
samurai from the market in response to the poor june sales said 
rob cahn a representative of the companys public relations 
agency rogers amp associates he said that had been the companys 
position from the beginning 
the samurai passed the ordinary consumers union test it flunked 
only when the obstacle course was made more challenging 
the fourwheeldrive samurai has a high center of gravity a 
narrow tread width a short wheelbase and light weight consumers 
union said that combination made the vehicle inherently flawed but 
suzuki said the design was sound and cited statistics showing the 
samurai had a good safety record 
suzuki said almost any vehicle can be made to tip over but 
television highlights of the samurai test runs apparently unnerved 
many potential customers 
for the first six months of 1988 samurai sales were down to 
31221 from 42912 a year earlier according to american suzuki 
the brea califbased subsidiary of japans suzuki motor co ltd 
the boxy samurai became a bestseller almost immediately after 
its introduction in the united states in november 1985 taking some 
business away from larger and more expensive cousins such as the 
jeep wrangler jeep cherokee and isuzu trooper ii 
sales had already begun to slow down from their torrid 1987 pace 
earlier this year in part because of allegations by the center for 
auto safety about the samurais propensity to roll over

a coalition of women activists on wednesday 
said they will press the presidential candidates to appoint more 
women to executive positions in the new administration 
although not an echo of the 1984 clamor for a woman vice 
presidential candidate the coalition for womens appointments will 
conduct a bipartisan effort to recruit and recommend qualified 
women for presidential appointments said irene natividad 
chairwoman of the national womens political caucus 
too often men have voiced a wecantfindany syndrome 
said rep lynn martin rill cochairman of vice president george 
bushs presidential campaign 
she and other participants in a news conference said the goal of 
about 50 womens groups in the coalition is to counter that 
syndrome by making known the names and resumes of women who have 
qualifications for high government posts 
others who spoke at the news conference were rep barbara 
kennelly dconn representing the campaign of democrat michael 
dukakis eleanor holmes norton a key adviser in the campaign of 
jesse jackson who finished second to dukakis in the democratic 
primaries and barbara blum former environmental protection agency 
official under president carter 
the women spoke about the much touted gender gap showing 
that women increasingly have provided a margin of victory for 
democrats in key races and according to recent polls support 
bush in far fewer numbers than men 
were looking beyond the campaign to show the next 
administration that the gender gap does more than deliver votes 
its also bulging with talent said natividad 
natividad said the reagan years have seen a slowdown in 
appointments of women to key posts he appointed 54 during his 
first term two of them to cabinetlevel posts compared to 72 
appointed by president carter with four cabinet members 
this slowdown during the reagan administration has occurred 
despite continuing gains by women in both the private sector and in 
elective office on the state level the number of women 
appointed to high level positions nearly doubled between 1981 and 
1987 
the women noted the drumbeat for a woman running mate has been 
muted this year compared to 1984 when democrat walter mondale was 
nudged into choosing a woman running mate in part by the sheer 
fervor in favor of such a move 
martin said that the first woman elected president or vice 
president will have to be perfect or pretty doggone close 
because of the grilling she will undergo 
kennelly said many feminists agreed that a woman selected for 
vice president should have been a presidential candidate first 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo abandoned this years 
presidential race before formally entering it

white house pollster richard wirthlin said 
wednesday the resignation of attorney general edwin meese iii 
doesnt erase the sleaze factor for vice president george bush 
in the fall presidential campaign but makes it easier for him to 
deal with it 
during a luncheon session with reporters wirthlin said only 
about 3 percent of the voters he has surveyed cite ethics in 
government as the most important issue a figure that is no higher 
than a year earlier 
the issue that outstrips all others in importance in the minds 
of voters is drugs said the pollster 
there are now 21 percent who tag drugs as the single most 
important problem facing the nation he said no other issue was 
named by more than 10 percent of people interviewed 
i think bush is still going to have to address the sleaze 
factor said wirthlin when asked about the impact of meeses 
decision to leave the cabinet 
for months while meese was under investigation by independent 
counsel james mckay bush was peppered with questions about whether 
he thought the attorney general should resign bush aides at one 
point described meese as a liability a description the vice 
president disavowed 
wirthlin said the departure of meese would put the ethics issue 
in a different context and would enable bush to talk about 
ethics without implicitly criticizing ed meese 
for more than 20 years wirthlin has done polling for ronald 
reagan beginning when reagan was governor of california and 
continuing through three presidential campaigns 
during the 1988 primaries wirthlin polled for sen bob dole of 
kansas during his unsuccessful race against bush for the gop 
presidential nomination 
wirthlin said that democrat michael dukakis will have an 
opportunity to open a wide lead right after the democratic national 
convention in july and that the republicans should plan some kind 
of major event to gain attention 
he suggested the best bush tactic would be to name his running 
mate during the week following the democratic convention 
on the question of running mates wirthlin said sen john glenn 
of ohio would be far and away the best pick on the democratic 
side he said the picture wasnt clear on the republican side 
but he named dole and his wife elizabeth as bringing strength to 
the ticket as well as gov jim thompson of illinois and former gov 
richard thornburgh of pennsylvania 
wirthlin also said he thought it would be a mistake to have 
president reagan on the stump attacking dukakis 
people do not approve of an incumbent president attacking a 
candidate trying to succeed him he said 
in addition he said reagan is not a good attack candidate

the unanswered questions remaining about the 
iranian airbus destroyed by an american missile have given rise to 
some bizarre theories about the downing of the plane 
those television images of bloated bodies floating in the 
persian gulf fuel speculation but no answers 
on television the bodies appeared to be nude and to be so 
bloated as to suggest they were in the water for some time how 
come 
how did the iranians have a television camera in place to 
capture what iranian televisision said were shots of the plane at 
the moment it was hit to the viewer the plane was a mere dot on 
the screen and the pictures were too grainy to lead to that 
conclusion 
no american official has publicly suggested that irans 
revolutionary government deliberately sent civilians on iran air 
flight 655 to their death but terrorism expert robert kupperman 
said he had heard a few people in the pentagon advance such 
theories 
i dont give much credence to it personally said kupperman 
a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international 
studies a think tank i dont believe that anybody is going to 
be able to prove that this has been a setup 
neil c livingstone a conservative expert on terrorism said 
there are some real strange questions about the incident 
citing television footage provided by the iranians 
its very hard to explain why someone would be taking pictures 
of a plane flying in the gulf livingstone said 
dr charles ruehle the former commander of the armed forces 
institute of medical pathology said finding floating bloated 
bodies within a short time would not be unusual after a crash into 
warm salty water 
the gulfs sea surface temperature averages about 89 degress 
fahrenheit and the salinity is higher than in the atlantic ocean 
off the florida coast 
ruehle said he was puzzled by why the bodies appeared to be 
nude in my experience there has been nothing that would explain 
that he said 
the experts however all said there is not enough available 
information to evaluate exactly what happened 
gary sick a columbia university professor and a national 
security council aide under president carter said he began to hear 
people suggest within hours of sundays attack that the airbus 
had taunted the navy warship vincennes on purpose 
it is an easy explanation that takes the united states off the 
hook for having shot the plane down sick said at present the 
evidence does not justify that conclusion he said

britain on wednesday announced an agreement with 
iran to pay for damage to each others embassies in violent 
incidents but insisted it made no sordid deal to secure the 
release of britons held hostage in lebanon 
david mellor a junior minister at the foreign office also said 
britain was more than willing to improve its chilly elations 
with iran but added it has to be in relation to legitimate 
things 
what we are not prepared to do is get involved in any sort of 
sordid deal trading for hostages that sort of thing mellor 
said in a radio interview after the announcement 
but if they want to do business of the kind weve just 
concluded today then i think that is in everybodys interest 
we would like to have sensible relations with iran 
irans sole diplomat in london said the agreement was a 
technical matter 
we are following a principled position that we are accepting a 
kind of normal businesslike relationship charge daffaires 
mohammed basti told reporters 
britain seeks the release of three of its nationals believed 
held by proiranian islamic fundamentalists in beirut they are 
anglican church envoy terry waite journalist john mccarthy and 
teacher brian keenan keenan holds both british and irish 
nationality and the irish government also seeks his release 
the foreign office says it also seeks word on alec collett a 
new yorkbased british journalist whose palestinian abductors claim 
they killed him his body was never found 
they are among 18 foreign hostages held in beirut including 
nine americans longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was abducted march 16 
1985 
wednesdays agreement followed several weeks of negotiations 
that britain says iran initiated out of the blue on a 
compensation offer first made in 1984 
the agreement came just two days after basti protested to the 
foreign office about prime minister margaret thatchers refusal to 
condemn the us downing of an iranian passenger jet on sunday in 
the persian gulf 
the us navy said it mistook the civilian airbus a300 for an 
iranian f14 fighter all 290 people aboard the plane died

only japan among the worlds industrial powers 
bested the united states in reducing manufacturing labor costs in 
absolute terms last year the government said wednesday 
but measured in devalued us dollars labor costs in japan 
soared 135 percent campared with a 15 percent decline in the 
united states which had lower hourly increases in wages and 
benefits than any of its nine largest industrial competitors the 
labor department said 
our competitiveness visavis our foreign trading partners is 
definitely improving especially after taking into account the 
changes in exchange rates said allen sinai chief economist for 
the boston co a new york consulting house its a step in the 
right direction but we still have a long way to go 
us manufacturers held hourly wage and benefit increases last 
year to just 13 percent compared with boosts of 14 percent in 
japan 45 percent in candada 34 percent n france 4 percent in 
west germany and 82 percent in great britain 
but japan improved its manufacturing productivity its 
efficiency in churning out goods by 41 percent last year 
compared with a 28 percent improvement in the united states the 
departments bureau of labor statistics said 
the higher japanese productivity improvements combined with 
relatively the same wage gains as in the united states reduced 
japanese labor costs for each product 25 percent compared to the 
15 percent decline in us labor costs 
france was the only other nation to reduce those labor costs in 
absolute terms by 02 percent unit labor costs all climbed in 
canada korea denmark west germany italy norway sweeden and 
great britain 
but after taking into account the 48 percent to 205 percent 
increase in the value of foreign currencies agains the dollar the 
contrast in labor costs between the united states and its 
competitors was much more dramatic 
adjusted for the sharp 1987 appreciations in foreign currency 
values relative to the us dollar japanese and european labor 
costs rose about 13 percent to 25 percent the labor department 
said 
measured in dollars labor costs rose 77 percent in canada 75 
percent in korea 274 percent in denmark 149 percent in france 
239 percent in west germany 18 percent in italy 19 percent in 
norway 17 percent in sweeden and 13 percent in great britain 
thanks to our rising currency many countries had to reduce 
their output as a response to the tremendous rebound in our 
manufacturing last year said sinai 
but the decline in the industrial sectors of japan great 
britain and west germany has bottomed out and so has the dollar 
this year will not be a repeat of last he warned 
the labor department figures in fact showed that manufacturing 
growth last year was slower in the united states than in canada 
korea italy and great britain 
us productivity improvements also were smaller than 4 percent 
gains of japan france and italy 7 percent increase in great 
britain and nearly 8 percent improvement in norway 
while five of the nine countries had larger 1987 productivity 
increases than the united states only great britain and norway 
exceeded the us rate of improvement over the past two years the 
bls said 
however only the united states and canada experienced any 
employment growth in manufacturing last year the us increase was 
only onehalf of 1 percent but it reversed two straight years of 
declines 
factory jobs remained abut the same in germany and sweeden and 
fell by 1 percent to 25 percent in the other countries 
for france 1987 was the 13th consecutive year of manufacturing 
employment declines and in great britain factory jobs have been 
falling in number for the past 10 years

the us downing of an iranian passenger plane 
last sunday seems certain to set back tentative efforts by the two 
countries to have a more normal relationship according to us 
officials and independent experts 
robin wright an associate at the carnegie endowment of 
international peace who recently visited iran said in an interview 
wednesday that iran wants an opening to the west because of 
economic hardship brought on by the prolonged war against iraq as 
well as declining oil prices 
iran clearly needs to open the door again wright said 
adding that after irans recent normalization of relations with 
france britain is going to be next and then canada 
she said that before last sundays incident iranian officials 
sounded hopeful about the possibility of an eventual accommodation 
with the united states 
secretary of state george p shultz said earlier this week that 
before the airliner was shot down iranian officials had sent 
messages through third parties indicating a desire to open a direct 
dialogue with the united states 
but shultz said it is not clear whether the messages were sent 
by officials in positions of authority 
us officials believe that the iranian government may be 
divided on the question of improved relations with a some 
supporting irans antius interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
and others rallying behind more moderate elements 
state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
wednesday the united states is willing to open an authoritative 
dialogue with iran but us efforts to explore this possibility 
have not borne fruit 
this has been a longstanding us position but received little 
attention until the us navy warship vincennes shot down the 
iranian passenger plane killing all 290 persons aboard 
in any case mrs oakley said there can be no normal 
relationship with iran so long as the iraniraq war does not end 
american hostages continue to be held by proiranian militants in 
lebanon and iran does not halt what she described as international 
terrorist activities for its part iran has called sundays 
incident coldblooded murder and an act of international 
terrorism by the united states 
wright said that military incidents have repeatedly thwarted 
fledgling efforts by the united states and iran to improve 
relations 
as an example she said that iranian officials told her that 
president carter in the spring of 1980 expressed a willingness to 
recognize irans 1979 islamic revolution but shortly thereafter 
approved a military mission to rescue the american hostages in 
tehran the mission ended in failure 
there have been reports that administration officials believed 
that iran might attempt to take advantage of the current us 
presidential campaign to advance its diplomatic goals 
the wall street journal reported on june 10 that robert oakley 
the national security councils middle east expert had written an 
internal memo warning of that possibility 
the article said that oakley was concerned that iran might try 
to entice vice president george bush the presumed republican 
candidate into a deal involving the release of nine american 
hostages in return for a less hostile stance toward iran 
there also has been speculation that iran may be attempting to 
spread word of its interest in improved ties with the united states 
as a means of shaking the confidence of iraq and its arab allies in 
the gulf 
one of the prime purposes of the us military deployment in the 
gulf is to provide reassurance to irans neighbors many of which 
look upon iran as an expansionist power

gov robert casey instructed state officials 
wednesday to seek maximum civil penalties and consider criminal 
charges against ashland oil inc for a jan 2 fuel tank collapse 
that polluted two major rivers in three states 
the governor following the recommendations of a task force 
report that he released at a news conference told the department 
of environmental resources to seek maximum civil damages against 
ashland he declined to say how much the damages might total 
casey also asked the state attorney general to consider criminal 
charges against the company but said he would not recommend filing 
charges against individuals 
in us district court meanwhile ashland promised in a consent 
decree to pay 680000 in federal cleanup expenses and to clean 
contaminated soil and ground water at its floreffe terminal south 
of pittsburgh 
the us environmental protection agency which joined in the 
consent decree reserved the right to sue ashland separately for 
damages an epa spokesman in philadelphia declined to say if the 
agency would sue 
keith welks chief counsel of the state der and head of the 
governors task force said ashland and its subcontractors 
displayed a pervasive pattern of neglect at virtually every 
step in taking down an old steelwalled vessel at its whiskey 
island terminal near cleveland and reconstructing it in floreffe 
among other things welks said the company failed to test the 
toughness of the 40yearold steel used in the tank did not xray 
enough welds on the reconstructed tank or repair defective welds 
found and did not test the reconstructed tank with water first 
a critical dimesized flaw in the steel located near a weld 
probably would have been discovered had ashland acted properly 
welks said 
in general we found that there was a failure of leadership by 
ashland he said employees did not know what each others 
responsibilities were they did not know what their own 
responsibilities were 
ashland officials said the state report largely duplicates its 
own study 
in a statement from its headquarters in ashland ky the 
company expressed disappointment with the governors decision and 
said ashland has paid 85 million so far in company and government 
expenses and in damages to individuals and businesses 
weve been as open as we possibly can be said ashland 
spokesman roger schrum 
casey asked the state legislature for power to regulate 
aboveand belowground fuel tanks 
voluntary industry standards do not adequately protect the 
public he said 
the governor also urged the state senate to remove from pending 
toxic waste cleanup legislation what he called crippling 
antipeople propolluter amendments that would exempt fuel tanks 
from coverage 
the aboveground tank at floreffe burst minutes after the 
company filled it with 39 million gallons of no 2 fuel oil for 
the first time since its reconstruction the report said the state 
accepted previous findings that blamed the collapse on the flaw in 
the metal cold weather and the pressure of the fuel oil 
the collapse spilled an estimated 511000 gallons into the 
monongahela river cutting off water service to 20000 pittsburgh 
residents for a week 
about 1 million other pittsburgh residents were ordered to 
conserve water until the oil passed their municipal water intakes 
water supplies were affected similarly in ohio and west virginia 
along the ohio river which joins the monongahela at pittsburgh

republican george bush promised he would name a 
hispanicamerican to his cabinet wednesday as he sought minority 
votes in texas democrat michael dukakis searched for a running 
mate and dealt with state budget deficits and other homefront 
headaches 
bush also declared he would not apologize to iran for the 
shooting down of a jumbo jet with 290 people aboard 
we probably ought to do what we did which is to officially 
express regret which i guess should happen when you have the loss 
of innocent life the vice president told reporters 
dukakis two weeks away from the democratic presidential 
nomination continued to check out vice presidential prospects he 
interviewed rep lee hamilton of indiana a respected but 
littleknown congressman who was chairman of the house committee 
that led the irancontra investigation 
hamilton the eighth man dukakis has interviewed in his search 
said he would accept the no 2 spot if offered 
dukakis senior aide paul brountas was in washington through 
friday researching the contenders and talking to party leaders 
fueling speculation that a decision on a running mate would not 
come until next week dukakis is to be in washington next wednesday 
for more meetings 
while attention focused on his search for a running mate the 
massachusetts governor was plagued with an increasingly frustrating 
budget dilemma and a new poll showing his popularity dropping at 
home 
the state governments new fiscal year began last friday and 
dukakis has yet to close a 450 million deficit for fiscal 1988 or 
to sign a budget for the new year he asked the legislature for 81 
million in emergency spending authority to cover state payroll and 
welfare checks 
a poll last week for wbztv and the boston herald found dukakis 
leading bush in the state by 14 percentage points but it also 
found 56 percent saying dukakis has not been an effective governor 
while campaigning for president and 47 percent saying he should 
resign after the convention to devote his full time to the race 
the poll a survey of 400 massachusetts voters conducted last 
week by telephone found dukakis unfavorable rating has more than 
doubled to 36 percent from 17 percent since january 1987 
dukakis has already signed a new 40 million tax on cigarettes 
and more than 200 million in other new taxes are moving toward his 
desk 
bush preceding dukakis by a day before a major hispanic group 
in dallas made the promise to name a hispanicamerican to his 
cabinet calling it a pledge that i have never made before to 
anyone to any group 
but he refused to make the same commitment to blacks women or 
other groups other groups have been represented in the cabinet 
and hispanics have not im addressing myself to righting a 
wrong that has been out there for many years he said 
it is time it is time and its long overdue and that is a 
solemn pledge bush said 
bush addressed the annual convention of the league of united 
latin american citizens or lulac an umbrella organization of 
hispanic groups 
dukakis will speak to the group thursday night at the first stop 
on a swing that will take him to five western states he planned 
appearances with one of his potential vice presidential candidates 
texas sen lloyd bentsen in texarkana and with a former 
presidential candidate former gov bruce babbitt in arizona 
bush talking to reporters aboard air force ii on the way to 
texas said it was too early to decide whether the united states 
should pay compensation to the families of passengers killed in 
sundays shooting down of an iranian civilian jetliner 
he said i wouldnt because of the facts offer an apology 
to the iranians even though president reagan agreed that his own 
statement of regret amounted to an apology 
jesse jackson still technically a presidential candidate 
although dukakis nomination is assured renewed his call for more 
money to battle drugs while at an appearance in new york he 
stopped at a harlem center providing treatment for infants born 
addicted to heroin or other drugs 
jackson renewed his call for the united states to pay 
compensation to the iranian airliner victims and said there should 
be a period of mourning showing sincere and clear and 
unequivocal regret 
dukakis in boston met with civil rights leaders including 
naacp executive director benjamin hooks and coretta scott king 
widow of martin luther king jr 
i cannot recall an issue he disagreed with us on hooks said 
dukakis also was addressing the greek orthodox ecumenical 
congress which was holding its convention in boston dukakis is a 
member of the greek orthodox church bush was planning to address 
the group on thursday 
a surrogate campaigner for bush sen arlen specter rpa held 
a news conference at the statehouse in boston to attack dukakis on 
his home turf he criticized as indefensible a massachusetts 
furlough program later amended that allowed the release of a 
firstdegree murderer who escaped and raped a maryland woman 
but specter was upstaged by local supporters of dukakis 
including sen john kerry of massachusetts who stepped in to 
defend dukakis at the news conference and to say bush had been a 
failure in leading the reagan administrations antidrug efforts

the soviet military chief of staff beginning 
an unprecedented tour of us military bases said wednesday he 
didnt see any similarity between the downing of an iranian 
airliner last weekend and that of a korean airliner by soviet 
forces in 1983 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev told a pentagon news conference 
that he had discussed the incident with his us counterpart and 
host adm william crowe but had refrained from offering any 
advice 
yesterday adm crowe informed me about that and he told me 
about the specifics and we took some time discussing this said 
akhromeyev speaking in russian i and adm crowe are military 
professionals and i did not see fit to offer any military advice 
i would not draw any similarities between the iranian airliner 
a few days ago and the downing of a korean airliner a few years 
ago said akhromeyev 
asked to explain the differences between the two incidents 
akhromeyev smiled and said i believe you would be more interested 
in the subjects we are discussing today as part of the continuing 
dialogue between us and soviet armed forces 
crowe and others in the briefing room laughed as akhromeyev 
ducked the question and the american admiral said a few minutes 
later that he was looking forward to facing the soviet press 
when he accepts the soviet marshals invitation to visit moscow at 
a later date 
crowe at a grim news conference sunday announcing that an us 
warship had shot down iran air flight 655 with 290 people aboard 
said there were fundamental differences between it and the 
downing of korean air lines flight 007 on sept 1 1983 
the key distinction said crowe was that the americans fired on 
the iranian jetliner in an area of combat while the soviets shot 
down kal 007 in an area free of hostilities 
the fundamental differences of course are that it was not a 
war zone crowe said of the kal incident there was not combat 
in progress there was not combat there normally over the soviet 
kamchatka penninsula where kal 007 was tracked by soviet fighters 
and shot down 
during their talks tuesday and wednesday said akhromeyev he 
and crowe agreed upon military exchanges in 1988 and 1989 
including visits by us and soviet warships to ports in the 
others country and exchanges of military historians senior 
officers and delegations 
the details remain to be worked out but he mentioned as a 
possible port of call for us ships leningrad the baltic sea city 
that is headquarters for the soviet fleet 
akhromeyev also declined to spell out how the soviets were 
changing their force structure as part of a new military policy 
they are advertising as a doctrine of reasonable sufficiency 
which is supposed to be purely defensive 
defense secretary frank c carlucci has expressed skepticism 
about the new doctrine following extensive conversations about it 
with his soviet counterpart defense minister gen dmitri yazov 
carlucci and yazov met in switzerland last march again in moscow 
during the summit last month and are to meet again in moscow in 
early august 
akhromeyev said he hoped to give convincing evidence about the 
new doctrine on july 11 at a news conference at the close of his 
visit to the united states 
akhromeyev brushed aside speculation that the soviets might make 
unilateral cuts in areas where they enjoy a significant edge such 
as tanks 
why should we do that unilaterally we will discuss the 
question in greater detail with adm crowe later on during the 
visit said akhromeyev 
the soviets have been pushing for an exchange of data as the 
first step toward bilateral talks aimed at reducing conventional 
forces in europe 
but the us side has said that such reductions can only be made 
in negotiations which include all the members of the north atlantic 
treaty organization the warsaw pact and expected to begin late 
this year or in early 1989 
akhromeyev will visit several us military installations during 
his tour becoming the top ranking soviet officer to do so at 
least since the two nations were allies during world war ii said 
crowe

fighting flared between palestinian 
guerrillas in beiruts bourj elbarajneh refugee camp wednesday 
after the collapse of algeriansponsored negotiations to end the 
nineweekold bloodletting 
police said loyalists of plo chief yasser arafat traded mortar 
and rocket fire with syrianbacked rivals of col saeed mousas 
fatahuprising breakaway faction after three algerian envoys left 
the camp 
two people were killed and 11 were wounded in the exchanges 
police said bringing the overall toll to 160 killed and 629 
wounded since fighting broke out on may 1 for control of bourj 
elbarajneh and the nearby chatilla camp 
chatilla fell to fatahuprising guerrillas june 27 leaving 
bourj elbarajneh as the palestine liberation organizations last 
stronghold in the lebanese capital 
the algerians would not say why the talks failed but a police 
spokesman later explained that the dissidents insisted on 
withdrawal of arafats followers from the shantytown 
the policeman who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
algerians were working on a formula for peaceful coexistence 
between the two sides 
the negotiations had included syrian army officers 
representatives from the two warring factions and other palestinian 
and leftist lebanese groups mohammed taher a member of algerias 
ruling national liberation front led the algerians 
taher told the dissidents before he and his team withdrew that 
algeria will not sponsor the evacuation of palestinians from 
anywhere the police spokesman reported algeria is a leading 
arab supporter of the palestinian cause and the plo 
neutral plo factions also sided with the algerians 
the police spokesman had said earlier that the mediators were 
discussing withdrawal of the remaining 100 guerrillas of arafats 
mainstream fatah faction from bourj elbarajneh to south lebanon 
where the plo has bases 
mousa broke with the plo in 1983 
fatah officials said mousas gunners wrecked 80 percent of bourj 
elbarajneh in the past two months only 3000 of the camps 20000 
residents remain inside 
the loss of chatilla and the weakened defensive position in 
bourj elbarajneh are setbacks for arafat who has been trying to 
rebuild his lebanese power base since he was forced out of beirut 
when israel invaded in 1982 
a fatah official in bourj elbarajneh who also spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the fatah guerrillas have accepted 
the evacuation idea in principle but are demanding guarantees that 
they will not be attacked when they leave the camp 
he said about 150 fatah fighters have left the camp peacefully 
since the latest bout of fighting erupted monday 
a fatahuprising official known as abufadi hammad said arafats 
men would only be allowed to evacuate after they hand over their 
weapons 
the algerians were to guarantee the safe conduct for arafats 
withdrawing fighters fatah also asked that other plo factions not 
involved in the battles escort the guerrillas on the 25mile trip 
south to the lebanese port city of sidon 
mousas forces have prevented libyan mediators who played a 
key role in evacuating arafats men from chatilla after it fell 
from continuing their efforts the fatah official said he said the 
dissidents have banned 26 libyan military observers from entering 
bourj elbarajneh in the past few days 
libya has become one of arafats main allies and its leader 
col moammar gadhafi has been trying to reconcile the plo chief 
with syrian president hafez assad 
assad and arafat met in damascus in april and again in algiers 
in june but they have failed to patch up their bloody fiveyear 
feud over who would control the palestinian guerrilla movement 
the interpalestinian war has capped six years of assaults on 
the camps the israelis devastated the shantytowns during the 1982 
invasion in september 1982 israelibacked christian militiamen 
massacred hundreds of refugees in chatilla and sabra the smallest 
of the three beirut camps 
sabra then was demolished in a crackdown by syrianbacked shiite 
moslems 
thousands more were killed in three years of fighting between 
the guerrillas in the camps and syrianbacked shiite moslem 
militias that ended earlier this year

sentenced to death wednesday in the 1986 hijacking of a pan am 
jetliner that left 21 people dead including an indianamerican a 
local government official said 
judge mohammad zafar barbar sentenced the defendants in a 
makeshift courtroom in a prison in this town 30 miles west of 
islamabad he blamed lax airport security in part for the 
hijacking in which four of the palestinians entered the plane 
dressed as security guards 
the boeing 747 on a stopover between bombay india and new 
york was seized on the ground sept 5 1986 in pakistans 
southern port of karachi with 400 people aboard including 44 
americans 
it sat on the tarmac for 17 hours before the palestinians 
fearing an attack when an onboard generator ran out sprayed the 
cabin with bullets and pakistani troops stormed the plane 
the defendants contended they were innocent in the murders and 
blamed pakistani commandos for the killings two hundred others 
were injured 
we dont care about the sentence said mohammad hafiz turk 
32 the only one of the five who was not on the hijacked plane he 
was sentenced to hang for his part in planning the hijacking we 
care only about the millions of arabs and islamic countries 
the other four mohammad ahmed munawar khalil hussain rahayyal 
and saeed abdul rahim of lebanon and abdul latif sairfani of syria 
were sentenced to hang for their role in the hijacking they also 
were sentenced to 10 consecutive life sentences or 250 years in 
prison for the deaths of 10 of the 21 passengers three of the four 
men received an additional life sentence in an 11th death that of 
the indianamerican 
the four men ranging in age from 1824 also were fined nearly 
2800 in each murder conviction half the money will be given to 
relatives of the hijack victims 
in washington the state department welcomed the convictions 
the pakistan court decision is an important action in bringing 
the rule of law to bear against terrorists said a statement read 
by spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
the five said they will appeal their convictions and sentences 
within the 30day deadline 
libya and the palestine liberation organization both denied any 
involvement in the hijacking 
in an interview following the sentencing turk ringleader of 
the group said if free we would hijack another plane 
pan am was targeted because it is a us carrier he said 
by using pan american it was a strike against america turk 
said 
but he explained we are friends to american people we are 
against the administration and the crazy man in new york or 
washington wherever he is he was referring to president reagan 
during sentencing barbar said security at the airport 
seemed to be extremely lax the judge questioned how the four men 
dressed as security guards could board the pan am flight weighed 
down with weapons and ammunition 
the hijackers he said were able to collect huge caches of 
ammunition unnoticed and unhindered 
as a result of the sentencings authorities tightened security in 
karachi 
the karachi administration along with the airport authorities 
have increased the security staff at the karachi airport pan am 
office and the united states consulate said commissioner shahid 
aziz siddiqui 
more armed police are posted around the american cultural 
center and we are more vigilant of arab students living in 
karachi he said

blind people face harassment humiliation and 
possible arrest on airplanes and proposed federal rules may fail 
to protect them against discrimination the executive director of 
the national federation of the blind said wednesday 
kenneth jernigan told more than 2500 people attending the 
annual meeting of the federation that proposed us department of 
transportation regulations would allow the federal aviation 
administration to treat blind people differently from other 
passengers 
each airline has its own rules about where blind and other 
disabled passengers should sit how they should board and whether 
they can keep their guide dogs and canes with them 
today the situation is such that no blind person anywhere in 
the country can board a plane without fear of harassment public 
humiliation and possibly arrest and bodily injury jernigan said 
the transportation department last week published nine proposed 
rules to govern all airlines policies said matthew scocozza 
assistant transportation secretary for policy 
the federation has long argued that a policy held by many 
airlines that restricts blind passengers from sitting in emergency 
exit rows is discriminatory 
scocozza said in a speech to the convention that he agreed with 
the federations position that many blind people are capable of 
sitting in an exit row and handling an emergency situation 
under one of the proposed rules no passenger could be required 
to sit in a certain area of the plane except where required by 
an faa safety rule scocozza told a predominantly blind audience 
of more than a thousand 
jernigan suggested the proposed rule may fail to stop the 
humiliations some members of his federation have experienced on 
airlines 
but scocozza said if nothing else its the rule a start 
thats 30 years too late 
in april james gashel an officer of the federation was taken 
into custody on a charge of criminal trespass after he refused to 
leave his seat in an emergency exit row of a united airlines flight 
united spokesman joe hopkins said wednesday that the airline has 
a policy against seating blind passengers in an exit row because in 
an emergency a blind person could not assess the situation on the 
other side of the door as well as a sighted person could 
lets say theres a fire on the other side a blind person 
wouldnt be able to see that hopkins said 
scocozza said the proposed regulations also would 
allow airlines to refuse service only upon a showing that a 
patron couldnt be carried safely 
bar singleflight limits on the number of disabled passengers 
bar requirements for disabled people to travel with an 
attendant 
bar requirements of advance notice for flights by the 
handicapped unless special equipment is needed 
allow guide dogs to travel with their masters instead of in 
baggage holds 
allow the disabled to reject services they dont want such as 
preboarding and safety explanations in braille 
scocozza estimated the overall cost to the airlines of 
implementing the rules at 750 million 
he said the rules were open for comment and could be implemented 
by the end of the year

american investigators began their 
inquiry wednesday into the shooting down of an iranian airliner by 
questioning senior officers of the cruiser that fired the fatal 
missiles us sources said 
the sixmember military team of experts arrived from the united 
states late tuesday and began their confidential task under a 
15day deadline which us officers said could be extended 
leading the group is rear adm william m fogarty a senior 
staff officer at us central command headquarters in tampa fla 
it includes a lawyer and technical experts who will analyze 
computer tapes communications records and other data that could 
explain the tragedy 
iran says the uss vincennes a billiondollar aegis cruiser with 
computerized radar and weapons systems intentionally shot down the 
iran air airbus a300 over the strait of hormuz on sunday all 290 
people aboard were killed 
it has accused the united states of premeditated mass murder and 
pledged revenge in the same bloodspattered skies over the 
persian gulf where iran and iraq have been at war since september 
1980 
the united states says the vincennes fired because signals sent 
by one of two airliners transponders were were analyzed in its 
combat information center as being from an f14 fighter on an 
attack bearing 
iranians shouting death to america and waving banners 
vowing revenge held funerals wednesday for 24 of the victims at 
bandar abbas where the flight originated and in zahedan 
javier perez de cuellar un secretarygeneral spent an hour 
in geneva with mohammed javad larijani deputy foreign minister of 
iran neither side would comment about the meeting 
in new york the united nations announced wednesday that the 
security council will convene on the issue july 12 at irans 
request it said the montrealbased international civil aviation 
organization will meet the following day on irans demand for an 
inquiry american officials said the united states would cooperate 
with an investigation by the un agency 
us military sources said the teams first order of business 
was to interview capt will c rogers iii skipper of the 
vincennes and other officers who were present as he watched the 
crisis develop on a huge blue video screen and gave the order to 
shoot 
american officials said earlier the officers would be under 
oath they said the investigators mandate does not exclude 
recommending disciplinary action if there appears to be grounds for 
it 
navy officials would not divulge the whereabouts of the 
9600ton cruiser but one said privately it was a reasonable 
assumption the vincennes had anchored off bahrain overnight if 
so it was far enough out to be invisible from shore through the 
haze 
all aspects of the investigation will remain secret while it is 
in progress us officials said 
fogarty who once commanded the battleship new jersey is 
director of plans and policy for the central command 
administrative headquarters for us military affairs in 19 
countries of the middle east and north africa 
his team was met in bahrain by rear adm anthony a less 
commander of the us joint task force middle east which includes 
the approximately 29 us warships opeating in the gulf and arabian 
sea 
a senior us officer speaking on condition of anonymity said 
it was highly doubtful investigators would be able to talk to 
iranian officials 
an unanswered question is why the airbus was not diverted from 
the area of a skirmish involving the vincennes the frigate elmer 
montgomery and several armed iranian speedboats 
initially the us navy report said two speedboats were sunk a 
third was damaged and the vincennes shot down an iranian f14 
fighter the plane later proved to be the iran air jet which was 
on a scheduled flight to dubai from a combined militarycivilian 
airport at bandar abbas 
the battle was the first direct encounter between us warships 
and iranian armed craft since april 18 when us attacks on two 
iranian oil platforms in reprisal for the mining of a navy frigate 
started a day of combat in which six iranian craft were sunk or 
disabled 
one theory in gulf diplomatic and aviation circles is that an 
iranian f14 was using the airbus as radar cover to approach 
the american ships 
a us official also speaking privately said he had no 
evidence for the speculation which is expected to be among 
questions the us investigators will try to resolve 
in washington rep les aspin dwis said pentagon officials 
were examining the possibility of a second plane but a navy 
spokesman lt brian cullin said we do not believe there was 
another aircraft in the area 
aspin chairman of the house armed services committee said 
defense department officials told a closed briefing a wide range 
of possibilities was under study including the possibility of 
a military plane that was somehow masked by the airliner

caribbean leaders were preparing a 
letter to president reagan on wednesday accusing his administration 
of impinging on the sovereignty of other nations in antidrug 
campaign in order to attract votes in an election year 
a draft letter protesting us drug policy in the caribbean was 
circulated among leaders of 13 member nations of the carribean 
common market and commmunity or caricom holding a fiveday annual 
summit meeting in st johns 
lester bird deputy prime minister of antigua and barbuda 
acting as spokesman for the group said a second draft of the 
letter accused the united states of derogation of the caribbean 
nations laws 
they feel that the domestic imperatives of an election year in 
america have forced certain people in certain parts of the american 
process to step beyond what is acceptable in terms of the 
sovereignty of a country bird said after the closeddoor morning 
session he gave no specific examples 
the us attempt to stop the flow of drugs into the united 
states through the caribbean has become a key issue at the summit 
at opening ceremonies monday prime minister lynden pindling of 
the bahamas denounced the united states for what he called 
politically motivated intervention in certain countries he 
suggested he was made a scapegoat for failing to stop drugs 
from reaching the united states through his archipelago of more 
than 700 islands 
for years pindling has been the target of allegations that he 
personally benefited from the drug trade 
on tuesday the leaders unanimously agreed to condemn the united 
states for what they considered interference in their countries and 
in panama the reagan administration sought the ouster of panamas 
de facto ruler gen manuel antonio noriega after his indictment 
in florida on federal drug charges 
bird said wednesday the prime ministers stance was not meant to 
protect any one government although it might have the spinoff 
effect of doing so 
he said caribbean leaders condemn the drug trade and in many 
cases are working directly with us drug enforcement authorities 
but cooperation should not be abused by interfering with their 
rights to run their own affairs 
there are agreements which lay out the procedure in which 
working closely can be achieved without affecting the integrity of 
your own institutions he said thats the issue thats at 
point here the whole question of extraterritorial jurisdiction

position on the haitian government of lt gen henri namphy who

talks between japan and the united states have 
focused on balancing trade between the countries but havent 
ignored the fact that japan has built its technological edge on the 
foundations of western science 
under a pact signed last month by president reagan and prime 
minister noboru takeshita japan will donate 4 million to invite 
us scientists and engineers to the country open research 
laboratories to americans and boost the number of foreign 
researchers invited on scholarships from 28 to 200 
washington long has demanded more funding and a commitment to 
balance the flow of researchers and information getting tough as 
critics especially us industry call for an end to what they say 
has been japans free ride 
the japan center at the university of north carolina estimates 
that 15000 japanese students and researchers enter us 
institutions a year five times the number of americans coming to 
japan 
japan earned 22 billion from foreigners in fiscal 1986 on its 
patent licenses and other technology information while it paid 
24 billion over 80 percent of that to the united states 
hiroshi inose head of the national center for science 
information system discounts tokyos latest moves 
its a big step but its still symbolic said inose 
developer of the governments fifthgeneration computer research 
project and one expert consulted by the government over the 
bilateral science pact 
we should establish a sort of system of substantial scale in 
terms of money or university chairs and positions and let this be 
understood by the americans and the europeans inose said they 
will decide whether they want to come over 
leading japanese scientists many of whom have studied or worked 
in america agree that the time has arrived for japan to repay its 
debt 
my generation has all gone to the united states to study 
japan just preaches about international cooperation but it really 
has to start putting out more funds like the us government 
which has spent so much over the years tokyo university 
professor shoji tanaka one of the worlds leading 
superconductivity researchers said in an interview 
inose who invented the digital telephone switch as a researcher 
at the university of pennsylvania and bell telephone in the late 
1950s agrees 
i have repeatedly told the government that the united states 
has spent a great deal to invite japanese scientists and engineers 
on fulbright scholarships i dont think we ever reciprocated for 
that 
the usjapan agreement on cooperation in science and 
technology was first signed in 1980 to promote basic research in 
nonenergy areas it was renewed five times since 1985 and after 
10 months of negotiations ending in june officials agreed to a new 
pact effective from 1988 to 1993 
the largely symbolic agreement was not controversial until 
tensions mounted over japans trade surplus when fullscale talks 
to renew the pact began last year the united states surprised 
japan by laying down a list of stringent rules to balance bilateral 
cooperation 
in 11thhour talks in june us negotiators won a major 
concession when japan agreed to restrict the publication of joint 
technology with possible military application and to restrict the 
transfer of such information 
technological exports include information and licenses on old 
and new technology such as submarinesilencing equipment toshiba 
machine co sold to the soviet union in violation of a western 
block trade agreement 
no provisions exist under japanese law to prevent the 
dissemination of scientific and technological information developed 
for peaceful purposes but officials say they can adhere to the 
pact because both sides have agreed to distribute the results of 
their joint research as widely as possible 
in tokyo however the feeling pervades that japan is being 
forced to comply with a pact of benefit only to washington to us 
in japan it appears we are under the pressure of the us 
government inose said 
japanese officials point to a number of problems overlooked by 
washington 
nagahide onozawa will oversee 100 of the foreign researchers 
under the jurisdiction of the governmental japan society for the 
promotion of science he says promising american scientists 
eligible for 30 to 40 of the endowments are not the most likely 
candidates to respond to the new program 
apart from the problems of language and style of living many 
researchers at the start or the peak of their careers are not that 
interested in coming to japan theyre afraid of being left 
behind by their colleagues back home 
tanaka head of the governments international superconductivity 
technology center questions the intentions of the us government 
and industry 
tanaka found no takers when he recently visited the united 
states in an attempt to woo american corporate participation in the 
new superconductivity project despite paranoia that japan was 
taking the lead in the field which promises a bounty in terms of

tanaka said nationalism is driving the us government as it 
closes off symposiums on superconductivity to foreign participation 
in a bid to take first place in the field yet superconductivity is 
one area us officials selected for joint research in drawing up

space subcommittee that japan should give us firms free 
access in exchange for the technology it has developed from 
american research 
foreign ministry spokesman yoshifumi matsuda said in a briefing 
the americans major interest is in japanese institutions of 
applied science rather than basic science most of the applied 
science institutions here are private and we cannot control the 
private sector 
japans private industry footed 803 percent compared with the 
50 percent us firms put up in america of the 68 billion the 
nation spent on research and development in 1985 
of the research in japanese industrial laboratories almost 94 
percent of the outlays went into experimental development and 
applied research a fact not overlooked by us industry 
japans technological standing inose said is worldclass in 
fields like computer memories and biotechnology the united 
states cannot excel in every area and they have to think about an

opposition presidential candidate cuauhtemoc 
cardenas challenged the governments claim that one of his key 
strategists and an aide were killed by the criminal underworld not 
political assassins 
he said wednesday he still believes francisco ovando hernandez 
and ovandos aide roman gil heraldez were victims of 
reactionary elements bent on provoking election violence 
cardenas candidate of the leftist national democratic front 
coalition spoke with reporters while waiting to vote in the 
national election 
hours before the polls opened for the most hotly contested race 
in decades federal district police officials said they had 
discarded a political motive for the slayings saturday night 
they blamed criminals seeking revenge for ovandos work as 
michoacan state attorney general when cardenas then still a member 
of the ruling institutional revolutionary party was governor of 
the state 
i dont consider that to be the truth cardenas said 
wednesday 
opposition parties claim the ruling party known as the pri for 
its initials in spanish has used intimidation voter manipulation 
and fraud to stay in power since it was founded in 1929 
president miguel de la madrid promised the nation the murder 
case would be solved quickly 
jorge obrador capellini director of the federal district 
judicial police went on national television tuesday night to 
announce the results of the 3dayold investigation 
he said police had more than a dozen suspects none of whom had 
been arrested he named three people two of them prison inmates 
as the masterminds 
cardenas said wednesday there was no reason to believe that 
these people he is naming could have been the ones who ordered 
the killings 
ovando 41 and heraldez 28 were shot to death while driving 
home from a political meeting party officials have said 
confidential documents outlining the cardenas coalitions plans to 
monitor the voting were missing from their car 
obrador capellini said the murders were timed to make them look 
like a political crime 
he said several michoacan law enforcement officials had been 
murdered by the same criminal gang and outlined criminal 
prosecutions in the state that he said provided motives for the 
slayings 
cardenas rejected this theory he said ovando had little to do 
with the cases mentioned when he was attorney general from 
september 1980 to june 1981 
the murders showed voters how far some of the most reactionary 
sectors are willing to go to stop the opposition he said most 
polls have shown cardenas running a strong second to the pri 
candidate carlos salinas de gortari 
ovando a longtime friend and political associate of cardenas 
was in charge of the coalition plan for monitoring the election for 
fraud he was buried tuesday in michoacan state

george street the center of west jerusalems shopping district 
police rushed to the scene to search for suspects and stopped arab 
passersby for identity checks

targets in recent weeks but rarely have they acted in busy jewish 
population centers such as west jerusalem 
in other developmentes wednesday

after youths stoned riot police and buses 
the military administration extended for three days a closure 
order against all 800 arab schools in the west bank an israeli 
spokesman said the army says the schools which are to reopen 
monday are centers of unrest in the nearly 7monthold palestinian 
uprising 
the government said it would check a complaint of the abctv 
network that israeli secret service agents posed as abc employees 
to deceive a 17yearold palestinian whom they arrested 
in the west bank city of nablus palestinian youths stoned an 
army patrol and troops opened fire wounding 9yearold ahmed 
sarkaji in the left leg said officials at the citys alittihad

the hospital to use his property as collateral against the final 
payment the newspapers said 
the government forbids the hospitals to transfer casualties to 
israeli hospitals as was done before in emergency cases

dakdouk 17 of the west bank village of salfit 
abc correspondent dean reynolds said the network learned of the 
incident and complained to the israeli police the army and

begins talks thursday with southeast asian leaders on cambodias 
future the vietnamese boat people and usasian trade problems 
shultz arrived in the thai capital wednesday at the start of a 
ninecountry trip through asia and the pacific he was greeted by 
tight security expected to be a feature of his entire stay 
also on shultzs asian agenda are the fate of us military 
bases in the philippines security at the upcoming olympics in 
seoul and development of democracy in south korea 
a senior thai military officer said special precautions were 
being taken because of sundays shooting down of an iranian 
airliner by us missiles in the persian gulf iran has threatened 
revenge and asian officials and journalists are likely to ask 
shultz for explanations of the incident 
the malaysian foreign ministry tuesday said it deplored the 
american action adding it was difficult to believe or accept us 
claims that its forces mistook the large civilian aircraft for a 
military one 
the thai officer who requested anonymity said sharpshooters 
were included in a security task force which includes police air 
force and army personnel reporters were barred from the military 
section of bangkoks international airport where the secretarys 
official aircraft landed

at their annual conference here earlier this week the asean 
ministers sidestepped the khmer rouge problem focusing instead on 
a total withdrawal of vietnamese troops from cambodia and plans for 
a politial settlement of the war 
fear of a return by the khmer rouge who turned cambodia into a 
killing field during their 197578 rule has been sparked by an 
ongoing partial vietnamese troop withdrawal and hanois pledge to 
end its military presence in cambodia by 1990 
vietnam drove the khmer rouge from power in 1979

and other countries to accept more indochinese refugees who 
continue to flee to southeast asia from vietnam cambodia and laos 
thailand malaysia indonesia and hong kong have recently 
toughened their policies on providing vietnamese boat people 
with temporary asylum washington has criticized the moves 
the us government says it is committed to accepting 29500 
indochinese refugees from first asylum countries for resettlement 
this fiscal year it has accepted more than 900000 since 1975 
including 32000 last year 
in china shultz will express american concern about a reported 
flow of chinese missiles to hot spots in the middle east 
sources in washington said

expanding democracy and human rights in south korea there also 
will be discussions on the running of a troublefree olympics 
which begin in the south korean capital sept 17

in bangkok as well as manila where negotiations over their future 
is continuing as a bloc asean has refused to take a stand on the 
issue but most individual members want a solid us military 
presence in the region to offset soviet power 
trade issues and japans emerging role as both a political and 
economic force in asia are likely to feature in discussions in 
tokyo shultzs last stop on the asian continent

two strong undersea earthquakes rocked the northern 
japanese island of hokkaido early thursday but officials reported 
no damage or casualties 
the central meteorological agency said the first tremor struck 
at 1254 am 1154 am edt wednesday with a preliminary reading 
of 64 on the richter scale 
the quakes epicenter was 36 miles under the seabed off the 
coast of kushiro 556 miles northwest of tokyo the agency said 
a tsunami or seismic wave warning was issued along hokkaidos 
pacific coast but was lifted about 30 minutes later said an 
official of the hokkaido prefectural police 
the second quake jolted the same region an hour later with a 
reading of 57 on the richter scale the agency said 
there were no reports of damage or casualties from either quake 
said the police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its 
epicenter according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs 
an earthquake of 5 on the richter scale is considered very strong 
and a 6 severe capable of widespread damage near the epicenter 
every increase of one digit represents a tenfold increase in 
magnitude thus a reading of 75 would be 10 times stronger than 
one of 65

the senate voted wednesday by a vetoproof 
7223 margin to make companies provide workers and local officials 
60 days advance notice of plant closings and large layoffs 
nineteen republicans many of them up for reelection this year 
joined democrats in support of the mandatory notices which 
president reagan cited as his primary reason for vetoing in may a 
massive overhaul of the nations trade laws 
the bill requires any company or plant employing more than 100 
people to give advance written notices to affected workers and 
local officials of any layoff or closing of a facility involving 50 
or more fulltime employees 
exempted from the requirement are layoffs caused by 
unforeseeable circumstances at the time the notices should have 
been provided and businesses that might be hurt by the notices in 
trying to raise capital in order to keep a plant open 
the vote occurred after democrats rejected a lastditch 
amendment by sen dan quayle rind a leader of the opposition to 
the measure to raise the thresholds to half a plants workforce 
and 75 or more workers 
with the higher thresholds quayle said he and other republicans 
would try to persuade reagan not to veto the bill 
weve compromised far enough said sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio this is a matter of simple human decency american 
workers are entitled to 60 days advance notice before losing their 
jobs 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash said the house 
likely will take up the measure early next week 
after delaying the vote for two weeks republicans agreed 
earlier wednesday to end what critics had claimed was a filibuster 
aimed at denying democrats a chance to override reagans expected 
veto before the democratic national convention begins july 18 
only five senate republicans warren rudman and gordon humphrey 
of hew hampshire james mcclure and steve symms of idaho and 
malcolm wallop of wyoming voted to continue the stalling tactics 
i would hope that the president would see there are sufficient 
votes to override a veto and that will mean that he wont veto 
it metzenbaum said 
had the measure been law the past two years more than 800000 
workers who were laid off annually in 1986 and 1987 would have 
received the advance notices he said 
democrats voted unanimously for the measure while picking up the 
support of nine more republicans than they had when they failed to 
override reagans veto of the trade bill last month 
i dont know what the presidents going to do when he gets 
this bill said senate minority leader bob dole of kansas who 
called the vote a big victory for the labor leaders in america 
reagan had indicated he would sign a trade bill that did not 
include the plant closing measure but the aflcio said it would 
withdraw its pivotal support for the trade legislation without 
enactment of a separate plant closing law 
aflcio president lane kirkland called wednesdays vote margin 
overwhelming and said it is a welcome message for american 
workers 
republicans last week succeeded in stalling the vote until after 
the july 4th holiday only five of them voted with democrats to 
break the filibuster then 
im certain that its going to pass and become law sen 
phil gramm rtexas said just before wednesdays vote the 
tragedy is that were doing this all because of politics 
with polls showing that 80 percent of americans favor making 
companies provide their employees advance notice of layoffs the 
issue has given democrats a major opening to attack reagan 
administration economic policies 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis has endorsed 
the idea of federally mandated advance notices nationwide even 
though he opposed them on other than a voluntary basis in 
massachusetts as governor he feared that businesses would 
relocate in other states 
republicans stalled action on the bill last week by trying to 
make democrats vote first on the massachusetts voluntary notice law 
that dukakis has touted as an example of his concern for workers 
democrats balked at allowing a vote then on a day that dukakis 
was making a series of courtesy calls in the capitol that would 
have enabled republicans to claim as a rejection of the 
massachusetts governor 
vice president george bush has endorsed voluntary notices the 
same position taken by the reagan administration the last four 
years and conditioning federal contracts and tax incentives to 
pledges by companies to provide advance notices as part of their 
affirmative action plans 
a bureau of labor statistics study in may showed that more than 
400000 workers in just 49 states lost their jobs last year to mass 
layoffs and plant closings 
the bureau concluded in a 1987 study of layoffs in six states 
that 64 percent of the workers affected received no advance notice 
they would lose their jobs and another 16 percent were told less 
than two weeks in advance

delegates to the national education 
associations annual convention approved a resolution wednesday 
urging all school districts to provide counseling for students 
struggling with their sexual identities 
the resolution was adopted after a stormy debate by a standing 
vote of the 8227 delegates attending the neas annual convention 
here 
the twosentence measure put the 19million member teacher 
union on record in favor of all persons regardless of sexual 
orientation having equal opportunity within the public school 
system 
it added the association further believes that every school 
district should provide counseling for students who are struggling 
with their sexualgender orientation 
john walters chief of staff to us education secretary william 
j bennett said the resolution neglected the primary role of 
parents in guiding children in such sensitive matters 
schools have a big enough job teaching basics like reading and 
math and character he said 
speaking in favor of the measure nea secretarytreasurer 
roxanne bradshaw said she knew a young girl who attempted suicide 
and wound up in a comma because of her distress over her sexual 
identity 
indiana teacherdelegate art daniel said it is not the intent 
of this resolution to encourage a gay or lesbian orientation but 
to help children accept and deal with their orientation whatever it 
may be 
those who spoke against the measure argued that existing union 
positions on civil rights counseling and other matters adequately 
covered the concerns raised in the resolution

windhoek southwest africa ap a bomb killed a black man and 
wounded 18 people at a butcher shop in an affluent white area 
wednesday and a second bomb wrecked an army truck in a black 
township 11 hours later police reported 
police said no one was hurt at katatura black township on the 
outskirts of windhoek when an explosive device was thrown under a 
parked army truck at about 1020 pm 
col jumbo smith a police spokesman said the explosion blew 
out house windows and shock waves woke people miles away 
two victims of the first bomb were in critical condition and 
four were hurt badly including a woman who lost a leg police 
spokesman kierie du rand said 
he said it appeared the bomb was inside a parcel left in the 
shop du rand said most of the wounded were black although the 
shop is in a white area 
witnesses said an adjoining store was damaged and broken glass 
and other debris littered the street 
no group claimed responsibility for either explosion but police 
blamed the south west african peoples organization a guerrilla 
group that began fighting 21 years ago for independence in the 
territory also known as namibia 
i have no doubt in my mind that swapo is responsible du 
rand said 
south africa captured the territory from germany in world war i 
and was given a league of nations mandate over it the united 
nations abrogated the mandate more than 20 years ago but the south 
africans have refused to leave 
the deadliest bombing in the guerrilla war occurred feb 19 
when an explosion at a bank in the northcentral town of oshakati 
killed 27 people

the white house launched the search for 
attorney general edwin meese iiis replacement wednesday saying 
president reagans aides were collecting names of candidates from 
various sources 
reagan met privately with meese his longtime california friend 
and political confidant and the white house said nothing of what 
had transpired it said the meeting was granted at meeses request 
spokesman marlin fitzwater conceded that white house officials 
had no contingency plan to find a replacement even though meese 
indicated some time ago he might leave before the end of the 
administration 
we had an attorney general up until tuesday yesterday 
fitzwater said we dont compile lists for positions where 
theyre already filled 
fitzwater had said earlier that meese told reagan some time 
ago that he might want to leave before the end of the 
administration the president left the timing up to him 
reagan who conceded tuesday that he had nobody in mind to 
take meeses place on wednesday briefly discussed a successor 
for meese with white house chief of staff kenneth duberstein and 
general counsel ab culvahouse the spokesman said he did not say 
whether reagan and meese had talked about whom to select 
a justice department spokesman patrick korten was asked 
whether the attorney general would play an active role in choosing 
a successor 
i think hes already weighed in on the subject korten said 
in reference to meeses meeting with reagan 
as he left the white house meese was asked what he had told 
reagan he gestured in the direction of his car and said ive got 
to go interviewed later on cable news network meese was asked 
what kind of person he thought should succeed him 
i dont think anybody would be a clone of anybody else he 
said but meese said he hoped the person selected is someone who 
subscribes to the principles of ronald reagan and his 
administration 
i think a lot depends on the willingness of the senate to 
fulfill its responsibility and confirm someone he said i 
would hope that someone would be confirmed and take over the day i 
leave office 
meese announced tuesday that he was resigning effective in late 
july or early august he said he had been vindicated by the fact 
that independent counsel james mckay concluded an exhaustive 
investigation without seeking his indictment 
korten acknowledged that the office of professional 
responsibility a justice department unit may decide to pursue an 
ethics examination of meese despite the fact that he is resigning 
but he said he saw no purpose in such a probe because the main 
task of opr is to ensure the integrity and adherence to laws and 
regulations by current department officials 
meese in the cnn interview said he had no concerns on that 
score 
this is something that someone else would have to determine 
whether there is any reason to have such an inquiry but as i say 
if there is ill be glad to answer all the questions meese said 
the head of common cause a nonpartisan public interest group 
sent letters wednesday to the office of professional responsibility 
and the office of government ethics urging the agencies to review 
mckays report and determine if meese violated executive branch 
ethics requirements 
fred wertheimer president of the group told the agencies they 
should make public their findings to make clear to current and 
future public officials and to the nation what is required of a 
public official under existing executive branch ethical 
requirements 
fitzwater said that culvahouse will be considering processes 
and procedures and so forth over the next few days and criteria 
also collecting the names of candidates from various sources 
so we are beginning the search immediately he said wed 
like to have a candidate to replace the attorney general before he 
leaves but you just cant predict what the timetable will be 
if a new attorney general has not been confirmed by the time 
meese leaves fitzwater said the administration probably would 
install solicitor general charles fried in the job on an acting 
basis fried is outranked by two justice department newcomers 
deputy attorney general harold christensen and associate attorney 
general francis keating but neither has been confirmed by the 
senate 
christensens name was making the rounds wednesday on capitol 
hill as were a number of others being circulated by various 
senators 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan told reporters on 
capitol hill that the names of former white house chief of staff 
howard h baker jr and judith richards hope daughterinlaw of 
comedian bob hope sprang immediately into mind 
baker resigned as chief of staff effective june 30 to return 
to private law practice in tennessee mrs hopes nomination to 
succeed robert h bork on the us court of appeals for the 
district of columbia has not yet been acted upon by the senate 
others suggested on capitol hill were former nevada sen paul 
laxalt former house republican leader john rhodes of arizona 
former democratic attorney general griffin b bell who served 
under jimmy carter reagans first attorney general william french 
smith and eugene thomas of boise idaho former president of the 
american bar association 
tom loranger a laxalt spokesman said he asked laxalt about the 
speculation and the former senator said there is absolutely no 
truth to the rumors about my going to the justice department 
fitzwater was asked whether meese could have remained if he 
wished absolutely he replied absolutely the president has 
expressed full confidence in ed meese at all times 
describing the attorney generals call to reagan notifying the 
president that he was stepping down the spokesman said the 
president said ok if thats your determination 
fitzwater said reagan did not try to dissuade his friend 
respecting meeses wish to step aside

the new bags degrade in two to three years weaver said 
conventional plastic bags may last 100 years or more and somch the polyethye 
plastics take 300 to 400 years to degrade he said 
several communities nationwide have passed ordinances forbidding 
the use of plastic trash bags that are not biodegradable weaver

an indiana company is making a new type of 
trash bag that wont last long and that should be good news for 
the environment 
gary weaver vice president of rollpak corp said his company 
makes plastic trash bags made of 7 percent corn starch the corn 
starch is bonded with the complex plastic compound polyethylene 
when soil bacteria and fungi consume the starch the polyethylene 
crumbles into dust that the organisms can break down readily 
the new bags degrade in two to three years weaver said 
conventional plastic bags may last 100 years or more and some 
plastics take 300 to 400 years to degrade he said 
several communities nationwide have passed ordinances forbidding 
the use of plastic trash bags that are not biodegradable weaver 
said nevertheless rollpak a subsidiary of a swedish company 
doesnt expect big orders soon because the new bags cost 10 percent 
to 10 percent more than other bags he said 
ramani narayan a chemical engineer at purdue university says 
research there may produce plastics containing 30 percent corn 
starch that break down in 15 months 
the technology can be applied to a broad range of plastics and 
conserve municipal landfill space he said conventional plastics 
accounts for about 30 percent of landfill volume and could rise to 
40 percent by the year 2000 he said

communist party chief karoly grosz 
called for more openness in news media wednesday as newspapers for 
the first time bared statistical data showing more than 25 million 
hungarians lived in virtual poverty last year 
grosz said in an article wednesday in the communist daily 
nepszabadsag that he was deeply impressed while visiting moscow 
with the openness of the soviet press and said the hungarian 
media can report on anything but military secrets 
he told the newspaper that a meeting of the party central 
committee set for july 13 would receive extensive coverage the 
official news agency mti reported from moscow on tuesday that grosz 
announced at a news conference there that the meeting would be 
broadcast live on hungarian television and radio 
party proceedings have traditionally been conducted behind 
closed doors 
in other stories nepszabadsag and the trade union daily 
nepszava said 18 percent of the population lived below the social 
minimum income level in 1987 and 6 percent below the living 
minimum level 
nepszava noted that for a long time a certain official 
shyness prevented even the idea of a minimum wage to appear 
publicly in the media also for a long time there was no such 
thing as poor people in this country while there were many who 
knew it from experience 
social minimum was defined as an income level that in 
addition to the most basic needs allows very modest spending on 
some goods and services that are considered requirements of the 
masses living standard minimum only allows paying for bare 
necessities 
in 1987 19 million hungarians lived beneath the first and 
660000 below the second minimum living standard

workers at lockheed missiles amp space co 
used government computers to run a football pool built a private 
airplane at public expense and billed the government for the time 
it took to write the entire bible into a computer according to a 
lawsuit unsealed wednesday 
i think were looking at the tip of an iceberg as far as 
secret and topsecret programs go said margaret a newsham 45 
a former employee of lockheed and one of the plaintiffs as we 
delve into this i believe well find a lot more 
we expect additional people to step forward and disclose 
additional examples of waste and fraud said guy t saperstein 
the oaklandbased lawyer for the plaintiffs 
the violations that the suit says occurred at one california 
plant cost the government more than 10 million saperstein said 
if proven the charges could result in suspension of defense 
contracts to lockheed missiles amp space which employs 23700 
workers in sunnyvale developing spacecraft satellite systems and 
submarinelaunched missiles it is a subsidiary of lockheed corp 
one of the nations largest defense contractors 
newsham who appeared at a news conference wednesday to discuss 
the suit was fired as a computer software analyst by lockheed 
missiles in 1984 for allegedly padding her time card the dismissal 
is the subject of another suit that is expected to come to trial 
this year 
she was joined in the current suit by martin overbeek bloem 34 
an engineer who still works for the company 
the suit charged that some employees skipped work partied and 
ran their own businesses at government expense while waiting for 
security clearances for top secret contracts 
lockheed spokesman george mulhern said company officials will 
comment on the individual allegations when they receive a copy of 
the suit 
but we very vigorously deny that false claims have been or are 
made or condoned by the company mulhern said in fact weve 
had a very strong program over the past several years to make sure 
all employees know any form of mischarging is wrong and can lead to 
disciplinary action including dismissal if warranted 
we are also are very confident the suit if it goes to trial 
will show the company has not engaged in any improper practices 
he said 
saperstein said he would seek an order from federal court so he 
could serve lockheed with a copy of the suit which was filed in 
us district court in san jose in january under the false claims 
act 
the civil warera federal law which was strengthened with 
amendments in 1986 allows whistleblowers to keep some of the 
judgments against companies convicted of cheating the government 
saperstein said such suits are kept secret for 60 days to allow 
the justice department time to consider action he said he released 
the information on wednesday after granting the justice department 
two extensions 
they still havent made up their minds he said 
the suit said one senior manager at the plant using government 
charge numbers had lockheed machinists build him an airplane he 
was allowed to retire when the project was discovered and he took 
the plane with him the suit alleged 
and one lockheed employee wrote out the entire bible onto a 
lockheed computer charging government contracts for his time 
the suit claims 
newsham and bloem according to the suit held special security 
clearances from the national security agency the codebreaking and 
surveillance branch of the defense department 
they worked at lockheed on a project identified in the suit only 
as p285 from 1981 to 1984 the suit says the project was part of 
the pentagons black budget which involves projects so secret 
that their funding is classified 
the suit claims that lockheed workers waiting for security 
clearances were sent to the ice box an unclassified area where 
they had nothing to do 
but while employees were there some allegedly used lockheed 
computers and charged time to government contracts to run 
businesses that included selling real estate honey stocks 
cosmetics diet food jewelry belt buckles and cable television 
decoders 
mulhern denied the allegation that employees waiting for 
security clearances are given little or nothing to do 
newsham and bloem claim employees were told that even if they 
worked less than a full week to bill various government contracts 
for 40 hours they also claim that lockheed officials told 
employees to charge their time to contracts on which they had not 
worked 
newsham complained about the alleged abuses to a lockheed 
supervisor who then threatened to fire her the suit said 
the defense contract audit agency however investigated the 
allegations and substantiated them after newsham called a defense 
department hot line in 1984 the suit said reports from the agency 
were filed with newsham and bloems suit

kuwait and iran their relations strained by 
irans repeated threats to this persian gulf arab nation were 
reported wednesday to have exchanged friendly notes since the 
weekend downing of the iranian airliner 
foreign minister sheik sabah alahmed received a written message 
from irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati thanking him on 
behalf of the tehran government for condolences kuwait offered 
after the us navy shot down the iran air a300 airbus on sunday 
with 290 people on board 
an official kuwaiti statement said velayatis message also 
expressed condolences for the loss of a number of kuwaiti 
nationals in the incident thirtyeight noniranians were among 
the passengers 
the statement said sabah sent a reply to velayati thanking iran 
for its condolences 
sheik sabah underscored the gravity of such an incident which 
necessitates investigation that would determine its causes and its 
circumstances and prevent its repetition the statement said 
the messages contained no direct reference to nearly 8yearold 
war between iran and iraq 
iran has often accused kuwait of actively aiding iraq in the 
war in the past years it fired missiles into kuwaiti territory and 
menaced this tiny countrys oil shipments in the gulf 
iran also has been accused of backing shiite moslem saboteurs 
blamed for bombings in kuwait over the past five yeras 
the radical alrai alaam newspaper meanwhile urged iran not to 
retaliate for the incident 
it said that such an error cannot be ruled out in area whose 
land sea and air are jammed by military equipment civilian 
aircraft and commercial ships the threat of revenge against a 
superpower will not serve the cause of peace or end tension but 
rather it will lead to another series of violence and 
counterviolence 
in the united artab emirates the dubaibased englishlanguage 
newspaper khaleej times said iran appears to be in no need to 
undertake any adventurist actions the moral and propaganda gain 
for it has already been enormous iran can easily sit back and 
watch the americans squirm with embarrassment as they try to 
explain how one of their most sophisticated ships failed to 
distinguish between an airbus and an f14 fighter

subcontractor for unisys corp paid for a trip a political 
consultant made to rep bill chappell jrs district earlier this

the consultant he could get paid for the campaign trip by going to 
the top man at armtec the network said the wiretap was placed by 
fbi and navy investigators

the expenses nbc said 
nbc did not give the amount allegedly paid it did not identify 
the political consultant

pattern of defense firms paying out cash for political purposes via 
smaller contractors with the costs charged to the pentagon as part 
of work on weapons contracts

thousands of workers from 
yugoslavias largest rubber and shoe plant forced their way into 
the federal parliament on wednesday demanding changes in the 
government and protesting low living standards they later were 
evicted 
in an action unprecedented in communist yugoslavias postwar 
history about 4000 demonstrators clashed with security police in 
front of the parliament building police were unable to keep them 
from entering 
the protesters filled the main lobby of the domed building for 
about half an hour before security men forced them to leave 
there were no injuries reported from the brief scuffle 
uniformed police used only their hands to keep the demonstrators 
away from passersby 
about 5000 demonstrators representing more than 10000 
strikers of the borovo plant traveled from borovo about 60 miles 
west of belgrade they began arriving in the capital overnight 
they demanded a 100 percent pay increase and changes in the 
governments economic austerity program and national leadership 
the workers said their average monthly wage is about 6250 the 
monthly salary of an average yugoslav is about 120 
the demonstrators called for the resignation of foreign trade 
minister nenad krekic he was director of the plant two years ago 
and workers blame him for their plight now 
after being evicted the protesters waited for more than seven 
hours in front to the parliament in 100degree heat to hear from 
ivo latin a member of the republic of croatia presidency 
latin pleaded with them to return to borovo where he said 
negotiations to resolve the problems would resume 
but the workers booed latin who could not continue his speech 
they demanded talks with premier branko mikulic 
the workers left belgrade for borovo by buses and trucks shortly 
after midnight wednesday ending about 24 hours of demonstrating in 
the capital 
the official tanjug news agency said that parliament was 
consulting highranking state and party leaders including 
president raif dizdarevic and communist party president stipe 
suvar to try to find a solution to the workers problems 
mikulic said he would be ready to address the demonstrators in 
a few days in borovo tanjug said 
more than 10000 workers at the plant which employs at least 
23000 people went on strike saturday in what is believed to be 
one of the largest work stoppages in the country since it became 
communist 
it was the latest in a series of protests by workers voicing 
their dissatisfaction with the govermnents austerity program 
allowing substantial price increases and hefty wage cuts 
the austerity measures introduced in may linked wages to 
productivity to try to cut inflation currently hovering at about 
175 percent and to improve overall economic performance 
yugoslav officials insist there is no other alternative to the 
program made in conjuction with the international monetary fund 
if the country wants to pay off its 21 billion foreign debt 
the program also lifted price controls for about 60 percent of 
goods and services that were under a price freeze since november 
the action resulted in huge price increases in june when 
inflation reached a record 211 percent resulting in a further 
drop in living standards that have fallen by at least onethird 
since 1980 
in addition to a 100 percent pay increase the workers are 
demanding a 30 percent reduction of the plants administration 
better working condition and full payment of their june wages 
they promised us everything except the pay hike which is our 
main demand a borovo worker zorica radic told the associated 
press 
more than 10000 people demonstrated tuesday in vukovar about 
three miles south of borovo chanting down with the government 
and demanidng higher wages witnesses said 
yugoslavia registered a record 1600 strikes last year 
involving 300000 workers most of the work stoppages were staged 
inside factory gates

federal agents who searched the home of an 
aerospace lobbyist played tape recorded conversations for him to 
induce his cooperation with the government his attorney said 
wednesday 
the attorney william dougherty said his client fred lackner 
refused to talk to the agents without consulting his lawyer and has 
since turned down a deal offered by federal officials to help build 
cases against others 
doughertys comments provided the first indication of government 
willingness to bargain with defense industry lobbyists and others 
who have figured in the investigation into alleged pentagon 
procurement bribery and fraud 
the purported deal indicates the government may be willing to 
seek the help of lesser known consultants in building cases against 
more prominent suspects in the alleged fraud scam 
lackner a former san fernando valley aerospace industry 
salesman is one of about 275 people who have been subpoenaed to 
appear before a federal grand jury in alexandria va on july 19 
dougherty said lackner will appear voluntarily 
the lawyer said agents urged lackners cooperation when they 
came to his home with a search warrant on june 14 
i wasnt there but when they served the warrant they asked 
him to cooperate and played some tapes for him and he said i want 
to see a lawyer dougherty said 
the attorney said he isnt sure what tapes were played but 
assumes they were of wiretapped conversations similar to those 
mentioned in search warrant affidavits unsealed last week in 
dallas he said he did not know whether lackners voice was on the 
tapes 
a federal court in dallas last week unsealed government 
affidavits that included excerpts of wiretapped conversations 
between a navy purchasing official and two consultants 
dougherty confirmed that investigators are trying to prove that 
lackner bribed former pentagon official stuart e berlin but he 
insisted that lackner gave nothing of value to berlin 
berlin a friend of lackners since the 1970s was removed as a 
contracting official at naval air systems command last month after 
his pentagon office was searched as part of the defense probe 
dougherty said the government deal would have required lackner 
to plead guilty to two counts of bribery and stealing government 
property and to cooperate in the investigation in exchange 
prosecutors would remain silent at lackners sentencing he said 
the lawyer said he has not been told what charges might be 
lodged against lackner if he fails to cooperate he added that he 
has been unable to gain access to an affidavit filed in support of 
the lackner search warrant that would outline government suspicions 
material taken from lackners home during the search was not 
incriminating the lawyer said 
he has done nothing illegal said dougherty they didnt 
get a single government document they got invoices on his 
letterhead there were no classifed documents involved with my 
client they didnt seize anything of a proprietary nature 
describing his clients business he said hes an independent 
consultant to consultants they go around talk to one another 
pick up information and help people get contracts 
he said lackner continues to work although people do ask 
questions i guess 
dougherty said he has advised lackner not to discuss the case 
with reporters 
dougherty confirmed that lackner apparently helped william 
parkin a consultant for hazeltine corp of greenlawn ny obtain 
a navy contract for a device that tests radarlike equipment in 
some air force and navy planes 
dougherty also did not deny a report in time magazine that 
parkin a former navy contracting officialturnedlobbyist paid 
lackner half of his 24000 annual fee from hazeltine in exchange 
for marketing intelligence but he contended there was no 
evidence his client paid berlin for the information later passed on 
to parkin

a child sexual abuse scandal which tore apart 
scores of families and horrified britain last year arose from an 
honest but misfired attempt to protect children a judicial inquiry 
concluded wednesday 
as a result of the 320page report the government said it will 
spend 12 million to improve training for officials who deal with 
abused children and that it was strongly considering setting up a 
child protection office 
in the report lord justice elizabeth butlersloss blamed two 
overconfident doctors inflexible police and a lack of 
communication between officials 
it is unacceptable that the disagreements and failure of 
communication of adults should be allowed to obscure the needs of 
children in so sensitive difficult and important a field 
she said 
during spring and summer 1987 121 children were diagnosed by 
drs marietta higgs and geoffrey wyatt as being sexually abused and 
were separated from their parents ninetyeight have returned home 
but the report does not rule on whether they were actually abused 
the spate of alleged cases triggered a national debate on 
parents rights versus child protection 
mrs butlersloss who took four months to write her report 
after her twomonth inquiry told reporters the scandal in the 
northeast english county of cleveland arose partly from the 
increased recognition of child abuse and the new problems this 
posed 
in cleveland an honest attempt was made to address these 
problems by the agencies she said in spring 1987 it went 
wrong 
mrs butlersloss said the doctors did not create the crisis but 
shared responsibility for it and should be criticized for their 
certainty and overconfidence 
the two doctors were also criticized for relying too heavily on 
a controversial diagnostic technique called anal dilation 
the judge said police and the local social services director 
failed to resolve differences between agencies involved and they 
and others failed to reappraise their practices although the 
numbers of separated families reached dramatic proportions 
she recommended improving techniques for dealing sensitively 
with children and parents in such cases and urged improved 
cooperation between doctors social workers and police 
an independent childrens rights group the childrens legal 
center called the report a milestone in the development of 
childrens rights but some parents who felt wrongly accused 
expressed bitterness that the report was not critical enough of 
officials involved 
some families called for the resignations of local officials and 
for wyatt and higgs medical licenses to be taken away 
at the end of the day we are left with the feeling that this 
terrible thing happened to us but nobody says what theyre going 
to do about it said one parent who spoke on the condition of 
not being identified

officials from the towns of ashford and 
willington were forced wednesday to postpone walking the line 
to settle a longstanding border dispute when they discovered that 
heavy woods made it too difficult to get their bearings 
officials of the rural northeastern connecticut towns decided to 
resort to the method used for centuries by new england farmers to 
reestablish property lines each spring after being told that an 
engineers survey of the 20 acres of disputed land would cost about 
40000 
if were going to actually do any walking weve decided we 
have to do it when there arent any leaves on the trees because 
its just too hard to see anything at all said ashford first 
selectwoman paula faulkner 
poet robert frost immortalized walking the line in his poem 
mending wall in which he described to property owners walking 
along a stone wall dividing their land that had been partly 
demolished by winter weather and hunters 
connecticut statute once required that officials from 
neighboring towns also walk the line every 10 years to maintain 
boundaries according to albert fitzback of putnam a surveyor and 
member of an arbitration panel appointed by a superior court judge 
to help settle the border dispute 
the panel suggested walking the line after ashford and 
willington officials balked at the cost of a survey 
at issue is an eightmile long milewide stip of land that the 
general assembly took from ashford in 1727 when willington was 
incorporated ashford authorities contend the border originally was 
drawn as a straight line but willington officials have relied on 
markers placed in 1916 that create a slight jag in the line 
the officials did locate one of the key markers during their 
abbreviated walk wednesday night they expect to continue the 
exercise in september or october once the leaves are off the 
trees said willington first selectman carlton csiki 
its a country problem were country people and well most 
likely resolve it in a country fashion he said

number of investigators specifically assigned to track down 
contractor fraud has risen from 375 six years ago to more than 
1000 now

services committee and given the departments projected budget 
shortfalls for the coming years i am pessimistic they will be 
hired 
brown and derek vander schaaf the deputy inspector general did 
not speak specifically about details of the ongoing criminal

defense probe indicate a defense contractor armtec inc a 
subcontractor for unisys corp paid some expenses incurred by a 
congressional campaign consultant and may have passed the cost on 
to the government 
charles gardner then a unisys official was heard on a wiretap 
telling the consultant he could get paid for the campaign trip for 
rep bill chappell jr dfla by going to the top man at armtec 
the network said investigators believe gardner also discussed 
doing phony paperwork to bill the costs to the pentagon nbc said 
the pentagon recently developed a selfpolicing code of ethics 
that it wants defense contractors to follow but that hasnt worked 
very well said vander schaaf 
of the 46 companies who signed the selfpolicing code 39 are 
under investigation for contract fraud he told rep john kasich 
rohio 
brown said moreover it is discouraging to me that only 46 
defense contractors signed the ethics code 
if corporate officials do not recognize this responsibility 
and take appropriate actions no number of auditors inspectors or 
investigators will have a measurable impact upon reducing fraud and 
waste in defense programs she said 
unfortunately some contractor officials have not taken this 
responsibility seriously and have inappropriately blamed their 
shortcomings on excessive oversight regulations and legislation by 
the dod or congress she said 
vander schaaf agreed he said the contractor situation has 
gotten out of hand to a large degree explaining that the 
pentagon doesnt have enough people to effectively oversee 
contractor employees 
while problems with contractors remain brown said the pentagon 
itself is doing a better job 
for example she said complaints by contractors about 
duplicative audits led to an overhaul of the way the pentagon 
coordinates the numerous agencies it uses to look at contractor 
work 
in the past two years there have been more than 1500 
convictions in federal courts of contractors or their employees for 
a variety of crimes she said and 357 million has been returned 
to the federal government 
also on wednesday the washington times filed a motion in us 
district court to unseal documents filed in connection with 
warrants to search the offices or wiretap the telephones of defense 
consultants 
a number of such warrants were signed by us district judge 
john h pratt here the newspaper sought affidavits filed to obtain 
warrants as well as inventories of items seized in searches 
the publics common law and first amendment fights to access 
require the unsealing of these documents the newspapers lawyers 
said in court papers the public has a heightened interest in 
obtaining access to the sealed documents at issue since they may 
contain sufficient information for the secretary of defense to 
suspend payments under contracts obtained with criminal conduct

panamanian troops briefly detained 
three us soldiers who strayed off base in a military vehicle 
us officials said wednesday 
the progovernment newspaper matutino said panamanian forces 
detained the soldiers tuesday for unspecified suspicious 
activities in veracruz a town on the pacific six miles from the 
capital 
mercedes morris a spokeswoman for us southern command 
headquarters in panama said the soldiers had simply driven off 
clayton air base by accident 
the soldiers were identified as lt andrew j johnson sgt paul 
l coach and sgt edward e tate matutino said they were detained 
briefly then handed over to southern command officials 
matutino said panama will formally demand that the united states 
end such threats of a military invasion and breaches of the 
1977 canal treaties which forbid us military personnel from 
leaving base in uniform 
the three soldiers were in uniform at the time of the incident 
matutino also said their vehicle was equipped for espionage 
morris denied this saying the vehicle had nothing but standard 
radiocommunications gear 
tensions are high between the united states and panama because 
of us backing for the ouster of gen manuel antonio noriega head 
of the panamanian defense forces and the countrys de facto ruler 
noriega is under indictment in the united states as a drug 
trafficker

a panamanianregistered ship seized on the high 
seas with more than 72 tons of marijuana was towed into port 
wednesday and the coast guard said its capture was the largest 
drug bust ever on the west coast 
officials said the encounter bay had endured 60 rounds of 
machinegun fire about 600 miles offshore last friday and 
surrendered only when threatened with cannon fire 
the ship was towed into port under tight security by the coast 
guard cutter boutwell which was flying a makeshift pot buster 
flag 
the crew of 18 including three americans one from england 
one from new zealand and 13 from indonesia thailand and singapore 
were photographed and fingerprinted aboard the boutwell in 
preparation for an appearance before a us magistrate 
admiral robert kramek installed last week as regional 
commandant used the occasion to criticize funding cuts in the 
coast guards patrol budget he said the bust was the largest ever 
on the west coast 
this ought to indicate to people that its a flourishing 
business and for the government not to give the coast guard proper 
funds to interdict is foolhardy said kramek 
agents from the us drug enforcement administration were 
waiting on shore for the converted oilrig supply ship and set up 
security for the crew and for the cargo which will be burned 
officials said 
if it can be proved they were headed for the united states they 
could face felony charges and prison terms of a few years to life 
said gary liming dea agentincharge 
sixteen of the ships crew members appeared wednesday afternoon 
before us magistrate john weinberg and were advised of their 
rights and two others will appear thursday when a thai interpreter 
is available all are being held pending a detention hearing monday 
when bail may be set said deputy clerk karen lamborn 
the americans were identified as samuel j colflesh terrance 
albert nolan and gary robinson but hometowns were not available 
ms lamborn said 
the others were nico jacob tuwahatu abraham rumahlaiselan 
ramil bin samaila saptu bin ismail muhid sus pingi neh sudariyo 
and bernhard rumuat all of indonesia seng beng ng jupri beh 
ariffin and rusfi beh ariffin of singapore wuthi phibulsilpa 
panya aranyig and abdul syukur all of thailand jeffrey bernard 
press of the united kingdom and anthonyo gilbert sayers of new 
zealand 
cecil allison captain of the boutwell said the encounter bay 
appeared headed for the strait of juan de fuca which separates 
canadas british columbia and the northeastern corner of the state 
of washington 
family and friends of the boutwells crew cheered the cutters 
arrival and the makeshift flag of a marijuna leaf marked diagonally 
by a red line 
noriega put this in your pipe and smoke it said a banner 
held aloft by allisons family panamas gen manuel antonio 
noriego came under federal indictment in florida earlier this year 
on charges of drug trafficking 
the 180foot encounter bay was not flying a flag when it was 
spotted last friday by an air patrol 600 miles offshore it did not 
answer when contacted by radio flag light bullhorn and gunfire 
signals 
the boutwells crew could read the word panama in obscured 
letters and a few hours later the coast guard had permission to 
board the encounter bay from the panamian embassy allison said 
encounter bays owner was listed as countess shipping corp of 
panama 
the boutwell fired 60 rounds at the encounter bays rudder and 
engine areas when there still was no response the boutwell 
threatened cannon fire and the encounter bay surrendered 
our best estimate is there is somewhere in excess of 72 tons 
of marijuana on board said allison who described the drug as 
very high grade with very few stems and very few seeds 
allison speculated that the encounter bay stalled to destroy 
records 
it was a very organized operation from the packaging all the 
way through to the control of the ship and the cleaning out of the 
boats records 
allison said they found no records that would indicate where the 
vessel had come from or was headed to or who may have been in 
charge of the operation 
he said the marijuana with a street value estimated at about 
280 million consisted of about 8000 bales packed in four 
large shipping containers each bale in a blue nylon sack 
contained eight packets of marijuana vacuumsealed in double 
plastic wrappings 
liming said that much of the marijuana possibly from thailand 
probably would have gone to california

argentina for the humanity of the world and to show that after 
40 years people cannot hide from the crimes theyve done

fillings and jewelry from victims

a hungarian church official has appealed 
to the international community to pressure romania into dropping a 
village demolition project the austrian catholic news service 
kathpress reported 
the agency quoted cardinal laszlo paskai the hungarian catholic 
primate as saying the romanian project would destroy the 
culture the history and hence the national identity of millions 
of people 
under a plan unveiled by romanian leader nicolae ceasuescu in 
march about 7000 of romanias 13000 villages will be razed and 
replaced by agriculturalindustrial centers 
the move would also affect hundreds of communities where many of 
romanias 17 million ethnic hungarians live 
the project led to an unofficial mass protest in downtown 
budapest june 27 ceausescu angered by the protest in the 
hungarian capital closed a hungarian consulate and ordered the 
premises of a hungarian cultural center vacated 
paskai said he was protesting not only in his own name but also 
in the name of the bishops priests and the faithful he said 
he received petitions and letters indicating his concern was shared 
by many hungarians 
villages are more than just settlements of small groups of the 
population they are integral components of the entirety of a 
country paskai said the demolition of buildings including 
churches means the destruction of historical and cultural values 
irrespective of which nationality is involved 
he called the romanian plan all the more painful since it 
occurs in a country with which we want to live in friendly 
relations and with whose population we are bound by ties of 
friendship and kinship

top defense department officials briefed 
members of congress behind closed doors wednesday on the navys 
downing of an iranian jetliner but key questions remained 
unanswered even as lawmakers affirmed their support for the 
commander who fired the missiles 
defense secretary frank c carlucci and other pentagon officials 
conducted the secret briefings for house and senate members who 
characterized some of the information as confusing and said several 
important details have yet to be unearthed 
administration officials said the cruiser vincennes fired two 
missiles in the strait of hormuz because it thought it was under 
attack by an iranian f14 fighter instead the missiles destroyed 
iran air flight 655 killing all 290 people aboard in what 
president reagan termed a tragic accident 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said a lot of the questions that have come up are 
going to have to await the technical data package of computer 
records from the vincennes 
nunn said the questions include electronic signals received by 
the vincennes from the jetliner details of the warnings sent by 
the ship the jets speed altitude and whether it was descending 
toward the ship as pentagon officials have said 
abc news reported wednesday that military sources who have 
served in the persian gulf said iranian commercial airliners have 
been used to carry soldiers from bandar abbas the point of origin 
for iran air flight 655 to the front with iraq 
the sources who were not identified by abc said troop 
transports often have carried both civilian and military 
transponders which are radaractivated devices that broadcast a 
planes identification signal the sources said iranian f4 and 
f14 jets also have used both civilian and military transponders 
abc reported 
sen john warner rva ranking republican on the armed 
services panel said were still in the dark about a number of 
things there are a lot of things we dont know 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said pentagon officials told house members that us 
ships in the region had received specific intelligence warnings 
that an attack on american forces was likely over the july 4 
weekend those warnings heightened fears aboard the ship he said 
aspin said a pair of f14s had been moved from a military 
airfield elsewhere in iran to the joint militarycivilian airfield 
at bandar abbas 
rep ike skelton dmo said the ships captain had every 
reason in the world to feel threatened i dont think he had any 
choice but to shoot it down 
the washington post reported in thursdays editions that a 
postabc news poll of 524 adults found that 71 percent believed the 
shooting down of the plane was justified while 23 percent 
disagreed eighty percent said the captain acted properly in 
ordering the planes destruction 
poll respondents by a 65 percent to 31 percent margin approved 
of how president reagan is handling the situation involving the 
us navy in the persian gulf the telephone survey of randomly 
selected adults in the continental united states was conducted 
tuesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points 
meanwhile state department officials said the united states 
remains willing to open an authoritative dialogue with iran to 
discuss improving relations iran has expressed a similar interest 
in return said deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
she said the administration did not know yet whether the iranian 
messages arise from responsible officials 
mrs oakley said it would not be possible to have a normal 
relationship with iran as long as the iraniraq war continues 
american hostages continue to be held by proiranian militants in 
lebanon and iran engages in international terrorism 
as congress returned from the fourth of july recess legislators 
wanted to know what led capt will c rogers 3rd to order the 
vincennes missiles fired but they refused to secondguess him 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said the people 
we have out there on those ships are in a very difficult untenable 
situation when they have to make judgments of that kind in such a 
limited time frame 
it seem the decision was prudently made and one that i would 
have made had i been in that situation he said 
senate gop leader bob dole rkan said anyone tempted to 
monday morning quarterbacking should remember the intense 
pressure on a commander in combat 
he said they should also remember another american warship 
the stark and recollect the national anguish we endured when it 
failed to defend itself against an apparent threatened attack 
a may 17 1987 attack on the frigate stark by a iraqi warplane 
in the gulf killed 37 us sailors iraq said the attack was a case 
of mistaken identity an explanation accepted by the united states 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of a house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on the mideast said it looks to me as if the navy 
acted appropriately i dont know what else they could have done 
some lawmakers said the united states should consider 
compensation to families of the victims house majority leader 
thomas foley dwash said compensation may be appropriate not 
as a matter of requirement but as a matter of compassion and 
conviction 
sen arlen specter rpa said there would be nothing to 
preclude us reparations which he said would not constitute any 
admission of guilt but would be an act of generosity 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said he had no idea when 
the administration might decide on compensation but that it would 
probably await the outcome of a navy investigation into the downing 
of the airliner 
fitzwater also said the united states hasnt received a response 
from iran to reagans message sent through swiss intermediaries 
that the united states had not intended to shoot down the airliner 
sen brock adams dwash said the jets downing should prompt 
a reexamination of us foreign policy in the region 
and house majority whip tony coelho dcalif said he left one 
briefing feeling such a tragedy could happen again today or 
tomorrow and we have no way of preventing it the opportunity for 
disaster is just sitting there waiting to happen 
the result he said means that we will probably end up with 
american men and women dying as a result of this tragic accident 
the iranian government is basically an irresponsible government 
and you never know when they are going to retaliate or when 
aspin said wednesday that in a briefing tuesday pentagon 
officials had raised the possibility that a military 
identification signal received by the vincennes was sent by a 
military jet and not the iranian airliner 
but a navy spokesman lt brian cullin said we do not 
believe there was another aircraft in the area 
pentagon spokesman dan howard said the vincennes sophisticated 
electronic equipment picked up transmissions from the jet on a 
military frequency leading the crew of the cruiser to think it was 
firing at an iranian f14 fighter 
we were told that there were three possibilities said 
aspin one is that the airliner had in fact been broadcasting 
on both civilian and military frequencies the second is the fact 
that people on the vincennes made a mistake in reading the 
information and the third is that there was a second plane that 
was a military plane

the unanswered questions remaining about the 
iranian airbus destroyed by an american missile have given rise to 
some bizarre theories about the downing of the plane 
those television images of bloated bodies floating in the 
persian gulf fuel speculation but no answers 
on television the bodies appeared to be nude and to be so 
bloated as to suggest they were in the water for some time how 
come 
how did the iranians have a television camera in place to 
capture what iranian televisision said were shots of the plane at 
the moment it was hit to the viewer the plane was a mere dot on 
the screen and the pictures were too grainy to lead to that

choose a running mate and then it was only to say it would be a 
good thoughtful deliberative process 
but with interviews in boston on tuesday and wednesday of three 
prospective running mates the dukakis search began to resemble the 
parade to north oaks minn four years ago when walter f mondale 
was looking for someone to complete the democratic ticket

two weeks before his coronation as the democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis faces pressing problems at 
home a nearly bankrupt state treasury and increasingly unhappy 
constitutents 
according to a new poll the massachusetts governors 
favorability rating is declining along with the states tax 
collections twenty months after reelecting dukakis by an 
overwhelming margin voters now say they have doubts about his 
ability to run the state and campaign at the same time and nearly 
half say he should step down after the democratic convention to 
devote full time time to the campaign 
it could turn out to be the achilles heel of the dukakis 
presidential campaign because he has been campaigning across the 
country on his ability to manage said state sen paul cellucci

campaign of george bush

white house pollster richard wirthlin said 
wednesday the resignation of attorney general edwin meese iii 
doesnt erase the sleaze factor for vice president george bush 
in the fall presidential campaign but makes it easier for him to 
deal with it 
during a luncheon session with reporters wirthlin said only 
about 3 percent of the voters he has surveyed cite ethics in 
government as the most important issue a figure that is no higher 
than a year earlier 
the issue that outstrips all others in importance in the minds 
of voters is drugs said the pollster 
there are now 21 percent who tag drugs as the single most 
important problem facing the nation he said no other issue was 
named by more than 10 percent of people interviewed

some extraordinary warmth is showing up in the 
soviet unions relations with religion say american church leaders 
who returned from last months celebrations there of chistianitys 
millenium 
but they add that just what the friendlier climate means in 
practical implementation and lasting effect remains in question 
as is true with many historical events we wont know for 
about 25 years what happened in moscow says bishop herbert w 
chilstrom of chicago head of the evangelical lutheran church in 
america 
it may be a blip on the screen that will have little 
longterm significance or it may go down as one of the great 
milestone moments in christian history 
in any case the occasion was marked with fervor crowds the 
return of various church properties the presence of about 500 
church leaders from other lands all with cooperation and sometimes 
participation of state officials 
if anyone just a few years ago had said it could happen in that 
officially atheist state theyd have been laughed at chilstrom 
says but a change had come through soviet leader mikhail 
sgorbachev 
dont expect that suddenly youre going to have a change of 
180 degrees says chilstrom among about 50 us church leaders 
who took part in the celebration 
on the other hand they seem to be trying to reinterpret 
history they seem to be saying that in this society even though 
it is officialy atheistic the church has a right to exist and do 
its work 
new yorks cardinal john oconnor one of 10 highlevel roman 
catholics present for the celebrations says he is guardely 
optimistic about the status of religion there 
unquestionably something is happening he says citing the 
extensive services ceremonies and freedom of the celebration and 
noting the return of numerous monastaries and churches to the 
russian orthodox church 
but it remains uncertain whether it is genuine or just tactical 
expediency oconnor says 
he says it may be that gorbachev merely feels he must relax 
things for believers 70 million orthodox 9 million roman 
catholics 5 million protestants because he needs everybodys 
help to get the economy going 
but if he is sincerely interested in opening soviet society 
because it should be open and if he has the belief as he says he 
has that there should be much broader religious freedom then 
there is hope 
the rev joe hale of lake junaluska nc general secretary of 
the world methodist council who had previously visited the soviet 
union five years ago says he found this time a very different 
climate 
people were finally smiling seemed happier 
he says the broadly enthusiastic celebration was especially 
significant because it affirmed publicly the right of the church 
to exist in the soviet union with integrity 
the government affirmed this he says by its meetings with 
church officials its hosting of a reception for about 800 
celebrants at the kremlin and presence of gorbachevs wife raisa 
at a religious concert at the bolshoi theater 
a speaker at that event rabbi arthur schneier of manhattans 
park east synagogue president of the interfaith appeal of 
conscience foundation turned away from the audience at one point 
to address her directly 
he cited the bible story of creation of eve as helpmate to adam 
and told mrs gorbachev 
you are in sympathy with your husbands cause and your 
presence in our midst indicates your support of his pronouncements 
on the rights of religious believers 
evangelist billy graham who preached to overflow crowds at 
orthodox and baptist churches and who met with soviet officials to 
discuss changes in churchstate relations told one baptist 
congregation 
you are entering a new period of history for the nation in 
past years you faced many difficulties but your faith has become 
strong there is enough faith and spirit in the soviet union for 
you to help lead a revival throughout the world 
the rev bruce rigdon of mccormick theological seminary in 
chicago an expert on soviet religious affairs and a presbyterian 
leader at the celebration says 
we must remember that the church in the soviet union is 
surrounded by all sorts of forces that would like to use it the 
church needs our prayers and our support to have the courage to 
take advantage of what is possible for it 
cardinal oconnor says many uncertainties remain about the 
developments there and it would be naive to cast aside all 
political skepticism but he adds in his weekly column in the new 
york catholic 
something is happening in the soviet union something that 
could be monumental for the world for the wind blowing could be 
the divine wind we call the holy spirit

its 5 pm on a monday in detroit and disc 
jockey dave wagner is shepherding motorists home with the usual 
rushhour mix of traffic reports weather updates and short 
uptempo compact disc recordings 
music of mario castelnuovo tedesco wagner says as the 
acoustic guitar piece ends say that 10 times real fast 
also on the playlist are baroque piano renditions of hey 
jude and all you need is love from bach meets the beatles 
and stravinskys circus polka possibly the only piece ever 
written for an audience with peanuts on their breath wagner says 
its classical music and wagner and his colleagues at wqrsfm 
are taking a decidedly unclassical approach to presenting it 
this place is a lot of yuks he says 
wagner 39 is no dilettante djforhire he has a doctorate in 
music from the university of michigan belongs to the american 
organists society and is choirmaster at st pauls roman catholic 
church in grosse pointe farms 
but hes serious about dusting off classical music and making it 
more appealing to a younger increasingly affluent radio audience 
i play mostly things in major keys short pieces without a 
lot of commentary said wagner program director at wqrs and its 
evening drivetime host since 1980 
were not only giving them reasons to listen were giving 
them reasons not to turn us off 
wqrs is among the increasing numbers of commercial 
classicalformat stations stressing entertainment and shedding 
selfimposed roles as cultural custodians according to peter 
besheer executive vice president of the new yorkbased concert 
music network 
the adjective that would describe these newer stations would 
be friendly he said they would minimize talk and focus on 
providing real emphasis on the music and introduce it in an 
inviting way 
by contrast the oldline stations tend to be elitist a bit 
stuffy and believe they have a social obligation to make people 
hear what they want them to hear they view their job as to educate 
the listener the modern station is much less patronizing less 
paternalistic 
some traditional listeners remain including an older woman who 
phones wagner to say he incorrectly identified a chopin piece as 
opus 25 instead of opus 10 
its the music police yelps wagner jumping up to check the 
label and tell the caller she is indeed correct only at a 
classical station will people do that 
as for newer listeners he says this big yuppie generation is 
growing up they want to try something different besides the 
chuck berry songs they grew up with 
despite efforts at wqrs and elsewhere to broaden classical 
musics appeal the format never will dominate commercial radio 
of more than 10000 us stations only 34 commercial outlets 
broadcast classics full time besheer said but more than half of 
them have revamped their programming and their staffs in ways 
similar to wqrs he said 
the arbitron ratings service ranked wqrs 19th in the 26station 
detroit market in the fall of 1987 but its majority owner boston 
businessman howard woody tanger said ratings fail to reflect 
the new listeners affluence and their attractiveness to 
advertisers 
between its founding in 1960 and 1985 when tanger acquired it 
for a reported 5 million wqrs was run as a moneylosing tax 
shelter that carried as few as two ads an hour wagner said 
tanger said during a telephone interview that wqrs and its 
sister station wtmifm in miami are profitable he declined to 
give specific figures but said earnings from both will allow him to 
acquire wflnfm in philadelphia a traditional classical station 
that deal is pending 
our philosophy is simple we believe we play the top 40 of 
classical music tanger said we attempt to minimize the 
chatter we encourage our people on the air to be personalities we 
dont embrace the concept of teaching 
we are still considered by some in the industry to be 
renegades tanger said but i know what we are doing is the 
wave of the future 
we do have listeners who alternate between aor albumoriented 
rock classic rock and classical music he said the two are 
not inconsistent times have changed we view every radio 
station as a competitor 
a lot of people are coming to us straight from rock wagner 
said a lot of people say ive never listened to classical 
music but i like your approach and you dont make me feel stupid 
when i listen to it 
obviously i do that by being stupider than anybody else

in a land where weather vanes are akin to 
crown jewels city leaders and firefighters are at odds over a 
gilded prize that foretold the winds of new hampshires capital 
city for roughly a century 
the treasure is a meticulously detailed 4footlong horsedrawn 
fire wagon cast in copper and covered in gold leaf 
with manes and tails flying two strong horses race ahead of the 
bigwheeled wagon equipped with kerosene lanterns nozzles a 
woodfired steam boiler and pumping equipment one helmeted fireman 
holds the taut reins a second stokes the boiler 
the cushing amp white co of waltham mass no longer in 
business designed the vane around 1871 for 200 a sum then 
representing about half the cost of a working mans home experts 
today believe the vane could fetch 100000 
the vane graced the cupola of concords main fire station until 
1980 when firefighters without consulting city leaders took it 
down and put it in a room full of firefighting memorabilia in the 
citys southend station 
the firefighters took it into protective custody because weather 
vane thieves were active and because the city planned to sell the 
main fire station to a developer said fire department lt robert 
constant 
the vane issue has surfaced periodically with firefighters 
opposing city efforts to have the treasure again grace the concord 
skyline 
this is a valuable part of the firefighters heritage and it 
belongs with us no one can protect it like we can said wayne 
nickerson a firefighter for 13 years 
we dont pay the firefighters to be custodians of antiques we 
pay them to put out fires and to save lives and they are very good 
at that said martin gross a prominent concord lawyer and the 
citys mayor when the vane came down 
the dispute flared anew recently when mayor elizabeth hager 
decided the vane belonged to the city 
hager said she was first drawn to the vane in the 1970s while 
hawkwatching with her children who learned to focus their 
binoculars by training them on the intricate detail of the horses 
and wagon 
i was heartbroken when it came down hager said and 
recently i just decided we should stop futzing around and get it 
back up where it belongs 
weather vanes are popular with thieves in new england a region 
once crowded with copper rooftop art depicting rural life in the 
form of animals farm equipment and other bucolic symbols many of 
the most valuable vanes have been replaced with replicas the 
originals placed under lockandkey in museums or private 
collections 
it is deceptively simple to steal vanes said samuel 
pennington publisher of the maine antique digest vanes turn on a 
spindle and need only be lifted inches to remove them he said 
in 1983 pennington helped find and recover a valuable weather 
vane stolen from atop the fire station in hallowell a tiny 
antiquefilled town in central maine 
as for putting concords vane back on a roof pennington thinks 
it akin to tying 10 tenthousanddollar bills up there and daring 
someone to steal them 
two fire department vanes similar to concords in age and style 
disappeared during the renovation of buildings in nashua and 
manchester the manchester vane was discovered six years ago in a 
museum in shelburne vt the nashua vane has not been found 
not taking any chances concord firefighters recently wired 
their oneroom museum with an earsplitting alarm guaranteed to 
catch the attention of the 20 men and women assigned to the station 
the firefighters encourage visitors to come see the vane along 
with the fire photos records badges and helmets on display 
but seeing the vane means catching the firefighters between 
engagements which is not the city councilors idea of public 
access 
last month the councilors unanimously ordered the firefighters 
to relinquish the vane this month they rescinded the order and 
formed a study committee 
both sides appear to be moving toward creation of a replica that 
would foretell the winds from the roof of the original fire 
station now an office building 
hager said she would have no problem with a replica if 
firefighters paid for it constant said firefighters are 
considering how to raise the roughly 5000 needed for the process 
we probably wouldnt have it golded over though because that 
would just be an incentive to steal the replica constant said 
while a replica would solve one issue returning a scenic view 
to taxpayers it may be awhile before the fate of the crown jewel 
itself is resolved 
we dont want an argument but the vane belongs with the 
firefighters constant said 
to which hager replied oh there wont be any argument the 
weather vane belongs to the city

before you commit your money to a mutual fund 
investment check out the exits 
thats a lesson many savers and investors have learned in the 
past couple of years with volatility in the financial markets 
running especially high 
the typical modernday mutual fund may have as many as half a 
dozen ways to cash in or redeem shares and it stands ready to 
do so at any time you wish thus if you think of your holdings in 
a mutual fund as a very liquid investment you are correct with 
some caveats 
in fastmoving situations like the one that occurred on black 
monday last oct 19 a funds telephone switching or redemption 
privilege may not prove to be as fast and convenient as you 
expected if you have trouble getting through a traffic jam of 
calls from other fund shareholders 
the best time to deal with any such potential problems advisers 
in matters of personal finance say is before they have a chance to 
happen in other words at the time you make your first investment 
in a fund 
investors can lay the groundwork for fast and hasslefree 
share redemption says jonathan pond in the wiesenberger mutual 
funds investment report newsletter 
the prospectus contains information on a funds redemption 
rules read it closely you may find language about minimum holding 
periods minimum balance requirements exchange fees or annual 
limits on share exchanges 
if you are not clear on such items call the funds service 
phone and probe until you understand the funds policies 
the old lowtech way to redeem shares still in wide use is 
by letter including explicit instructions your account number 
and a signature that matches exactly the name in which the account 
is registered 
in many situations funds require that this signature be 
guaranteed by a commercial bank or brokerage firm 
nowadays most funds also handle redemption orders by telephone 
bank wire transfer or in person at their offices 
in addition some discount brokerage firms offer to buy and sell 
fund shares for you collecting a commission that comes atop any 
redemption or exchange fees charged by the fund itself 
one popular way to cash in shares is to use a fund groups 
telephone switch program moving from a stock or bond fund into 
a money market fund 
most money funds and indeed some bond funds as well allow you 
to redeem shares by simply writing a check 
when you fill out an application to open a fund account you are 
normally asked to choose which if any of these extra features you 
want to avail yourself of 
says pond it never hurts to sign up for all the services a 
fund offers someday they could come in handy 
it also pays to bear in mind that any redemption from a fund 
whose shares fluctuate in value is what accountants call a 
taxable event when you cash in you realize a capital gain or 
loss for tax purposes 
if you are dealing with a loss warns william brennan an 
investment adviser in valley forge pa watch out for a trap that 
can be sprung by the internal revenue services wash sale rule 
this can arise when investors have instructed funds to reinvest 
their dividends or capital gains distributions in new fund shares 
if you write a check against fund shares within 30 days of such 
a distribution and reinvestment you might forfeit the right to 
deduct on your tax return some or all of the loss realized on the 
shares you redeemed 
says brennan before you write a check determine when the 
next dividend payment is due

almost any day of the week you may find 
instances of where politics and economics clash but none with more 
noise than when minimumwage legislation is the subject 
so high are the political decibels that some economists claim 
judgment is skewed according to some politicians so cold is the 
economic logic that it is bereft of human dimensions 
but whether the perspective is mainly political or economic 
might be far less important than another aspect of minimumwage 
proposals that they might not help those they are intended to 
help 
that is the contention of economist william dunkelberg who has 
studied consulted and lectured intensively on the subject the 
minimum wage is earned primarily by secondary earners from 
abovemedian income families he states 
lowincome workers says dunkelberg account for only a bit more 
than 10 percent of all workers earning the minimum wage and in 
retailing a major employer of lowerwage workers 70 percent of 
recipients are from families with incomes more than 200 percent 
above the threshhold poverty level 
citing statistics such as these dunkelberg states unequivocally 
that minimumwage legislation cannot effectively redistribute 
income to the poor most beneficiaries he says are people we 
arent trying to help 
trying to help the lessadvantaged is an admirable goal and 
one that we all probably support says the professor formerly of 
stanford and purdue universities and now dean of the graduate 
business school at temple university 
he continues lets do it efficiently not with the shotgun 
approach of a minimum wage that is destined to miss its target nine 
out of 10 times while imposing substantial economic costs on us 
all 
in fact he continues a system already exists that could do 
even better for the poor he explains 
states alone devote an amount to public welfare programs that 
if distributed directly to the poorest 10 percent of all families 
in the united states would yield more than 12000 per family a 
year 
dunkelberg points out that benefits of that level would be much 
higher than congressional proposals to raise the minimum wage from 
335 an hour in three annual steps to between 425 and 455 in 
1991 
already many workers employed in what used to be minimumwage 
jobs earn far more than that in areas of new england and 
california a consequence of thriving economies marked by unusually 
low unemployment 
dunkelberg opposes minimumwage legislation for other reasons 
too among them 
most workers earn the minimum wage for only short periods of 
their lives advancing to higher paying jobs as their skills 
improve 
what he perceives to be a threat to the hiring capabilities of 
very small businesses where many unskilled workers obtain their 
first job experience 
his belief that raising the minimum wage would add to 
inflation albeit by only a fractional amount 
his contention that the increases proposed would add to 
unemployment again however by only a tiny amount 
but he concludes those tiny percentages are meaningful they 
add up 
the adverse employment effects dont bother most of us just 
those with few skills poor educations unlucky draws in the 
genetic lottery and young people 
he asks arent these the people we hope to help

paul collins has painted old arab women 
yemenite jews ethiopian immigrants nuns and israels first female 
general 
he has captured the pathos of holocaust survivors on canvas the 
panorama of tent encampments of nomadic bedouin tries and the 
desert fortress of masada 
the black american painter came to israel to promote a 
blackjewish dialogue the arab uprising he says has deepened the 
rift between the two groups and made his job more difficult 
collins who recently opened an exhibition of his paintings at 
the hilton hotel in jerusalem said two major black organizations 
have urged him to return to the united states because of israels 
crackdown on palestinian protesters in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
collins a former civil rights activist who has lived in israel 
for two years said he chose instead to go on a lecture tour in 
american schools and churches to explain why he stayed 
there are so many layers to this country that anyone who 
dismisses it and says they dont like israel doesnt really know 
the country the artist said in an interview ive fallen 
hopelessly in love 
collins of grand rapids mich began painting in 1944 when he 
was 16 years old he has had no formal art training and never went 
to college 
however he has exhibited at avery fisher hall in new york the 
illinois state museum in springfield ill the corcoran museum in 
washington the museum of natural history in detroit and the 
chicago cultural center 
his oils fetch from 25000 to 40000 and his drawings sell 
for as much as 8000 lithographs fetch 300 
most of his paintings are done in a realistic style but others 
have a surrealistic symbolic quality 
cousins in conflict for example is a portrait of two 
faceless men joined at the arm like siamese twins one wears a 
yarmulke the skullcap often worn by jewish men and boys the other 
wears a kefiyeh headdress a symbol of arab nationalism 
the centerpiece of the 30piece exhibit the faces of 
israel is a bright collage of images of arabs and jews created 
to celebrate israels 40th anniversary some of the proceeds will 
go toward promoting tourism to israel collins said 
although tensions between american blacks and jews have 
heightened in recent years collins said the rift is not as deep 
as the press and politicians would have us believe 
theres one thing we have in common if youre antisemitic 
you also hate blacks said the 50yearold artist a native of 
grand rapids mich 
collins also said he felt he was returning a debt to the jewish 
people who were among the most ardent supporters of the black civil 
rights struggle in the united states 
however he has been criticized by black leaders in the united 
states for working in israel 
collins came to israel two years ago with his wife candace and 
daughter chauvon to learn more about the country 
he spent from 1968 to 1970 in senegal painting traditional 
african life and later worked for three years at wounded knee 
sd painting american indians 
his new exhibit will tour a dozen us cities next year under 
the auspices of the antidefamation league of bnai brith

thats it bonita thats the way to do it wailed the proud 
aunt of 7yearold manuela nunez whose dancing stole the show at 
an outdoor performance about spanish gypsy life thats the way 
to keep it alive 
keeping flamenco alive is what both the brandnew andalucian 
flamenco foundation and matilde nunez want to do 
she and her gypsy family and neighbors in jerezs santiago 
neighborhood dont have much time for lectures on the evolution of 
the cante hondo literally the song from the depth of the soul 
or any arguing about the origin of the word flamenco 
but they do turn out in force complete with bottles of sherry 
ham sandwiches and babies for this way of life a show that 
tells the story of spanish gypsies through dancing singing guitar 
playing and handclapping in a style that has come to characterize 
the rhythm of southern spain 
the show by author tomas rodriguezpantoja and director manuel 
morao features many jerez gypsies and was the highlight of a 
conference in june two centuries of flamenco sponsored by the 
foundation its first official activity since inauguration in may 
to conserve the memory of flamenco to promote research into the 
art and to make contemporary flamenco known to as wide a public as 
possible are the principal aims of the foundation according to 
director joaquin carrera 
the foundation housed in a refurbished 18th century mansion in 
the heart of the santiago neighborhood the shrine of flamenco for 
many has a record video and book library as well as a dance 
hall it has a 350000 budget 
flamenco itself is a world of conflict said carrera 
flamencologists have a tendency to expostulate not to ask 
questions and we thought this might take up too much time 
especially for the foreigners who were attending 
when a mexican conference attendee asked about the meaning of 
the word flamenco there was an embarrassed silence as though 
someone had asked about the origin of the word christian in a 
church 
but bernard leblon professor of gypsy and andalucian culture at 
the french university of perpignan offered the explanation that 
the term referred to the gypsies who had been forced into military 
service in the fife and drum corps of the spanish regiments 
fighting in flanders in the low countries in the 17th century 
flamenco is the spanish word for a fleming or a native of flanders 
another theory has it that the word derives from the arabic 
felamengh or immigrant peasant and that many of the 
cantes or styles of flamenco songs were influenced by the moors 
who occupied most of spain for eight centuries 
although opinion varies over the current health of flamenco 
most flamencologists concur that the art form was first pulled 
from near oblivion by spanish composer and musician manuel de falla 
in june 1922 when he organized a cante hondo contest in granada 
late 19th century spanish intellectuals such as jose ortega y 
gasset had declared flamenco vulgar and looked to northern europe 
for their musical inspiration 
after fierce suppression following the 193639 spanish civil 
war flamenco was appropriated by the authoritarian regime of gen 
francisco franco 
the subsequent stylization of flamenco forms in staged shows and 
films contributed much to the cliche of the spain of the 
tambourine and castanets so rejected by spanish youth who began 
to look to foreign music as an expression of rebellion and 
independence 
the publication of flamencologia by anselmo gonzalez climent 
in 1957 marked the acceptance once again by the intelligentsia of 
flamenco as a basic element in spanish culture 
a contest the year before in cordoba for cantaores singers 
of flamenco also renewed interest 
but many students of the art point out that flamenco is not 
universally popular in spain and that many spaniards are 
embarrassed by foreign assumptions that flamenco is the nations 
national music 
critic angel alvarez caballero says flamenco has serious 
boxoffice problems in a country where some 100 flamenco festivals 
are held each summer half lose money and few would be possible 
without the support of local city or provincial councils in 
madrid where 20 public flamenco taverns existed a decade ago only 
five or six remain 
many aficionados have taken refuge in penas or private 
flamenco clubs that invite artists to perform regularly 
perpetuating the essentially intimate nature of the art 
leblon who places himself on the side that argues the 
determinant gypsy role in flamenco history says he believes many 
spaniards cannot accept flamenco as a serious art form because of 
its gypsy connections 
but many of flamencos most celebrated performers such as 
guitarist paco de lucia and cantaor antonio fernandez diaz 
fosforito are not even gypsies

its just a ragged clump of stunted spruce 
but the adak national forest is nothing short of inspirational to 
foresters who dream of covering the desolate aleutian islands with 
trees 
measuring scarcely 40 feet across the forest consists of 33 
trees huddled on a windy hillside near the adak naval air station 
a sign by the road proclaims you are now entering and leaving 
adak national forest 
the trees none over 17 feet tall are hardy survivors of a 
world war ii plan to boost the morale of homesick gis stationed in 
the aleutians one of the worlds longest stretches of unforested 
land 
thousands of seedlings were planted along the 1100mile island 
chain yet few took hold and fewer still have survived the long 
winters cold summers and relentless winds 
so the humble adak national forest is a model for hopeful tree 
lovers who are tending a new crop of seedlings this summer in the 
aleutians this time they say theyll do things right 
its history in the making one of these days the aleutians 
will be forested said richard tindall of anchorage a forestry 
consultant and volunteer for retree international an oregonbased 
group that plants trees around the world 
its not as if the aleutians never had trees huge sequoias grew 
here in the miocene epoch 11 million to 25 million years ago but 
volcanic eruptions a changing climate and grinding glaciers 
toppled that forest and the aleutians have been treeless since the 
last ice age ended 10000 years ago all thats left of the 
sequoias are petrified trunks up to 9 feet in diameter embedded 
in beaches and cliffs 
some foresters believe the aleutians would reforest naturally 
given another 50000 years or so since the glaciers retreat 
sitka spruce trees have spread from british columbia up through 
southeastern alaska and around the coast toward the aleutians 
studies of pollen in peat bogs show the spruce reached the 
northern tip of kodiak island and nearby alaska peninsula 400 to 
500 years ago said us forest service researcher john alden 
kodiak islands southern half is still mostly treeless 
oldtimers in the city of kodiak remember open fields where the 
forest now stands the grassy slopes south of town are dotted with 
fat little spruce 
but as the forest nears the aleutians the march is slowed by 
dry winds cool temperatures and thick grass that smothers tree 
seedlings alden figures the forest now migrates one mile per 
century 
thats not nearly fast enough for some a lack of trees never 
seemed to bother the native aleuts but the urge to plant has been 
rooted among newcomers since the first russian explorers 
russians planted the first trees in 1805 near the eastern 
aleutian village of unalaska a few still survive and enjoy 
national historic landmark status 
whalers traders and missionaries planted seedlings at 
settlements scattered along the chain but it wasnt until world 
war ii when lonely soldiers pined for winter greenery that 
largescale plantings were done 
after the war planting was sporadic alden said about 4000 
trees were planted on adak in 1976 as a bicentennial project but 
most died 
tree planters hope the latest plantings fare better 
the navy and us forest service have spent 30000 since 1985 
trying to find trees suited to adak alden has overseen the 
planting of nearly 6000 seedlings including 120 this spring 
but the federal programs funding was cut leaving things up to 
retree international now in its fourth year of aleutian plantings 
tindall said 2000 seedlings will be planted this summer with the 
help of volunteers in five aleutian and southwestern alaska 
communities 
not everyone shares tindalls preference for trees over native 
aleutian grasses and arctic alpine plants 
there are always those who wonder about bringing in something 
that isnt natural he said but most people understand that 
the only reason there arent trees in a lot of these places is 
because nature hasnt had time to come in 
planting trees where none grew before can be educational said 
david bruce a retired forester who directed the world war ii 
plantings as an army captain 
if you learn to do it under these very unfavorable conditions 
youre much better able to plant trees under better conditions 
bruce said another reason for the interest is just to see if you 
can do it sort of like climbing mountains

maryland and virginia republicans are fielding 
littleknown black candidates in uphill senate races apparently to 
help build bridges to a traditionally democratic constituency but 
some observers say the tactic is likely to backfire 
the maryland party is putting up alan l keyes a 37yearold 
harvardeducated businessman with conservative views and a gift for 
rousing rhetoric keyes emerged as the likely nominee on june 25 
after the victor in the partys nineway primary bowed out 
in virginia republicans are offering maurice a dawkins 67 a 
retired washingtonarea preacher and lobbyist who claimed the 
nomination after a stirring speech to delegates at the republican 
state convention 
common ground for the two candidates extends beyond their 
speechmaking ability both are relative newcomers to elective 
politics and both face daunting opponents popular incumbent sen 
paul sarbanes in maryland and former gov charles robb in virginia 
the political strength of both democrats scared off more 
experienced gop prospects 
that strength also virtually guarantees that keyes and dawkins 
the only two blacks running for the senate this year will not 
crack the chambers color barrier the only black to be elected to 
the senate in this century was edward w brooke rmass who 
served from 1967 to 1979 
but republicans hope the two men can at least stir up excitement 
this election season and change the mix of voters in the republican 
column 
they have that tremendous speaking ability that can ignite a 
group and galvanize the party in ways that dont require a lot of 
money said tom mason a spokesman for the republican partys 
national senate campaign arm 
theyre dynamic personalities theyll form a little bit 
different coalition hopefully a little bit broader than would 
other potential candidates he said 
mason emphasized that the broader appeal is not part of a 
national gop strategy the national party did not recruit either 
man he said but both came up on their own naturally through 
republican ranks 
however the similarities in the two neighboring states do raise 
at least the appearance that the party is using the two candidates 
for its own goals in a situation where victory is only a remote 
possibility 
if it appears to be some kind of cynical attempt to use 
minority candidates in an effort to say they have them but in 
races that appear to be unwinnable it could backfire said anita 
dunn spokeswoman for the democratic senatorial campaign committee 
one political analyst sees that as a real danger 
there are a lot of things the gop can do to attract black 
voters and build bridges to the black community said charles 
cook publisher of a newsletter on politics 
the way not to do it is to take a nomination that isnt worth 
anything because of the political situation and give it to someone 
who under normal circumstances would not be able to get it and 
hand it to them when they are just going to get crucified cook 
said 
neither cook nor dunn sees much prospect that black voters will 
flock to the republican column because of the choice of gop 
nominees in maryland democrats have a 2to1 registration 
advantage in virginia a recent poll gave robb a 4to1 lead over 
dawkins 
cook points to the 1986 governors race in michigan where 
william lucas a black republican county official garnered just 31 
percent of the vote against incumbent democrat james blanchard the 
gop vote was the lowest in 150 years 
i dont know that the republican party is stronger in michigan 
as a result of that or that relations between blacks and the party 
are better off cook said i dont know what purpose it serves 
maybe its trying to cure by symbolism a substantive problem 
mason calls that explanation really reaching 
i think these fellows were not nominated on the basis of their 
race but on the basis of their capabilities as a senate 
candidate he said to say they are only black candidates is to 
really insult them

paulino estebans knowledge of reedboat 
building a craft handed down in his family for centuries high up 
in the andes on lake titicaca has made him virtually indispensible 
to modernday explorers like thor heyerdahl 
an aymara indian esteban was one of the key builders of the 
reed boat ra ii that heyerdahl sailed across the atlantic in 1970 
from morocco to barbados in an attempt to prove that similar boats 
could have been used thousands of years before columbus by 
egyptians to reach the western hemisphere 
more recently esteban built another reed boat for an attempt by 
a group of spaniards to show that early incas could also have 
sailed the pacific 
he fashioned a 70foot sailboat entirely from bulrushes called 
totora that grow wild in his native lake titicaca which is about 
three times the size of rhode island 12500 feet up in andes 
between peru and bolivia 
the roughhewn vessel with the color and texture of golden 
straw conjurs visions of inca mariners sailing into the pacific 
precisely what heyerdahl theorizes and what five spanish 
adventurers are attempting to help substantiate now on their 
attempted 7200mile voyage to new zealand from peru 
the 12ton craft is a giant version of the totora boats that 
have plied titicaca for centuries and are still widely used on the 
lake 
esteban said the ocean boats bow rising 16 feet to blunt heavy 
seas is the most noticeable departure from the traditional craft 
i believe my forefathers sailed on the ocean the 
59yearold builder added in an interview the remains of reed 
boats have been found all along the shorelines 
although he has been building totora boats purely from 
memory since he was a boy esteban said he had never seen nor 
heard of oceangoing reed craft until heyerdahl summoned him in 
1970 for ra ii 
the system of design was so simple and yet so ingenious i 
know of no other tribe or individual who would be able to duplicate 
it heyerdahl said of esteban and his crew in his book the ra 
expeditions 
heyerdahl a norwegian anthropologist recently returned to 
peru the cradle of his theories on ancient mans migrations and 
met with esteban and the spaniards at the seashore near lima where 
the pacific boat was being built 
heyerdahl watched as esteban and seven other titicaca indians 
wove and tied the thin reeds into bundles the size of telephone 
poles 
the craftsmen later joined the bundles with ropes converting 
the reeds into a massive hull that tapered toward the arching bow 
and stern other workers built a bamboo deck cabin and two masts 
there are no more builders in the world like me my name is in 
the history books esteban said referring to his being mentioned 
in heyerdahls writings 
the spaniards headed by kitin munoz 29 sailed for new zealand 
on june 29 from lima they are following the course charted in 1947 
by heyerdahl on his voyage from peru to polynesia on the balsa raft 
kontiki 
heyerdahls voyages were aimed at demonstrating that peruvian 
indians could have colonized pacific islands and that other ancient 
sailors spread their culture from the middle east thousands of 
years ago 
after ra i broke up on heavy seas in his first attempt in 1969 
to sail from morocco to south america heyerdahl sought out estaban 
on lake titicaca the indians life style and their reliance on 
reed boats to travel and fish had changed little since early inca 
times 
esteban helped build ra ii from papyrus reeds in morocco and 
heyerdahl sailed it in 1970 for 3200 miles and 57 days to barbados 
in the caribbean 
esteban was summoned again by heyerdahl seven years later to 
build the tigris a ship made from a reeds that grow in the marshes 
of iraq where ancient sumarians lived 
heyerdahl sailed the tigris 4200 miles down the persian gulf in 
1978 to pakistan and across the arabian sea to djibouti in 
northeast africa there he and his crew burned the craft to protest 
what they called unhuman elements in the world because tigris 
was barred from ports in north yemen and ethiopia 
the intent of that expedition was to see how far the sumarians 
could have gone in their early reed boats 
esteban said the boat he built for the spaniards should remain 
buoyant for the five months it takes it reach new zealand 
in titicacas icy waters the 10foot totora boats become water 
logged and rot in about a year 
esteban said the spaniards boat called uru after an ancient 
tribe that once lived on lake titicaca would probably be his last 
oceangoing craft 
he said he plans to retire on suriqui his home island on the 
bolivian side of titicaca where he runs a museum of his work and 
heyerdahls travels he also weaves and sells model reed boats to 
tourists 
his sons fermin 22 and porfirio 12 helped build the uru along 
with estebans two brothers and three nephews 
but esteban alone understands the construction of large boats 
he worries that no one will continue building them and that even 
the knack of weaving the traditional lake boats may someday be 
forgotten 
i want my children to learn this art he said but the 
indians of titicaca dont want to everyone wants wooden boats 
now

spent vials herald a robust trade in crack 
prostitutes turn tricks in stairwells robberies beatings and even 
killings are everyday risks amid the hostility and crime of new 
yorks hotels for the homeless hundreds of expectant mothers mark 
time 
these women face double jeopardy fending for a place to live 
while luckless life grows inside them 
their babies die at twice the rate of other infants in the city 
of the survivors often underweight and fallen behind even before 
they get started many never recover many of the women are unaware 
of the medical help available or ignorant of its need 
theyre usually single heads of households with two or three 
children already they have welfare checks to fetch apartments to 
seek and meager meals to cook on hotplates those grim priorities 
come before prenatal care nutrition vitamins rest and hygiene 
these are highrisk pregnancies said dr philip brickner of 
st vincents hospital which provides free care for the pregnant 
and homeless without prenatal care theres a relatively high 
risk of a premature baby or a damaged baby both of which lead to 
enormous health expense 
its a time bomb said dana hughes senior health specialist 
with the childrens defense fund in washington dc the baby 
born to a pregnant homeless woman is at tremendous disadvantage if 
it happens to survive 
dabbing tears with toilet paper hotel resident juanita williams 
talked about a daughter born in december too busy with her other 
children she neglected prenatal care the child her 10th was 
born with spina bifida a congenital defect of the nervous system 
that doctors say can be related to drug or alcohol abuse early in a 
pregnancy 
i wonder if shed be ok if i would have gotten better care i 
was on the run so much the 42yearold mother said this is 
not living i dont even know if its surviving its no place to 
raise a child you have to take it one day at a time and pray you 
get out of this hell 
efforts by the city state and volunteers to reach these fragile 
tenants are complicated by sheer numbers in five years the 
homeless population has exploded and overwhelmed a stopgap shelter 
system that scatters them all over the city in that wave came 
scores of pregnant women 
new york leads the nation with 28000 homeless according to the 
citys human resources administration and spends 312 million 
about 6 percent of its 49 billion annual budget to care for 
them the city doesnt know how many homeless women are pregnant 
but estimates by the legal aid society and the coalition for the 
homeless put the number at 500 to 800 
because the city doesnt have enough private rooms in its 29 
shelters most get emergency housing in a network of 55 hotels 
some filled with welfare recipients while others are shared with 
tourists the city acknowledging hotels make rotten shelters 
hopes to get out of them by 1993 
since 1986 the city has been under court order not to house 
pregnant women or mothers with newborns in barracksstyle shelters 
where they can be exposed to such contagious ailments as measles 
and respiratory infection 
advocates had argued the women should have private rooms they 
didnt bargain for the wretched conditions in welfare hotels 
four people may share a room as small as 9by12feet furnished 
with two bunk beds but lacking chairs or a table for meals paint 
peels from walls and ceilings food is strung on ropes to keep it 
from rats and roaches 
not all bathrooms are private afraid their children may catch a 
disease or be molested in a communal toilet some mothers make 
their youngsters relieve themselves in plastic potties or empty 
cans 
the citys cure is perhaps worse than the disease said 
arthur fried of the legal aid society 
nevertheless some homeless women desperate to escape 
congregate shelters and knowing pregnant women get private rooms 
offer to buy urine from pregnant women the city tests urine to 
verify pregnancy and a positive screening can mean a room alone 
instead of a crowded floor 
one girl said shed pay me 5 for a sample of my urine because 
she wanted a private room she was strung out on drugs and she 
wanted to do them in privacy said tracie dillard 22 who at 
eight months pregnant was staying at a city shelter in brooklyn 
urine sales do occur city officials said but followup 
pregnancy tests have not found any cheaters 
im sure its happened said gail gordon first deputy 
administrator of adult services for the human resources 
administration but its not the norm if it did happen my 
goodness how sad 
medically and financially being homeless and pregnant produces 
a harsh principle of pay now or pay more later 
infants born to mothers who lived in welfare hotels during 
pregnancy had a death rate of 25 per 1000 births according to a 
1984 study by the citys health department thats more than double 
the city rate and 25 times higher than the national rate of 10 
deaths per 1000 births 
without prenatal care babies are at least three times more 
likely to have birth weights of less than 5 pounds which means 
theyll need followup care according to the childrens defense 
fund

prenatal care which regularly checks an expectant mothers 
pulse blood pressure weight and nutrition costs 800 to 1200 
after birth a months stay in a neonatal intensive care unit can 
cost 300000 
marjorie gish a registered nurse at the lambs church prenatal 
care clinic said the plight of the citys homeless pregnant women 
reminded her of her peace corps days in a mayan village in belize 
where shoeless women walked through open pigsties and bathed in a 
stream 
there however the chief convinced of the need ordered 
pregnant women to get regular checkups a power that no authority 
wields in the largest city in the worlds wealthiest nation 
care was more readily available in the village the homeless 
and pregnant in new york are probably worse off than the women 
receiving care in third world countries said mrs gish 
the children who survive have dim prospects of a normal life 
they are the closest things you can find to refugee 
populations in underdeveloped countries said dr irwin redlener 
of new york hospital which provides pediatric care for the 
homeless through donations by singer paul simon and new york 
yankees slugger don mattingly 
they are disenfranchised cut off and undernourished a lot of 
kids are not going to recover from the psychological trauma theyve 
experienced redlener said 
you end up with a lost generation of children said stephen 
banks a lawyer with the legal aid society 
the average homeless pregnant woman is 27 years old a high 
school dropout who has two or three kids already sixtyseven 
percent are black 27 percent are hispanic like all homeless they 
qualify for medicaid 
patricia smith four months pregnant has an 8yearold daughter 
and 6monthold son everyone in her family has asthma she had 
just spent three nights in three different hotels 
im a walking zombie said mrs smith 37 clutching a 
dogeared prayer book to her bosom its like youre falling and 
theres no bottom and theres nothing to catch on to 
it makes me feel like im a failure people treat you like 
youre nothing she said im always petrified ive chased 
rats as big as alley cats away from my children but i have no 
place else to go 
frustrated social workers offer prenatal care but expectant 
mothers dont actively seek it some skip sessions to keep their 
medicaid appointments which can take two weeks to reschedule 
others loathe standing in line for hours and filling out forms at 
hospital clinics 
we knock on doors in the hotels said barbara conanan 
director of the homeless project at st vincents hospital which 
has a van to drive patients to clinics or gives them transit tokens 
to make it easier to get care 
you have to reach out some dont understand the need for 
prenatal care many of them never sought it for their other 
children theres a real lack of education ms conanan said 
in a pilot program a team from bellevue hospital identifies and 
registers pregnant women at the prince george hotel the city then 
pays their way to and from the hospital for checkups 
in addition the citys department of health has clinics inside 
three hotels which offer convenience but lack such amenities as 
private exam rooms found in a hospital or doctors office 
the state bureau of reproductive health also has a 100000 
medical van that dispenses prenatal care at five sites 
living in a hotel may sound downright cozy especially when a 
room costs taxpayers an average 2000 a month or 23725 a year 
thats enough to rent a spacious apartment or make a down payment 
on a house half the bill is paid by the federal government the 
other half is split by the city and state 
in new york however the money most commonly rents space in 
warehouses of despair such as the martinique prince george 
holland and allerton hotels expectant mothers and children are 
especially vulnerable in these hostile incubators 
drug dealers recruit homeless children as lookouts and couriers 
according to city councils select committee on the homeless other 
kids sit in hallways at night while their mothers deal sex for 
crack hotel residents said 
some hotels are brothels the committee said by day hookers 
rent rooms by the hour when business drops off at night the 
homeless move back in the beds are called hot sheets because 
nobody stays on them too long 
jacqueline macklin 31 a hotel resident since 1984 sent her 
11yearold twin daughters to live in philadelphia with their 
grandmother in 1987 after they saw a security guard shot dead by 
another guard in the holland hotel 
theres nothing a kid doesnt see in here said mrs 
macklin herself a recovering crack addict 
its a picture of the worst of our civilization said robert 
hayes founder of the coalition for the homeless 
its an abandonment of the most fragile people to the most 
devastating of environments and then we wonder why these kids are 
so irreparably harmed hayes said its insane as well as cruel 
to leave a woman in a situation that will result in a sick baby

joseph johnson homeless and dispirited sat 
with his pregnant wife and 21monthold son in a welfare office 
waiting and waiting to be told what hotel bed they would sleep in 
that night 
its like being sent on a cattle truck johnson 33 said as 
he squashed a cockroach on a wall 
just being here wears you down no human being should have to 
live under these conditions if theres a breath left in my body 
im going to get out of this system johnson said 
new york city provides private rooms for homeless pregnant women 
and their families but because not all of the 55 city hotels that 
shelter the homeless allow long stays some families are bounced 
from hotel to hotel like human pinballs the numbing ritual begins 
in the citys four emergency assistance units or eaus where an 
average of 85 families show up nightly 
on a recent rainy friday night in brooklyn johnson plopped down 
in a fiberglass chair next to his wife angela six months 
pregnant their son chewed on a pizza crust and fidgeted in a 
stroller under a dingy christmas decoration spelling out seasons 
greetings 
the johnsons welfare recipients who had been burned out of 
their apartment left their old hotel at 11 am checked in at the 
welfare office and came to the eau at 5 pm at 9 oclock they 
were assigned a hotel but the welfare check to pay for it wasnt 
processed until midnight they waited for a van and got to sleep at 
2 am the tedious process began anew within hours 
in a waiting area mothers stripped their tots to bare bottoms 
to change their clothes diapered infants napped on sheetless 
spotted mattresses inside metal cribs a nurse gave pregnancy tests 
in a restroom three security guards watched a baseball game on a 
color television placed inside a vacant crib 
well past midnight and a normal bedtime youngsters scampered 
around an untended metal detector the detectors used to check for 
concealed weapons are standard at all shelters and eaus 
plastic garbage bags and beer cases bound with string are 
luggage the homeless drag with them every night 
theresa keels 35 four months pregnant had stayed in three 
hotels in three nights 
from her bag she pulled four crumpled and unfilled prescription 
slips for asthma medication shed lost her medicaid card and was 
on the run too much to get a new one much less go for prenatal 
care 
im worried about losing this baby and not having no place to 
stay said ms keels whose aunt kicked her out of her former 
apartment its a physical and mental strain on me youre never 
settled youre running from this place to that place its a 
miserable life 
among her meager possessions was a tattered blue book on legal

new yorks effort to house homeless women who 
are also pregnant is the nations biggest most expensive and most 
criticized it is also far ahead of other cities attempts to care 
for these doubly distressed women 
no city has come up with an adequate plan to deal with the 
problem its a real tragedy said tim hager assistant director 
of the national coalition for the homeless in washington dc 
at least new york is doing something theyre just not doing 
the right thing theyre wasting millions of dollars on fleabag 
hotels instead of building adequate housing hager asserted 
new york is under court order to provide private rooms to 
pregnant women because of contagious illnesses rife in group 
shelters none of four other cities surveyed by the associated 
press has a comparable policy 
new york has a pregnancy test to screen expectant mothers the 
city state and volunteers also provide specific prenatal care 
clinics for expectant mothers a public program no other city 
offers according to the homeless coalition 
here is a brief look at the four other cities

with an unknown number of pregnant women among its estimated 
35000 to 50000 homeless los angeles says care is provided 
through state health insurance and social programs at shelters 
theres no reason not to have quality prenatal care in 
california unless youre in the country illegally or mentally 
disturbed said larry johnson assistant director of los angeles 
countys department of community and senior citizens services 
but social workers say care is hindered by the bureaucracy and 
an inadequate shelter system 
as bad as things are in new york theres probably less 
available on the whole in california said gary blasi of the 
legal aid society 
ruth schwartz a nurse with the los angeles health care project 
says health centers are overloaded and public transportation is 
inadequate 
if youre pregnant youre at the bottom of the homeless pile 
the system is in no way meeting the demand only the persistent and 
the determined keep their appointments for prenatal care ms 
schwartz said 
she said she visits families who live among church pews or in

state social workers try to contact pregnant homeless women 
about public hospitals and clinics where prenatal care is

you can theoretically have all kinds of services available 
but you have to deliver them to people said judith riley

the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 2703 points 
tuesday to finish at 215861 its highest postcrash level since 
it closed at 215220 on june 22 
a weaker dollar higher interest rates and the us navys 
downing of an iranian passenger jet over the weekend had convinced 
many traders that the stage was set for a selloff on wall street 
but while the market opened moderately lower the dow average moved 
into plus territory around midday and climbed steadily for the rest 
of the session

incident in the persian gulf saying its aftermath probably would 
not affect petroleum shipping or inflate prices 
on the new york mercantile exchange one barometer of world oil 
prices the contract for august delivery of west texas intermediate 
crude oil rose 15 cents per barrel to 1509 
traders ascribed the price rise to shortterm speculative buying 
ahead of the american petroleum institutes weekly report on us

because of world oversupply and the outlook for prices was down 
in trading of other commodities soybean futures closed sharply 
lower on the chicago board of trade as a rainy forecast diluted

irving bank corp is backing a sweetened merger 
offer from banca commerciale italiana spa which rival bank of new 
york corp contends is still inferior to its own hostile bid 
irving said on tuesday that its management had negotiated an 
amendment to the outstanding offer by banca commerciale italys 
second largest bank for 51 percent of irvings common stock to 
include a dividend in the form of stock warrants to irving 
shareholders 
irving said the sweetened offer made the overall transaction 
worth at least 7950 per share which the bank holding companys 
board of directors deemed superior to bank of new yorks best and 
final bid 
under a complex restructuring plan that also would include the 
sale of assets and a special cash dividend banca commerciale has 
offered 80 cash a share for 51 percent of irvings common stock 
or a total of about 760 million 
the new agreement also provides for irving to distribute a 
dividend in the form of stock warrants to all irving shareholders 
before the banca commerciale tender offer the warrants one for 
every four shares of irving stock would have a term of seven years 
and an exercise price of 65 per share of irving stock 
the new deal means banca commerciale would be offering the same 
amount of money for irving shares even though the shares would be 
worth less to the italian bank because of the distribution by 
irving 
irving said bcis financial adviser lazard freres amp co put 
the value of the warrants to shareholders at 4 to 7 per share of 
irving common stock 
irving stock closed at 7137 per share up 12 cents in new 
york stock exchange composite trading tuesday bank of new york 
rose 125 per share to 3612 
bank of new york responded that its bid for all of irvings 
stock remained superior 
owen brady a spokesman for bank of new york said bnys 
financial adviser morgan stanley amp co projected that if irving 
stock sold for 45 a share after a merger with bci the warrants 
effectively would add no more than 135 per share in value to 
bcis previous offer 
bank of new york which owns a 49 percent stake in irving is 
offering 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its own stock for each of 
irvings common shares outstanding the offer is valued at around 
68 a share or 12 billion 
bank of new york has offered to sweeten its offer by slightly 
raising the stock portion of the bid and adding other shareholder 
incentives including a special cash dividend if irving agreed to 
abandon its antitakeover poison pill 
the company also has gone to court seeking to remove the 
defensive mechanism which would make an unsolicited merger 
prohibitively expensive 
irving steadfastly has rejected bank of new yorks takeover 
advances which surfaced last september 
estimates of the value of the offers have differed widely the 
irving board said analyses by its advisers goldman sachs amp co 
and jp morgan amp co inc said the banca commerciale offer was 
worth 74 to 7950 a share robert felise an executive vice 
president at irving said a separate analysis by lazard freres 
valued the sweetened bci offer at 80 or more per share 
bcis advisers valued the bank of new york offer at 72 to 77 a 
share

a representative of a local gasoline dealers 
group is criticizing as anticompetitive the merger of the areas 
two largest oil companies which will give sun co inc an 
estimated 33 percent local market share 
sun the nations 10thlargest petroleum producer announced 
tuesday it planned to purchase atlantic refining and marketing 
corp for 513 million 
sun said the acquisition would help meet its needs for increased 
refining flexibility 
sun which markets sunoco gasoline operates in 27 states 
atlantic operates in pennsylvania new york and new jersey 
atlantic reportedly has 20 percent of the market share in the 
philadelphia area while sun has about 13 percent 
tom anderson executive director of the pennsylvania gasoline 
dealers associations said consumers should be concerned by the 
acquisition 
another level of competition has been eliminated he said 
its going to increase the price because atlantic was the 
cheapest on the street 
the purchase is subject to approval by the federal trade 
commission and the us justice department 
part of the deal includes a philadelphia refinery that has a 
daily capacity of 135000 barrels of crude oil and a 986mile 
pipeline that runs from philadelphia to pittsburgh in pennsylvania 
and to rochester and tonawanda ny 
sun chairman robert mcclements jr said the company will 
purchase all shares of atlantic petroleum maatschappij bv a 
netherlands holding company owned by john duess 
duess bought the atlantic properties from atlantic richfield co 
of los angeles in 1985 for 420 million when it decided to pull out 
of the region 
atlantic is a wellrun and wellmanaged company sun 
spokesman kenneth huffman said he also said atlantic would 
continue using its present logo 
sun would pay for all atlantics inventory including crude oil 
and finished products and working capital 
huffman said a major part of the deal was the acquisition of the 
philadelphia refinery which unlike suns suburban marcus hook 
facility can process crude oil classified as highsulphur and 
heavy suns refinery can handle only socalled lighter crude 
this acquisition is consistent with our objective of 
strengthening the companys position in refining and marketing 
said mcclements 
sun presently owns four refineries with a processing capacity of 
460000 barrels of crude oil daily plus 6000 sunoco stations in 
27 states in the eastern half of the us 
the atlantic refinery whose 440 employees handled 130000 
barrels a day would help sun meet its daily sales demand of 
700000 barrels in the past sun has purchased from outside sources 
atlantic also has 571 companyowned stations and supples another 
400 independent stations 
besides marcus hook sun has refineries in toledo ohio tulsa 
okla and yabucoa puerto rico

possible regulatory changes stemming from the 
october stock market crash could threaten this citys position as a 
major financial center according to a new report by local 
government and business 
chicago is the world capital of hedging through its futures 
and options exchanges but changes linked to criticism of those 
markets following the crash threaten that dominance said the 
report prepared by the citys economic development commission and 
the civic committee of the commercial club of chicago 
in particular regulatory action could reduce the volume and 
liquidity of trading here and could cause the chicago exchanges to 
lose their international leadership to exchanges that operate with 
fewer restrictions stated the report released tuesday 
to prevent that the citys political and business leaders must 
unite to lobby against new government regulation of chicagos 
exchanges the report recommends 
the city also must improve its public schools and reduce its 
business taxes to expand its financialservices economy the report 
recommends 
many executives interviewed stated that chicagos development 
as a financial services center is hindered by the poor education 
provided by the chicago public schools it said 
the report called specifically for public schools to do a better 
job training students in computer literacy and typing skills 
mayor eugene sawyer said his staff was studying how to institute 
the reports recommendations 
chicago ranks third in the nation behind new york and los 
angeles with 330000 financialservices jobs and trails in such 
global businesses as international banking and money management 
the report said 
it is worldclass in trading but lags london new york and 
tokyo as a broadbased financial capital the report says 
instead of competing headon with those cities chicago must 
capitalize on its strength as a leader in global risk 
management and work to attract new financial businesses in such 
fields as insurance and banking the report states 
internationally chicago is the center of risk management the 
world capital of hedging the report says 
the city has four major exchanges the chicago board of trade 
and the chicago mercantile exchange which together have 60 percent 
of the world futures markets the chicago board options exchange 
which has nearly 60 percent of the global options market and the 
midwest stock exchange one of the worlds top five exchanges for 
trading equities 
the report recommends establishing a risk management center 
committee comprised of business executives and economists the 
committee would act partly as a public relations unit to promote 
chicagos image as a financial services center 
it also would help coordinate the introduction of new financial 
services products in chicago and create an institute at a local 
university to train people in risk management services

three opec member states are considering a call 
for an emergency meeting of the 13nation cartel if world oil 
prices continue to weaken the kuwait news agency reported tuesday 
citing highlevel senior industry sources the news agency said 
consultations were under way among officials from venezuela 
algeria and ecuador 
the unnamed sources told the news agency the three nations have 
not officially contacted other members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries about the proposed meeting 
the agency quoted its sources as saying some opec nations would 
give a positive response to a call for an emergency session 
but they said major member states may not accept because there 
is no guarantee an emergency meeting would have a positive effect 
on the cartels policies or oil markets 
the agency did not elaborate but the reference to nations which 
might object to an emergency meeting apparently meant kuwait and 
saudi arabia 
both opec states have opposed calls for emergency sessions 
without first establishing clear objectives 
the news agency said its sources hinted that venezuela algeria 
and ecuador might ask opec secretary general subroto the former 
indonesian oil minister to canvass member states about support for 
an emergency meeting 
last month the opec nations decided to extend until the end of 
1988 the production and pricing agreement reached last year 
however several cartel members are overproducing in violation of 
opecs overall 1506 million barrelsaday ceiling 
the agencys sources acknowledged severe weakness in the world 
oil market but they cautioned that without firm policy commitments 
prior to any emergency opec meeting an ineffectual session could 
increase the chaos 
the sources noted that overproduction and the definition of 
exactly what constitutes crude oil production are key issues which 
would have to be addressed

industry about dram availability and are hopeful the problem is 
corrected soon the company said 
the increase follows similar moves by digital equipment corp

a major postcrash reform that bars program 
trading during times of volatility in the stock market is expected 
to be dropped by the new york stock exchange a published report 
said today 
the nyse plans to phase out by the fall its socalled 
collar which bars index arbitragers from using the automated

declines at least 50 points in a day the wall street journal said 
quoting unnamed industry sources 
index arbitragers buy and sell large amounts of stocks and stock 
index futures profiting on price disparities between the two 
related instruments

into the market

individual investor is at a disadvantage and we want to say that 
it is not true thats the push behind this rule 
both proposals are expected to be considered by the nyses board 
of directors at a regular monthly meeting thursday according to 
the newspapers 
nyse spokeswoman sharon gamsin said she could not comment on 
what issues the board would consider at thursdays meeting 
however she noted the collar enacted in february had been set 
to expire after six months unless the exchange decided to extend it 
when the collar was put in place it had a sunset provision in 
it it was never meant to be permanant ms gamsin said 
the collar was enacted as a way of reforming the us stocks and 
futures markets in the wake of the oct 19 crash 
critics have complained the collar is ineffective and may even 
add to the volatility it was designed to curb for one thing they 
said sophisticated program traders could get around the collar by 
having their orders distributed on the trading floor manually by 
brokers 
market regulators also were cool on the idea when the 
securities and exchange commission approved it for a sixmonth 
trial it asked the exchange to consider other alternatives to 
curbing market volatility 
however proponents say market swings of 50 points or more have 
become less frequent because of the collar

the pentagon has sharply increased the number 
of inspectors trying to spot fraud among defense contractors but 
still more are needed and they are not likely to be added the 
defense departments inspector general said today 
given the defense departments projected budget shortfalls 
for the coming years i am pessimistic that the investigative 
organizations will get the additional resources they need june 
gibbs brown told the house armed services committee 
she did not speak specifically about details of the ongoing 
criminal investigation into fraud and bribery allegations among 
pentagon contractors and consultants 
but she said the pentagon has about 1000 people who do nothing 
but investigate fraud a sharp increase from 1982 when 375 were 
assigned to that task 
in spite of these impressive gains i remain concerned over 
the resources available to the defense criminal investigation 
organizations for the detection and investigation of fraud she 
said 
at least 450 more fraud investigators are needed she said 
confusion surrounds defense secretary frank carluccis hurried 
announcement of contract suspensions in response to the widening 
pentagon bribery probe with officials unable to say which projects 
are covered 
pentagon spokesman dan howard said tuesday that the defense 
department is still trying to implement carluccis order 
howard suggested carluccis announcement was a response to 
clamoring in congress and elsewhere for the pentagon to do 
something to restore its credibility in the midst of the criminal 
investigation 
we had people here and people on the capitol hill demanding 
immediate action to suspend people to suspend contracts howard 
said when asked to explain the timing of fridays announcement 
defense contractors say they are still waiting for formal 
notification of the contract suspensions 
were in the dark said cohann whitney a trw inc 
spokeswoman 
weve received no official notification and until we do were 
going ahead with production the work will continue said robert 
knapp a spokesman for litton industries 
trw is taking the same position were working with the navy 
to try to get some clarification on the announcement ms whitney 
said 
carlucci announced last friday he was ordering an immediate 
suspension of what pentagon officials said were 1 billion worth of 
contracts he said he was acting because the pacts may be tainted 
by the bribery allegations 
the investigation centers on allegations that defense 
contractors and consultants many of them former defense officials 
bribed pentagon officials for contracting details that could be 
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
asked for details of the contract suspensions howard said we 
worked that one very quickly and we gave you the best information 
we had 
but he admitted i dont know the answer when asked which 
contracts are involved or whether the freeze affects contractors 
and subcontractors alike 
navy officials were trying tuesday to figure out how to 
implement carluccis order 
were working on it were still trying to figure out the 
details lt barbara kent a spokeswoman for the navy said late 
tuesday 
at a hastily called news conference late friday afternoon 
carlucci said he was acting on the basis of information in 
affidavits that had been unsealed a day earlier by a federal 
magistrate in dallas the fbi said in the affidavits that its 
wiretaps had recorded a navy procurement officer passing along 
inside information to consultants about contracts 
pentagon officials have said one of the affected contracts is 
between the navy and litton to build handheld computers for the 
marines for use in transmitting targeting information 
but knapp said work on the contract will go ahead until litton 
receives official word 
the contract was awarded in 1982 and the remainder of the pact 
is worth 235 million according to john george a spokesman for 
litton the devices are produced by littons colorado springs 
colo plant which employs about 100 people he said 
another pact identified as being covered by the order is between 
the navy and trw inc to build new operating centers for 
antisubmarine warfare it was let in october 1987 and is for 367 
million ms whitney said 
to the best of our knowledge trw is not one of the companies 
involved in this probe and we have no idea why this action was 
taken she said we are working with the navy to try to get 
some clarification on carluccis announcement 
asked how long the freeze would last howard said i cant 
give you a blackandwhite answer on that at this point 
he added were looking at it were looking at it very 
carefully and im aware of this concern that you may be punishing 
the innocent along with the guilty this is no judgment of ultimate 
innocence or guilt freezing these contracts it simply seems a 
prudent step to take until we do sift through the evidence 
the spokesman added that we did not have to go to trial and 
conviction in order to take this step nor do i think it would be 
essential that we would go through trial and conviction in order to 
unfreeze a contract if as the evidence unfolds its clear that 
theyre not involved 
howard indicated the pentagon was responding to pressure 
particularly from outraged legislators but said it waited until 
the affidavits spelled out specific allegations before acting 
we said we cant do that we cant do that unless we have some 
evidence we had an affidavit come down that had some evidence 
he said we took immediate action 
house armed services chairman les aspin dwis joined by a 
number of other lawmakers had urged carlucci to do something 
dramatic to restore credibility as increasing numbers of 
contracts were called into question

morrison knudsen corp has filed suit 
against illinois businessman edward f heil charging him with 
filing a false and misleading statement with federal regulators 
the boisebased construction engineering and shipbuilding 
company charged in the suit filed tuesday that edward f heil did 
not disclose in documents filed with the securities and exchange 
commission the nature of a civil suit brought against him and 
others by the state of illinois over a major chicago convention 
center project 
heil the president of environmental construction co of downers 
grove ill made the sec filing following his purchase of 62 
percent of morrison knudsens stock federal regulations require 
anyone buying more than 5 percent of a companys stock to reveal 
their reasons for the acquisition to sec 
morrison knudsen officials said the illinois attorney generals 
office charged heil and two companies he controls with trying to 
defraud the illinois metropolitan fair and exposition authority in 
connection with the mccormick place annex a recently completed 
expansion of the mccormick place exhibition hall in chicago 
ileen lasko of the illinois attorney generals office said heil 
was one of 14 contracting companies named in the civil suit which 
seeks 7 million in restitution and damages from the defendants 
in the suit illinois attorney general neil f hartigan charged 
the contractors with submitting phony bills for labor and materials 
through dummy minority contractors 
heil said in his sec filing his purchase of 670300 shares of 
morrison knudsen common stock for 288 million was intended as an 
investment and to gain a seat on the companys board 
wall street analysts have dismissed a possible takeover attempt 
of morrison knudsen by heil 
the illinois suit seeks to bar any company of which heil is a 
director from doing business with public authorities in the state 
morrison knudsens suit charged heil failed to disclose to the sec 
what effect his presence on the board would have on its recently 
awarded 156 million construction contract with the metropolitan 
sanitary district of greater chicago 
morrison knudsen claimed heils involvement could also affect 
its bid on a large railcar refurbishment contract with the chicago 
transit authority and a third illinois project under consideration

grain and soybean futures opened narrowly mixed 
today on the chicago board of trade amid conflicting signals about 
the condition of the crops and the potential for further drought 
damage 
this is the first quiet opening weve had in a long long 
time said walter spilka a grain analyst in new york with smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
on the bullish side forecasts for recordbreaking heat and 
continued dryness in the midwest this week threatened further 
damage to the soybean and corn crops especially with corn entering 
its critical pollination stage spilka said 
on the other hand recent rains in the northern plains the 
southeast and the mississippi delta region and forecasts for rain 
in the midwest next week have tempered drought fears among 
traders already nervous about high prices 
spilka said the rain may tempt farmers in the delta and 
southeast to plant more soybeans 
the agriculture departments weekly cropprogress reports 
released late tuesday also had a calming effect spilka said the 
reports showed less deterioration in the corn crop last week than 
some had expected and indicated little new damage to the soybean 
crop 
in early trading wheat was 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in july at 389 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 2 cents lower with july at 342 a bushel oats were 
2 cents to 3 cents lower with july at 319 a bushel soybeans

government officials announced today an 
agreement between eastern air lines unions and management 
designed to ease labor tensions and enhance safety at the carrier 
under the pact a series of committees will be set up to hear 
grievances and to handle disputes over safety procedures 
today we propose a process within which parties can begin to 
address safety former labor secretary william e brock who was 
appointed last month to referee easterns ongoing labor troubles 
told a news conference it recognizes that the public safety must 
not suffer at the hands of a collective bargaining dispute 
transportation secretary james h burnley iv called the pact a 
good beginning but cautioned that the airlines workers and 
executives would have to work hard to make it effective 
all of the parties have agreed to a series of actions that 
have the potential to reduce substantially the threat to safety 
from labormanagement discord burnley said if the agreement 
is implemented in good faith that potential will be fully 
realized 
among the issues that labormanagement committees to be 
established will handle are the plane captains authority aircraft 
maintenance training and workers access to maintenance information 
kept by the company 
the agreement was signed tuesday evening by frank lorenzo 
chairman of eastern and other airline and labor leaders after 
four hours of bargaining that was overseen by brock 
tuesdays session ended with brock saying more work was needed 
a good deal of progress has been made but no final agreement 
was reached because certain participants required further 
consultations with their senior officials he said 
brock was named to try to bring the two sides together on june 
2 the day transportation department and federal aviation 
administration officials released their report on easterns labor 
turmoil 
the report written after government investigators studied 
eastern texas air and continental airlines another texas air 
subsidiary concluded that easterns labor troubles had to be 
solved before they became a threat to safety 
the bitter labormanagement relations were sparked by the 
efforts of texas air corp easterns parent compenay to exact 
wage concessions from easterns unions and to sell off many of the 
airlines most profitable parts 
management argued that the sales were meant to raise cash for 
the moneylosing eastern while unions said the real goal was to 
weaken the labor organizations 
texas air announced last friday that it had abandoned efforts to 
sell easterns washingtonnew yorkboston shuttle service to 
another subsidiary 
also attending tuesdays meeting were eastern president phil 
bakes mary jane barry president of local 553 of the transport 
workers union of america representing flight attendants charles 
bryan president of lodge 100 of the international association of

marjory williams has seen her life take several 
dramatic shifts 
moving to hong kong from boston was one and when she began to 
teach american literature she thought that was a pretty big move 
away from english literature 
little did i know the shifts to come she now says 
ms williams 44 is the founder and sole owner of a chain of 17 
career womens clothing stores that enjoyed just under 5 million 
in sales in 1987 
seven of the stores called she are in minneapolis where ms 
williams company is based the rest under the name laura caspari 
her greatgrandmothers name are in san francisco washington 
dc st louis chicago and detroit 
this wasnt the work ms williams expected to do when she 
graduated from wellesley college in the mid1960s 
when the chicago native left wellesley women had few job 
options and business wasnt one of them ms williams recalled in 
a recent interview 
one didnt talk about a career path she said either you 
were getting married right away or you went to katie 
katherine gibbs in boston and you got your secretarial training 
or you taught or you went to graduate school 
i just had a little bit more sense of adventure ms 
williams said so she chose the third option but in hong kong 
she spent 2 years teaching english literature at chinese 
university and then moved to india where she switched topics and 
taught american literature at the university of bombay for three 
years 
ms williams married while in india and had a son but in 1972 
when her child was 8 months old she decided to get a divorce and 
return to the united states with no job and the responsibility of 
single parenthood weighing heavily on her 
i was starting at zero she said i had to think what am 
i going to do 
her natural inclination was to pursue a doctorate in literature 
but the expenses of four years of study made that idea impractical 
college placement officials and relatives advised ms williams 
to stick to traditional womens roles such as librarian or 
secretary she knew those jobs did not suit her personality 
but the seeds of an idea planted in bombay had begun to take 
root and ms williams found herself turning toward business 
while i had been in india i was struck by the adventure that 
i felt in the business community she said 
with india having won its independence only in 1947 business 
people were selfmade men or their fathers were she said you 
had this very entrepreneurial spirit 
ms williams believes that spirit inspired her 
i decided business was probably a good idea she said i 
felt it would be interesting and at the same time it would meet the 
practical needs i would have 
the road to becoming a businesswoman was a bumpy one when she 
inquired about a degree from harvard business school she was 
turned away for lack of practical experience 
so she got a job as an assistant at boston financial technology 
group in 18 months ms williams worked her way up to manager of a 
real estate portfolio and vice president and was now ready for 
harvard 
after business school she became an assistant buyer with dayton 
hudson corp the minneapolisbased retailer where in 1978 she 
thought of selling womens career clothes in a specialty store 
format 
she suggested the concept to her bosses but the idea was 
deemed too risky and too unlikely at the time 
so i went out the next year and i did do it myself ms 
williams said 
with a small business administrationbacked loan ms williams 
opened four stores in her first 12 months as an entrepreneur the 
company took in 400000 that first year and has grown steadily 
ms williams honored for her achievements by the state of 
minnesota and the national association of women business owners 
exudes enthusiasm about her company and retailing as she talks 
about her work her speech quickens and she waves her hands for 
emphasis 
she oversees a staff of 140 employees to whom she delegates 
strongly but she does the fashion buying which has given her a 
few headaches over the years 
one occurred over the past year when fashion gurus proclaimed 
the miniskirt was back ms williams found her customers like many 
other working women balking at the idea 
the feedback i was hearing in our stores didnt support the 
idea that they were going to be comfortable wearing shorter 
skirts she said 
in a poll of customers only 2 percent said they preferred 
skirts above the knee and 72 percent asked if they would buy 
shorter skirts for work said no 
ms williams decided to buy just a few short skirts while other 
retailers flooded their stores with them the shorter lengths 
barely budged at she and laura caspari branches ending up on 
sale racks 
but ms williams found she wasnt immune from the fallout from 
the miniskirt controversy overall sales did temporarily dip 
because customers werent sure what to do 
customers would come in and theyd like the longer lengths 
she said but theyd say i dont want to invest in a length if 
its going to go out of style 
this wasnt the first time ms williams had to gamble on fashion 
trends in 1982 she said the fashion market declared women no 
longer wanted to wear classic clothing exactly what she was 
selling 
but ms williams theorized the problem was too many retailers 
offering career clothes she found customers werent ready to 
abandon the conservative look 
i bought against the markets advice she said and we did 
have a terrifically successful year 
another success was the development of the companys own private 
label fashions 
women were finding there were dozens upon dozens of the 
identicl thing blazers and skirts on rack after rack in store 
after store she said what we started to hear from our 
customers was i want something a little more exclusive 
her constant efforts at staying in touch with customers is part 
of ms williams emphasis on customer service which she calls 
critical 
the customer should feel as though she owns the store she 
said 
ms williams style mirrors one she said retailers used to have 
your oldtime retailers were really out there listening to 
what their customers said and responding immediately she 
said 
retailers must have the ability to change quickly she said 
its good to have goals and its good to have priorities but 
its critical to plan flexibly she said

when members of president jose sarneys 
entourage carried japanesemade personal computers on a recent trip 
to the united nations journalists wondered whether the brazilian 
officials were flouting their own trade laws 
the incident highlighted a controversial computer industry 
protection law that keeps large chunks of brazils growing computer 
market offlimits to foreignowned multinationals 
on june 8 one day after he addressed the united nations sarney 
was asked at a news conference to comment on the computers his 
answer was a terse all i will say is that now i will take 
another question later an official denial of any wrongdoing was 
issued 
for more than a decade local companies have been protected by 
the socalled market reserve policy that gives them the 
exclusive right to manufacture and sell microcomputers and 
minicomputers in the country 
multinationals such as unisys corp and international business 
machines corp are allowed only to produce and market the more 
powerful mainframe computers 
almost four years ago this practice was formalized with passage 
of brazils controversial informatics law 
it has frustrated computer companies from the united states and 
other countries wanting a greater share of what local press reports 
say is the worlds sixthlargest computer market after the united 
states japan west germany britain and france 
the laws advocates say that without market reserve local firms 
would never survive the competition from multinationals and brazil 
would never achieve technological autonomy 
according to the special secretariat of informatics the 
government agency that sets the rules for the computer industry 
the number of local companies in the sector went from nine to 350 
in little more than 10 years the number of multinationals rose 
from two to just 30 
more than half of brazils 326 billion computer market last 
year was kept offlimits to foreign firms 
marketreserve opponents concede the policy was instrumental in 
developing a thriving domestic computer industry but they say it 
has outlived its usefulness and now prevents brazil from obtaining

market reserve they say is responsible for brazils producing 
more expensive and obsolete clones of foreign computers the policy 
has spawned a growing black market which press reports estimate at 
some 300 million worth of computers and components a year 
geraldo moura press spokesman of the finance ministry said 
there were no official figures on the volume or value of computers 
smuggled into the country but he said computer smuggling was 
widespread and a very easy thing to get away with 
one of the laws major opponents is the united states which 
claims its industry has suffered some 2 billion in lost sales 
because of what it considers an unfair brazilian trade practice 
last year the united states was on the verge of imposing trade 
sanctions against brazil because of what it considered an unfair 
interpretation of the socalled equivalency principle used to 
determine what foreign software programs could enter the country 
under this principle foreign software could be imported as long 
as no locally made equivalent was available 
after lengthy negotiations the sanctions were suspended in june 
1987 when the united states received assurances the software issue 
would receive fairer treatment 
but a few months later the informatics secretariat banned the 
entry of the msdos software program produced by microsoft corp in 
retaliation president reagan announced on nov 13 his intention to 
raise tariffs of brazilian exports to the united states 
brazil soon started backtracking and in january decided to allow 
microsoft to market its msdos 33 the most sophisticated version 
of the operating system software for personal computers 
two months later the informatics secretariat refused to license 
a locally made computer that apple computer inc charged was a copy 
of its macintosh model 
and in may sarney signed a law that makes it easier for 
foreignmade software programs to enter the country and offers 
copyright protection for the authors of software programs 
the informatics secretariat believes it has taken sufficient 
steps to avoid trade retaliation by the united states and does not 
expect sanctions to be imposed said murilo ramos a spokesman 
one western diplomat who requested anonymity agreed saying 
the trade sanctions will probably once again be suspended because 
at least for the moment there is no reason for retaliations 
but while brazil seems to be inching towards a more flexible 
stance on its market reserve policy it has no intention of 
abandoning it at least not in the foreseeable future 
jose ezil veiga da rocha head of the informatics secretariat 
said brazilian companies will continue receiving government 
protection until they can stand on their own two feet and compete 
on the international market he did not want to predict how long 
this would take

bowling is making a comeback of sorts 
with yuppies and an olympic exhibition thanks in part to a 
company that has called this lake michigan city home for the past 
82 years 
having helped rejuvenate the sport with remodeled centers 
automatic scoring screens and livelier pins brunswick bowling and 
billiards corp is among those basking in the glow of a bowling 
renaissance 
bowling is finally getting the recognition it deserves as a 
competitive sport and its about time said thomas r weigt 
president and general manager of the division 
the only thing missing at the brunswick plant here is the crack 
of the ball crashing against the pins and maybe the beer 
almost everything else one would expect to see at a bowling 
alley can be found at the 1 millionsquarefoot plant bowling 
balls pins lanes and electronic scorekeepers are manufactured and 
distributed worldwide from the muskegon operation which is a 
division of the 2 billion skokie illbased brunswick corp 
though brunswick is practically synonymous with bowling the 
bowling division with 550 employees represents less than 10 
percent of the parent corporations business the major business 
over the last several years has come from its pleasure boating 
operations and marine engine businesses 
still the 143yearold company remains a leader in the bowling 
equipment industry along with rival amf bowling cos inc 
as a major promoter of the sport brunswick plans to be a 
principal sponsor this summer when bowling is rolled out as an 
exhibition sport in the olympics 
in addition to lobbying for olympic status brunswick has been 
at the forefront of product development the companys urethane 
ball the rhino was introduced two years ago and has been highly 
successful a new line of brightly colored balls for children was 
introduced in january brunswick calls them the odd balls 
altogether the company makes six series of balls in dozens of 
weights and colors they include the traditional rubber ball which 
can retail for as little as 25 the middleofthe line polyester 
ball and the topoftheline rhino which can retail up to 130 
the company has introduced a more durable nyloninjected pin 
the brunswick flyer which increases pin action and can boost 
scores the company is providing pins for the olympics 
brunswicks bowling lanes now are synthetic which make them 
easier to care for than wood lanes and provide a more consistent 
rolling surface the approximately 70foot lanes are shipped in 
20foot segments 
brunswick recreation centers division in skokie the biggest 
operator of bowling centers in the country has opened 12 new 
flashy centers since 1983 in the sun belt one of them has a 
stateoftheart fitness center attached 
we call them bowling centers now weigt said were 
trying to change bowlings image bowlings always been tied to 
ralph kramden and archie bunker and were trying to show that 
its not at all a lowclass kind of sport 
part of the modernization effort centers around brunswicks 
as80 colorvision automatic scorer which is manufactured in 
muskegon 
its taken all the work out of bowling weigt said of the 
product introduced in 1983 and now in nearly 20 percent of the 
approximately 8000 bowling centers in the country 
the automatic scorers also can double as video screens and 
proprietors can use them to show videotapes or even live 
television at garden bowl in detroit the oldest center in 
michigan the screens are used for music videos on certain nights 
to draw teenagers for rock n bowl 
weve got neon lighting too manager david zainea said 
such promotions are relatively new for the bowling industry but 
they are long overdue said bryan collins vice president of 
marketing at brunswicks bowling division 
were seeing remodeled centers with such things as nosmoking 
sections collins said these things are finally being 
addressed surveys are finally being done to find out whos 
bowling 
demographic surveys of the nations 22 million casual bowlers 
and 8 million league bowlers are the job of the national bowling 
council the industrys advertising arm 
our profiles show that todays average bowler is younger more 
affluent better educated and more family oriented than the 
national average said robbie puno marketing services manager 
for the council 
more and more professionals doctors lawyers and accountants 
among them are joining leagues said jerry rangel director of 
marketing services for bowling proprietors of america 
owners are spending a lot of money on remodeling to attract 
the socalled yuppie market he said weve gone from hard 
plastic chairs and formica to carpeting and earth tones its to 
make it look more like a country club than a bowling alley 
one of the reasons professional people are drawn to the game is 
its ability to relieve stress collins said 
theres nothing like taking a heavy ball and throwing it at 
something to get rid of stress he said

late at night after most people have turned off the lights and 
gone to bed the party is just beginning on telephone lines across 
the country where the lonely make friends and the wimp becomes 
macho 
hi this is baby boy looking for baby girl said one 
latenight caller on a party line serving washington dc and the 
nearby maryland suburbs 
baby girl apparently wasnt at that party but it was hard to 
tell with the chaotic jumble of voices and occasional bursts of 
obscenities and sexual directions on the line 
i want you new york another male caller said during a 
moment of calm 
i want you too a woman answered 
party lines like this one can take the loneliness out of living 
for many at least those willing to pay as much as 2 per minute of 
anonymous conversation 
among an estimated 400 talk services nationwide are dating lines 
for adult singles and gays lines for teenagers lines for 
discussions about politics and sports even lines where callers can 
exchange trivia or pick up a joke to tell the next day at the 
office 
i just like making new friends said john explaining why he 
has become a regular on one of the 20 or so party lines available 
to district of columbia callers 
like many others john calls nearly every night to see whats 
happening and occasionally to find a date 
its a very popular service said betsy superfon vice 
president of seattlebased omnicall one of the largest party line 
operators in the country people are lonely and want to reach out 
and talk to people its somebody to talk to who isnt charging 
you to sit on his couch 
it can also be a fantasy land of illusion 
you can be anything you want on the telephone she said 
sometimes it seems every girl is blonde with blue eyes and is 
going to be a doctor and every man has dark hair green eyes and 
drives a porsche 
about half the callers dial in just to listen and most of the 
others call just to talk anonymously superfon said but officials 
at other lines estimate that as many as 60 percent of callers want 
to meet their newfound friends in person 
we have people finding jobs weve had a couple of marriages 
and countless close friends said jim day marketing director 
for baltimorebased jaali inc for people who are lonely or new 
in town its a unique way to meet its an opportunity for minds 
to meet before finding out the belt size 
the idea for gab lines started in brazil when local businessman 
luiz carlos bravo noticed that when phone lines for his recorded 
dialajoke service got crossed inadvertently turning the 
service into a party line the volume of calls went up 
people enjoyed talking to each other he said they didnt 
care about the jokes 
the idea spread to england and then the united states 
party lines now operate in 24 states and the district of 
columbia though no chat lines operate in new jersey and delaware 
callers in those states can reach lines in pennsylvania and new 
york 
these lines produced an estimated 90 million for phone 
companies and vendors last year according to the information 
industry bulletin an industry newsletter 
not everyone is high on these gab lines though state public 
utility commissions and telephone companies say by far the most 
complaints come from parents whose children have run up huge bills 
on the lines phone companies usually forgive the charges for 
firsttime complainers and most offer blocking to prevent use of a 
phone for such calls also some states limit the price party lines 
can charge keeping rates as low as 10 cents a minute in some areas 
kids get on these lines and talk for hours said philip 
diehl director of telephone regulation for the texas public 
utility commission 
texas and southwestern bell had tried to prohibit live 
conversation on dialit lines but companies challenged the ban 
as an infringement of their free speech rights and prevented the 
phone company from cutting them off 
in california pacific bell also is locked in a battle to pull 
the plug on party lines 
we think that if chat lines are to exist they need to have 
some special safeguards to ensure that consumers are protected 
said pacific bell spokeswoman sandy hale 
pacific bell tried to run a talk line a few years ago but 
there were too many problems hale said despite monitors on the 
lines the talk often turned sexually explicit and callers violated 
the rule on anonymity by giving out names addresses and phone 
numbers 
many talkline companies say they have monitors on their lines 
to make sure the conversations remain anonymous but that rule is 
often broken on most services callers can request to be moved to 
a private line where such information can be exchanged without 
announcing it to others on the party line 
the monitors are also supposed to keep conversations clean and 
cut off abusive callers but claudia dulude president of the ixl 
group a denverbased market research firm in the dialit industry 
believes that even with monitors its virtually impossible to rid 
chat lines of sexual talk 
i tried running a clean talk line as part of her research 
and i couldnt do it im a professor at the university of 
colorado a harvard business school graduate and a mother of two i 
tried to do it but i couldnt she said 
the aids scare has made gay dating lines among the most 
successful talk lines with high volume and fewer bad debt problems 
than other lines she said 
many big cities are becoming saturated with talk lines new york 
telephone has about 20 lines in the new york metropolitan area 
applications pending for twice that many and more are coming in 
every day said spokesman steven marcus 
but some are leaving too phone medium inc of mill valley 
calif which has whittled down its inventory of party lines to 
two has made a business decision to phase out the live 
services said spokesman bob stevenson 
they are somewhat more prone to abuse by the customer than 
recorded programs weve had some difficulty with 
conversations on the line and people unwilling to pay for them 
for companies dulude said entry to the market is easy and 
relatively inexpensive about 5000 will buy the necessary 
equipment and a phone line 
but easy entry and saturated markets combined with complaints 
and bad debt mean a short lifespan for companies in the industry 
she believes 
i think theyre absolutely a fad she said politically 
theyll go out of favor as their revenue decreases the phone 
companies will say its not worth it to them

while eastern airlines has a long history of stormy relations 
with its unions other major us airlines also have been dogged by 
labor troubles 
financially ailing pan am corp has been trying for months to 
wrest pay cuts and other concessions from three of its unions the 
nations eighth largest airline stepped up the pressure on the 
holdout unions last month by threatening to sell most of its assets 
if the concessions are not made 
the pan am unions representing pilots and flight engineers have 
agreed to cuts totaling about 240 million over three years but 
the flight attendants teamsters and transport workers have refused 
to go along 
to ensure its financial recovery pan am needs labor concessions 
totaling around 540 million over three years analysts and company 
sources estimate the carrier posted a net loss of 833 million in 
the first quarter 
northwest airlines the fourth largest us carrier narrowly 
averted a strike by its 6700 flight attendants in late march when 
it reached a tentative contract agreement with them the st paul 
minnbased airline said its net loss of 435 million in the first 
quarter was partly due to the strike threat 
wage scales pensions and work rules were among the major issues 
in the dispute former republic airlines flight attendants had been 
working under their old contract since northwest acquired republic 
in 1986 and many former republic employees were paid less than 
their northwest counterparts

government officials announced today an 
agreement between eastern air lines unions and management 
designed to ease labor tensions and enhance safety at the carrier 
under the pact a series of committees will be set up to hear 
grievances and to handle disputes over safety procedures 
today we propose a process within which parties can begin to 
address safety former labor secretary william e brock who was 
appointed last month to referee easterns ongoing labor troubles 
told a news conference it recognizes that the public safety must 
not suffer at the hands of a collective bargaining dispute 
transportation secretary james h burnley iv called the pact a 
good beginning but cautioned that the airlines workers and 
executives would have to work hard to make it effective 
all of the parties have agreed to a series of actions that 
have the potential to reduce substantially the threat to safety 
from labormanagement discord burnley said if the agreement 
is implemented in good faith that potential will be fully 
realized 
among the issues that labormanagement committees to be 
established will handle are the plane captains authority aircraft 
maintenance training and workers access to maintenance information 
kept by the company 
the agreement was signed tuesday evening by frank lorenzo 
chairman of eastern and other airline and labor leaders after 
four hours of bargaining that was overseen by brock 
charles bryan president of lodge 100 of the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers told reporters in 
miami that he was optimistic and hopeful that the agreement 
would ease labor tensions but said he believed relations with 
management would not improve overnight 
we dont think this is going to be a total cure for all the 
problems of eastern said bryan whose union represents mechanics 
and baggage handlers 
tuesdays session ended with brock saying more work was needed 
a good deal of progress has been made but no final agreement 
was reached because certain participants required further 
consultations with their senior officials he said 
brock was named to try to bring the two sides together on june 
2 the day transportation department and federal aviation 
administration officials released their report on easterns labor 
turmoil 
the report written after government investigators studied 
eastern texas air and continental airlines another texas air 
subsidiary concluded that easterns labor troubles had to be 
solved before they became a threat to safety 
the bitter labormanagement relations were sparked by the 
efforts of texas air corp easterns parent compenay to exact 
wage concessions from easterns unions and to sell off many of the 
airlines most profitable parts 
management argued that the sales were meant to raise cash for 
the moneylosing eastern while unions said the real goal was to 
weaken the labor organizations 
texas air announced last friday that it had abandoned efforts to 
sell easterns washingtonnew yorkboston shuttle service to 
another subsidiary 
also attending tuesdays meeting were eastern president phil 
bakes mary jane barry president of local 553 of the transport 
workers union of america representing flight attendants charles 
bryan president of lodge 100 of the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers representing mechanics and jack

consumer advocate ralph nader asserted 
wednesday that lloyds of london has an unregulated secretive 
role in the us insurance industry and was a major force behind 
the nationwide liability crisis 
he said the giant insurance underwriting exchange looking for 
ways to make up losses sustained during highly publicized internal 
scandals helped spawn higher rates in the united states and 
reduced compensation for victims in liability cases 
nader added his voice to recent charges by a number of states 
that the insurance industry touched off the crisis by conspiring to 
stop providing some kinds of liability coverage 
he released a report titled goliath lloyds of london in the 
united states which charged that lloyds was a driving force 
behind the commercial insurance crisis of the mid1980s 
lloyds wields its influence in the united states primarily as a 
reinsurer providing insurance for us companies in exchange for 
sharing the risk of their own policies as such it dictates to a 
remarkable degree both the rate and policy decisions in the us 
propertycasualty insurance industry nader contended at a news 
conference 
it is a foreign unregulated secretive powerful lever on who 
gets insurance when and at what price in the united states 
whether it is the ability of a day care center a trucking firm a 
school a hospital a mass transit system or a farmer to get 
affordable insurance nader said 
lloyds of london spokesman david larner said we have not 
seen the report and we are not going to comment until we have had a 
chance to study it 
the 300yearold lloyds has in the last decade faced a series 
of insurance scandals and suffered heavy losses insuring ships and 
cargos in the persian gulf 
as a result nader asserted lloyds in the mid1980s saw an 
opportunity in the united states and by generating a fictional 
impression that there is a litigation explosion and a lawsuit 
crisis in the united states worked with us companies for 
legislation reducing victims rights in liability cases and 
restrictions on coverage for various policies 
that resulted in increased rates for what coverage could be had 
and the ensuing crisis he said 
this year 18 states have filed lawsuits accusing 32 insurance 
companies and underwriting agencies of engaging in secret 
agreements to eliminate pollution insurance and general liability 
for damage discovered after expiration of a policy 
the suits also claim that the companies got major reinsurers 
including lloyds to threaten to boycott any us insurance 
company that provided broader coverage 
the report called for greater us regulation of reinsurers and 
alternative reinsurance programs to be set up by federal and state 
governments

west german government officials have 
agreed to more than double subsidies to the airbus program a 
spokesman said 
dietrich vogel an economics ministry spokesman said wednesday 
that the government plans to more than double its allocation to the 
aircraft program in 1989 to 524 million marks or around 291 
million at current exchange rates 
the airbus jetliners are manufactured by airbus industrie a 
european aircraft consortium financed by the governments of west 
germany france britain and spain 
the subsidy originally planned at 200 million marks will cover 
the payments guaranteed by the west german government and made by 
the statecontrolled messerschmittboelkowblohm gmbh which holds 
the west german share of the airbus program 
vogel said the agreement to increase the airbus subsidy was 
reached at a meeting tuesday between finance minister gerhard 
stoltenberg economics minister martin bangemann and other 
officials from the two ministries 
the higher subsidy is expected to be endorsed by the government 
when it meets thursday to finalize its 1989 budget plans he said 
vogel said he did not see any difficulties that could block 
the proposal at the cabinet meeting 
also on wednesday the european economic communitys executive 
commission proposed in brussels belgium that the eec should spend 
60 million european currency units or about 684 million on 
aircraft research 
the funds would cover half of the programs costs over two 
years the areas of research proposed by the commission include 
aerodynamics aircraft materials noise and manufacturing

but corn finished slightly lower possibly indicating the bull 
market has peaked said cathy leow vice president of grain and 
soybean trading for thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
with corn plants entering the critical pollination stage in 
which silk and tassels appear were in the heart of causing 
damage and the weather forecasts are pretty horrible ms leow 
said 
the fact that the corn market has been unable to sustain 
stength in the face of these forecasts indicates to me that if we 
havent seen the highs were close to it 
at the close wheat was 4 cents to 8 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 394 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
lower to 1 cent higher with july at 342 a bushel oats were 1 
cent to 10 cents higher with july at 323 a bushel soybeans were 
05 cent lower to 26 cents higher with july at 985 a bushel

world oil prices ticked upward 
wednesday amid reports that three opec members might request an 
emergency meeting of the cartel to consider ways of cutting 
production and propping up prices 
but analysts remained steadfast in their predictions that the 
fractured cartel could do little to forestall continued price 
erosion through the summer 
they just seem to have thrown in the towel said paul 
mcdonald a londonbased oil consultant and an expert on the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
prices have dropped sharply over the past month in response to 
surplus supplies and a perception among traders that opec is 
crumbling 
the next regular opec meeting is set for nov 21 although that 
does not preclude a special session earlier if enough members deem 
it necessary 
the kuwait news agency citing highlevel senior industry 
sources reported tuesday that officials from venezuela algeria 
and ecuador were considering a call for such a meeting but the 
agency said the three nations had not officially contacted other 
opec members 
the report also noted that major member states such as kuwait 
and saudi arabia might object to an emergency session because 
there is no guarantee it would have any positive effect on prices 
and might even exacerbate the chaos now plaguing the cartel 
the kuwaiti reports coupled with the uncertainty caused by the 
us destruction of an iranian jetliner over the persian gulf 
appear to have provided some temporary support for prices the 
price of brent crude from the north sea was quoted in london in 
late afternoon at 1465 a barrel up 15 cents a barrel from 
tuesdays close a month ago brent europes most widely trade 
grade of oil was going for 1625 dollars a barrel 
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate 
crude rose 27 cents wednesday to 1536 per 42gallon barrel after 
a 15cent jump the previous day 
analysts nevertheless contend that prices are likely to fall 
from the existing range of 15 a barrel to 12 or even lower by the 
end of the summer 
each one dollar drop in the price of crude oil theoretically 
means a fall of 25 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices 
although oil companies usually do not pass on to consumers the full 
price decline 
the most common opec response to a sharp decline in oil prices 
is to cut production or at least give the impression of tightening 
its output controls indeed a report from the parisbased 
international energy agency showed wednesday that opec output fell 
slightly in june to 184 million barrels a day down from 187 
million in may 
yet analysts say the cartel appears helpless to cut decisively 
because saudi arabia and its gulf arab allies are unwilling at 
least for now to contemplate any cuts in production 
were still a very long way from opec doing what is 
necessary to avert a further price decline said fergus macleod 
an oil analyst at the investment firm barclays de zoete wedd in 
london 
opec also is hurt by the continuing iraniraq war which has 
effectively allowed iraq to ignore opec rules and pump more oil 
than any member except the saudis 
at its last meeting in june opec oil ministers failed to settle 
their internal problems and simply left the existing system of 
production quotas and prices unchanged hoping oil demand would 
rise this summer 
nothing has happened since then to improve chances of opec 
agreeing on production cuts or other measures to stabilize the 
market 
i dont foresee any opec move before the end of august said 
pierre terzian publisher of petrostrategies a paris publication 
it seems they will let the prices come down to 10 or 12 
opecs official oil price is 18 a barrel but discipline in the 
13nation cartel is so poor that most if not all members are 
offering discounts to keep up their sales in a glutted market 
worse from opecs point of view is a growing reluctance of 
some members to adhere to opecdecreed production quotas the 
united arab emirates for example has unilaterally declared that 
it will pump up to 15 million barrels a day instead of the 948000 
barrels it is allowed under the cartel agreement reaffirmed at last 
months meeting 
the uaes move was likened earlier this week by ecuadors oil 
minister fernando santos to an atomic bomb being dropped on 
the market santos suggested that other members may soon decide to 
abandon the opec quota system to protect their own shares of the 
market 
if a country does not respect its quota the other 12 member 
countries will consider themselves free to produce as much as they 
consider necessary he said

market to sell dollars but us traders said they saw no concrete 
evidence of the feds presence the bank of japan also was rumored 
to have told dealers that it was prepared to intervene at the 
opening of trading thursday 
despite the focus on central bank strategy mccarthy said the 
market is taking it in good stride 
dan holland an assistant vice president at discount corp 
credited the intervention rumors with driving down the currency

soybean futures prices surged in late trading wednesday as rain 
evaporated from weekend weather forecasts but corn prices dipped 
and analysts said the droughtdriven rally in that market was 
nearing its end 
wheat and oat futures followed the soybean market in other 
trading on the chicago board of trade 
on other markets cotton and sugar posted strong gains the 
tailspin continued for frozen pork bellies while livestock futures 
were mixed energy and preciousmetals futures advanced and 
stockindex futures plummeted 
the grain and soybean markets opened quietly mixed then turned 
sharply lower in what analysts said was a response to a weekly 
agriculture department report showing less deterioration in the 
corn and soybean crops than some traders had expected 
but private midday weather forecasts reducing the chances for 
rain this weekend in the midwest fueled a late soybean rally and 
wheat and oat futures followed 
soybeans staged a very very strong comeback said 
walter spilka a grains analyst with smith barney harris upham amp 
co in new york traders basically looked at the private 
forecasts which still say hot and dry as far out as they can see 
the national weather service issued a 6to10day outlook after 
the close predicting abovenormal temperatures and belownormal 
rainfall in most major cropgrowing areas for the middle and end of 
next week that forecast was in sharp contrast to mondays 
6to10day outlook which predicted abovenormal rainfall in the 
midwest for the five days starting sunday 
corn futures finished slightly lower possibly indicating the 
bull market has peaked said cathy leow vice president of grain 
and soybean trading for thomson mckinnon securities inc in new 
york 
with corn plants entering the pollination stage a critical 
growth period in which silk and tassels appear were in the 
heart of causing damage and the weather forecasts are pretty 
horrible ms leow said 
the fact that the corn market has been unable to sustain 
strength in the face of these forecasts indicates to me that if we 
havent seen the highs were close to it she said 
wheat settled 4 cents to 8 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in july at 393 a bushel corn was 2 cents lower to 1 
cent higher with july at 342 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 10 
cents higher with july at 323 a bushel soybeans were 03 cent to 
25 cents higher with july at 984 a bushel 
the soybean rally triggered buying of sugar and cotton futures 
analysts said sugar for october delivery settled 117 cents higher 
at 1399 cents a pound on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange 
july cotton finished 180 cents higher at 6680 cents a pound on 
the new york cotton exchange 
frozen porkbelly futures sank to new 8year lows on the chicago 
mercantile exchange amid a continuing lack of demand for the 
nearrecord glut of bellies in cold storage analysts said most 
contracts plunged the daily limit of 2 cents a pound for the third 
consecutive session 
hog futures were mixed in reaction to mixed cash markets cattle 
futures were pressured by a statement by national cattlemens 
association president dale humphrey that the drought would continue 
to cause liquidation of cattle herds causing increased beef 
supplies in the near term said dale durchholz an analyst with 
agrivisor services inc an advisory service in bloomington ill 
live cattle were 17 cent to 88 cent lower with august at 6482 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 35 cent to 88 cent lower with 
august at 7437 cents a pound hogs were 20 cent lower to 50 cent 
higher with july at 4457 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
85 cent to 2 cents lower with july at 3240 cents a pound 
energy futures advanced on mostly technical factors on the new 
york mercantile exchange 
the weekly american petroleum institute report issued after the 
close indicated continued strong demand for unleaded gasoline 
which should support futures prices on thursday said peter beutel 
energy analyst with elders futures inc in new york 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 25 cents to 33 cents 
higher with august at 1536 a barrel heating oil was 86 cent to 
106 cents higher with august at 4261 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 60 cent to 87 cent higher with august at 5050 cents 
a gallon 
precious metals gained slightly in thin trading on the commodity 
exchange in new york in reaction to the higher oil and soybean 
prices analysts said 
gold was 40 cents to 110 higher with august at 44070 a troy 
ounce silver was 5 cents to 57 cents higher with july at 6819 a 
troy ounce 
stockindex futures plummeted in a late flurry of program 
trading linked to falling treasury bond prices analysts said the 
contract for september delivery of the standard amp poors 500 index 
settled 665 points lower at 272 on the chicago mercantile exchange

jurors were asked wednesday to 
decide whether financier marvin warner was a victim of fraud in the 
esm government securities collapse or a cunning participant who 
profited at the expense of investors 
closing arguments ended in the 21 million civil suit filed by 
esms bankruptcy trustee against warner at us district court 
here only blocks from esms former offices deliberations were 
expected thursday 
the collapse of esm led to the failure days later of warners 
home state savings bank in cincinnati esms biggest customer 
everybody takes credit for discovering the esm fraud but no 
one knew about it until people from home state were down here 
trying to find the truth said andrew hall warners lawyer 
it has not been proved he took part in the fraud warner is 
the biggest victim of this case hall said in closing statements 
to the sixmember jury 
hall said warner 69 lost at least 26 million of his own 
money securities and real estate when esm folded 
jose garciapedrosa attorney for esms courtappointed trustee 
thomas tew painted a different picture for jurors 
he described a jetset world of complex and illegal transactions 
on corporate jets and at private kentucky derby cocktail parties 
garciapedrosa told jurors that warner a former us ambassador 
to switzerland was tipped off to financial problems at esm in time 
to pull out millions of dollars before the collapse 
help bring that money back to the estate of esm he urged 
jurors no other creditor got out early 
the lawsuit against warner by the esm estate originally sought 
more than 60 million that figure has been reduced to 21 million 
by us district judge jose a gonzalez jr 
warner who filed for chapter 11 financial reorganization in 
jacksonville placed his fortune in his familys name tew charged 
i think we could recover the money from his wife and son 
tew said 
warner looking tan and confident nodded to jurors as they 
entered the courtroom and smiled as he made eye contact with each 
of them the financier lives on a horse ranch in ocala in north 
central florida 
warner has said he lost almost 30 million in 1985 when esm 
failed with a total of 315 million in losses to investors 
esms downfall also sank home state setting off a thrift crisis 
in ohio and forcing that state to temporarily close 72 savings and 
loan associations 
warner was convicted in ohio last year of fraudulently 
transferring home state funds to esm he was sentenced to three 
years in prison but is free on appeal

mtm entertainment inc the 
television production company cofounded by actress mary tyler 
moore will be bought by a british tv company in a deal the 
companies valued at 320 million in cash and stock it was 
announced wednesday 
mtm producer of such popular and critically acclaimed series as 
hill street blues and st elsewhere will retain its name 
management and creative philosophy after the takeover by television 
south plc officials said here and in london 
miss moore and three mtm officers will emerge from the deal with 
a 20 percent share in the buyer known as tvs producer of the 
television movie mandela and other programs aired on britains 
two independent networks 
tvs which is selling an additional 20 percent stake to two 
french media companies to raise money for the buyout gets mtms 
library of old tv shows popular on both sides of the atlantic and 
becomes britains biggest independent tv production company 
im very excited about it i think its a great opportunity 
for mtm to grow especially in the european market miss moore 
told a news conference here 
officials of both companies said they hoped to cooperate on 
production and distribution of programs on both sides of the 
atlantic but that both production operations would remain 
independent 
responding to questions about possible changes in programming 
that produced the sometimes controversial st elsewhere arthur 
price mtms chief executive officer said there are going to be 
no changes in the creative attitude the company has displayed 
in a deal that must be approved by the tvs board of directors 
and various regulatory bodies the british firm agreed to pay 
2423 million cash for the privately held mtm 
additionally tvs will issue new stock it valued at 358 
million to four members of mtm management price miss moore who 
is a director mel blumenthal senior executive vice president and 
tom palmieri executive vice president that stock would give the 
four a combined 20 percent of tvs but miss moores 64 percent 
share and blumenthals 36 percent share wouldnt change hands 
until 1993 under the agreement 
blumenthal and price will get seats on the tvs board 
the deal also calls for a second transfer of new stock valued 
at 419 million to the mtm group five years after completion of 
the buyout 
tvs said it would finance the deal through bank borrowing and 
the sale of 190 million worth of common and convertible preferred 
stock 
two french media companies canal sa and generale dimages 
sa have agreed to buy 99 million worth of the common stock 
giving them each 10 percent of tvs 
the most valuable asset in the transaction is mtms library of 
old shows that are syndicated or sold to television stations for 
reruns the library which tvs valued at 310 million has 1000 
hours of programs including the mary tyler moore show the 
bob newhart show lou grant rhoda wkrp in 
cincinnati and remington steele 
mtm also has a us distribution arm that could help sell tvs 
programs to american networks and a production studio in ireland 
mtm had sought to expand through a public stock offering in this 
country last year but dropped that plan after the october stock 
market crash dampened investors enthusiasm for new issues 
the tvs deal arrived at after 10 months of negotiations blends 
each companys desire to expand in the others area tvs chief 
executive james gatward said in london 
though officials at both the london and california news 
conferences said they hoped the companies could jointly produce 
shows there arent any specific plans to do so immediately 
blumenthal said 
mtm reported pretax profits of 438 million in its most recent 
fiscal year tvs reported net profits of 32 million in 1987

ford motor co announced wednesday it is 
recalling about 60000 vans and extending the warranties on an 
additional 266000 because of possible wiring brake and 
transmission problems 
ford said it is recalling 60000 198688 model aerostar vans and 
wagons equipped with an optional trailer tow package for a wiring 
modification 
faulty wiring on the vehicles could overheat and cause a fire 
the automaker said to correct the problem dealers will install an 
additional fuse to protect the wiring 
ford said it is extending warranty coverage on a total of 
266028 aerostar vans built on or prior to march 3 1987 including 
the 60000 with wiring problems to correct a nonsafety related 
brake problem 
the front brakes on the affected vehicles make an annoying 
groaning noise ford said dealers will cover the cost of 
correcting the problem the automaker said ford said the noise 
does not affect the performance of the brakes 
also 136000 aerostars may have problems with their automatic 
transmissions as well as noisy brakes ford said 
transmissions on those vehicles may show premature clutch wear 
preventing the vans from shifting into reverse or third gear ford 
said adding that in some cases the problem could render the 
vehicle inoperable

through to the asbestos property damage trust which was created to 
handle property damage claims against manville 
richard b von wald manville senior vice president and general 
counsel said that under manvilles plan of reorganization the 
latest settlement ultimately would benefit the asbestos property

with aetna totaling 2005 million for policies issued by the 
insurer prior to 1980
