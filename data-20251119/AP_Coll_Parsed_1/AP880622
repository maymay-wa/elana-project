the request at a sevenhour meeting that also included the foreign

along costa ricas northeastern border with nicaragua but the 
reports ceased since one rebel group stopped operating in the area 
three years ago

talks between governments and opposition groups an end to military 
aid to insurgents in the region and reforms to bring greater 
democracy to central america

a soviet aviation official in montreal defected 
after giving information on security breaches by 17 soviets 
diplomats and officials who have been expelled or barred from 
canada the foreign minister said wednesday 
the soviet government retaliated wednesday for canadas action 
by kicking out two canadian diplomats and telling three others they 
are not welcome 
the canadian broadcasting corp reported late wednesday that 
some of the soviets who were expelled had attempted to infiltrate 
paramax electronics a usowned military contractor in montreal 
that has access to highly classified us naval technology 
the cbc reported on its latenight television program the 
journal that paramax had access to highly classified radar sonar 
and and communications systems 
the new york times said in its thursday edition that the 
technology to which paramax has access included computerdriven 
equipment that controls shipboard weapons systems 
paramax a subsidiary of the detroitbased unisys corporation 
has a 1 billion contract with the canadian government as the 
primary subcontractor on a fleet of six newpatrol frigates for the 
canadian navy the times reported unisys is one of the largest 
military contractors in the united states 
canadian foreign minister joe clark told parliament that eight 
soviet diplomats were expelled last week and another nine diplomats 
and officials who recently left the country have been told they 
should not return 
clark said there was not one conspiracy but several operations 
that formed the object of parallel but distinct investigations 
he said the soviets transgressions included an attempt to 
penetrate the canadian security intelligence service and its 
predecessor the royal canadian mounted police security service 
we are confident that canadian security was not compromised 
clark said 
he said the soviet diplomats also tried to gain access to 
classified information and technology with commercial and military 
applications 
clark said a soviet official at the international civil aviation 
organization headquarters in montreal identified as yuri smurov 
has defected and asked to remain in canada with his wife and 
daughter after supplying useful information to canadian 
security clark did not elaborate 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said earlier 
in moscow the canadian action was entirely groundless 
here we have an apparent provocation planned in advance that 
has nothing to do with the activity of soviet citizens in canada 
gerasimov said the provocation of the canadian authorities will 
naturally not remain without due reply 
the official soviet news agency tass said soviet deputy foreign 
minister alexander bessmertynkh informed canadian ambassador vernon 
turner of the explusion order against the canadians 
in a note to turner bessmertynkh called the canadian 
governments move a rude antagonistic act the note accused 
canada of trying to spoil relations with the kremlin at a time when 
eastwest ties were improving 
however canadian prime minister brian mulroney said wednesday 
theres just no question about what the soviets were doing here 
clark did not say how long the various diplomats had been under 
surveillance or why the government decided to act against them last 
week 
seven soviets left canada last friday 48 hours after they were 
ordered out they included a consular official in ottawa three 
diplomats from the soviet consulate in montreal a trade 
representative in montreal and two officials from the soviet 
delegation to the international civil aviation organization 
an eighth diplomat capt boris tatarintsev assistant naval 
attache at the soviet embassy in ottawa was on the expulsion list 
but was outside canada last week he will not be allowed to return 
the nine soviets who worked in canada previously and are now 
persona non grata include two former soviet embassy diplomats in 
ottawa a journalist based in ottawa three members of the soviet 
consulate in montreal two civil aviation officials in montreal and 
a former manager of the aeroflot office there 
the canadian press news agency quoting unidentified sources in 
ottawa said the soviet diplomats were believed to have links to 
both the kgb the soviet secret police and the gru the soviet 
military intelligence agency 
viacheslav bogdanov second secretary at the soviet embassy 
said there would be no comment on the affair 
the tass dispatch said two canadian diplomats in moscow 
raymond steele a naval attache and evelyn puxley a second 
secretary had three days to leave the soviet union they were 
accused of engaging in activity which is absolutely 
unacceptable and which did not correspond to their official 
status diplomatic language for spying 
three canadians who worked previously at the embassy were 
declared persona non grata and forbidden from returning to the 
soviet union they were identified as ann leahy a first secretary 
john digangi a second secretary and kenneth moody an air attache 
mulroney disclosed the action against the soviets on tuesday at 
a news conference concluding the sevennation economic summit he 
accused the diplomats of improper and unacceptable behavior 
more than 40 diplomats from the soviet union and east european 
countries have been ordered out of canada for alleged espionage 
activities since 1945 
the last expulsion of western diplomats from the soviet union 
was in april 1987 when the kremlin ordered out four french 
diplomats and two french businessmen that move was in retaliation 
for the earlier expulsion by france of three soviet diplomats 
accused of spying

during their sevenyear marriage fred 
astaire often told his wife robyn people have taken advantage 
of me all my life try to see that it doesnt happen after im 
gone 
that has been mrs astaires consuming mission since the dancing 
actors death a year ago 
i didnt realize how difficult it would be she said 
everyone wants a piece of fred now 
she cited a hollywood boulevard operator who has been selling 
lifesize cutouts of astaire to be used in stores and amusement 
parks companies have tried to merchandise fred astaire lines of 
tuxedos jewelry and cologne robyn astaire has hired a lawyer to 
try to police such ventures and she is supported by new laws 
protecting the names and images of deceased celebrities 
mrs astaire is also disturbed by the use of her husbands name 
and works by companies or individuals who dont consult her such 
as the sale by mca to the disney channel of the astaire tv 
specials the only films that he owned he made his classic 
musicals while under contract to studios 
she doesnt rule out licensing of products that met the astaire 
standards of class 
fred wanted me to do that she said he was so afraid that 
he wouldnt be able to provide for me after he was gone you see 
when he turned 78 he decided it was time to put his affairs in 
order he never expected to marry again so he gave most of his 
wealth to his family keeping only what he needed to live on 
then he met robyn smith a lithe young jockey who had broken 
the sex barrier in thoroughbred racing they were married june 24 
1980 when he was 81 and she was 35 the marriage astonished 
hollywood and appalled freds sister adele and daughter ava but 
it endured 
mrs astaire recently talked about her life with fred at the 
hilltop home she shared with him it is unchanged as is she daily 
running keeps her 5foot7 frame at 106 pounds 
by the time we were married fred had done everything in his 
life more than once she related he was in a mood to relax 
and take it easy that was fine with me he was such an exciting 
person to be around that we didnt have to do a lot we just always 
had a lot of fun i know that 
i was happy with my life before that as with any athlete 
when you get into your 30s you are forced to retire everyone 
thinks youre over the hill when you turn 25 
besides fred wanted me to get out of the racing business 
because it was very dangerous i was ready to quit anyway but i 
made fred sell his horses because i wasnt about to let him run 
them if i couldnt ride 
fred and robyn astaire played some golf together and attended 
the latest movies always at 12 oclock at a neighborhood theater 
so he wouldnt be recognized she even had him watch his own 
movies at home 
i had never seen a fred astaire picture that i can remember 
she admitted i just wasnt interested in musicals when i was 
young i never realized what i had missed 
fred never liked watching himself in movies but i wanted to 
see them and they absolutely blew my mind at my insistence he 
started watching them with me he was so cute when i said oh 
darling its so spectacular hed say oh was it really good 
toward the end of his life he enjoyed watching the films which he 
had never allowed himself to do 
i wont dance goes the old astaire tune and he wouldnt do 
so after his last tv show at 70 but on their rare appearances at 
hollywood events fred danced with robyn and nightly after dinner 
they exited the dining room in a comic tango that convulsed the 
servants 
astaire was in perfect health until the last six months of his 
life she said he started losing weight and that alarmed her his 
doctors could find nothing wrong but robyn feared that he might 
develop pneumonia the killer of the aged 
i thought fred would live into his 90s she said his 
mother had died at 96 and he was just like his mother all of a 
sudden when he reached 86 he started to get weaker and weaker he 
wasnt ill his batteries were draining 
last june he developed pneumonia she drove him to century city 
hospital late at night to avoid public notice and entered him 
under his mothers maiden name his presence there was kept secret 
until his death on june 22 
for the past year mrs astaire has devoted herself to 
preserving her husbands rich legacy but she realizes she will 
need to start a life of her own next month she is enrolling in an 
intensive course at the university of california at los angeles to 
determine what kind of a career she should pursue 
she grinned i just hope the results dont show that the only 
thing im qualified for is to be a jockey

david was sleeping on the streets and 
working as a prostitute the 16yearolds parents had left him 
behind when they moved from alaska 
geanne also 16 got pregnant and ran away from her athabascan 
indian village in anchorage she turned to prostitution and was 
often beaten by her pimp she died of a drug overdose 
there are others enough to give this city of 230000 residents 
one of the nations highest percapita rates of runaway and 
homeless youths at least 1200 teenagers are reported as runaways 
each year in anchorage more than three times the number for 
comparable cities a 1986 municipal study found 
we are not a large city yet we have a very large problem 
said marj hall director of the alaska juvenile crime commission 
where davids and geannes cases are on file confidentiality 
restrictions prevented use of their last names 
the statistics and the troubled young faces behind them 
grabbed the attention of covenant house a nonprofit group that 
until now focused on running shelters in larger cities such as new 
york and houston 
this summer in anchorage covenant house is turning a beatup 
old ymca building into a 40bed shelter where runaways can sort out 
their lives and perhaps avoid the deadend world of life on the 
street 
covenant houses arrival is lauded by local social workers 
frustrated by a lack of longterm care for runaways but some warn 
the shelter expected to open in october is no panacea 
they say anchorages runaways are part of a greater malaise 
arising from alaskas frontier demographics a young transient 
population isolated from stabilizing family and community ties in 
the lower 48 states 
kids dont have the extended family network here hall said 
if they get into trouble they cant go to uncle charlie who 
theyve known since they were a pup 
a boombust economy contributes to social instability as does 
the cultural upheaval besetting alaskas 14percent native 
population 
the result alaska consistently places at or near the top of the 
charts in percapita rates of drug and alcohol abuse rape child 
abuse divorce suicide assault and domestic violence 
trouble at home gives some alaska youths good reason to run but 
once on the street they face bigger trouble as easy targets for 
drugpushers pimps and sexual exploiters 
in the early 1980s when north slope oil revenues swelled state 
budgets officials increased funding for social programs but 
social workers say little went toward helping runaway kids today 
anchorage has only 10 beds available for runaways and now that the 
oil boom has busted government money is hard to come by 
enter covenant house the group started 19 years ago in new york 
city when the rev bruce ritter a franciscan priest started 
letting street kids sleep on his apartment floor today covenant 
house runs shelters in six cities and provides food clothing 
medical care and counseling to more than 20000 youths a year 
covenant house officials are asked why theyre opening shop in 
anchorage when other larger cities have bigger and more visible 
runaway populations 
we were invited answered brenda moscarella the alaska 
project manager the roman catholic archdiocese of anchorage raised 
enough money to buy the building and told ritter it was his if 
covenant house would open a shelter ritter took the bait 
the future covenant house alaska is now a bombshell of a 
building said fred ali the alaska programs executive director 
in the next few months workers will transform it into a homey 
shelter with bedrooms upstairs and a dining hall clinic lounge 
and chapel downstairs 
ali has begun the search for a 40member staff of doctors 
childcare workers cooks and counselors operating costs are 
expected to run just over 1 million a year most of which will 
come from covenant houses national fundraising efforts 
though the organization has strong religious ties runaways are 
not proselytized moscarella said god is one more father figure 
and they ran away from that she said 
covenant house alaska may differ a little from the groups other 
operations ali said hes looking for staff comfortable with 
alaskas native culture and moscarella said the usual 930 pm 
curfew may have to be extended in summer when even toddlers stay 
out to play under the latenight sun 
but the blend of love and discipline that distinguishes other 
covenant house shelters will apply here moscarella said no 
weapons drugs or violence will be allowed and kids will have to 
do chores and adhere to progress plans mapped out by counselors 
the goals of those plans may be returning teenagers home 
helping them land jobs or sending them to drug counseling 
nationwide covenant house claims a 35 percent success rate in 
meeting those goals moscarella said 
some dispute that success saying covenant house actually 
encourages runaways 
i dont think it will help said allen 17 a runaway and 
former drugpusher who now helps the alaska juvenile crime 
commission counsel youths on the street its going to make kids 
more likely to run away because theyll know they have some place 
to stay 
and the police who handle runaway reports say many anchorage 
runaways are not in great danger investigator ronald emmons said 
at least 90 percent fit into the spoiled brat or free 
spirit category rebellious kids who run because theyre told to 
take out the garbage or vacuum the carpet 
these manipulators generally return home after wearing out their 
welcome at friends houses and covenant house may not get through 
to them emmons said to them it might just mean a picnic for 30 
days he said 
but ali and moscarella said covenant house is hardheaded enough 
to deal with manipulators and openminded enough to take all 
comers spoiled brat or not 
that kid may start off as a spoiled brat ali said but 
those kids are at risk just like anybody else there is child 
prostitution in this town and there are kids running drugs the 
streets not a safe place to be

the house ways and means committee is putting 
together a catchall tax bill that includes help for students and 
farmers but offsets every penny of relief with higher taxes on 
someone else 
in addition to farmers who buy diesel fuel and students who 
receive education aid from an employer the winners in the 
legislation include owners of shares in mutual funds lowincome 
workers firsttime homebuyers and corporations with big outlays 
for research 
the losers defense contractors purchases of singlepremium 
life insurance and corporations that own less than a 20 percent 
share of other corporations 
the bill would take away a considerable portion of the tax 
benefits associated with singlepremium life insurance and other 
investmentoriented policies the income from such policies whose 
purchasers usually have high incomes is now taxdeferred and 
policy loans are taxfree 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the ways and means 
committee presented his proposal tuesday to members of the panel 
and they immediately began considering it behind closed doors when 
the committee quit for the day it had not made any decisions 
rostenkowski said 
the grab bag of special tax provisions would be added to a bill 
designed to correct hundreds of errors that crept into the big 1986 
law that overhauled the income tax system 
in the past such technical corrections bills have been the 
vehicle for any number of specialinterests tax relief fewer 
special provisions are likely to be accepted this year because of 
budget restraints and a requirement that every amendment that cuts 
taxes for some group be paid for by raising taxes on another group 
rostenkowskis package which the committee hopes to finish this 
week does just that according to estimates of the staff of the 
joint committee on taxation the proposal would cut taxes by 6230 
billion from 1988 through 1991 and raise other taxes by 6232 
billion 
among the bills major provisions are those to 
renew for three years through 1991 an expired provision that 
allowed employees to avoid taxes on amounts paid by their employer 
up to 5250 a year to further their educations it would not be 
available for postgraduate courses 
make permanent a oneyear provision that prevents owners of 
mutual fund shares from being taxed on the funds operating 
expenses 
effectively repeal on july 1 1988 a provision requiring 
farmers and other offtheroad business users of diesel fuel to pay 
the federal tax of 151 cents a gallon and then apply for a refund 
extend through 1990 a credit for owners of rental property 
used for lowincome housing 
modify and extend through 1990 a tax exemption for mortgage 
bonds that are issued to make loans for firsttime homebuyers 
renew for two years a tax credit under which the government in 
effect pays 40 percent of the first years wages of poor employees 
extend through 1990 a 20percent credit for increased research 
expenditures a research expense deduction would be reduced to 
reflect the credit 
permit american corporations to allocate 67 percent of their 
domestic research expenses against ussource income 
repeal the completed contract method of accounting under 
which defense contractors and other large corporations avoid taxes 
on part of their income until a project is completed 
reduce from 70 percent to 50 percent the deduction allowed 
certain corporations for portfolio dividends 
eliminate the ability of certain corporations with fluctuating 
incomes to reduce the total of taxes paid in advance in a given 
year 
repeal a special rule designed to benefit corporations 
established by alaska natives rostenkowski said the rule is being 
abused at great loss to the treasury by outside investors

sen william proxmire says senate support of a 
poison pill amendment would weaken his bill to make hostile 
takeovers of corporations more difficult and says he is considering 
withdrawing the legislation from the senate floor 
the amendment which the senate refused on tuesday to set aside 
would curb the poison pills the term refers to strategies used 
by target companies to make themselves less desirable to raiders 
such as issuing additional shares of stock or incurring new debt 
the vote on the amendment which was offered by sen william 
armstrong rcolo was 5740 
proxmire dwis chairman of the banking committee temporarily 
withdrew the legislation from the floor after that vote aides said 
that would give him time to examine the support he has to oppose 
several amendments by armstrong and to assess how he should deal 
with them 
asked if he might remove the bill completely from consideration 
he told a reporter theres a possibility that would happen 
yes 
earlier the lawmakers approved another amendment limiting 
golden parachutes bonuses that are sometimes paid to corporate 
managers ousted after their companies are acquired in hostile 
takeovers 
the golden parachute amendment is aimed at payments sometimes 
amounting to tens of millions of dollars that can be made to 
executives who are fired by new corporate owners the provision 
would require such bonuses to be approved by a majority vote of 
shareholders 
there is a point at which these abuses ought to be stopped or 
at least made subject to a vote of the stockholders said 
armstrong rcolo the amendments chief sponsor shortly before 
the 981 vote 
the provision as is true for many aspects of the corporate 
takeover legislation attracted an unusual coalition of supporters 
one of the senates most liberal members sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio joined conservatives armstrong sen phil gramm rtexas 
and sen richard shelby dala in cosponsoring it 
sen william roth rdel voted against the amendment saying 
that state laws should be allowed to continue to control the 
bonuses delaware corporate home of 54 percent of the companies 
listed on the new york stock exchange has strong antitakeover 
legislation of its own 
the only senator not voting was joseph biden ddel who is 
recovering from brain surgery 
armstrong argued that his poison pill amendment which would 
require that such strategies receive stockholder approval was 
needed because poison pills diminish shareholders power proxmire 
and his allies have argued that poison pills benefit stockholders 
by driving up the price raiders must pay and that there already 
are state laws that curb abuses under the procedure 
obviously we suffered a serious loss on that amendment 
proxmire said 
proxmires bill would reduce from 10 days to five days the time 
buyers of 5 percent of companys stock have to report the 
transactions to the securities and exchange commission the shorter 
window and a prohibition on buying additional stock until the 
report is completed would make it harder for a buyer to quietly 
gain control of a company 
it would require buyers to disclose more information to the sec 
such as whether they desire to simply make an investment or gain 
control of a corporation tender offers public offers to purchase 
stock at a given price would have to remain open for 35 days 
instead of the current 20 days 
the legislation would also increase criminal penalties for 
insider trading from 100000 and five years in prison to 1 
million and 10 years of imprisonment 
proxmire and his supporters say takeovers have become such a 
distraction to american business that their threat is causing 
corporate managers to focus on them rather than on improving their 
products in addition they say companies are being dismantled and 
jobs lost because of the costs of battling wouldbe buyers even 
when the corporations successfully fend off the buyers

memo to politicians looking for an 
electionyear issue as surefire as the flag baseball or moms 
apple pie maybe a statue honoring american women even better 
women veterans of vietnam 
well think again 
although the senate overwhelmingly approved the idea last week 
961 proposed legislation to add a womans statue to the national 
vietnam veterans memorial in washington ran into all sorts of 
trouble in the house on tuesday 
members of the house post office and civil service subcommittee 
on libraries and memorials witnessed a genteel clash between 
actress loretta swit who favored the statue and maya lin the 
softspoken designer of the vietnam memorial who said it would be a 
mistake 
the panel also cited reports of allegedly extravagant spending 
and mismanagement by former officers of the statues 
minneapolisbased sponsoring group a possible conflict of interest 
by the sculptor of another statue at the vietnam memorial and 
political pressure from former interior secretary james watt 
moreover the commission on fine arts reaffirmed its vote last 
october opposing the plan for an eightfoot bronze sculpture of an 
army nurse in battle fatigues at the 22acre vietnam memorial site 
on the mall near the lincoln memorial 
the independent agencys approval is required before any 
monument can be built on federal land in washington which bothered 
rep bill frenzel rminn 
if were just going to serve it up to them to veto again why 
bother frenzel asked i dont want to pass a bill and find out 
were firing a blank 
miss swit who starred on the popular television series 
mash as an army nurse made an emotional appeal for 
approval of the monument she called it a belated tribute to the 
10000 american women who served in vietnam now that a sculpture 
of three combatweary infantrymen has been placed at the memorial 
she was backed by several members of congress and major 
veterans organizations against ms lin the american institute of 
architects and others who protested that yet another statue on the 
site would distract from and damage the artistic integrity of its 
centerpiece the black granite wall bearing the names of 58156 
vietnam war dead including eight female nurses 
rep sam gejdenson dconn chief sponsor of the house bill 
expressed concern over allegations that led to a highlevel shakeup 
in the vietnam womens memorial project inc the private sponsors 
of the womans statue 
chairwoman donnamarie boulay was replaced after two board 
members filed a lawsuit alleging that the organization spent 
unreasonable amounts for fund raising and failed to maintain 
adequate financial records 
gejdenson and rep mary rose oakar dohio the subcommittee 
chairwoman strongly suggested that the projects new managers 
avoid further trouble by funneling privately raised money through 
an independent federal agency 
diane carlson evans a project founder and former vietnam nurse 
said the board shakeup in may has resulted in a complete review 
of operating procedures and a total commitment by the current board 
to see the memorial completed professionally and expeditiously 
ms lin said the addition of a statue of three infantrymen at 
the vietnam memorial in 1984 was ordered by watt the former 
interior secretary as his condition for building the main portion 
of the memorial according to her design the memorial was dedicated 
in november 1982 
retired air force nurse linda spoonster schwartz told the panel 
that frederick e hart who sculpted the infantrymens statue was 
a member of the fine arts commission when it vetoed the womans 
statue last fall ms schwartz noted that hart receives a portion 
of the royalties from novelties based on his statue 
i do not believe we will ever be given fair treatment as long 
as frederick hart will be sitting in judgment on a potential 
competitor to his royalty income she said 
charles atherton a commission spokesman said hart took part in 
the commissions discussion but abstained from voting on the 
proposal

two senior reagan administration officials are 
denying that there is a droughtinspired plan to scuttle export 
subsidies or impose restrictions on how much us grain can be 
purchased by foreign countries 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng said tuesday that its a 
little bit hard now to predict that the export enhacement 
program or eep will continue to operate at its recent high level 
in view of the uncertainty about 198889 crop supplies and prices 
but he said we will definitely with whatever resources we 
have do whatever we need to do to try to keep our competitive 
export position ever in front of us 
besides the uncertainties of us crop production this year 
world supply and demand will have to be reviewed he said 
its impossible for us to make firm forecasts lyng said 
but ill tell you this that we will not neglect our export trade 
under eep private exporting companies are subsidized with 
bonuses of free governmentowned surplus commodities so they 
can sell wheat or other designated commodities to specified foreign 
countries 
wheat exports have soared for example largely because of eep 
sales to the soviet union china and about 30 other foreign buyers 
lyng and us trade representative clayton yeutter fielded 
questions tuesday during a telephone news conference with farm 
reporters 
yeutter had just returned from japan which has agreed to open 
its doors to more us beef and citrus products he was asked about 
remarks attributed to him in tokyo on the possibility of a us 
clampdown on exports of corn soybeans and other products because 
of the droughts threat to supplies 
i dont happen to believe that were going to have an embargo 
and certainly i would oppose it and i believe secretary lyng would 
as well yeutter said 
lyng said that president reagan in march 1982 came out with a 
statement that said we would never the united states would never 
under any circumstances put an embargo on the shipment or 
restrict the shipment of agricultural products because of high 
prices 
further lyng said weve been telling the japanese that we 
must maintain their confidence in us as suppliers of agricultural 
products there will be no embargoes selectively on agriculture 
because of prices and scarcity 
restrictions and embargoes in the 1970s when supplies ran low 
along with a partial ban on grain sales to the soviet union in 
january 1980 have been sore points with farmers who contend the 
restrictions unnecessarily disrupt commodity markets

the new pact with japan on beef and oranges 
helps us trade negotiators generally particularly in dealings 
with the european economic community says us trade 
representative clayton yeutter 
it should provide some additional psychological support for us 
in dealing with the europeans yeutter said tuesday in other 
words now that weve been able to strike a deal with the japanese 
on beef and citrus it puts some additional pressure on the 
europeans to be somewhat more accommodating than they have in the 
past 
with the japanese starting to come into line it could put 
european leaders in the position of looking like the villains of 
the agricultural world if they continue holding out he said 
yeutter who earlier this week returned from tokyo where the new 
agreement was reached after marathon negotiations said that japan 
agreed to open the door to more american beef and citrus in the 
face of further us challenges under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade or gatt 
the agreement could lead to a doubling of us exports of beef 
and oranges by 1991 to more than 1 billion a year in return the 
united states agreed to withdraw its gatt complaint against japans 
restrictive import quotas 
yeutter said the complaint and previous success under gatt 
rules last year helped prod japan into accepting an expansion of 
beef and citrus imports 
in other words the jig was up he said theyd gotten 
away with a continuation of these programs for a lot of years what 
we the united states should have done was challenge these things 
about 15 years ago instead of now but better late than never 
yeutter said he did not expect serious problems in ensuring that 
japan lives up to the new agreement although officials should be 
watchful 
i dont see any loopholes there for the government of japan to 
use three years or so in the future he said but one can never 
be sure governments are very creative on these kinds of things 
and theyll sometimes find loopholes or build loopholes where 
theyre not around today

further red tape has been trimmed so that 
droughtstricken farmers can cut hay from conservation reserve 
program cropland 
haying on crp land will be permitted if the county has been 
approved for emergency haying and grazing under regular crop 
setaside programs agriculture secretary richard e lyng said 
tuesday this means that the agriculture department no longer will 
rely on a complicated drought severity index to determine if 
hay can be cut from crp land 
the extreme severity of the drought and the remote possibility 
of any relief in sight makes this decision necessary lyng said 
crp land was opened for haying last week in about 300 counties 
in 13 states and has been expanded gradually since then the action 
announced tuesday however will raise the number of counties 
eligible for crp haying to more than 1100 in 30 states

fundamental changes in the educational system 
are needed to attract students to technical fields and assure that 
the nation has enough qualified scientists and engineers according 
to a study released today by the congressional office of technology 
assessment 
the ota a research arm of congress found in the study that 
though american schools have the capacity to produce the scientists 
and engineers needed by the nation many capable students never 
enter the fields because of a lack of money or preparation 
some experts the ota report said worry that a decline in 
collegeage students in the early 1990s and a lessened interest in 
the technical fields will cause a decline in the number of 
scientists and engineers 
despite these trends said the report shortages of scientists 
and engineers are not inevitable 
some adjustments will be made in the labor market the report 
said causing more students to go into science and engineering but 
the federal government may need to play a more active role 
the problem the report said could be attacked in two ways 
to correct shortterm shortages the government could encourage 
students to finish undergraduate and advanced degrees 
if the nation wants more scientists and engineers relatively 
quickly then retaining college and graduate students in science 
and engineering is the most useful policy strategy the report 
said it noted that currently only about 30 percent of graduates 
with bachelors degrees enter fulltime graduate level studies and 
only about half of doctoral candidates actually earn the doctoral 
degree 
those who leave unwillingly or prematurely are a rich resource 
that could be tapped the report said 
a longerterm solution is to expand and improve the talent pool 
of students willing and prepared to go into the science fields 
the years to do this are elementary school through the first 
years of college the report said increased recruitment into the 
technical fields might come through fullscale revision of 
elementary and secondary curricula tracking testing and course 
structure the report said though it noted that such a change 
will be hard to achieve given the scale of american education and 
the inertia of the existing system 
among the measures needed the report said are methods of 
recruiting more women and minorities into technical fields which 
traditionally have been dominated by white males 
the report said that developing a scientist or engineer requires 
20 years of schooling and a social and economic climate that 
encourages students to prepare themselves in the lower grades and 
to persist in college to the advanced degrees 
investing in future scientists and engineers is essential to the 
nation the report said 
although comprising only 4 percent of american workers 
scientists and engineers have specialized skills that are vital to 
the national welfare in developing new technology and in keeping 
the national industrial machine operating smoothly the report said 
the nation is well advised therefore the report said to 
seek an adequate supply of people prepared for science and 
engineering careers

congress is expected to act quickly to enact 
legislation to strengthen the enforcement of the nations fair 
housing law now that democrats and the reagan administration have 
worked out a compromise 
sen edward m kennedy dmass one of the measures strongest 
supporters called the compromise a giant step toward enacting 
legislation that will make the promise of fair housing a reality 
president reagan and vice president george bush gave their 
approval tuesday to an agreement reached by democrats and civil 
rights groups with republicans and realtors permitting someone 
charged with housing discrimination to have the accusation 
considered in federal court 
currently the department of housing and urban development can 
offer to mediate disputes only if both parties agree to 
participate if they dont individuals must bring private 
lawsuits the justice department can intervene only if government 
lawyers detect a pattern of discrimination against a particular 
group 
the bill that came out of the democraticcontrolled house 
judiciary committee earlier this month would allow those who 
believe they have been discriminated against in the sale or rental 
of housing to bring complaints before an administrative law judge 
the judge would have the power to levy fines and issue injunctions 
and the decision could then be appealed through the courts 
administration officials opposed the measure because they said 
monetary damages should be assessed only by the courts 
rep hamilton fish jr rny crafted an amendment to the bill 
that received support from the opposing parties giving the 
accused party the opportunity to go into federal court first to 
have his case heard 
the fair housing law enacted two decades ago at a time of 
national mourning and strife stands as a symbol of our national 
commitment to the goals of equal housing opportunity for all 
americans fish said at a news conference unfortunately 
however the reality confronting victims of housing discrimination 
falls far short of our lofty legal goal 
the proposed bill together with my amendment provides 
victims a quick and effective means of seeking redress he said 
passage of this legislation will boost confidence in the 
effectiveness of our fair housing law 
rep robert h michel rill the house minority leader said 
that reagan in toronto for the economic summit told michel that 
he believes the compromise preserves the constitutional right to 
jury trials and hopes the congress will move quickly on the 
legislation to strengthen fair housing laws 
bush the republican presidential nomineetobe said the fish 
amendment will strengthen the fair housing law by giving hud 
secretary samuel pierce the necessary enforcement powers to more 
effectively combat housing discrimination 
a similar measure is pending in the senate which is expected to 
act as soon as the house approves the measure 
the bill also extends antidiscrimination provisions to families 
with children and to the disabled and requires that all new 
apartment buildings be constructed to permit access by the 
handicapped to some units it also requires landlords to permit 
disabled individuals at their own expense to adapt homes to suit 
their needs

the gulf between the haves and havenots in 
the savings and loan industry is yawning wider as institutions in 
texas continue to bleed red ink 
the federal home loan bank board said tuesday that the 3118 
federally insured savings institutions lost a staggering 378 
billion in the first three months of this year down only slightly 
from the 381 billion postdepression record set in the last 
quarter of 1987 
bank board economist james barth said 2164 institutions 69 
percent of the industry posted a 13 billion profit in the first 
quarter but that was overwhelmed by the 51 billion lost by the 
remaining 954 moneylosing institutions 
barth said three states plagued by moribund oil industries and 
depressed real estate prices texas oklahoma and louisiana 
accounted for 80 percent of the firstquarter loss 
texas alone where nearly half of the sampls 133 of 279 are 
considered insolvent racked up losses of 348 billion 
the 20 weakest sampls accounted for 3 billion of the loss up 
from 24 billion in the fourth quarter and the weakest 50 
accounted for 37 billion a single institution sun belt savings 
association in dallas lost 12 billion 
we do have a bifurcated industry barth said 
last year savings associations had their worst year since the 
great depression losing 76 billion if the first three months 
are any indication 1988 is likely to set another record 
by comparison the nations 13541 commercial banks earned 36 
billion in 1987 the smallest profit since the depression but 
recovered with a 5 billion gain in the first quarter of 1988 
still barth noted some hopeful signs for the savings industry 
the number of insolvent sampls under generally accepted accounting 
rules fell for the first time in two years from 518 to 504 
also earnings at thrifts considered solvent under lessstrict 
regulatory rules about 90 percent of the industry totaled 600 
million compared with a 200 million loss in the fourth quarter of 
1987 
and preliminary data for april indicate the industry as a whole 
could turn an operating profit in the second quarter 
there are a lot of things in these numbers to suggest that 
while the problem is terrible it is not getting worse said 
martin a regalia chief economist of the national council of 
savings institutions 
it is bottoming out somewhat i dont mean to put a favorable 
light on a 38 billion loss but there are some glimmers out 
there he said 
the question is how many more soured loans as yet unrecognized 
on sampls books are there loan losses accounted for 39 billion 
of the first quarter loss versus 4 billion the previous quarter 
i would expect they would start tapering off in texas weve 
had a massive amount of losses over the past few years said 
william c ferguson an irving texas sampl consultant i 
fervently hope it will taper off soon 
but other private analysts say billions more in bad loans are 
likely to surface and they say rising interest rates could cut 
into the operating profits of healthy thrifts 
a lot of people would say that losses in the industry total 
55 billion were still a long way from recognizing that plus 
there is some risk of shortterm interest rates going up and losses 
increasing said richard l peterson professor of finance at 
texas tech university in lubbock 
the question is becoming increasingly critical as regulators and 
congress try to determine how long the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp which insures savings deposits up to 100000 can 
continue operating without an infusion of more money 
bank board chairman m danny wall said the 20 billion the fslic 
will have over the next three years is as much as the agency can 
efficiently spend and it is too soon to tell if more will be needed 
later 
however the general accounting office congress auditing 
agency estimates it will cost 26 billion to 36 billion to clean 
up the industry private analysts put the price tag at 50 billion 
or more

the prospects that the reagan administration 
will be able to meet its 1467 billion budget deficit goal for the 
fiscal year are growing dimmer 
the treasury department said tuesday that personal incometax 
collections picked up in may after the april revenue flow lagged 
but the cumulative deficit of 1275 billion for the first eight 
months of the 1988 fiscal year is still running 63 percent higher 
than last year 
if we continue the pace we have right now it will come in at 
about 159 billion said samuel d kahan chief financial 
economist of kleinwort benson government securities inc in chicago 
unless they do some funny accounting theyre not going to be 
able to hit their goal for the year or even the congressional 
budget offices projection of 157 billion he said 
the deficit last year totaled 1502 billion after soaring to a 
record 2211 billion in 1986 the target for the 1989 fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 is set at 136 billion by the grammrudman budget 
balancing law 
the persistent imbalance between what the government spends and 
what it takes in is blamed by economists for weakening the dollar 
encouraging a high trade deficit and pressuring interest rates 
upward 
in may the deficit totaled 225 billion about 5 billion less 
than expected by most analysts and down 369 percent from 356 
billion a year ago 
personal income tax collection was off by 258 percent in april 
513 billion against 718 billion a year earlier but may 
collections were nearly double those of last year they rose from 
93 billion in 1987 to 180 billion the treasury department said 
basically the irs internal revenue service got money in may 
this year rather than in april kahan said 
economists trying to determine the 1988 number will be closely 
watching quarterly corporate tax collections which were due june 
15 
the question is if corporations with their sharp pencils can 
reduce some of the bite of the new tax law kahan said 
in may government revenues totaled 597 billion 252 percent 
stronger than in may 1987 spending totaled 822 billion down 13 
percent from a year ago 
for the first eight months revenue totaled 5818 billion up 
49 percent over 1987 while spending was 7093 billion up 52 
percent from a year ago 
as usual the largest spending categories in march were the 
military followed by social security interest on the national 
debt and other programs in the department of health and human 
services 
military spending totaled 203 billion last month and 1887 
billion for the fiscal year so far up 41 percent from the same 
period a year ago 
spending for social security totaled 181 billion last month 
and 1394 billion for the past eight months up 54 percent from 
the same period in fiscal 1987 
the other hhs programs including medicare and medicaid spent 
119 billion in may and 1051 billion so far this budget year a 
55 percent increase over 1987 
interest on the 25 trillion national debt totaled 174 
billion last month and 1375 billion so far this fiscal year an 
increase of 95 percent over the same period last year

a senate panel has cleared the way for an 800 
million appropriation for the planned us space station up from a 
200 million package approved last week that officials said was so 
small it would derail the project 
the senate appropriations defense subcommittee voted tuesday to 
shift 600 million from unspent defense funds to the national 
aeronautics and space administration budget the money is intended 
for the space station said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who helped 
arrange the transfer 
the big hurdle was the subcommittee bentsen said weve 
crossed the big hurdle 
another senate appropriations subcommittee which has 
jurisdiction over nasas budget voted last week to appropriate 
200 million for the space station bentsen said at the time that 
amount provides only enough for the slow strangulation of the 
project 
bentsen said an 800 million appropriation would be enough to 
reach the level of support that is needed and get it moving ahead 
as it should 
president reagan had asked for a 967 million appropriation for 
the space station in the next fiscal years budget and nasa 
officials said 900 million is needed to keep it on schedule 
construction of the space station could begin next year if it 
stays on schedule and it is planned to be in orbit around earth 
and occupied by astronauts by the end of 1996 officials say 
bentsen said he is optimistic the 800 million will clear the 
appropriations committee and the full senate 
the house appropriations committee however says the future of 
the project should depend on the next president the committee 
voted last week to appropriate 902 million for the space station 
but the next president would have to agree to go ahead with the 
project before the project could receive about half of that amount

new jersey sen bill bradley has plenty of 
practice answering the question hes most often asked these days 
would you accept the vice presidential nomination on a ticket with 
michael dukakis 
no no no is bradleys reply well rehearsed from the days 
not too long ago when the 44yearold democrat was as often 
asked if he would run for president 
speculation that the former basketball star was himself eyeing 
the white house ended in march when bradley threw his soughtafter 
support to the massachusetts governor 
bradleys endorsement answered for 1988 at least what bradley 
aides had wistfully come to call the p question 
yet the endorsement gave rise to the next query would bradley 
seek or accept the no 2 slot 
the basketball hall of fame member could bring a needed bit of 
pizazz to the dukakis ticket from bradleys continued celebrity 
from his days playing for princeton and the new york knicks 
also a rhodes scholar the intellectual senator specializes in 
economics and foreign affairs two areas key to a solid dukakis 
platform bradley has already traveled to boston to counsel dukakis 
on the soviets 
most pragmatically bradley is new jerseys most popular 
politician and could no doubt deliver the states 16 electoral 
college votes 
on the negative side the northeastern combination of bradley 
and dukakis would make a geographically lopsided team 
i think massachusetts and new jersey have a lot in common but 
i dont think they go together on a national ticket bradley says 
even more monotonous would be the combination of the two mens 
stiff speaking styles though a crowd pleaser bradley still 
struggles with the wooden delivery that labeled him boring since 
entering politics 10 years ago 
as with the presidency the everstudious bradley says he is 
unready to be vice president 
the senator always listens first to himself when advisers told 
him to attend a bigtime basketball school he went to princeton 
when they said go for the pros he accepted the rhodes scholarship 
in 1978 they told him to run for local office he got elected to 
the senate 
last week bradley met in private here with dukakis campaign 
chairman paul brountas aides made no secret that brountas who is 
heading the vice presidential search was seeking the senators 
input 
but bradley and his aides insisted the idea of bradley on the 
ticket was not discussed 
bradley says he wants to play a role at the democratic national 
convention next month in atlanta he has been mentioned as a 
possible keynote speaker as one of several promising democrats 
with guaranteed roles in the partys future 
but delivering the keynote speech would invite inevitable and 
unenviable comparisons to the impressive 1984 oratory by gov mario 
cuomo of new york bradley might be more comfortable with a 
lowerprofile speech perhaps nominating dukakis 
still young bradley has never ruled out the idea of one day 
running for president 
aides meanwhile say they are preparing for the next question 
which cabinet post will the senator want

a defense contractor told federal agents four 
years ago that a private consultant routinely provided his company 
with secret pentagon documents and every major corporation gets 
the same material 
the comments of walter r edgington then vice president of gte 
government systems corp meshed with remarks by a former pentagon 
investigator tuesday that the justice department had substantive 
evidence that there was massive fraud in military weapons 
purchases three years ago 
robert l segal a former drug enforcement administration agent 
who investigated procurement fraud cases at the pentagon for one 
year until his resignation in january 1985 said there was 
extensive evidence of wrongdoing even though only a handful of 
companies were charged 
gte government systems was one of the companies against which 
criminal charges were brought nearly three years ago after an 
investigation by the defense criminal investigative service for 
which segal worked 
the widespread pentagon investigation now under way centers on 
allegations that defense contractors and consultants bribed 
pentagon officials to obtain inside information that would give 
them a competitive advantage in the multimillion dollar procurement 
sweepstakes 
edgington and bernie zettl a former gte consultant were 
indicted on charges of espionage and theft of government property 
while robert r carter a former gte marketing manager was charged 
with participating in the alleged conspiracy 
the company agreed to plead guilty and was fined 500000 but 
nearly three years after the indictment the rest of the case still 
has not come to trial and all charges have been dropped except a 
conspiracy count against zettl 
delays have resulted from lengthy legal disputes over the 
release of classified material 
on feb 29 1984 edgington was interviewed by two pentagon 
investigators according to a document in the court file the 
defense contractor told the agents that when he first started with 
gte in 1966 everyone within the office had unauthorized 
classified documents 
to get a handle on all of the paper edgington said he got a 
good sergeant major and put all the documents in the file room so 
that they could at least be controlled according to the report 
on the interview 
every major corporation gets the same material edgington 
told the agents but he declined to reveal names of other companies 
with the unauthorized material 
edgington did say that zettl provided the documents to a gte 
employee who routed them to the proper people inside the company 
the gte vice president said he never asked zettl how he came upon 
the material because he wasnt interested 
edgington defended possession of classified documents as a tool 
in major technical planning the information saves the 
government money by cutting down on startup time for projects he 
said 
when one agent asked edgington why he didnt shut the document 
trafficking operation down once he knew about it he replied if 
you already have your feet in the mud why take a shower you still 
cant get rid of past dirt 
at his news conference segal now a stockbroker in suburban 
springfield va said he concluded three years ago that bribery 
and fraud in pentagon procurement were common 
segal was supposed to testify at a senate subcommittee oct 1 
1985 but was blocked by the justice department which claimed his 
testimony would have harmed an ongoing criminal case 
sen charles grassley riowa the subcommittee chairman at the 
time contends that the current pentagon bribery probe could have 
started three years ago had the justice department not stifled 
segals allegations 
attorney general edwin meese iii has defended the justice 
departments role 
in a related development tuesday sen david pryor dark said 
the congressional general accounting office estimates that the 
pentagon spent 28 billion on consultants in fiscal 1987 the 
pentagon has said it spent 155 million 
pryor said the gao estimate high as it is may still be far too 
low he said the gao estimated that consulting costs might run as 
high as 18 billion a year

here is the text of the economic declaration 
issued tuesday by the seven major industrialized countries at the 
end of their threeday summit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
1 we the heads of state or government of seven major 
industrial nations and the president of the commission of the 
european communities have met in toronto for the 14th annual 
economic summit we have drawn lessons from the past and looked 
ahead to the future 
2 over the past 14 years the world economy and economic policy 
have undergone profound changes in particular the 
informationtechnology revolution and the globalization of markets 
have increased economic interdependence making it essential that 
governments consider fully the international dimensions of their 
deliberations 
3 we observed a sharp contrast between the 1970s and the 1980s 
the former was a decade of high and rising inflation declining 
productivity growth policies dominated by shortterm 
considerations and frequently inadequate international policy 
cooperation 
in the 1980s inflation has been brought under control laying 
the basis for sustained strong growth and improved productivity 
the result has been the longet period of economic growth in 
postwar history however the 1980s have seen the emergence of 
large external imbalances in the major industrial economies 
greater exchange rate volatility and debtservicing difficulties 
in a number of developing countries 
our response to these developments has been an increased 
commitment to international cooperation resulting in the 
intensified process of policy coordination adopted at the 1986 
tokyo summit and further strengthened at the venice summit and in 
the group of seven 
4 summits have proven an effective form to address the issues 
facing the world economy promote new ideas and develop a common 
sense of purpose especially in the 1980s theyhave helped bring 
about an increasing recognition that the eradication of inflation 
and of inflationary expectations is fundamental to sustained growth 
and job creation that recognition has been underpinned by a shift 
from shortterm considerations to a mediumterm framework for the 
development and implementation of economic policies and a 
commitment to improve efficiency and adaptability through greater 
reliance on competitive forces and structural reform over this 
period we have also singled out for concerted attention a number of 
other issues of decisive importance 
the overriding need to resist protectionism and strengthen the 
open multilateral trading system 
to maintain and strengthen an effective strategy to address the 
challenge of development and alleviate the burden of debt 
and to deal with the serious nature of the world agricultural 
problem 
5 since we last met our economies have kept up the momenum of 
growth employment has continued to expand generally inflation has 
been restrained and progess has been made toward the correction of 
major external imbalances these encouraging developments are cause 
for optimism but not for complacency to sustain noninflationary 
growth will require a commitment to enhanced cooperation this is 
the key to credibility and confidence

6 the tokyo and venice summits have developed and strengthened 
the process of coordination of our economic policies developments 
in the wake of the financial strains last october demonstrate the 
effectiveness and resilience of the arrangements that have emerged 
the policy the shortterm prospects and the mediumterm 
objectives and projections of our economies are being discussed 
regularly in the group of seven the policies and performance are 
assessed on the basis of economic indicators 
we welcome the progress made in refining the analytical use of 
indicators as well as the addition to the existing indicators of a 
commodityprice indicator the progress in coordination is 
contributing to the process of further improving the functioning of 
the international monetary system 
7 fiscal monetary and structural policies have been undertaken 
to foster the adjustment to more sustainable economic and financial 
positions in the context of noninflationary growth efforts in 
those directons including continued reduction of budgetary 
deficits will continue we need to maintain vigilance against any 
resurgence of inflation 
we reaffirm our determination to follow and wherever feasible 
strengthen our agreed strategy of coordinated efforts to reduce the 
growth of spending in countries with large external deficits and to 
sustain the momentum of domestic demand in those with large 
external surpluses the reduction of large external imbalances 
however will require not only our cooperative efforts but also 
those of smaller economies including newly industrializing 
economies with large external surpluses 
8 the exchange rate changes in the past three years especially 
the depreciation of the us dollar against the japanese yen and 
the major european currencies have played a major role in the 
adjustment of real trade balances we endorse the group of sevens 
conclusion that either excessive fluctuation of exchange rates a 
further decline of the dollar or a rise in the dollar to an extent 
that becomes destabilizing to the adjustment process could be 
counterproductive by damaging growth prospects in the world 
economy

9 international cooperation involves more than coordination of 
macroeconomic policies structural reforms complement macroeconomic 
policies enhance their effectiveness and provide the basis for 
more robust growth we shall collectively review our progress on 
structural reforms and shall strive to integrate structural 
policies into our economic coordination process 
10 we will continue to pursue structural reforms by removing 
barriers unnecessary controls and regulations increasing 
competition while mitigating adverse effects on social groups or 
regions removing disincentives to work save and invest such as 
through tax reform and by improving education and training the 
specific priorities that each of us has identified are outlined in 
the attached annex on structural reforms 
11 we welcome the further development of the oecds 
surveillance of structural reforms such surveillance would be 
particularly useful in improving public understanding of the 
reforms by revealing their impact on government budgets consumer 
prices and international trade 
12 one of the major structural problems in both developed and 
developing countries is in the field of agricultural policies it 
is essential that recent significant policy reform efforts 
undertaken by a number of parties be continued through further 
positive action by all summit participants more marketoriented 
agricultural policies should assist in the achievement of important 
objectives such as preserving rural areas and family farming 
raising quality standards and protecting the environment we 
welcome the oecds increased emphasis on structural adjustment and 
development in the rural economy 
13 financial and technological innovations are rapidly 
integrating financial markets internationally contributing to a 
better allocation of capital but also increasing the speed and 
extent to which disturbances in one country may be transmitted to 
other countries we will continue to cooperate with other countries 
in the examination of the functioning of the global financial 
system including securities markets

14 a successful uruguay round will assure the integrity of an 
open predictable multilateral trading system based on clear rules 
and will lead to trade expansion and enhanced economic growth at 
punta del este ministers committed themsleves to further trade 
liberalization across the wide range of goods and services 
including such new areas as traderelated intellectual property and 
traderelated investment measures to strengthen the multilateral 
trading system and to allow for early agreement where appropriate 
countries must continue to resist protectionism and the temptation 
to adopt unilateral measures outside the framework of gatt rules 
and to allow for early agreements where appropriate in order to 
preserve a favorable negotiating climate the participants should 
conscientiously implement the commitments to standstill and 
rollback that they have taken at punta del este and subsequent 
international meetings 
15 we strongly welcome the free trade agreement between canada 
and the usa and the steady progress towards the target of the 
european community to complete the internal market by 1992 it is 
our policy that these developments together with other moves 
towards regional cooperation in which our countries are involved 
should support the open multilateral trading system and catalyze 
the liberalizing impact of the uruguay round 
16 we attach major importance to strengthening the gatt itself 
it is vital that the gatt become a more dynamic and effective 
organization particularly in regard to the surveillance of trade 
policies and dispute settlement procedures with greater 
ministerial involvement and strengthened linkages with other 
international organizations gatt disciplines must be improved so 
that members accept their obligations and ensure that disputes are 
resolved speedily effectively and equitably 
17 trade plays a key role in development we encourage the 
developing countries especially the newly industrializing 
economies to undertake increased commitments and obligations and a 
greater role in the gatt commensurate with their importance in 
international trade and in the international adjustment process as 
well as with their respective stages of development equally 
developed countries should continue to strive to ensure more open 
markets for the exports of developing countries 
18 in agriculture continued political impetus is essential to 
underpin the politically difficult efforts at domestic policy 
reform and to advance the equally difficult and related process of 
agricultural trade reform although significant progress was made 
in 1987 in the uruguay round negotiations with the tabling of 
major proposals it is necessary to ensure that the midterm review 
in montreal in december 1988 adds impetus to the negotiations in 
this as in other fields we support efforts to adopt a framework 
approach including short as well as longterm elements which will 
promote the reform process as launched last year and relieve 
current strains in agricultural markets this would be facilitated 
by a device for the measurement of support and protection also 
ways should be developed to take account of food security and 
social concerns to move the issue forward and noting among other 
things the diversity of our agricultural situations our 
negotiators in geneva must develop a framework approach which 
includes shortterm options in line with longterm goals concerning 
the reduction of all direct and indirect subsidies and other 
measures affecting directly or indirectly agricultural trade the 
objective of the framework approach would be to make the 
agricultural sector more responsive to market signals 
19 as the uruguay round enters a more difficult phase it is 
vital to ensure the momentum of these ambitious negotiations the 
midterm review will provide a unique opportunity to send a 
credible political signal to the trading world the greatest 
possible advance must be made in all areas of the negotiations 
including where appropriate decisions so as to reach before the 
end of the year the stage where tangible progress can be 
registered to this end we support efforts to adopt a framework 
approach on all issues in the negotiations ie reform of the gatt 
system and rules market access agriculture and new issues such 
as trade in services traderelated intellectual property rights 
and traderelated investment measures for our part we are 
committed to ensure that the midterm review establishes a solid 
base for the full and complete success of the negotiations in 
accordance with the punta del este declaration 
20 we all recognize the critical and expanding role of 
international investment in the world economy aand share a deep 
concern that increased protectionism would undermine the benefits 
of open investment policies we resolve to progressively liberalize 
international investment policies and urge other countries to do 
likewise

21 certain newlyindustrializing economies nies in the 
asiapacific region have become increasingly important in world 
trade although these economies differ in many important respects 
they are all characterized by dynamic exportled growth which has 
allowed them to treble their share of world trade since 1960 other 
outwardoriented asian countries are also beginning to emerge as 
rapidlygrowing exporters of manufactures with increased economic 
importance come greater international responsibilities and a strong 
mutual interest in improved constructive dialogue and cooperative 
efforts in the near term between the industrialized countries and 
the asian nies as well as the other outwardoriented countries in 
the region the dialogue and cooperative efforts could center on 
such policy areas as macroeconomic currency structural and trade 
to achieve the international adjustment necessary for sustained 
balanced growth of the world economy we encourage the development 
of informal processes which would facilitate multilateral 
dicussions of issues of mutual concern and foster the necessary

22 the performance of developing countries is increasingly 
important to the world economy central to the prospects of the 
developing countries are a healthy global economic environment and 
an open trading system adequate financial flows and most 
important their commitment to appropriate economic reform the 
problems of many heavilyindebted developing countries are a cause 
of economic and political concern and can be a threat to political 
stability in developing countries several countries find 
themselves in that situation in various regions of the world latin 
america africa and the pacific particularly the philippines and 
that merits our special attention 
</TEXT>

23 a number of highlyindebted middleincome countries continue 
to have difficulties serving their external debt and generating the 
investment necessary for sustainable growth the marketoriented 
growthled strategy based on the casebycase approach remains the 
only viable approach for overcoming their external debt problems 
24 we are encouraged that many indebted countries have begun 
the difficult process of macroeconomic adjustment and structural 
reform necessary for sustained progress encouraging the return of 
flight capital and new investment flows the success of these 
efforts is essential for improving the economic performance and 
strengthening the creditworthiness of these countries 
25 official financing has played a central role in the debt 
strategy through the paris club 73 billion of principal and 
interest have been consolidated since 1983 and the flexible 
policies of export credit agencies the international financial 
institutions will continue to have a pivotal role we endorse the 
recent initiatives taken by the international monetary fund to 
strengthen its capacity to support mediumterm programs of 
macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform and to provide 
greater protection for adjustment programs from unforeseen external 
developments we strongly support the full implementation of the 
world banks 75 billion general capital increase to strengthen its 
capacity to promote adjustment in middleincome countries we also 
support greater awareness by international financial institutions 
of the environmental impact of their development programs 
26 commercial banks have played an important role in supporting 
debtor countries reform efforts through an expanded menu of 
financing options which has facilitated the channelling of 
commercial bank lending into productive uses their continued 
involvement is indispensable to the debt strategy in this regard 
the world bank and imf can play an important catalytic role in 
mobilizing additional financing from private and official sources 
in support of debtor countries adjustment programs 
27 we note that in recent years there has been increasing 
recourse to innovative financing techniques the important 
characteristics of these techniques are that they are voluntary 
marketoriented and applied on a casebycase basis the menu 
approach has engendered new financial flows and in some cases 
reduced the existing stock of debt the flexibility of the present 
strategy would be enhanced by the further broadening of the menu 
approach and the encouragement of innovative financing techniques 
to improve the quality of new lending but particular initiatives 
would have to be carefully considered 
28 international direct investment plays an important role in 
spurring economic growth and structural adjustment in developing 
countries thus it contributes to alleviating debt problems 
developing countries should welcome and encourage such investment 
by creating a favorable investment climate

creditors are rescheduling debt at extended grace and repayment 
periods in addition the recent enhancement of the imfs 
structural adjustment facility the world bank and official 
development assistance oda agencies enhanced program of 
cofinancing and the fifth replenishment of the african

30 we welcome proposals made by several of us to ease further 
the debt service burdens of the poorest countries that are 
undertaking internationallyapproved adjustment programs we have 
achieved consensus on rescheduling official debt of these countries 
within a framework of comparibility that allows official creditors 
to choose among concessional interest rates usually on shorter 
maturities longer repayment periods at commercial rates partial 
writeoffs of debt service obligations during the consolidation 
period or a combination of these options this approach allows 
official creditors to choose options consistent with their legal or 
budgetary constraints the paris club has been urged to work out 
necessary technicalities to ensure comparability by the end of the 
year at the very latest this approach will provide benefits over 
and above the impressive multilateral agreements to help the 
poorest countries over the past year we also welcome the action 
taken by a numbr of creditor governments to write off or otherwise 
remove the burden of oda loans and also urge countries to maintain 
a high grant element in their future assistance to the poorest

31 we agree that the protection and enhancement of the 
environment is essential the report of the world commission on 
environment and development has stressed that environmental 
considerations must be integrated into all areas of economic 
policymaking if the globe is to continue to support humankind we 
endorse the concept of sustainable development 
32 threats to the environment recognize no boundaries their 
urgent nature requires strengthened international cooperation among 
all countries significant progress has been achieved in a number 
of environmental areas the montreal protocol on substances that 
deplete the ozone layer is a milestone all countries are 
encouraged to sign and ratify it 
33 further action is needed global climate change air sea 
and fresh water pollution acid rain hazardous substances 
deforestation and endangered species require priority attention 
it is therefore timely that negotiations on a protocol on 
emissions of nitrogen oxides within the framework of the geneva 
convention on longrange transboundary air pollution be pursued 
energetically the efforts of the united nations environment 
program unep for an agreement on the transfrontier shipment of 
hazardous wastes should also be encouraged as well as the 
establishment of an intergovernmental panel on global climate 
change under the auspices of unep and the world meteorological 
organization wmo we also recognize the potential impact of 
agriculture on the environment whether negative through 
overintensive use of resources or positive in preventing 
desertification we welcome the conference on the changing

34 we the heads of state or government and the 
representatives of the european community believe that the 
economic summits have strengthened the ties of solidarity both 
political and economic that exist between our countries and that 
thereby they have helped to sustain the values of democracy that 
underlie our economic and political systems our annual meetings 
have provided the principal opportunity each year for the 
governments of the major industrialized countries to reflect in an 
informal and flexible manner upon their common responsibility for 
the progress of the world economy and to resolve how that 
responsibility should have practical manifestation in the year 
ahead we believe that the mutual understanding engendered in our 
meetings has benefited both our own countries and the wider world 
community we believe too that the opportunities afforded by our 
meetings are becoming even more valuable in todays world of 
increasing interdependence and increasing technological change we 
have therefore agreed to institute a further cycle of summits by 
accepting the invitation of the president of the french republic to 
meet in france july 1416 1989

europe is pursuing structural reforms to complement 
macroeconomic policies in order to spur job creation enhance 
growth potential and achieve a sustainable pattern of external 
balances structural reform measures are being put into place in 
the framework of the communities program for a unified internal 
market by 1992 including full liberalization of capital movements 
removal of physical administrative and technical barriers to allow 
the full mobility of persons goods and services and an improvement 
of competition policy however full achievement will depend on 
complete and timely implementation of the measures and on 
complementary policies including those in the fields of regional 
social and environmental policies and of technological cooperation 
the main elements of germanys structural reforms are tax 
reform and reduction deregulation and privatization reform of the 
postal and telecommunications system increased flexibility in the 
labor market and reform of the social security system 
in france the main structural reforms will deal with improving 
the level of education and professional training and development 
for workers and with major improvements in the functioning of 
financial markets in order to facilitate the financing of the 
economy at the lowest possible cost 
italy will seek to promote training and education increase the 
flexibility of the labor market to spur employment improve the 
functioning of financial markets revise the tax system to promote 
efficiency and eliminate distortions enhance public sector 
efficiency 
in the united kingdom there has already been a substantial 
program of tax reform trade union law reform deregulation 
opening up of markets and privatization of state industries this 
will continue further measures are being introduced to improve 
both the quality of education and the flexibility of the housing 
market 
japan will pursue further structural reforms to support and 
sustain the greater reliance on domestic demandled growth which 
has quickened remarkably japan will promote reform of government 
regulations in key sectors including land use policies and the 
distribution system and reform of the tax system 
for the united states where recent indications that the 
declining trend in private savings may have bottomed out are 
encouraging it is nonetheless a priority to increase incentives to 
save also the united states will strengthen the international 
competitiveness of its industrial sector 
the most promising areas of structural reform in canada are 
implementation of the second stage of tax reform the proposed 
liberalization of the financial services sector and most 
important templementation of the free trade agreement with the 
united states

here is a transcript of president reagans news 
conference tuesday 
well please be seated 
i have a little statement here first id like to impose on you 
ill this will be before taking questions 
todays ceremonies as you know marked the end of my eighth 
economic summit 
and over the years i have come to regard the summit process as 
extremely important in forging a coordinated economic approach for 
the united states and the other industrialized democracies 
its helped return the nations represented here to steady 
growth and helped to establish a consensus among us that only free 
and open markets and only free and open societies foster economic 
progress and opportunity 
maybe one of the best ways to view these economic summits is to 
compare discussions at them whether heralded in our communiques or 
not with later results 
for example our 1981 communique from ottawa said the primary 
challenge we addressed at this meeting was the need to revitalize 
the economies of the industrial democracies 
revitalization of course has been achieved in part because 
the common commitment at ottawa inaugurated a search for consensus 
on how to work together to release the productive energies of our 
peoples 
and today gross national products are growing as are 
employment numbers and real personal incomes 
our economic expansion in the united states got the ball rolling 
and helped crystalize the new consensus 
and now everyone is part of the act 
to take another example in our 1986 tokyo economic communique 
we said there should be close and continuous coordination of 
economic policy among the seven summit countries 
today policy coordination is a major pillar of the economic 
policies of all our countries 
its a significant reason why the world market in stabilizes of 
last october or instabilities i should say of last october had 
so little impact on our underlying economies 
the summit in tokyo gave the political push that ensured that 
the fledgling process of coordination grew strong and robust 
so here we are celebrating this summit with a measure of pride 
some significant items are still in need of attention but all 
in all how things have changed over the years 
the economies of the summit countries have come roaring back 
driven by a common commitment to replace government control with 
marketoriented policies 
these summits are building blocks for tomorrow 
goals we set in earlier years have borne fruit 
i believe that the goals were setting now will become the 
landmarks for the future

shortly before 10 am toni kurasch spread her 
blanket on the great lawn in central park and plopped a 
handlettered sign on it reading beware of dog 
nine hours later no dog had appeared but ms kuraschs sign 
had served its purpose safeguarding her spot in front of an 
estimated 150000 other picnicking music lovers who thronged to 
tuesday nights free concert by the metropolitan opera 
the work being performed donizettis elixir of love seemed 
incidental for most of the crowd to the main attraction a chance 
to hear tenor luciano pavarotti and soprano kathleen battle 
luckily both were in top form which means they sang about as 
well as any two singers alive are capable of singing 
its great theyve managed to assemble such an array of 
talent said jane sternsnyder who came from philadelphia for the 
event one doesnt sit in this heat for no reason 
that was at noon nearly three hours before the temperature 
peaked at a withering 97 degrees at performance time the sun was 
still blazing enough for parks commissioner henry stern to joke 
that the audience could get both an opera and a suntan 
but as the sun went down the music took hold of the crowd 
which spread back the length of several football fields from the 
portable stage and two 40foot amplifiers even from the far edge 
of the lawn the singers came through clearly though they looked 
no bigger than ants 
up close pavarotti amp co were almost as much fun to watch as to 
hear using broad gestures and facial expressions to get across the 
comic action outstanding in this respect was baritone giuseppe 
taddei whose infectious enthusiasm brought dr dulcamara the love 
potion peddler vividly to life 
pavarotti has always had a special fondness for the part of the 
bumbling lovestruck nemorino and he sang with more ease and 
elegance than he sometimes musters these days his rendition of the 
famous aria una furtiva lagrima brought such an ovation that he 
responded with an encore something thats strictly taboo at the 
indoor met 
as for miss battle in the role of adina she poured out delicate 
tones of unmatched beauty all night earning an encore of her own 
near the finale 
paolo coni a baritone who will make his official debut with the 
met next season displayed a vibrant powerful sound as sergeant 
belcore and soprano dawn kotoski was excellent in the small part 
of giannetta conductor marcello panni led a spirited performance 
in his american debut 
crowd estimates are notoriously unreliable but met spokeswoman 
johanna fiedler said she figured the attendance at about 150000 
compared with the previous record of 100000 for an opera in the 
park 
the performance kicked off the mets 22nd season of free opera 
in the park a nearly 2 million endeavor whose major sponsor is 
chemical bank the opera company visits each of new york citys 
five boroughs long island and new jersey though the allstar cast 
sang only on opening night 
opera lovers who missed pavarotti and miss battle can catch them 
in elixir at the met next season the acoustics will be better 
but youll pay for it up to 90 for the best orchestra seats

looking back at how much has been achieved since the last time 
the summit was in canada is it any wonder that our seven free 
democratic industrialized nations are turning with confidence to 
the future to the challenges and opportunities that new 
technology more closelyknit global markets and a free world will 
bring on and are working together 
during our meetings here we discussed the international 
economic and political situation 
we reviewed the economic policy coordination process the world 
debt situation particularly that of the poorer countries the 
state of the uruguay round of trade negotiations particularly in 
agriculture and international cooperation to stop the production 
and flow of illegal drugs 
we also had a fruitful exchange of views on eastwest relations 
terrorism and regional political issues 
yesterday afternoon prime minister mulroney organized an 
informal session where leaders shared their thoughts on the 
economic future of the summit countries 
in that session i said that i believed that the expansion of 
global markets and the enormous technological advances that are 
coming in the years ahead will demand even closer coordination of 
economic policies 
all of our economies must be flexible and open not burdened by 
excessive regulations high taxes and all the other rigidities 
that too many economies have known too well 
last night my colleagues and i spoke of the future of the 
education of our children of assisting those displaced by the 
rapid pace of economic change most notably our farmers of 
removing structural impediments in our economies so that were all 
flexible enough to meet the challenges of the rapid technological 
changes and economic integration that is the hallmark of the future 
the summit nations can be partners in a great venture to 
progress 
yes we can seize our opportunities or we can watch the world go 
by 
im confident which path our nations will choose 
as i said before leaving washington the future belongs to the 
flexible 
eight years ago youd have heard arguments about that today it 
defines the consensus among the seven nations that meet at these 
economic summits 
and finally in closing let me say thank you to the people of 
toronto and to prime minister mulroney for hosting us with such 
courtesy and enthusiasm 
they made all of us in the american delegation and im 
confident those in other delegations as well feel right at home 
after just three days here we share one common sentiment we 
love canada 
so thank you 
and terry teeoff

q mr president i want to ask you about the investigation of 
corruption at the pentagon caspar weinberger your former defense 
secretary says that perhaps the defense department wasnt as 
vigilant as it should have been do you share any responsibility 
for that sir or feel any sense of failure or disappointment 
a well i think all of us are disappointed and upset that such 
a thing could happen 
i think that cap weinberger was just being or trying to join 
in here 
i think he was one of the finest secretaries of defense this 
country has had and i think he was doing all that he could to 
bring a national security out of chaos the kind that we inherited 
for him to take some responsibility of course he was heading 
up there and i suppose i could do the same thing except that you 
have to look at what is being unveiled here that one tip came from 
one individual and immediately the naval intelligence or 
investigative unit began an investigation based on that single tip 
and then called for help from the federal bureau of investigation 
they joined in and for two years theyve been tracking this 
down to finally the place where they have come to the point in 
which they feel they can serve indictments 
and i have to say that i think that it should be understandable 
how such things can happen in something as big as our government is 
but i think we also ought to recognize that within our 
government and the minute there was one tip of something of that 
nature was going on it was the units to which we entrust such 
things the this naval unit and the fbi that set to work and 
now is ready to act 
q but how much ammunition do you think that this gives michael 
dukakis on the socalled sleaze factor 
a i dont think it really gives him any at all 
i dont think this is a case at apparently at high levels 
i think the very fact that it was investigated let me just 
point something out theres almost an accusation in the fact of 
why didnt some of us know 
i think the tip that came and the investigation that was 
started reflected that there wasnt anyone up to and including 
me that the investigators could feel free to inform of this 
they had no idea where this leveled off or how far it went or 
how high it went 
so they set out keeping their own decisions to themselves and 
investigated 
and now they have come forth with this and some of us have been 
notified now about what was going on but i think they were proper 
the danger of leaks and everything else and not knowing where this 
investigation might take them to do just as they did

q mr president you didnt know about the diversion of funds 
you say in the irancontra scandal weinberger doesnt know about 
all of this alleged rampant bribery fraud who is in charge i 
mean where does the buck stop why arent you accountable to the 
public trust and id like to follow up 
a we are accountable 
on the other hand i think theres some things that you can see 
in something as complex as that whole process and the number of 
corporations and all 
corporate heads probably are surprised at what theyre learning 
also 
because you cant be down there watching several million people 
in the total of all of the companies and of the defense department 
every day and what theyre doing or what phone calls theyre 
making 
and im quite sure that no one would think that we should be 
tapping all of those phones and listening in on conversations of 
everybody just on the suspicion that someone might be out of line 
q mr president in terms of the scandals senator mitchell has 
asked that specifically that you not pardon colonel north and 
admiral poindexter before they are tried because he said that 
otherwise there might be a perception of purchasing silence are 
you willing to give that commitment 
a well i have said already that while i dont think that those 
men were guilty of any lawbreaking of any kind but of course 
the case should has to go forward or they would live the rest of 
their lives under a shadow of guilt 
so i have no intention of 
now wait a minute 
let me move back for some of our visitors 
q mr president do you plan a visit to the areas of the 
country that have been afflicted by the drought and recognize 
this is about the drought do you plan a visit to the drought area 
of the country sir and recognizing that your interagency 
committee on the drought has not made its report could you give us 
an idea of what specific steps you are considering to help the 
farmers in view of the drought 
a oh well here we secretary of agriculture has taken his 
place and we have a task force out there taking a look a firsthand 
look at the situation 
and were going to have to see what we can do 
we dont underestimate the seriousness of this at all 
and im here in this summit 
theyre out there finding out 
and outside of praying for rain there isnt anything i can do 
until we here from them 
q mr president if i may follow up sir are you planning to 
visit the drought area yourself and take a firsthand look yourself 
</TEXT>

a thats going to depend on whether the task force sees that 
there might be any value in doing that 
chris 
q thank you mr president you suggested the other day and 
you seem to be suggesting today that the pentagon scandal is just 
a case of a few people gone wrong but in fact there are 200 
subpoenas out on this case a number of the top procurement 
officers at the pentagon are under investigation and so are almost 
all of the top defense contractors isnt the greater likelihood 
that this is a very widespread scandal 
a oh listen 
im aware of the numbers and i if i gave that impression that 
this is minor in some way not at all 
i dont feel that way at all 
as a matter of fact im very upset 
the only thing im calling attention to is that that same that 
same department the department of defense is the one that 
uncovered and then proceeded to investigate and pin down where 
there was guilt 
but we now have to wait and find out under the due process of 
law that it definitely is guilt on individuals part 
there may be some people that are falsely suspected and we 
should know that too 
but no im not taking this lightly at all but i do think that 
you all ought to call you all ought to pay attention to the fact 
that it wasnt an outside investigation 
q if i may follow up sir its been suggested that contracts 
with some of these defense contractors may have to be suspended 
until the investigation proves out are you concerned about the 
impact on the national security either in terms of slowing down 
the defense buildup or the further erosion of support for your 
defense buildup 
a well im concerned about any or anything that affects our 
national security 
at the same time however i recognize that we have established 
a national security system that we didnt have a few years ago and 
that we have produced enough strength that resulted in things like 
the inf treaty with a potential adversary the soviet union and 
that has to be taken into account too 
but i havent seen any we cant judge yet whether theres 
something specific in all of these things that might have in some 
way lessened our the recovery of our defensive strength 
im looking for somebody from the local press and then ill 
come back down front 
q mr president id like to ask you about the savings and loan 
industry this year there were record losses in the industry 
close to 4 billion has been spent bailing out savings and loans 
its estimated that it will take 75 billion to get it on its feet 
is there a crisis in the savings and loan industry and will the 
american taxpayer have to bail it out

<TEXT>
a well i certainly hope not and i dont think so and i dont 
believe theres a crisis 
the market today went up 25 points and our growth is still 
continuing and theres no sign of inflation and things of that 
kind or panic 
but yes there is a problem there and were trying to deal with 
the problem 
sam 
q mr president recently washington columnist carl rowan 
beieved he was threatened by people in his backyard he took a gun 
which was unregistered and he shot he said as a warning shot a 
young man was nicked in the wrist do you think its a good idea 
for citizens to have guns in their home and to go out and use them 
if they feel threatened 
a well sam as i understand it what carl was saying was that 
his son who was entitled to have a gun left that gun there and 
it was a registered gun with regard to his son 
on the other hand i try to keep thinking this was 2 oclock in 
the morning someone is coming toward him 
he had that but you asked a question in general not just 
about him 
you asked whether people should have 
sam i going to answer by way of a letter a very interesting 
letter that i received when i was governor of california 
it came from a burglar who was serving time in san quentin 
prison 
and there was a big movement on in california at that time as 
there continually is every place to eliminate the citizens having 
weapons 
and this burglar prisoner wrote to me and said i just want 
to tell that if that goes through that law there will be 
hundreds of very happy people here in san quentin 
he said we case a place that weve planned for robbery or 
burglary we get to know the habits of the people and their 
comings and goings and so forth 
but he said the one thing we never can know in advance is in 
that household in a drawer by the bed does the householder have a 
gun 
and he said if you can ever tell us that none of them do 
that they dont have them then i can assure you that all of us 
burglars are going to be very happy 
i think we ought to pay heed to that 
q but sir is it worth it statistics show that when 
homeowners or citizens use handguns normally they shoot 
themselves their loved ones or strangers who are not engaged in a 
criminal act by mistake is it worth all these lives in order to 
attempt to try to shoot one burglar

<TEXT>
a well sam ill tell you 
theres some certain things that i would go for 
for example in california for a citizen to buy a gun that 
citizen has to come in lay down the money of course name 
address and so forth 
and then doesnt get the gun 
and this goes to an agency in the state government that looks 
into that persons entire background as to who and what they are 
and then they come back after that investigation and if they 
dont have a record of any crimes or mental problems or anything 
of that kind they are allowed to take their gun home 
now i would like to see that generally i think that all 
states ought to take a look at that system 
but in addition i think that maybe we could tie to that 
making sure that they arent just totally absent of any knowledge 
of weapons 
i taught my entire family out at the ranch how to shoot a gun in 
case they ever had to 
and i think maybe there could be some restrictions that there 
had to be a certain amount of training taken 
now let me no no here and then back to you no no you 
get up yes and then yes and then ill take him 
q my name is jerry oleary and im 
a i know jerry 
q mr president have you give up on doing anything forceful 
about the continuing chaos in panama and nicaragua and now once 
again in haiti since you have not used up all of your options 
including the option of military force and is there any prospect 
at all in the rest of your administration for resuming military 
assistance to the resistance fighters 
a well jerry on the first thing of panama i have to say to 
you that there are many things i cant comment we still have some 
of our economic measures in place 
we still feel as we always did that a military dictatorship in 
panama under general noriega is not what we want to see continue 
but i cant speculate or even hint at what might be options that 
are being considered or anything of that kind because i just dont 
i dont think it would be suitable and i dont think it would be 
helpful 
but we have not changed our minds about the fact that panama 
should return to a civilian democracy 
q this is very short indeed what did you mean when you said 
today when you were asked if mr dukakis would win and you said 
over my live body 
a well because the old expression is my dead body and i 
wouldnt somebody to take me up on that 
the gentleman back there 
q if i could ask briefly about the economic summit the 
communique 
a i was all set for that too 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP880622-0032 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
q the communique praises the canadianamerican free trade deal 
if for whatever reason the deal doesnt go through what would 
that do to canadianamerican relations 
a well i certainly dont think it would change the 
relationship that the prime minister and i have and i also dont 
think that it would do away with the friendship that exists between 
americans and canadians 
were pretty unique in the world theres no place quite like 
well there isnt any place like this five thousand miles of 
border as your prime minister has said without a loaded gun along 
that border 
i think were very very proud of that 
and ive had an idea here i know that in your parliament there 
are critics there are in our congress and ive had it figured out 
that if i could get what the critics in the parliament are saying 
about maybe this bill favoring the united states and take it down 
and show it to our congress and in turn send what our congress are 
saying about this favoring canada up here to the parliament i 
think it would be passed in a minute and a half 
and im not going to do that but im optimistic im 
optimistic that we can get it 
and it will be i think it will have an effect on the entire 
trade of the world 
we are the two biggest trading partners in the world 
and for us to establish the biggest free trading area in the 
world is right in keeping with all the things that weve been doing 
bill 
q mr president during the irancontra scandal america 
learned that there were people in the white house making foreign 
policy in effect without your knowledge and that of some of your 
other senior officials now we have the situation in the pentagon 
sir where there is apparently a burgeoning scandal which happened 
without the knowledge of you or your secretary of defense 
reflecting on this sir have you thought that you might have 
changed your style of management would you wish to have had a more 
handson approach now that youre at the end of your term would 
that have changed things would it have helped 
a i dont think it would have changed anything in this present 
situation at all 
i dont think theres any way that anyone at higher levels could 
have had access to this information or what was going on 
with regard to the iran and contra contra affair i would just 
like i havent had a chance to do this for a long time id like 
to remind you all that im the one who told all of you of what had 
just been discovered 
and it was discovered after the leak came out of a newspaper in 
lebanon charging the trading of hostages for arms and that i was 
dealing with the ayatollah 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP880622-0033 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
let me say with great emphasis and to all the rest of you who 
arent as close to washington as some of the people here theres 
no scandal we were not doing business with the ayatollah 
we were keeping the operation covert because by way of a third 
country some individuals from iran who were heeding the warnings 
that we were being given at about that time that the ayatollah 
might not live out the week and there was factionalism rising as 
to who was going to have to do with the new government 
these individuals were we were assured were pretty 
responsible by that third country which was much closer to the 
situation and they wanted to meet to discuss with us what might 
be the future relations between our two countries when the 
ayatollah was gone and i sent a team 
now you couldnt send the secretary of state or people of that 
kind there because it wouldnt be covert any longer theyre 
recognizable 
i dont mean that hed tell hes just you know he cant be 
anonymous anymore or people like him 
but anyway we sent them there to make contact 
and now back came this request from them that what it would do 
for them in the event of forming a new government and so forth a 
more or less token shipment of a type of weapon 
we i sent word back that we didnt do business with countries 
that supported terrorism 
well they sent back reminding us that they werent representing 
the country they werent that government and they wouldnt if 
they were to be a government they wouldnt do these things 
and so then was when i sent word back and said well all 
right but i know that there are connections in iran with the 
hezbollah who are holding american hostages now well do this if 
you will use your influence if you have any to see if you can get 
our hostages back 
and they said yes 
well they got two of them back and we were supposed to get two 
more within 48 hours 
now all of this i told to you when after it broke and the news 
had broken that we were doing this the our own investigation 
began and we found one memorandum that indicated that there was 
more money than we had received for our weapons 
we got the money that we had coming to us but suddenly we had 
and i told you that and that we were trying to find out and 
that i was appointing a commission under secretary or under 
senator tower to find out how could there be additional money 
there 
and after all the months of investigation by the congress i 
still havent found out how there was extra money 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
q well sir if you had kept a tighter rein on what was going 
on and inquired more closely into what was happening in this and 
in other situations might it not have happened 
a i dont see how i could have without endangering the people 
we were doing business with 
if they were identified they were they could be executed 
they werent representing the government 
and to tell you the truth i dont know whether theyre alive 
today 
and as a matter of fact when this all broke one of our 
hostages had just been released jacobsen 
and he pled with you one day out in the rose garden at that time 
to please not talk about this because we could get some people 
killed 
q mr president but in this case you have said that cap 
weinberger helped take the national security out of chaos can you 
really disagree with both republicans and democrats who are saying 
that your administration threw so much money at the pentagon and 
hired people to manage it who were hired for their conservative 
values rather than their management skills and that in this 
administration there was a different structural approach to 
controlling the spending of these billions of dollars 
a no i dont believe that or agree with it and they were 
appointed because of their business skill 
id made statements many times during the campaign that i didnt 
want people that were out looking for a job in government 
i wanted people that would make a sacrifice to work for 
government and id then take them for as long as they as they 
could stay there 
and this we did 
but with regard to throwing this money at the pentagon id like 
to call your attention to something 
when i took office on any given day 50 percent of our military 
planes couldnt take off for lack of spare parts and fuel half of 
our naval vessels couldnt leave port for the same reason or in 
addition a lack of crew 
i had promised during the campaign in answer to questions from 
just people in audiences over and over again that with regard to 
deficit spending and all where did this figure the military thing 
and i said if it comes to a choice the prime responsibility of 
government is the defense of the nation 
i have to do that 
but i would like to call attention to this fact

political action committees bankrolled by 
members of special interest groups are building up their war chests 
for the fall elections with the teamsters and realtors pacs each 
contributing close to 1 million to federal candidates so far 
five of the more than 4000 pacs registered with the federal 
election commission each had more than 2 million in cash on hand 
at the beginning of april an fec summary released tuesday showed 
together the registered pacs raised more than 213 million in 
the 15 months ending march 31 up 7 percent from the same period in 
1986 they had spent 162 million up 84 percent from spending at 
that point in the last election cycle the fec said 
labor unions and corporations are prohibited by law from giving 
money to federal campaigns so many set up pacs to which their 
employees and others can give money voluntarily politicians and 
interest groups also form pacs to promote their own interests 
the teamsters pac called democratic republican independent 
voter education committee raised the most during the 15month 
period 55 million followed by the american medical association 
pac at just under 4 million and the realtors political action 
committee at 37 million 
federal law allows pacs to give no more than 5000 to each 
candidate per election compared to the 1000 limit on 
contributions by individuals 
the teamsters and realtors pacs each reported giving close to 1 
million to federal candidates but the ama pac was 10th on the list 
of most contributions giving 585946 the summary said 
in cash on hand the teamster pac had the most 45 million 
followed by the international longshoremens association aflcio 
pac 27 million the national education association pac at 23 
million the auto dealers and drivers for free trade pac 23 
million and the realtors pac 21 million 
the pacs that raise the most do not necessarily give the most 
donations to candidates with money often going to a variety of 
fundraising and overhead costs 
the fec summary did not reflect any money the pacs might have 
spent on socalled independent expenditures such expenditures do 
not come under the 5000 limit as long as the money is spent to 
support or oppose a candidate but without coordination with the 
candidates campaign 
besides the teamsters ama and realtors pacs those that raised 
the most through march 31 followed by the sums they have 
contributed to candidates were 
the national congressional club founded by supporters of 
republican sen jesse helms in north carolina 27 million raised 
47032 in contributions 
auto dealers and drivers for free trade pac a jamaica 
nybased committee funded significantly with money from imported 
and domestic car dealers 27 million 377650 
campaign america founded by sen bob dole rkan 26 
million 59350 
american citizens for political action a committee founded by 
former young americans for freedom chairman robert dolan which has 
given to a variety of conservative candidates 24 million 
35650 
league of conservation voters an environmentally oriented 
group 24 million less than 30000 
national education association political action committee 23 
million 697587 
association of trial lawyers political action committee 22 
million 722658 
the pac founded by vice president george bush fund for 
americas future raised 17 million and spent a total of 15 
million but less than 20000 of that went to federal campaigns 
critics of the pac system contend that pac spending allows for 
too much special interest influence in politics the center for 
responsive politics conducted a survey that found pacs give money 
expecting that it will buy them access to politicians

president carter evidently realized the situation before he left 
office 
and as you know a president leaving office gives you a 
fiveyear projection of his plan what his budget my the first 
budget when i came in was passed by the previous president but 
then where it goes 
we have not yet spent as much money on defense as he had 
advocated should be spent for the next five years 
q sir how do you feel about the fact that even though you 
pride yourself on cutting government spending and regulations that 
the legacy you may well leave is a counterreaction where there is 
an erosion of public support for defense spending and a public 
reaction that actually hurts rather than helps national security 
a well youre just saying some things that i dont know how 
i would answer that but i think if people will listen and get the 
explanation and exactly what the situation was and wait until all 
the facts are in for example on this particular investigation 
that i dont think that they will find that we were derelict in 
our duty 
no theres a young lady there 
q thank you mr president was there any concern when you met 
with summit leaders this week that higher interest rates in the 
united states would push the dollar too high 
a i dont recall any conversation of that kind 
we were we all of us have been feeling pretty confident of 
what were doing and the stability we have and 
q the dollar is on the right track 
a i think we have stability right now 
and im afraid to look at jim baker because i might find myself 
asking him to answer the question for you 
q mr president what do you really think youve achieved in 
terms of drug interdiction here how many drug traffickers are 
going to be apprehended as a result of these deliberations 
a well more have been apprehended in this past year or so than 
ever before 
and more thousands of literally tons of illegal drugs seized 
more airplanes more ships more trucks and automobiles and more 
money has been seized than ever before 
but we have come to the conclusion with boundaries like ours 
and coastlines like ours the only answer that is ever going to win 
this war for us we keep this up we keep doing that of course 
but the real answer is going to be a bigger effort at taking 
the customer away from the drugs 
thats why were going to implement all the programs we can 
about appealing to the people and getting former drugs addicts who 
are many of them in the entertainment world and the athletic 
world are doing more than their duty to speak to young people 
about their ex theyre exaddicts and about this 
but that is going to be the only way we can really succeed 
but we have stepped up this interception thing and i think more 
than has ever been intercepted before

q just to follow up sir 
q mr president 
q is the course a bit bilateral arrangements rather than 
multinational do you think 
a oh well oh you were talking about the summit and our 
all the listen we are all in agreement here 
and i think weve weve discussed this today and we thought of 
a number things 
and theyre going to be were going to be working on this and 
putting a team together that will be represent more than us 
were going to do such things and were agreed that were going 
to do such things as tracking money and interfering with the 
laundering of illegal drug money and so forth 
so we are united on this 
theres no question about that 
q mr president 
a but wait a minute before all the hands 
helen is in charge and she tells me ive used up all my time 
i cant do it 
so im sorry 
im always sorry i have to leave hands but 
q but inaudible talk to you about haiti yet this week 
inaudible 
q have you found our anything more about the situation there 
a i thought you already all knew everything about it because 
you didnt ask me any questions about it

here are the highlights comments made by and 
about president reagan in toronto as he concluded his eighth and 
final economic summit of industrialized democracies 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a prepared statement reagan retraced the eight summits said 
he was satisfied with the economic prosperity and revitalization 
that has been achieved through cooperation in the western states 
he said however some items are still in needs of attention 
answering questions from reporters primarily on domestic issues 
he said he was very upset about alleged widespread bribery 
and fraud in the defense departments procurement process but said 
it would be understandable considering the size of the 
government he praised former secretary of defense caspar 
weinberger as one of the finest secretaries of defense this 
country has had who was doing all that he cold to bring our 
national security out of the kind of chaos that we inherited 
on the irancontra situation and possible pardons for former 
administration officials he said of course the case has to go 
forward he also defended his management style and the 
administrations handling of the situation 
on gun control he said he had taught everyone in his family to 
how to use a gun in case they need to he also proposed state 
governments conduct background checks on all gun purchasers 
on the drought plaguing much of the country he said outside 
of praying for rain there isnt anything i can do 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
western leaders praised reagan throughout the 3day meeting 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney speaking on behalf of 
the leaders said ronald reagan has been for all of us at this 
table a gracious friend and a trusted ally we shall all miss his 
warmth and his wisdom 
mulroney said the reagans leadership has been strong his 
accomplishments substantial and his place in history secure 
the summit host said the leaders wished for good health and 
every happiness for nancy and himself 
british prime minister margaret thatcher declared she had only 
kind words for reagan adding hes been marvelous 
she echoed mulroneys tribute saying each of the leaders had 
the wholehearted support and affection for president reagan and 
what he has done 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
reagans farewell to the leaders of the western democracies came 
in a speech to a group of canadian businessmen 
he warned them that protectionist storms are brewing around 
the world 
he told them they had a choice between moving toward freer 
trade or backward toward the protection and isolation that are 
relics of another age and urged them to follow the example set by 
the united states and canada we north americans never have we 
have always risen to meet a challenge our hearts quicken to the 
call our eyes brighten our pace picks up he said 
reagan praised the economic progress he had seen take place in 
the western states during his tenure inflation stagnation 
decline and despair characterized in one measure or another the 
economies of nearly all the summit nations today we live in a 
time of hope 
he also said there was hope for the reform going on in the 
soviet union calling soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev a 
serious man seeking serious reform

since we last met our economies have kept up the momentum of 
growth employment has continued to expand inflation has been 
restrained and progress has been made toward the correction of

for complacency to sustain noninflationary growth will require a 
commitment to enhanced cooperation this is a key to credibility

likely republican presidential nominee 
george bush faces a political dust bowl in the midwest that is 
worsening with this years drought some democratic and gop 
observers say 
its true that farmers when theyre out of sorts for any 
reason vote against the party in power said lawrence pope a 
drake university law professor and gop strategist 
i think that what republican legislative and congressional 
candidates are worried about right now is that does begin to affect 
those other races pope said tuesday republicans are going to 
be nervous about a bush candidacy in iowa right now 
phil roeder spokesman for the iowa democratic party pointed to 
growing democratic strength in the region demonstrated by the 
partys capture of senate seats in iowa and illinois in 1984 and in 
the dakotas in 1986 
theres clearly a democratic seed growing out here roeder 
said with that on top of drought its not only going to be a 
literal dust bowl its going to be a political dust bowl for 
bush 
republican politicians have been nervous about the impact bush 
will have on other races and their confidence wasnt helped by a 
poll in sundays des moines register showing him trailing likely 
democratic nominee michael dukakis by a 60 percent to 28 percent 
margin 
when youre down that bad you dont need more bad news 
pope said 
also reflecting the gop nervousness was david roederer a 
political aide to republican gov terry branstad 
if you have weak candidates at the presidential level its 
bound to hurt roederer said were a long way from writing the 
final chapter but this doesnt help 
iowa republican chairman michael mahaffey put a better face on 
the issue 
i think iowans are smart enough to realize that those are 
things beyond a politicians control he said you can make an 
argument that its going to make people nervous 
mahaffey said the gop can recover even if the drought worsens if 
the reagan administration moves quickly with emergency aid programs

michael dukakis came away from a private 
discussion with jesse jackson saying he has no short medium or 
long list of potential running mates but that the search is on for 
someone firstrate 
neither of the democratic rivals would say whether jackson asked 
for the vice presidential slot during the 40minute meeting tuesday 
dukakis said he wouldnt discuss his private conversation with 
jackson but added that theres no understanding with jackson 
over the selection of a running mate 
the process has now begun but its open dukakis said 
theres no short list or medium list or long list 
meanwhile sources in washington who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said tuesday that dukakis campaign has requested 
background information from jackson and at least one other possible 
runningmate sen bob graham of florida 
dukakis also is conducting public polling to assess the strength 
of potential democratic vice presidential candidates the sources 
said 
dukakis who has more than enough delegates to clinch the 
presidential nomination at the democratic national convention next 
month replied indirectly when asked if he were using polling to 
help him pick a running mate 
i dont think this is a decision that is helped particularly 
by a lot of polling he said 
this is one where youre looking for presidential qualities 
for a person to be a firstrate president who can bring real 
strength not only to the ticket but to government and the nation 
and those are things you really dont poll for he added 
at a news conference following the dukakisjackson meeting 
jackson repeated his assertion that his constituency deserves 
consideration in the selection of the democratic vice 
presidential nominee 
our constituency represents hope for our party it represents 
a commitment to make room for all democrats jackson said 
but asked whether he told dukakis that he wanted to be on the 
ticket jackson said im not going to characterize exactly what 
we discussed 
jackson said that during the meeting the two discussed the vice 
presidency more than we have talked about it before person to 
person 
dukakis and jackson met following dukakis address to more than 
3500 members of the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees jackson was to address the same group today 
dukakis used his appearance before the group to renew his call 
for a national health insurance program patterned after 
legislation he signed in massachusetts 
affordable health care is the birthright of every family and 
every citizen of the united states of america dukakis said 
two months ago i became the first governor in america to 
sign a bill that will guarantee health insurance for every single 
citizen in my state dukakis said and i look forward to the 
day i can sign the same kind of bill into law for all americans 
as president of the united states

the contras will lay off administrative staff and 
sharply cut expenses at the end of june a spokeswoman for the 
nicaraguan rebels said late tuesday 
but the budget squeeze will not affect troops in the field or 
support received by their families said spokeswoman marta sacasa 
we are not closing its just a matter of trying to function 
with less cost she said 
deep cuts are expected in the staff at the miami headquarters 
and other contra political offices around the world although some 
employees may continue as unpaid volunteers 
by the 30th i understand nobody is sure who will continue 
working ms sacasa said adding that the directors have not 
announced the extent of the layoffs or the restructuring that 
will accompany them 
the new york times in wednesdays editions quoted silvio 
arguello cardenal vice president of the contra legislative 
assembly as saying layoff notices have already been mailed to 350 
to 400 employees in the contra offices in miami washington latin 
america and europe 
ms sacasa said that to her knowledge none of the employees had 
received the official notice by tuesday she said directors would 
do their best to ensure none of the employees would be out on the 
street 
the layoffs are part of a toptobottom reorganization she said 
were giving the directors the freedom to do what has to be 
done to be more productive she said 
she denied the cutbacks were directly related to congress 
refusal to back the administrations full budget request for the 
contras this year 
the rebel political staff has had exceptionally high expenses so 
far this year in part because of trips back and forth to central 
america to negotiate a truce with nicaraguas sandinista government 
in march congress approved 479 million in contra aid but 
limited it to humanitarian applications and although the reagan 
administration is expected to ask for more money legislative 
leaders give new funding little chance

president reagan his last economic summit not 
quite the success he had hoped for heads into the twilight of his 
administration with only the slim prospect of another session with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev to keep him on center stage in 
the international arena 
there was considerable praise for reagan in toronto most of it 
in the form of a personal tribute in his best awshucks manner 
reagan admitted he would miss the glitter and ceremony in a way 
with only seven months to go and a long summer vacation ahead 
reagan is entering lameduck status and his foreign policy 
objectives are nearing a dead end 
negotiations with the soviet union to sharply reduce longrange 
nuclear weapons have encountered problems with verification and the 
kremlins continued objections to his search for a spacebased 
defense against ballistic missiles 
but talks are continuing in geneva and neither reagan nor 
gorbachev has ruled out the possibility of a fifth superpower 
summit if a deal is struck most analysts however believe the 
chances of that happening are remote 
in the middle east where reagans economic summit partners 
called for a peace conference his envoy secretary of state george 
p shultz has been unable to nudge jordans king hussein and 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir to the negotiating table 
on reagans agenda in the coming months are vacations at his 
california ranch in both july and august and campaign forays on 
behalf of his vice president george bush 
and so for reagan the threeday toronto meeting might just be 
his last hurrah 
the summit punctuated the success of the presidents economic 
program over the last seven years marlin fitzwater the white 
house spokesman enthused in a windup statement 
the facts however suggested a more mixed performance 
for instance reagans proposal to end all agricultural 
subsidies by the year 2000 fell on deaf ears 
frances socialist president francois mitterrand challenged 
reagans unfettered faith in the free market and on helping 
debtridden countries the best reagan could manage was a 
compromise formula that really was no decision at all 
and then there were those persistent washington reporters who 
peppered reagan with questions at a predeparture news conference 
about a spreading pentagon bribery investigation and the 
irancontra affair 
these are not the kind of topics reagan likes to discuss at 
home or away 
in fact reagan fielded only a few questions about the economic 
meeting 
he did receive a rousing tribute from the summit host canadian 
prime minister brian mulroney and reagans closest ally prime 
minister margaret thatcher of britain but even that was tempered 
by mitterrand 
for someone who played a great role in contemporary history 
its normal to salute him and wish that his retirement be happy and 
long the french president said its a courtesy it has 
nothing to do i suppose with politics

use of animal furs in the miss usa contest says tv host alan thicke 
reneged on an agreement to allow him to appear on thickes 
childrens show about animals 
bob young director of the las cruces nm chapter of sangre 
de cristo animal protection inc said he is disappointed that the 
producers of animal crackups decided not to invite him because 
it could have been to controversial for the young audience

animal activist was trying to stir up waters that had just settled 
this was resolved at the miss usa pageant and unfortunately 
theyre the ones who retracted the agreement shore said

the nationally televised pageant they pointed out that thicke ends

the washingtontomoscow hotline has 
helped cool tensions between the superpowers since its creation 25 
years ago this week after the cuban missile crisis put the united 
states and soviet union on the brink of nuclear war 
the best quote ive seen about it called it an insurance 
policy for peace norm covert a spokesman for fort detrick 
said tuesday i think its the best description of the system and 
why we have it 
fort detrick an army installation just north of washington was 
made part of the hotline system in 1978 the communications line 
was established june 20 1963 
the president has access to other forms of communication with 
the soviet union but the hotline provides a direct link between 
the two heads of state covert said the hotline often used when 
either country is planning military action in some part of the 
world provides a way for the leaders to communicate without going 
through diplomatic channels 
the hotline was established less than a year after tensions 
mounted between the superpowers during the cuban missile crisis 
after learning the soviet union had missiles in cuba capable of 
striking us cities president john f kennedy set up a blockade 
and ordered navy ships to turn back all vessels delivering soviet 
missiles to cuba war seemed imminent for about a week but the 
soviets eventually ordered offensive missiles removed and kennedy 
lifted the blockade 
soon after jess gorkin a senior editor for parade magazine 
wrote an open letter to kennedy suggesting that a communication 
line be opened allowing the two leaders to communicate directly 
without the chance for misinterpretation covert said kennedy 
embraced the idea and the hotline was established in 1963 
we dont know that he president reagan uses it unless he 
tells us covert said i believe he said he used it just before 
we invaded grenada 
unlike fictional descriptions of the hotline a red telephone is 
not part of the system the only telephone there is the one the 
technicians use covert said 
fort detrick is one of two independent satellite stations in the 
hotline network the other is in etam wva he said adding that 
communications technicians check the line with moscow every hour 
the soviet unions satellite earth station is just south of moscow

rudolf nureyevs version of swan lake which 
opened the paris opera ballets threeweek season at the 
metropolitan opera is not the finest production of the wellknown 
ballet nor was tuesday nights performance the best presentation 
the two stars danced very well but didnt dazzle with 
personality laurent hilaire was the most impassive prince weve 
seen isabelle guerin rippled her arms and looked appropriately 
swanlike but did not convey the aspects of the woman she was 
before evil sorcerer rothbart changed her into a swan 
when she danced the black swan miss guerin switched on 
vitality which the ballet needed badly 
hilaire has impressive height to his jumps and beats in air the 
prince and black swan when they traded variations did build 
excitement though not as much as usual in that scene 
we recall both dancers putting more oomph into their 
performances when the company presented the same ballet here two 
years ago maybe the june 14 to 19 season in costa mesa calif 
was exhausting 
nureyev whose choreography is after the early work of 
marius petipa and lev ivanov emphasizes the men more than those 
choreographers did he has one dance for four groups of four men 
one group of which couldnt stay together on tuesday 
john lanchbery conducted the tchaikovsky music with elegance 
franca squarciapino designed costumes and unusually effective swan 
headdresses 
from july 12 to 14 the company will dance in vienna va

president reagan says bribery and fraud are 
understandable within the huge bureaucracy of the pentagon and 
that no one can keep track of all the defense employees and 
military contractors 
nevertheless reagan who came to office pledging to crack down 
on waste fraud and abuse said tuesday all of us are 
disappointed and upset that such things happen 
but he appeared to excuse himself of any responsibility 
the president commented at a news conference in toronto at the 
end of the threeday economic summit of major industrial 
democracies later he delivered a speech urging economic allies to 
expand free trade and resist protectionism 
after celebrating his last summit with what he said was a 
measure of pride reagan returned to washington where the 
mushrooming pentagon case and lingering fallout from the 
irancontra scandal are likely to occupy much of the seven months 
that remain of his term 
at the news conference his second this month reagan fielded 
only a few questions about economics instead the focus was on 
other issues 
about the drought now plaguing much of the united states reagan 
said it was too early to say what the government could do to help 
farmers recover 
outside of praying for rain there isnt anything i can do 
until a government task force submits a report on the problem next 
week 
the president also suggested he favors restrictions on handgun 
purchases so that buyers would be required to take some training 
before they can buy a weapon 
reagan said he would like to see states adopt a system in which 
people have to have a background check of any crimes or any 
mental problems before they can buy guns 
the gun ownership issue arose in response to a question about an 
incident in which columnist carl rowan shot a teenager who 
allegedly was trespassing in his swimming pool late at night 
speaking about the allegations of scandal at the pentagon 
reagan said i have to say that i think it should be 
understandable how such things can happen in something as big as 
our government is 
federal prosecutors this week revealed a widespread 
investigation into corruption in the pentagon weapons purchasing 
system and disclosed that wiretaps had been used to record more 
than 4700 telephone conversations 
reagan said that in something as complex as pentagon buying 
you cant be down there watching several million people and the 
total of all of the companies and the defense department every day 
and what theyre doing or what phone calls theyre making 
and im quite sure that no one would think that we should be 
tapping all of those phones and listening in on conversations of 
everybody just on the suspicion that someone might be out of 
line reagan said 
the president largely excused former defense secretary caspar 
weinberger for any problem that occurred in his seven years at the 
pentagon 
for him to take some responsibility of course he was heading 
up there and i suppose i could do the same thing reagan said 
however he said the whole affair was uncovered by the 
government and that theyve been tracking this down to finally 
the place where they have come to the point in which they feel they 
can serve indictments 
on other matters 
reagan said he doubted that huge losses in the savings and loan 
industry would add up to a crisis i certainly hope not and i 
dont think so reagan said however he acknowledged there is 
a problem there and were trying to deal with it 
the president said theres no scandal in the irancontra 
affair which has resulted in several indictments including those 
of former white house aides oliver north and john poindexter the 
federal judge in the case has indicated he wants to begin the 
trials shortly starting with north 
asked if he would pardon north and poindexter before their 
trials reagan said their case in court has to go forward or they 
would live the rest of their lives under a shadow of guilt so i 
have no intention of he did not finish the sentence 
reagan discussing the american hostages in lebanon said to 
tell you the truth i dont know whether theyre alive today

revolution 
the meeting may also show whether socialist president francois 
mitterrand of france who will become the first leader ever to 
repeat as summit host can shift the theme of the gathering away 
from the freemarket philosophy so dear to president reagan and 
british prime minister margaret thatcher 
reagan will be gone replaced most likely by george bush or 
michael dukakis but most of the other leaders who finished their 
threeday meeting tuesday in canadas largest city probably will be 
on hand again next year 
reagans retirement is sure to shine the spotlight all the more 
brightly on mrs thatcher a vigorous proponent of the policy that 
less government is good government 
like mrs thatcher and mitterrand west german chancellor helmut 
kohl has won reelection in the past 18 months and can expect to be 
in office next year prime ministers noboru takeshita of japan and 
ciriaco de mita of italy are new in office but the italian cannot 
count on staying around long enough to see his second summit 
the leader in the shakiest position is this years host 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney whose progressive 
conservative party is trailing well behind the opposition liberals 
in public opinion polls with an election expected within the next 
year 
but mitterrand may well be the only socialist in the next group 
as he was this year his views eccentric in a group of freemarket 
conservatives brought him into repeated clashes with reagan over 
contents of the final communique 
the host leader has a strong role in shaping the summit agenda 
and the 71yearold mitterrand is known as a wily strategist but 
he will have a difficult task if he wants to stamp the meeting with 
his leftist policies 
he told a news conference on tuesday that he was sure that farm 
subsidies and third world debt the two biggest issues at the 
toronto summit will still be major items for the leaders to 
attack next year 
when mitterrand convenes the economic summit on july 14 1989 
france will be marking exactly 200 years since a parisian throng 
stormed the bastille prison launching the french revolution and 
in a sense the modern era 
preparing the bicentennial was one of mitterrands priorities in 
his first term and his reelection last month to another seven 
years in office assures that he will be able to preside over the 
fireworks displays concerts and other events planned for the 
occasion 
mitterrand said tuesday that it was fitting that the seven 
leaders would be on hand for the celebration of one of the great 
events of our history which is also theirs 
he said the date chosen for the summit will have an undeniable 
symbolic force 
next years meeting will start a third cycle now that each 
of the seven countries has been host twice since the summits 
started in 1975 when president valery giscard destaing of france 
invited his peers to the renaissance chateau at rambouillet 
when mitterrand started the second cycle in 1982 he chose 
another grand palace the chateau of louis xiv at versailles but 
officials said next years site would more likely be a modern 
office complex in paris 
in their closing statement tuesday the leaders said their 
meetings have helped to sustain the values of democracy that 
underlie our economic and political system and were worth 
continuing for the next seven years ending with another meeting in 
canada in 1995 
we believe that the mutual understanding engendered in our 
meetings has benefited both our own countries and the wider world 
community they said

the united states summit allies left toronto 
with much of what they wanted they won more debt relief for the 
worlds poorest countries and fought off an american attempt to 
eliminate agricultural subsidies 
from french president francois mitterrand to japanese prime 
minister noboru takeshita the allies expressed satisfaction with 
the outcome of the 14th annual economic summit of seven leading 
industrialized nations 
british prime minister margaret thatcher called the summit 
which wound up tuesday highly successful and takeshita said 
through a spokesman that he was finishing this summit meeting 
with a sense of fulfillment 
with the economies of the major industrialized nations on track 
the leaders turned their attention to the sticky question of 
agricultural subsidies and the desperate plight of the worlds 
poorest countries 
in advance of the summit mitterrand proposed that the leaders 
fashion a plan to ease the foreign debt burdens of the poorest of 
the poor countries those in vast subsaharan africa 
at the end of the meeting mitterrand said his suggestions were 
adopted in the leaders final communique 
so he told reporters im satisfied 
west german chancellor helmut kohl also praised the plan which 
offers a variety of options including slashing interest rates and 
forgiving some loans for easing the poor countries debt burden 
willy de clercq commissioner for external relations of the 
european community called the measure a big step forward the 
12nation trading bloc is represented at the summit 
the united states earlier this month backed off from its 
previous refusal to go along with concessions paving the way for 
the agreement 
japans finance minister kiichi miyazawa offered a sweeping 
proposal that would help such bigdebt countries as brazil and 
mexico the two latin american countries are the developing worlds 
largest debtors with a combined foreign debt of 220 billion the 
total for all the developing world is an estimated 1 trillion 
summiteers complained the japanese plan was so complicated and 
offered on such short notice that they did not have time to study 
it 
they renewed their support instead for the current 
casebycase approach drawn up in recent years to handle 
individually the money woes of the large debtors 
the japanese seem unfazed by the cool response to their plan 
which will no doubt be discussed at future international meetings 
takeshita was particularly pleased at the great deal of 
attention that was paid to the problems of developing countries 
according to michihiko kunihiro chief cabinet counselor for 
external affairs 
the europeans and the japanese tangled with the americans and 
canadians over what has become a bitterly disputed issue that of 
agricultural subsidies 
reagan has proposed as part of his freemarket philosophy that 
farm subsidies be scrapped by the year 2000 
american officials argue that european subsidies have made the 
european community a major agricultural supplier at a time of 
excess world capacity 
the europeans respond that they have begun the politically 
sensitive process of limiting european community subsidies to 
farmers but dont want to be pushed to meet a deadline 
the final statement offers vaguely worded language that called 
for a framework approach including short as well as longterm 
elements to promote reforms relieve strains in agricultural 
markets and which would be in line with goals concerning the 
reduction of all direct and indirect subsidies and other measures 
affecting agricultural trade 
de clercq expressed satisfaction with what he said was a 
compromise among the leaders 
agriculture is a bone of contention we succeeded in 
avoiding a row he told reporters 
the final wording he said underlines the reality the 
diversity of agriculture situations in the world a fact we had to 
take into account small family farms not large agribusinesses 
are common in europe 
kohl said the leaders were moving completely on a similar 
track 
the longterm goal must be a strong marketorientation of 
agriculture production he said for this realism and 
perspective are necessary 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney who had hoped for firm 
action to end the global subsidy war said it is not a perfect 
statement but it represents progress 
mrs thatcher who has fought in the european community for 
curbing the subsidies said there is a specific commitment to 
try first to freeze and then to roll back the subsidies and various 
other kinds of support for agriculture in an ordered and 
substantial way 
we have made a start she said

president daniel ortega charged that 
secretary of state george p shultz plans to seek support for us 
aggression against nicaragua when he visits central america next 
week 
shultz will visit el salvador honduras guatemala and costa 
rica from june 29 to july 1 to discuss the collapse of nicaraguan 
peace talks 
ortega on tuesday noted that shultz would not visit nicaragua 
what does this mean he said the united states doesnt 
have any interest in a negotiated solution to the problems with 
nicaragua 
negotiations between nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
and the ussupported contra rebels broke off june 9 
on monday rebel leaders rejected a government proposal to 
resume the talks saying the offer was aimed at discouraging a 
renewal of us military aid 
ortega told a group of more than 100 americans representatives 
of sister cities programs that while president reagan recently 
visited the soviet union he doesnt have the desire to negotiate 
with nicaragua 
he said the purpose of the shultz visit was to seek regional 
support for american war policies against nicaragua 
the united states has supported the contra rebels since they 
began their war to topple the sandinistas in 1981 
managua and washington maintain diplomatic relations but the 
united states cut off all aid in 1981 and imposed an economic 
boycott in 1985 
bilateral talks between the sandinistas and the reagan 
administration broke off in 1985 
in other developments a group of atlantic coast indian rebels 
declared they were renewing their warfare against the leftist 
sandinista government according to a statement published tuesday 
night in the opposition newspaper la prensa 
the communique of the yatama indian rebel organization rejected 
peace negotiations with the sandinistas and said the government 
would have to revise its dictatorial policies to implant the 
conditions for a true democracy in our country 
yatama seeks a form of selfgovernment for the indigenous tribes 
along the socalled mosquito coast of the atlantic the sandinistas 
have reached agreements with other indian rebel groups to lay down 
their arms 
yatama organizers claim to have 2000 combatants at least 1000 
have surrendered since last year and the indian war had stopped for 
the most part 
the statement signed by yatama general coordinator wicliff 
diego said the sandinistas refused to accede to their demands for 
autonomous rule 
ceasefire talks with the indians began in may little more than 
a month after the mainstream contras reached a temporary truce with 
the sandinistas the indians received a small part of the millions 
of dollars in military and economic aid supplied by the us 
government

sued the federal government for 55 million alleging that navy 
doctors gave his wife an aidstainted blood transfusion that 
eventually killed her and their son 
martin gaffney 39 filed the negligence lawsuit tuesday in us 
district court claiming the navymishandled his wifes pregnancy by 
causing their baby to be stillborn then giving her a transfusion 
that transmitted the deadly virus to him his wife and a son born 
later 
ive asked for an apology said gaffney a chief warrant 
officer in the marine corps even the soviet union has apologized 
for killing an american soldier but my own government wont 
apologize for being responsible for the deaths of my wife and son 
even though i serve them 
gaffney said he filed the lawsuit because he wants to provide 
for his 4yearold daughter maureene she is the only member of 
the family to escape infection and will likely become an orphan 
gaffney said 
he said he also decided to sue after the navy responded with an 
insulting settlement offer of less than 1 million to a 
complaint he had filed internally 
its been a very long frustrating time waiting for the navy 
to act gaffney said in an interview tuesday i realized i 
wasted six months of my life waiting for the navy to act 
gaffneys wife mutsuko 38 a japanese national died in may 
1987 the couples 13monthold son john died in 1986 gaffney 
lives with his daughter on a navy base in south weymouth about 15 
miles south of boston 
though gaffneys health is still good he said he has made 
provisions for his daughter to live with his brother when he dies 
the gaffneys were married in 1981 three years after meeting in 
okinawa and their first child was due that august 
the lawsuit claims mrs gaffney went into the navy regional 
medical center in long beach calif one saturday certain she 
about to give birth and a nurse sent her home 
two days later doctors discovered the baby had died during a 
subsequent caesarean section mrs gaffney was given two units of 
blood one of which was contaminated with the aids virus the 
lawsuit says 
navy officials traced the two donors and one tested negative 
for acquired immune deficiency syndrome gaffney said the other 
refused to be tested and it was learned he had been discharged from 
the navy for homosexual activity gaffney said 
gaffneys claimed navy officials have lied to him on several 
occasions and never apologized to him for what has happened to his 
family 
navy spokesman lt ken ross declined to comment on the lawsuit 
or gaffneys charges of bad treatment 
gaffney said his life has worsened since he filed the internal 
claim against the navy last year 
there are so many things i have to put up with every day 
gaffney said its hard to put on that uniform every day and im 
afraid every time i get my hair cut im afraid that if im nicked 
ill have to stand up and tell them who i am and what they have to 
do to protect themselves 
gaffney must cut his hair regularly under marine guidelines he 
said he used to get his hair cut on base but now goes to different 
civilian barbershops 
but gaffney said his marine colleagues at the base have been 
supportive and sympathetic 
he said that by seeking a financial settlement from the navy he 
will be able to spend whatever time he has left with his daughter 
and avoid daily separations caused by his work

americas major allies had effusive words of 
praise for ronald reagan in public but in private some werent as 
kind handing the president a series of defeats at his eighth and 
final economic summit 
the bickering got so intense on tuesday the last day that the 
final negotiating session ran an hour longer than scheduled as the 
world leaders tried to settle their differences 
the 14th annual economic summit between the united states 
japan west germany britain france italy and canada was not a 
total disaster for reagan 
the allies did voice approval for his favorite freemarket 
economic themes and the economic coordination process the united 
states has championed since the 1986 tokyo summit 
but in the area of farm subsidies third world debt aid to the 
philippines and drug trafficking the united states either suffered 
defeats or had to accept less than it wanted reflecting perhaps 
the waning influence of a lameduck president with only seven 
months left in office 
little of this was visible on the surface the leaders used the 
occasion of the public reading of the final communique to salute 
reagan on his last foray into economic summitry 
his leadership has been strong his accomplishments 
substantial and his place in history secure canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney said on behalf of the other world leaders 
we shall all miss his warmth and wisdom 
british prime minister margaret thatcher a philosophical 
soulmate of reagans called the president marvelous even 
though mrs thatcher was one of the leaders who pushed reagan to 
relent on his insistence for the complete phaseout of all 
agricultural subsidies 
on that issue the united states was forced to settle for vague 
language in which the countries promised to seek ways to reduce 
subsidies instead of the us goal of eliminating them 
french president francois mitterrand a socialist who has often 
clashed with reagan was even more of a problem for the president 
during the threeday meeting 
mitterrand objected to a reagan initiative to have the countries 
cooperate more closely on the problem of drug trafficking 
contending the seven summit nations did not have the authority to 
set up another international body 
in whose names do these seven countries decide for the rest of 
the world mitterrand grumbled america settled for a call for an 
international study group with the participating countries to be 
chosen later 
mitterrand also blocked reagans effort to single out the 
philippines for multilateral foreign aid a dispute that took up 
much of the final hour and was resolved when the leaders decided to 
add all heavily indebted developing contries to the list of those 
deserving attention 
on the question of debt for the poorest countries in subsaharan 
africa the united states knew coming into the session that it 
would have to accept a debt relief package because of heavy 
pressure from other countries to do so 
reagan and other administration officials tried to paint the 
summit in the best light saying that no disharmony existed in the 
critical areas of currency stabilization and overall coordination 
disputes in these areas last fall were cited as reasons for the 
october stock market collapse 
treasury secretary james a baker iii said that it was wrong to 
characterize the summit as a donothing affair because no major 
initiatives were started 
there are a number of things that may not be news but 
represent action he said we all know there is still a job to 
do out there that there are still problems to be faced but we 
feel very fortunate in light of what happened to the economy last 
october 
financial markets treated the threeday summit as basically a 
nonevent with analysts saying that since little was expected the 
markets werent disappointed 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co an investment 
firm said financial markets were reassured by the final language 
because it signaled that the coordination process that has 
stabilized the dollars value can be expected to continue 
the communique itself offers little that is new but it is a 
capstone on what has been an extraordinary amount of coordination 
among countries beginning in 1985 he said it also offers the 
promise that this coordination will continue 
to further the coordination process the summit countries did 
agree to a us proposal to adopt two commodity indexes both 
including gold to monitor whether inflationary pressures are 
building 
the index was an idea first proposed by baker last september he 
has insisted that the proposal is not a first step to returning the 
world monetary system to a gold standard 
baker told reporters that the two indexes would differ in the 
weight they gave gold also one of the indexes would include oil 
while the other would not but he refused to disclose what weight 
gold would have in each of the indexes other than to say that a 
significant weight would be attached to gold

for a moment only henny youngman stood between 
gloria allred and her destiny but ms allred brushed past the 
irate comedian and stepped into the masculine confines of the 
friars club becoming the first woman admitted for lunch there in 
its 84 years 
im literally walking on air ms allred a los angeles 
lawyer said after a lunch of poached salmon and zucchini 
ms allred who specializes in sex discrimination law took a 
midnight flight to new york on monday night after hearing that the 
us supreme court had upheld a new york city law that bans sex 
discrimination in private clubs 
she has been a member of the beverly hills friars club since 
may 1987 but her previous attempts to gain entry to the new york 
club which has a reciprocal agreement with its california 
offshoot have been rebuffed 
until tuesday the new york clubs policy was to admit women 
only after 4 pm or for saturday lunch 
ms allred was readily admitted this time although not without 
vocal objections from some members including youngman 
i dont think they ought to butt in in our business the 
comedian said if we want privacy we ought to have privacy 
theres a million clubs in new york why do they want to get in we 
have fun here 
when ms allred tried to argue youngman brushed her off 
saying i dont know who you are 
she finally slipped past him and into the club saying nice 
to have met you sir youre entitled to be wrong 
some people bring happiness wherever they go she brings 
happiness whenever she goes youngman grumbled 
once inside she said she was treated with hospitality by the 
executive director jean pierre trebot and other members 
it went very well she said after dining with trebot i 
enjoyed the lunch very much 
the decision to admit ms allred was based on the us supreme 
court ruling trebot said the friars board of governors plans to 
vote soon on whether to admit women as members we expect it will 
be affirmative he said 
the friars club founded in 1904 has 1360 members in new 
york twothirds of whom are active in the performing arts its top 
officer called the abbot is frank sinatra other members include 
george burns and irving berlin

the legislature of nagornokarabakh has asked that 
the disputed region be declared independent until moscow decides 
whether to transfer its control from the azerbaijan republic to 
armenia a dissident said 
the body also asked the federal parliament or supreme soviet 
to disregard an earlier decision by azerbaijans legislature to 
oppose the regions transfer to armenia added koryun nahabidyan a 
moscowbased armenian activist 
he said he had spoken with nagornokarabakh residents familiar 
with the regional legislatures tuesday decision 
nagornokarabakh has a population of about 160000 people most 
are ethnic armenians a mainly christian ethnic group but the 
region was assigned in 1923 to the predominantly moslem neighboring 
republic of azerbaijan 
nagornokarabakhs legislature voted feb 20 to request 
annexation to armenia and the legislature of that southern republic 
supported it 
but azerbaijan has refused to cede the territory and moscow has 
not said whether it will decide the question 
nahabidyan who has led several armenian demonstrations in 
moscow said nagornokarabakhs legislature also asked the federal 
supreme court to take over legal action against rioters responsible 
for killing 32 people most of them armenians on feb 28 in the 
azerbaijan city of sumgait 
armenians have said the supreme court of azerbaijan which is 
handling the case is not dealing harshly enough with those 
responsible 
a resident of stepanakert the territorial capital said the 
whole city of 60000 people had gathered outside government 
buildings to await the legislatures decision 
the resident speaking by telephone on condition of anonymity 
said the members rejected a proposal to secede outright from 
azerbaijan 
the legislature also reportedly asked residents to return to 
their jobs they have been striking since may 23 stopping nearly 
all commercial activity in the region except for retailing and 
agriculture according to reports from the area

the lebanese bruised by 13 years of 
civil war are jumpy over a new threat shipments of toxic waste 
and contaminated meat imported by men the media calls merchants 
of death 
in the past few weeks merchants have imported 2400 tons of 
chemical wastes from italy 23 tons of spoiled frozen meat from 
europe and hundreds of tons of spoiled tobacco from greece 
in addition about 40 barrels inscribed cairo oil and 
containing suspiciouslooking pink and gold powder were discovered 
in the mediterranean off the coast of tyre in southern lebanon and 
tabarjah in the north 
it was not clear where the barrels came from 
the discovery of the mystery barrels sent shock waves through 
much of seaside lebanon prompting residents to desert beaches and 
forgo seafood 
health ministry sources said 72 people contracted skin ailments 
after swimming in the sea 
on tuesday an italian toxic waste expert umberto fortunato 
met with health minister joseph hashem to discuss the 2400 tons of 
toxic wastes sent from italy 
afterward hashem told reporters the waste was not radioactive 
but was poisonous and harmful to man land and sea he said the 
chemicals had been shipped to lebanon early in june 
hashem said an agreement was reached with the italian expert to 
gather the waste and ship it to an incinerator in the pacific 
ocean italy will help pay for the operation he said 
the case is one of several in the past two weeks in which 
european firms contracted to get rid of toxic wastes and shipped 
them to africa or the middle east nigeria accused an italian firm 
of dumping toxic chemicals on its beaches and a norwegian firm was 
forced to reclaim waste from the united states that it sent to 
guinea in west africa 
in lebanon efforts by the christian lebanese forces militia to 
return the chemical waste to italy failed the italians told them 
that moving the waste was risky without prior examination by an 
expert 
some of the waste was dumped in the kesrouan coastal strip in 
the christiancontrolled heartland about 20 miles north of the 
capital the rest according to unconfirmed press reports was 
buried in the same region 
the chemicals found their way to lebanon through a local 
importer roger haddad who is being interrogated by lebanese 
officials 
haddad is the head of maritime operations in a shipping company 
based in christian east beirut 
the barrels of cairo oil triggered a strong reaction among 
the thousands of swimmers along the lebanese coast 
beaches usually packed on sunday were all but deserted last 
weekend 
people did not even dip a finger in the sea but rather swam in 
the overcrowded pools said mona chahin a swimmers at the plush 
coral beach hotel in moslem west beirut 
another health threat to the lebanese is the shipment of spoiled 
meat confiscated by the ministry of health it was imported by 
antoine khoury who was arrested by lebanese police but later freed 
for lack of evidence 
people are worried that part of it has reached local merchants 
and have stopped ordering meat in restaurants supermarkets are 
advertising in local newspapers that the meat they are selling is 
fresh and not radioactive 
the meat refused entry into jordan in late may arrived in 
lebanon in early june jordan has not said why the meat was refused 
as for the shipment of spoiled tobacco hashem said it did not 
contain any radioactive or poisonous substance but it contained 
500 tons of nicotine and was stored in unsecured buildings in the 
lebanese mountains 
the springs much of lebanon depends on for water are located in 
the mountains and if the nicotine leaks it could contaminate the 
countrys water supply the minister said 
he said that the tobacco will be moved to special storehouses to 
prevent leaks 
the importer of the tobacco was not identified 
for the past 13 years lebanon has been wracked by a civil war 
that pits israelibacked christians against moslems and moslem 
factions against each other thousands of people have died in the 
conflict which has left lebanons government and economy in 
shambles

an agreement on boosting sales of american 
beef and oranges in japan could set the stage for settling similar 
agricultural issues with european nations says the chief us 
trade negotiator 
now that weve been able to strike a deal with the japanese on 
beef and citrus it puts some additional pressure on the europeans 
to be somewhat more accommodating than they have in the past 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said on tuesday 
yeutter told reporters the accord signed this week in tokyo 
after prolonged dispute was the result of a fundamental change in 
the attitude of japanese leaders who showed new willingness to 
settle the issue 
the agreement calls for japan to phase out quotas on imported 
beef and fresh oranges within three years and orange juice in four 
years with the blow to japanese domestic producers cushioned by 
declining tariffs 
the settlement was obviously very attractive for the united 
states and its exporters and shows japan has bitten the bullet 
and decided to begin to open its markets yeutter said 
yeutter conceded to reporters tuesday that the original us 
demand for total and immediate removal of the quotas last march was 
a negotiating tactic impossible for the japanese government to 
agree to 
it would have been impossible for the japanese government to 
make that agreement and survive so we had to work out a way to 
achieve full market liberalization as quickly as possible 
yeutter said 
yeutter said the next step for the us will be to press 
european leaders to eliminate agricultural trade barriers there 
within the next decade 
it doesnt seem to us that a 10year phaseout is unrealistic 
or irrational he said 
it ought to be faster he said the world would be better 
off and the european community would be better off if it were 
because the community just as much as the rest of the world is 
hurt by farm trade barriers 
there was no agreement over the agricultural issue at this 
weeks summit in toronto between the leaders of the worlds seven 
leading industrialized nations but yeutter said the us will 
press for an end to barriers at the next round global trade talks 
next december in montreal

a selfstyled minister who enslaved four 
women and killed two others in his basement torture chamber 
believed society owed him a wife and a family one of the survivors 
testified at his murder trial 
the four women spoke tuesday about the horrors they encountered 
while chained to pipes some for months and said gary heidnik 
tortured and raped them repeatedly and fed them dog food mixed with 
the human remains of one of his victims 
two survivors testified that they saw heidnik hang sandra 
lindsay 24 from a pipe until she died feb 7 1987 and 
electrocute deborah dudley 23 also known as debbie johnson in a 
waterfilled pit in the basement 
heidniks attorney describes the 44yearold army veteran and 
financial whiz as very very guilty but insane he could face 
the death penalty if convicted 
during the grisly testimony heidnik seemed to pay no attention 
he sat in the courtroom staring straight ahead and wearing the same 
flowered black hawaiian shirt and baggy trousers he has worn to 
court appearances for months 
josefina rivera who was held four months before she escaped 
told jurors that the black comedy film eating raoul in which a 
couple disposes of a body by mixing the flesh with food gave 
heidnik the idea to chop up ms lindsays body grinding parts in a 
food processor and mixing it with dog food he fed his captives 
he was mixing the body parts in with the dog food because 
thats the only way he could get rid of sandra ms rivera said 
heidnik first tried to dispose of the body by cooking it but 
stopped after neighbors complained of the odor she said 
heidnik once took a protesting ms dudley upstairs and when she 
was brought down i asked debbie what gary had done ms rivera 
testified 
she said he had taken her upstairs and shown her sandras head 
in a pot and her ribs in a roasting pan on the stove and her legs 
and arms in the freezer and that if she kept it up thats what was 
going to happen to her ms rivera testified 
heidnik wanted his captives to have his children the women 
testified 
heidnik who spent four years in jail for kidnapping and raping 
a woman felt as though society had owed him a wife and a 
family ms rivera said 
lisa thomas who was 19 when police freed her from heidniks 
north philadelphia house said she was abducted when she accepted a 
ride from heidnik and returned to his house to have sex 
when she wanted to leave he tried to strangle her she 
testified 
she was taken to the basement where ms thomas said two other 
women naked from the waist down were chained 
heidnik once pretended to be a police officer coming to the 
womens rescue then beat his captives when they screamed for help 
ms thomas said 
jacquelyn askins testified that she once heard what sounded like 
a chain saw upstairs after heidnik removed ms lindsays body from 
the basement she said she smelled the burning odor later 
it was in his hair ms askins said of the smell it was 
all over him

the us state department told a refusenik family 
that waited in vain for a presidential visit last month that soviet 
officials will let them emigrate after 11 years of denials a 
family member said today 
tanya zieman said her daughter who was permitted to leave the 
soviet union last year and now lives in boston was informed of the 
decision by richard schifter assistant secretary of state for 
human rights and humanitarian affairs 
the daughter galina khatutsky telephoned early today to tell 
her family the news mrs zieman said the word reportedly was 
conveyed to secretary of state george p shultz by soviet 
ambassador yuri dubynin 
mrs zieman said she was told it would take about two weeks for 
the soviet union to formally notify her that she her husband 
yuri and their 12yearold daughter vera may leave the soviet 
union 
the family spent much of the previous two days seeing off best 
friends who received permission to emigrate to israel just before 
the moscow summit 
the first indications the matter was about to be resolved came 
tuesday when soviet officials informally notified us and other 
western diplomats that the ziemans would soon be granted exit visas 
last week the ziemans were officially informed that their 
latest appeal had been rejected by a special review commission of 
the supreme soviet the nominal parliament 
vera zieman had written president and mrs reagan appealing for 
their help and the reagans considered going to her home when they 
arrived in moscow may 29 for the ussoviet summit 
but sources said they passed up the visit after us officials 
were warned such a presidential stop would doom the familys 
chances to emigrate 
the ziemans did attend a tea the reagans gave for people 
washington considers victims of soviet human rights abuses and 
vera a pianist recently received a gift of several classical 
music tapes from the first family 
the gift wrapping from the present with the gold presidential 
seal was on veras piano today in the familys tiny threeroom 
apartment in southwest moscow in a note the ziemans received after 
the summit reagan said he hoped one day to be able to visit them 
in boston 
yuri zieman a computer specialist who lost his job when he 
applied to emigrate in 1977 worked as a plumber until stricken 
several months ago by a mysterious brain ailment that left him with 
double vision and a loss of balance 
the condition diagnosed by some soviet physicians as a 
potentially deadly aneurysm or bulge in a cerebral artery made 
the familys quest more urgent because zieman was warned by his 
doctors not to undergo the delicate corrective surgery in the 
soviet union 
zieman has been told he is not permitted to leave the country 
for security reasons though he contends he never had access to 
state secrets and has no information that could threaten soviet 
security

likely democratic presidential nominee will probably choose a

what undoubtedly will be done is that he will reach out to 
someone who has washington experience most likely in the

for connecticut democratic senate candidate joseph i lieberman 
where do our white males come from for national office they 
come from either a statehouse or the united states senate 
unfortunately for this country blacks and women and hispanics 
and orientals and asians are under represented in our statehouses 
and in our senate she said 
ferraro indicated that sen john glenn of ohio would be a good 
choice as a running mate 
i would not be unhappy with john glenn he is certainly a

president reagans support of a waiting period 
for wouldbe buyers of handguns runs counter to the traditional 
views of many of his conservative supporters that there be little 
or no restrictions on individual access to weapons 
but reagans comments tuesday won immediate praise from sarah 
brady whose husband white house press secretary james brady was 
wounded by presidential assailant john hinckley reagan also was 
injured in the march 1981 attack but recovered completely 
the president answering a question at a news conference in 
toronto expressed support for the waiting period as well as for 
instruction of new gun buyers 
in california for a citizen to buy a gun that citizen has to 
come in lay down the money of course name address and so 
forth reagan said and this goes to an agency in the state 
government that looks into that persons entire background as to 
who and what they are 
and then they come back after that investigation and if they 
dont have a record of any crimes or mental problems or anything 
of that kind they are allowed to take their gun home reagan 
continued adding now i would like to see that generally i 
think that all states ought to take a look at that system 
reagan did not say whether he supports federal legislation 
pending in congress that would require a sevenday waiting period 
for handgun purchases 
the national rifle association opposes the bill arguing that 
such waiting periods aside from not preventing serious criminals 
from getting handguns are unconstitutional and divert police 
resources to looking into the private lives of lawabiding citizens 
one nra lobbyist james jay baker told a senate judiciary 
subcommittee earlier this month that even with the waiting period 
hinckley would have qualified for the weapons he obtained 
but mrs brady who became a strong gun control advocate 
following the wounding of her husband issued a statement tuesday 
night saying that she was delighted that the president has given 
his vital support to a waiting period and background check for 
handgun buyers 
i hope the presidents leadership will encourage republicans 
and democrats alike to join together and pass the federal 
legislation she added 
reagan also said that he thought instructions on gun use should 
be required for gun purchasers 
i taught my entire family out at the ranch how to shoot a gun 
in case they ever had to reagan said and i think maybe there 
could be some restrictions that there had to be a certain amount of 
training taken

pope john paul iis second trip to 
austria will provide the pontiff with a platform from which he can 
address the faithful in bordering communistruled countries he has 
been kept from visiting 
tens of thousands of hungarian catholics are expected for a mass 
on friday at trausdorf less than 10 miles from the frontier 
and catholics from yugoslavias northern republics of slovenia 
and croatia will probably flock to a mass on saturday at gurk 
about 90 minutes by car from the border 
about 60 percent of the 155 million czechoslovaks are 
catholics according to vatican estimates but their governments 
travel restrictions are much tougher and they probably will have to 
rely on television 
the popes tour begins thursday and ends monday austrian 
television will broadcast 40 hours of the trip 
a native of poland john paul has been allowed to visit his 
homeland three times since being elected in 1978 to head the 
church he has not however been welcome in the rest of the soviet 
bloc or nonaligned yugoslavia 
cardinal franz koenig of austria who built relationships with 
the catholics of eastern europe in the 1960s and 1970s predicted 
the pope will reach out to the sovietbloc and yugoslavia during 
his masses in austria 
in recent months the vatican has been pressuring prague to 
liberalize its treatment of the church catholic activists recently 
got 600000 signatures on a petition for religious freedom there 
and this month czechoslovakia held its first consecrations of 
bishops since 1973 
the prague government perhaps influenced by recent official 
overtures by the kremlin to the russian orthodox church also 
allowed brief excerpts of the ceremonies to be shown on television 
names of bishops barred from performing their duties for decades 
suddenly appeared in the staterun media 
vatican efforts against restrictions on religion appear even 
more successful in hungary and the soviet union 
cardinal agostino casaroli vatican secretary of state this 
month attended celebrations of 1000 years of christianity in 
russia and gave mikhail s gorbachev the first letter ever sent by 
a pope to a kremlin leader 
gorbachev said the soviet union and the vatican have a basis for 
further talks in the common struggle for peace and did not exclude 
eventual diplomatic relations 
in hungary where an estimated 5 million of the 106 million 
people are roman catholics the church may be able to improve its 
legal standing in a current revision of religious laws 
cardinal laszlo paskai who has criticized predecessors for not 
standing up to curbs on religion is said to have a good 
relationship with imre miklos head of the government office on 
church affairs 
in yugoslavia relations between the communists of slovenia and 
croatia and their catholic churches are far from easy 
one major obstacles to a papal visit there is a reported wish by 
john paul to visit the grave of cardinal aloisius stepanac in 
zagreb cathedral the communists call stepanac a war criminal who 
collaborated with the nazi puppet regime in croatia during world 
war ii

communist authorities are ordering chinas 
rambunctious students to sit through special summer school classes 
geared toward ridding them of yearnings for democracy and a better 
life for intellectuals 
official reports today said the government ordered universities 
to use summer school to teach students to support state policies 
and to enhance students consciousness about the difficulties 
of implementing them 
in china students every summer are sent for several weeks to 
farms factories and businesses to learn from the masses 
the peoples daily said this years program would push the party 
line 
the order came down in a government directive issued by the 
communist party propaganda department state education commission 
and communist youth league it appeared part of official efforts to 
control chinas restive college students and lessen their 
widespread alienation from the party line 
the directive came two weeks after students at beijing 
university put up dozens of posters demanding democracy and 
criticizing the governments ongoing political and economic reforms 
as inadequate 
the directive expressed the hope that the students will be led 
to the frontline of the reforms to understand the great 
achievements of the past 10 years of reform and increase their 
confidence in it the peoples daily said 
the xinhua news agencys english service said the students 
should be educated to support reform programs drawn up by the 
party and the government and take part in overcoming difficulties 
in the reform 
senior leader deng xiaoping launched the reform program in 1978 
in an effort to develop chinas backward economy by replacing 
central planning with elements of freemarket economies 
he also sought to make the sluggish bureaucracy more efficient 
many students believe the reforms do not go far enough and want 
sweeping political changes including introduction of westernstyle 
democracy 
the posters that went up this month at beijing university took 
pokes at top leaders and demanded democracy respect for human 
rights a freer press more funds for education and better pay for 
intellectuals 
police appeared in force to head off a march students had 
planned to dramatize their demands authorities warned against 
illegal protests and emphasized the need for stability if china is 
to modernize 
the official china daily today quoted the head of the party 
propaganda department wang renzhi as telling a meeting of 
ideological workers in beijing they must be careful in exposing 
students to foreign ideas 
wang said china must introduce foreign ideas that are good for 
its development but should not embrace all western culture and 
ideology he especially warned against teaching nihilist egoist 
and nonrationalist philosophies

contra political offices although some employees may continue as 
unpaid volunteers 
by the 30th of june i understand nobody is sure who will 
continue working ms sacasa said adding that the contra 
directors have not announced the extent of the layoffs or the 
toptobottom restructuring that will accompany them 
she denied cutbacks were directly related to congress refusal 
to back the reagan administrations full budget request for the 
contras this year 
in march congress adopted a limited 479 million budget 
limited to humanitarian aid and although the administration is 
expected to ask for more money legislative leaders give new 
funding little chance 
the rebel political staff also has had exceptionally high 
expenses so far this year in part because of trips to and from 
central america to negotiate a truce with nicaraguas leftist 
government 
the new york times today quoted silvio arguello cardenal vice 
president of the contra legislative assembly as saying layoff 
notices have been mailed to 350 to 400 employees in contra offices 
in miami washington latin america and europe 
ms sacasa said that as far as she knew no employees had 
received the official notice by tuesday she added that directors 
would do their best to ensure that no employees would be out on 
the street 
were giving the directors the freedom to do what has to be 
done to be more productive she said

trainees in the navys rescue swimmer 
school plunged into the pool under less stringent demands as the 
program resumed for the first time since a recruit drowned last 
march from sheer terror 
the rescue swimmer school was closed march 29 because of the 
death four weeks earlier of airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of 
appleton wis who was allegedly forced back into a swimming pool 
after he climbed out saying that he wanted to quit the course 
officials have since revised the curriculum and eliminated the 
drill being conducted at the time of mireckis death the school 
reopened monday and students grunting and shouting encouragement 
to each other went into the pool for the first time tuesday 
they are a highly motivated group and they are pretty 
enthusiastic about getting started said lt cmdr dennis 
hessler public affairs officer for the naval education and 
training command 
as a result of mireckis death five instructors have been 
accused of involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit 
battery the officer in charge of the school lt thomas a 
torchia has been relieved and charged with dereliction of duty 
all six may face courtmartial 
the 22 navy and two coast guard students will serve to validate 
the new training regimen no other classes will begin until their 
four weeks of training is completed hessler said 
the class is being monitored by experienced rescue swimmers and 
representatives of the naval education and training command and the 
coast guard 
basically they are watching to see how this curriculum works 
and then to make any fine tuning or tweaking if necessary 
hessler said 
after mirecki was forced into the pool one instructor allegedly 
held him under water in a headhold used during a drill called 
sharks and daisies just before he collapsed 
the drill in which instructors grabbed swimming students to 
simulate a panicked air crash survivor has been dropped from the 
curriculum and students now will practice rescue drills on each 
other 
other changes call for training to stop immediately for students 
who ask to quit or show signs of panic fear or extreme fatigue 
mirecki had a phobia about being dragged under water that 
triggered heart failure caused by sheer terror followed by 
drowning a pathologist testified during an investigative hearing 
two weeks ago

fewer songbirds live in many north 
american forests scientists say a probable outcome of the cutting 
of tropical rainforests where the birds winter and the loss of 
other forests to suburban sprawl 
an article in the julyaugust issue of the vermontbased 
harrowsmith magazine cites a growing body of evidence that 
deforestation of tropical rainforests in central and south america 
is harming a long list of songbird species by depriving them of 
their winter nesting grounds 
other researchers however say that the decline in the songbird 
population may be more a result of the carving up of large forest 
tracts in north america by housing developments shopping malls or 
highways 
songbirds which winter in the south and migrate north for the 
breeding season include more than 100 species of warblers 
flycatchers thrushes and vireos 
several experts contacted tuesday by the associated press said 
it is too early to make a definitive connection between lower 
populations of songbirds and deforestation in the tropics 
but some said even the preliminary evidence available is cause 
for concern 
were most likely going to see documentable declines within 
the next few years said david capen associate professor of 
wildlife biology at the university of vermont 
about 40000 square miles of tropical forest an area the size 
of virginia are cleared annually for cattle grazing farmland 
timber and other uses according the nature conservancy 
environmental group cited by harrowsmith 
at least one species decline and its connection with 
deforestation in the tropics has been documented said john 
terborgh professor of biology at princeton university 
terborgh said bachmans warbler a songbird that formerly lived 
in the southeast hasnt been seen for 10 or 15 years most of that 
birds old winter habitat in cuba has been cleared for sugar cane 
fields 
a study of songbird nest sites in central illinois also provides 
evidence that the population has been hurt by the fragmentation of 
forests in north america creating habitats where predators or 
parasitical bird species can thrive at the expense of songbirds 
in a report to published in october scott robinson of the 
illinois natural history survey says that about 80 percent of all 
songbird nests were preyed upon in fragmented wood lots he studied 
the new york times reported this week 
it was really impressive just how much trouble these birds 
were having he said 
terborgh said a major cause of songbird decline in north america 
is the growing population of the parasitic cowbird which invades 
songbirds nests and often deprives their young of food 
some of the decline of the species that spend their summers in 
upper elevations in vermont and elsewhere in the eastern united 
states may be due to forest decline caused by acid rain capen said 
the scientists agreed that more study is needed and lamented 
the lack of accurate and thorough data tying individual bird 
species to specific migratory routes 
we do not now have a good way to determine which factor has 
the most effect said chandler robbins a wildlife bioligist with 
the us fish and wildlife service there are problems down there 
and problems up here its tough on birds all over

three canadians who smuggled a bomb into 
the united states were bunglers who got caught not members of a 
syrian terrorist group that assassinated bashir gemayel in lebanon 
a defense attorney says 
georges younan walid mourad and walid kabbani faced sentencing 
today in us district court younan faces up to 35 years in 
prison kabbani faces 30 years and six months and mourad faces 10 
years 
i think the governments attempt to say theyre part of a 
terrorist group is greatly exaggerated said art anderson 
younans attorney i think it should be kept in perspective 
the men who were born in lebanon were arrested last oct 23 
after crossing the border at richford 
mourad pleaded guilty jan 26 to conspiring to transport 
explosives and an immigration violation a jury convicted younan 
and kabbani on several charges of explosives violations and an 
immigration violation 
us attorney george terwilliger iii and the fbi said the men 
are members of the syrian social nationalist party the party was 
founded in the fascist era of the 1930s and devoted to the 
formation of greater syria would have united lebanon and what 
was then palestine under syrian hegemony 
members of the group have claimed responsibility for the 1982 
assasination of lebanese presidentelect gemayel according to 
floyd clarke an assistant director of the fbis criminal 
investigative division 
the trios offenses represent an attempt to import those 
techniques of violence into the united states terwilliger said 
the three were arrested in richford after the police chief 
spotted them behaving suspiciously near the international border a 
search of their van turned up explosives authorities said 
since their arrest the three have been held at the northwest

police allowed more than 2000 people to 
return home today after a series of explosions and a massive fire 
at a chemical processing plant forced the evacuation of a 
picturesque area of this southern seaport 
dorset county police supt bill hanson said 14 people were 
treated and released from a hospital after inhaling fumes following 
the explosions tuesday afternoon 
an investigation began today to determine what caused the 
explosions at bdh chemicals which witnesses said hurled chemical 
drums into the air shattered windows of nearby houses and sent up 
a fireball and a 200foot column of smoke 
the blasts which could be heard miles away destroyed the plant 
and severely damaged a nearby pub 
more than 2000 people many of them elderly were evacuated 
from picturesque poole old town which dates to roman times when a 
chemical cloud passed over the district as it drifted out to sea 
police said the chemical cloud was not dangerous 
there were some methylated spirits but suggestions that 
cyanide was involved is not so it was on the premises but 
fortunately was not affected by the explosion said a dorset 
police spokesman who spoke on condition he was not identified 
about 120 firefighters brought the blaze under control within 
one hour and reported all workers safe 
eric week a dorset county councilor called for an 
investigation into the cause and whether storage of potentially 
dangerous chemicals should be allowed in a plant in the center of 
poole 
i dont think theres any indication at the moment that our 
operations were unsafe john vass manager of bdh chemicals said 
in a british broadcasting corp television interview 
some elderly local residents described the blasts as worse than 
during the german bombing blitz in world war ii 
beatrice edwards 79 whose home is 200 yards from the chemical 
works said ive never heard anything like it even when a bomb 
dropped down here during the war this was 10 times worse 
there was an enormous explosion and then we kept getting 
explosions after that

government spokesman jerzy urban has 
offered to travel to munich west germany to confront the staff of 
usfunded radio free europe about what he calls distortions in 
its polishlanguage broadcasts 
the president of radio free europe gene pell said the station 
accepts urbans challenge and will accept an invitation to send 
members of its staff to poland 
i am hereby announcing a proposal which i am addressing to 
the head of radio free europe in munich urban told a news 
conference tuesday 
if you are not afraid of discussion about the role of radio 
free europe against the backdrop of the situation in poland then i 
declare my readiness to come to munich 
urban added that staff members of the station could also come to 
poland 
pell issued a statement tuesday night saying he welcomed urbans 
offer and planned to forward a formal invitation to urban today 
pell said the station also would accept the offer to send staff 
members to warsaw 
a secretary to urban said today that he was not in the office so 
could not comment immediately on pells reply 
jamming of polishlanguage broadcasts of radio free europe 
voice of america and the british broadcasting corp ended jan 1 
the end of jamming was accompanied by a steppedup polish media 
campaign against the stations particularly radio free europe 
the station broadcasts uncensored news and commentary to poland 
urban and the official press have accused it of inaccuracies and 
waging psychological warfare against poland specifically attacked 
have been the stations reports after the 1986 chernobyl nuclear 
disaster its coverage of price increases earlier this year and its 
reports on strikes in poland in april and may 
in general the station is accused of exaggerating polands 
problems and inciting unrest 
as a relic of the cold war radio free europe is an obvious 
anachronism said a commentary today on the staterun news 
service pap it misses the spirit of our times new political 
thinking and the current trend in eastwest relations 
in addition to direct attacks on the station the government has 
taken steps to demonstrate that it does not fear the broadcasts 
for instance polish state radio has a weekly program in which 
it repeats without comment excerpts of western broadcasts and the 
communist party newspaper trybuna ludu has a new column in which it 
reprints three or four quotes from government critics interviewed 
on western stations followed by a pithy response in italics 
two emigre poles employed by radio free europe who moved back to 
poland were given highly publicized television interviews last week

more than six decades after it was written sean 
ocaseys juno and the paycock still has the power to move an 
audience to laughter and tears 
both are present in the extraordinary yet remarkably 
unsentimental revival which opened tuesday at broadways golden 
theater as part of the first new york international festival of the 
arts 
this straightforward production from the gate theater in 
dublin is tough and unrelenting as it tells the sad tale of the 
bibulous capt jack boyle and his longsuffering wife juno who eke 
out their lives in a dublin tenement 
the boyle home a wonderful decrepit design by frank hallinan 
flood doesnt radiate warmth its a dismal place where shatterx ty 
hes a 
foolish everyman evading employment and responsibility for his 
wife and children 
the floridfaced donal mccann beautifully captures boyles 
childish dreams particularly after the character learns he has 
inherited a great deal of money from a distant relative its the 
salvation boyle has been dreaming about but unwilling to work for 
only after the inheritance has turned to dust does his foolishness 
take on a poignant quality that turns to despair by the end of the 
play 
boyle spends much of his time in the company of joxer daly a 
spectral figure who in the gate revival resembles one of 
becketts alienated creatures the beckett analogy is particularly 
apt because of the startling performance by john kavanagh a crone 
of a man whos as much of a scavanger as he is a lost soul 
still there is a lot of humor in these characters daily lives 
boyle and joxer have a long breakfast reverie in act 1 that is one 
of the comic highlights of the play they rail against the worlds 
problems without coming up with any solutions 
the captain stands in contrast to juno a sad sensible woman 
who worries about her daughter mary on strike from her job and 
son johnny a morose homebody whose arm was blown off during the 
war for independence 
geraldine plunkett has the resilience needed to convey junos 
sense of survival and duty while rosemary fine and joe savino 
capture the unhappy defeated lives of the boyle children another 
standout in the large cast is maureen potter as the boisterous 
neighbor maisie madigan 
director joe dowling keeps the high spirits under control and 
avoids the maudlin as the play builds toward its inevitable tragic 
finale 
th whole worls in a terrible state o chassis says a 
sodden boyle who never could pronounce the word chaos its one 
of his favorite refrains and reappears often during the play 
boyle mutters it as the curtain falls on the final act its to 
the credit of this production that audiences can see the statement 
not just as a metaphor for ireland but for a family whose center 
no longer holds 
in other reviews 
frank rich of the new york times called the production alive 
at every level as boisterous comedy as wrenching tragedy as 
blistering social commentary 
in the daily news howard kissel writes that few plays capture 
the soul of a nation as powerfully as juno and the paycock he 
praises mccann as memorable and kavanaugh as masterly but 
writes that the women are less strong 
clive barnes in the new york post said the production is one 
of the greatest nights the new york theater has seen in years 
the ironic mingling of tragedy and comedy and here ocasey 
demands comparison with shakespeare has never been so much to the 
life before

a woman whose campaign to raise 
money for her sons liver transplants drew support from president 
reagan says the dismissal of a fine for improperly using the 
donations has cleared her name 
but a hearing officers report says legal challenges remain open 
to maria desillers use of the donated money 
the decision means i have not done anything wrong ms 
desillers said at a news conference tuesday after the civil fine 
was dismissed 
floridas secretary of state had charged ms desillers in an 
administrative complaint with using donations for personal expenses 
and failing to register her 7yearold son ronnies fund as a 
charity 
but administrative hearing officer donald alexander on tuesday 
dropped the 1000 fine ruling the money was exempt from the 
states charity law because the money remaining in ronnies 
accounts became part of his estate when he died april 29 1987 
while awaiting a fourth liver transplant 
alexander emphasized he was not ruling on whether ms desillers 
received or used the money legitimately but only whether she was 
required to register as a charity he noted other court remedies 
are available for those challenging her use of the money 
the miami woman is being sued by childrens hospital of 
pittsburgh which is seeking 262000 in unpaid hospital bills she 
contends she was not legally bound to pay the bill and that her son 
received inadequate medical care 
ms desillers also faces a criminal investigation by the dade 
county state attorneys office over her use of the donated money 
no charges have been filed in that case 
a dade county judge froze ronnies estate three months ago and 
appointed an attorney to oversee the remaining money in the childs 
accounts 
judge francis j christie took the action after state 
investigators reported ms desillers withrew at least 47000 in 
donations to buy jewelry clothing and furniture and spent 270624 
without a judges permission or authority 
ms desillers dismissed questions tuesday about jewelry she 
bought with donated money saying funds collected for ronnie and 
funds collected for the ronnie desillers foundation which paid her 
a salary were different 
the state has nothing to show my side of it i will be 
vindicated in the end she said 
fundraising for ronnie attracted 660000 in donations 
including 1000 from president reagan

a pilot sentenced to nine years in prison on 
drugsmuggling charges would be the major witness against manuel 
antonio noriega if the panamanian general ever comes here to face a 
federal drug indictment 
floyd carlton caceres was sentenced after pleading guilty to one 
count of conspiracy to import cocaine chief assistant us 
attorney richard gregorie said tuesday 
if gen noriega comes to trial at some future time this 
defendant will be the key witness against him gregorie said 
us district judge sidney aronovitz sentenced carlton late 
monday to the 9year term but carlton could be released on parole 
after serving three years 
the prosecutor reviewed for the judge carltons role in the 
noriega indictment carlton has been held at the federal 
metropolitan correctional center south of miami since his 
extradition from costa rica 
carltons testimony before a miami grand jury was crucial in 
indicting noriega in february and he even donned a black hood to 
tell a us senate panel how noriega protected colombian drug lords 
carlton told authorities he personally flew arms to central 
american leftists for noriega and brought cocaine shipments into 
panama 
in february the panamanianborn carlton told the senate 
committee that noriega contracted in 1982 to protect drug flights 
of the notorious colombiabased medellin cartel responsible for up 
to 80 percent of us cocaine imports 
we did nothing without his approval carlton said of noriega 
during the hearing 
carlton said he acted as a gobetween for the cartel and 
noriega even recounting how the general laughed off the smugglers 
original 30000 offer for landing rights in panama 
he told me that if these people thought he was begging they 
were wrong the spanishspeaking carlton testified through a 
translator 
noriega eventually received up to 200000 a flight said the 
pilot who said he personally flew several flights from colombia to 
panama 
carlton also told congress that noriega personally authorized 
air shipments of weapons to leftist guerrillas in el salvador and 
the rebel sandinistas in nicaragua before they overthrew the 
government of anastasio somoza debayle in 1979 carlton said he 
also made some of those flights 
the pilot was eventually accused by the cartel of stealing a 
cocaine shipment at the same time drug agents in florida 
intercepted a flight by an associate who named him as a fellow 
smuggler 
carlton tried to make a deal with us authorities without 
surrendering but was eventually lured to costa rica where he was 
arrested and extradited

government troops battled communist 
rebels near clark air base and killed the guerrilla who allegedly 
masterminded an attack against us servicemen last year the 
government news agency reported today 
the agency said shooting continued sporadically for nine hours 
as soldiers chased an unknown number of new peoples army 
guerrillas through a sugar cane field about five miles from the 
base tuesday 
meanwhile suspected communist rebels killed a policeman in a 
manila suburb today police said on tuesday unidentified men 
killed the mayor of a nearby town as he arrived at a suburban 
hospital to seek medication for his arthritic wife police said 
in a separate development vice president salvador laurel asked 
president corazon aquino today to convene the national security 
council to formulate an official stand on the future of us 
military bases in the philippines 
we should close ranks on this issue because the stakes 
involved are crucial and they affect the very future of our 
people laurel said in a letter to mrs aquino copies of the 
letter were distributed to reporters by laurels office 
laurel said convening the council the countrys highest 
advisory group on security matters was necessary because of 
conflicting statements by government officials on the future of 
clark air base subic naval base and four smaller installations 
some officials have said they are against renewing the 1947 
lease on the bases when it expires in 1991 while others say they 
favor extending the lease provided the united states increases 
military and economic aid 
mrs aquino has said she will respect the agreement until 1991 
but is keeping her options open on what to do afterward 
officials at the central luzon regional military command said 
initially that two rebels were killed in the fighting near clark 
but reported later that only one rebel was slain they said the 
other dead person was a girl caught in the crossfire 
a statement from the command identified the slain rebel only by 
his alias ka comrade aries it said he was allegedly one of 
the hitmen who killed three americans and a filipino in attacks in 
october near clark 50 miles north of manila 
the philippine news agency later quoted lt col amado espino 
chief of the philippine constabulary command in angeles city as 
saying that a captured rebel had identified ka aries as the one 
who masterminded the oct 28 attacks 
the rebels have claimed responsibility for the killings and have 
threatened more attacks on american targets because of continued 
us military assistance to the aquino government 
military officials said tuesdays clash began when troops 
arrived at the cane field after being tipped off about the rebels 
presence in the area they said a helicopter and an armored 
personnel carrier were brought in three hours later 
police in the manila suburb of las pinas said angelito miranda 
died immediately when five unidentified men sprayed him with 
automatic rifle fire in the lobby of the perpetual help medical 
center he suffered 21 bullet wounds police said 
miranda was mayor of the town of bacoor in nearby cavite 
province his wife escaped unhurt but a hospital security guard 
was wounded in the shooting police said 
the assailants escaped in a waiting car 
gonzales said police have ruled out the possibility that 
communist rebels killed miranda he reported members of mirandas 
family as saying they suspected personal motives behind the 
slaying but he did not elaborate 
in neighboring pasay city five suspected communist gunmen 
killed patrolman danilo laberez today at a busy intersection near 
the domestic airport terminal police said 
communist guerrillas have been blamed for the slayings of about 
200 people in the manila area since january 1987

a fire set off by sparks from a cooking 
booth swept through a city of tents housing thousands of coptic 
christians attending a religious festival police said fortyseven 
people were killed 
the victims most of them children either died in the blaze or 
were trampled to death in the rush to escape a senior police 
official said 
the fire broke out late tuesday in the tent city at the foot of 
the almuharraq monastery in alqusiyyah north of this southern 
provincial capital authorities said 
the fire began when sparks from a makeshift food booth touched 
some tents igniting them and setting off a chain reaction in which 
about three dozen butane lamps exploded the police official said 
speaking on condition of anonymity he said the booths two owners 
both copts were arrested 
witnesses said monks quickly closed the monasterys massive door 
when the fire broke out this caused panicstricken pilgrims who 
initially dashed to the building for refuge to turn back and rush 
to the gate of the fenced tent city 
there was was a big rush from the pilgrims towards the main 
gate of the camp some children fell and were trampled to death 
the police official said 
the police official said 26 children 15 men and six women died 
in the blaze he said 15 people were injured trying to escape 
the monastery a 10acre compound with 70 to 80 monks in 
residence was not damaged 
foul play was not suspected in the fire 
the police official said authorities had authorized burial of 
the dead which in egypt is allowed only when the cause of death is 
not in question and a corpse is not required for criminal 
investigation 
the fire caught us by surprise said a survivor one of the 
pilgrims the man appeared dazed and refused to give his name 
there wasnt enough water in the tent city to extinguish the 
fire apparently there was no firefighting equipment at the 
monastery said the survivor 
fire engines were summoned from nearby villages and eight of 
them arrived on the scene a full hour after the fire started 
he said 
a preliminary police report estimated damage at 420000 
the monastery is built at the site of a cave where tradition 
says joseph mary and the infant jesus took shelter on their flight 
into egypt the holy family left palestine after king herod ordered 
all male children killed 
the church inside the monastery is among the oldest in egypt 
although its exact origins are unknown the name of the monastery 
means the burnt monastery 
the pilgrims were at an annual festival dedicated to the virgin 
mary 
about 50000 people customarily celebrate the feast of the 
consecration of the church of the virgin held every june 2128 but 
tuesday only about 5000 pilgrims were inside the tent city near 
the monastery 
formerly a christian stronghold the assiut area has become in 
recent years a hotbed of moslem fundamentalist militancy several 
times moslem extremists have attacked coptic christian shops 
unlike many early coptic monasteries built in desert isolation 
almuharraq is along a relatively welltraveled route near the nile 
river about 35 miles north of assiut the provincial capital is 240 
miles south of cairo 
the coptic orthodox church is reputed to be the oldest community 
in christendom it traces its origins to the disciple st mark who 
tradition says founded a congregation in alexandria in the first 
century

an admitted television addict has been 
charged with cutting down a neighbors tree that apparently stood 
between his satellite dish and clear reception of the disney 
channel 
arthur anderson a 59yearold construction worker has been 
charged with seconddegree criminal mischief and thirddegree 
criminal trespassing in the june 12 incident according to redding 
police officer brian t jones 
hes scheduled to appear in court july 1 
charles marriner a 62yearold financial analyst awoke that 
sunday morning to discover the 50foot tall oak tree lying on its 
side on his wooded property 
its very unfortunate to think that someone can walk on your 
property and cut something down that took 80 or 90 years to grow 
marriner said 
ive heard of people who have satellite dishes around here but 
cutting down somebodys tree for better reception goes a little 
above and beyond said patrolman john leonard 
anderson claimed that the tree felling spotted by several 
children playing nearby was a mistake 
i didnt know whose property i was on anderson said 
he also said the lure of distant television signals via the 
satellite dish is allconsuming 
that dish has caused me more problems were tv addicts me 
and my wife watch it all the time disney baseball the yankees 
we pick it all up i got bicycle races on now youve never seen 
anything like it anderson said 
he said he has gotten telephone calls from supporters who have 
asked him to cut down trees that are blocking their satellite 
signals 
i got one from a girl who said she wanted to be able to get 
the disney channel too he said 
anderson said he has offered to pay marriner 500 in damages and 
to haul away the dead tree in exchange for his neighbor dropping 
the charges marriner has refused 
the scoundrel he knew what he was doing were all just lucky 
it didnt fall on somebody marriner said

a 300pound black bear who stumped police 
and entranced onlookers by spending the day in a downtown tree 
headed back to the woods early today 
that poor bear wasnt going to come down in the day 
firefighter bill sargent said it was just waiting for night and 
for everyone to get away 
the police had planned to wait until today to decide what to do 
about the bear they hoped it would leave by itself they found the 
tree empty when they cruised by at about 130 am 
i dont know what the townspeople will do for excitement 
today though sargent said the tree was about 500 feet from 
town hall in this northern new hampshire community of about 6000 
residents 
the treed bear drew a crowd of spectators on tuesday including 
children on their first day out of school 
while officers made sure no one got close enough to get into 
trouble if the bear decided to come down during daylight the 
dispatcher at headquarters was busy with calls from people who had 
ideas on how to get the bear down 
my phone has been ringing off the hook with suggestions 
said the dispatcher who declined to give her name one person 
said to get a long pole tie a rag on the end and dip it in honey 
to coax the animal down 
another said use ice cream bears love ice cream 
and one suggested climbing the tree and believe it or not 
just talking the bear down like you would a child or your pet 
she said 
chief louis babin said its likely the bear had visited the tree 
before and had not been noticed 
this time one of his officers saw the animal on the street 
early tuesday and babin said the cruisers light may have spooked 
it and sent it up the tree

the supreme court today upheld the way texas 
courts administer that states death penalty law dashing the hopes 
of more than 260 death row inmates 
the justices by a 63 vote ruled that convicted murderer and 
rapist donald gene franklin properly was sentenced to death for a 
1975 crime in san antonio 
the court said jurors deciding whether franklin should be 
sentenced to death or to life in prison did not need more guidance 
on how to weigh mitigating circumstances those factors 
suggesting that life in prison is the appropriate punishment 
the instructions given to jurors in franklins sentencing trial 
are similar to those typically used in texas 
writing the courts main opinion justice byron r white 
rejected franklins argument that jurors were not given a chance 
during his sentencing trial to consider any residual doubt they 
might have had about his guilt 
white rejected other arguments raised by franklin as well 
concluding that the texas death penalty system passes 
constitutional muster 
under texas law capital case sentencing juries are asked two 
key questions whether the murder was committed deliberately and 
whether the killer poses a continuing violent threat to society 
if the jurors unanimously conclude beyond a reasonable doubt 
that the answer to both questions is yes a death sentence is 
imposed 
but franklin wanted the judge who presided over his sentencing 
trial to explain more fully to the jurors how they should consider 
mitigating evidence 
and he argued that the jurors wrongly were limited to 
considering the mitigating evidence in determining a defendants 
future dangerousness and not for some other reason 
because we do not believe that the jury instructions or the 
questions presented to jurors precluded jury consideration of any 
relevant mitigating circumstances in this case or otherwise 
unconstitutionally limited the jurys discretion here we reject 
franklins challenge to his death sentence white said 
his opinion was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justices sandra day oconnor and harry a blackmun voted to 
uphold the states death penalty system for different reasons 
spelled out in a concurring opinion authored by oconnor 
justices john paul stevens william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall dissented 
the ruling is not expected to have any impact beyond texas 
borders 
of the 37 states with death penalty laws 33 provide for jury 
participation in the sentencing of those 33 only texas does not 
require explanatory jury instructions about mitigating evidence 
franklin 36 already has had three trials and four execution 
dates he had been a convicted rapist when convicted of the july 
1975 abduction and murder of mary margaret moran a 27yearold 
nurse 
franklin was arrested hours after ms morans disappearance from 
a hospital parking lot but he refused to tell police where he had 
left her 
search parties combed san antonio but it took four days to find 
her bleeding in a bed of insects and suffering from irreversible 
shock she died the next day

a bitterly divided supreme court today upheld 
by a 54 vote an oklahoma mans murder conviction and death 
sentence even though the presiding judge wrongly refused to exclude 
one juror 
the justices said bobby lynn ross conviction for killing an 
oklahoma policeman was not tainted because his lawyer used a 
peremptory challenge to oust the juror 
so long as the jury that sits is impartial the fact that the 
defendant had to use a peremptory challenge to achieve that result 
does not mean his constitutional right to a fair trial was 
violated chief justice william h rehnquist wrote for the court 
but justice thurgood marshall writing for the four dissenters 
said a mans life is at stake we should not be playing games 
in this case everyone concedes that the trial judge could not 
arbitrarily take away one of the defendants peremptory challenges 
yet that is in effect exactly what happened here 
the justices heard a first round of arguments in the oklahoma 
case last january a month before justice anthony m kennedy joined 
the court 
they scheduled a second round of arguments in april so kennedy 
could participate in the decision a move indicating that the 
eight justices had been evenly divided 
kennedys vote in which he joined the chief justices opinion 
indeed proved to control ross fate 
prosecutors said ross shot elk city okla police sgt steven 
mahan three times in the head after the officer arrived at a motel 
being robbed by ross on jan 5 1983 the murder weapon was found 
in ross pocket 
during jury selection at ross trial one potential juror said 
he would vote to impose the death penalty and would not consider 
a life sentence if ross were convicted 
ross lawyer attempted to have the person disqualified for 
cause but the trial judge refused the defense lawyer then used 
one of nine peremptory or automatic challenges to oust the 
potential juror 
ross contended that his right to a fair and impartial jury had 
been violated becaused the judges error forced the defense team to 
expend one peremptory challenge unnecessarily 
writing for the court today rehnquist said the trial judge 
clearly was wrong in not excluding the potential juror for cause 
but he said that error does not entitle ross to a new trial 
although we agree that the failure to remove the potential 
juror may have resulted in a jury panel different from that which 
would otherwise have decided the case we do not accept the 
argument that this possibility mandates reversal rehnquist said 
quoting from a previous high court ruling rehnquist said the 
constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial not a 
perfect one 
aside from kennedy rehnquist was joined by justices antonin 
scalia byron r white and sandra day oconnor 
marshall was joined in dissent by justices william j brennan 
harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
the case is ross vs oklahoma 865309

republican george bush said today he will continue to criticize 
democrat michael dukakis record because people need to know 
their differences dukakis held private talks with jesse jackson 
about the vice presidential nomination pledging an open search 
for a running mate 
as dukakis begins his search in earnest some members of 
congress say privately that placing the civil rights leader on the 
ticket could seriously jeopardize chances of defeating bush 
bush still weeks away from having to pick his own running mate 
is concentrating on rallying enthusiasm for his candidacy 
aboard air force two enroute to kentucky today bush said his 
likely fall opponent has waffled on major issues 
people need to know wheres the guy coming from i cant 
count on others to do this ive got to spell it out and then get 
surrogates those other people who believe as i do to spell it 
out bush told reporters 
bush denied he was engaging in namecalling and said its the 
record 
on tuesday bush said im convinced we can carry the day 
despite his poor standing in the polls he uttered his prediction 
in a session with the 46 republican senators in washington 
dukakis emerged from a 40minute meeting with jackson in 
california and said the process has now begun that will lead 
him to pick a running mate 
at the same time sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said dukakis campaign has begun public polling to determine which 
running mate will enhance his chances of winning the white house 
in the meantime campaign officials have asked jackson florida 
sen bob graham and possibly others to provide background material 
about themselves for review 
dukakis and his aides have avoided talking publicly about the 
search for a running mate as much as possible in part because they 
want public attention focused on the campaigns public themes 
neither dukakis nor jackson would say exactly what they talked 
about nor would the massachusetts governor say whether his closest 
pursuer in the primary campaign had asked for the no 2 slot on the 
ticket 
jackson said they discussed the vice presidency to some 
measure during the meeting and he repeated his assertion that 
our constituency deserves consideration 
we talk about lots of things when we talk dukakis said at a 
news conference following the session i dont talk about private 
conversations 
dukakis didnt say so but sources in washington disclosed that 
his emissary paul brountas received strong advice last week not 
to place jackson on the ticket these sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity said brountas was urged to tell dukakis 
that a southerner or westerner with experience in the areas of 
defense and foreign policy would enhance the partys chances the 
most in the fall 
he was told you can basically write it off in terms of the 
election if you pick jackson said one congressman who met with 
brountas speaking on condition of anonymity 
at the same time sources disclosed dukakis has asked for 
background information on at least two possible vice presidential 
contenders jackson and graham 
sen bill bradleys office disclosed that the new jersey 
lawmaker has not received such a request even though he has been 
mentioned as a possible running mate 
other names that crop up in speculation about dukakis ticket 
mate include sens sam nunn of georgia john glenn of ohio and 
lloyd bentsen of texas as well as reps tom foley of washington 
and lee hamilton of indiana 
while most of the attention was focused on dukakis bush got a 
boost from president reagan and a public show of support from the 
republicans in the senate 
reagan made light of the prospect that dukakis might move into 
the white house next january saying over my live body 
his aides passed the word that the president is making plans to 
spend two days a week campaigning on bushs behalf beginning in the 
fall 
the vice president met for lunch with gop senators who later 
said they expressed their concern about the polls showing dukakis 
with a doubledigit lead 
they offered their help like a bunch of trout ready to jump 
out of the water said sen alan simpson the no 2 republican in 
the senate 
bush conceded the poll showings but said they dont bother 
me 
im convinced we can carry the day i am not going to be 
outhustled by michael dukakis i can guarantee you he said 
bush has said he intends to wait until dukakis fills his ticket 
at the democratic national convention in july before selecting his 
own vice presidential running mate 
both bush and dukakis have more than enough delegates to win the 
major party presidential nominations this summer 
but the issue has moved front and center in the democratic 
campaign in part because that partys convention is only a few 
weeks away and in part because jackson has mounted a public 
attempt to assure that he is at least offered a spot on the ticket 
we talked about it more than we have talked about it before 
person to person jackson said of the vice presidential question 
dukakis repeated earlier statements that he has begun looking at 
vice presidential nominees but has made no decisions yet 
the process has now begun but its open theres no short 
list or medium list or long list dukakis said 
theres no understanding with jackson dukakis continued 
he himself has said its up to the nominee to make that decision 
i agree with him

do muoi who has directed purges 
against corruption in vietnams ruling communist party was chosen 
today as the countrys prime minister the official radio hanoi 
said 
do muoi 71 was elected on the opening day of the national 
assembly said the broadcast monitored in bangkok he replaces 
pham hung who died in march 
a party communique meanwhile said vietnams communist party 
has decided to regularly change its leadership to improve 
efficiency and better the economy 
the communique said the party central committees fifth plenum 
decided that every time the party elects members to its upper 
echelons onethird of the seats will change hands 
do muoi is the thirdranking member of the politburo the top 
policymaking body 
little known to most vietnamese do muoi gave up the vice 
premiership last year when he became the no 2 man in the party 
secretariat where a major responsibility was directing a purge of 
inept and corrupt elements in the 18millionmember communist 
party before that the veteran revolutionary had a long list of 
key party and government jobs 
the central committee is the policyimplementing arm of the most 
powerful party organ the politburo the committee had 124 full 
members and 49 alternate members when it was elected in december 
1986 
a text of the plenum communique carried by the official 
domestic radio hanoi tuesday was obtained from a western embassy 
in bangkok the june 1420 plenum was convened to prepare for 
todays national assembly session 
a separate radio hanoi broadcast said tuesday that the assembly 
would take up the very hot issue of how to resolve the crisis 
in grain production vietnam has asked the international community 
for emergency aid to offset serious food shortages resulting from a 
series of crop failures last year 
since the party was founded in 1930 its leaders have largely 
been veterans of the revolutionary struggle against the french 
colonialists and then the americans and south vietnam lately the 
party set economic reform as its no 1 priority and says 
incompetent party members with outdated ways of thinking can no 
longer remain in powerful positions 
the plenum communique says the party will combine elderly 
cadres with young cadres avoid renovating and rejuvenating the 
contingent of cadres for the sake of formality by referring only to 
ages and academic degrees and overcome the class ideology and 
hierarchy 
party committee secretaries generally will not remain in their 
posts for more than 10 years it adds 
the communique says managers of state and business enterprises 
and leading cadres of mass organizations need not be party members 
in the past such positions have normally gone to party members 
it says competent cadres in local areas should be brought to 
centrallevel agencies and those cadres who have no ability and 
quality to perform assigned duties must be relieved of of their 
leading positions 
there has been a major purification campaign in the 18 
millionmember party including largescale purges since linh came 
to power in december 1986 
the communique said while most party members retained their 
revolutionary qualities the fighting will of quite a number of 
cadres and party members has declined and their revolutionary 
ideals have faded making them degenerate and deviant

republican george bush today denied he was 
engaging in namecalling in his attacks on rival michael dukakis 
and said he will continue to set the record straight on the 
differences between the two presidential contenders 
its the record what he favors and what i favor its not 
namecalling bush said aboard air force two en route to 
louisville ky where he was scheduled to address the national 
sheriffs association 
bush said he hasnt seen much emphasis in news reports or 
democratic statements on the differences between himself and the 
massachusetts governor 
yet they are there if people like that kind of thing theyll 
vote for him he said referring to dukakis vagueness 
bush added that he will continue to spell it the differences 
out and then get surrogates those other people who believe as i 
do to spell it out 
on tuesday senate republicans concerned about recent polls 
showing bush trailing dukakis by 10 or 12 points promised the vice 
president they would campaign on his behalf 
were all politicians we see a poll that shows that kind of 
thing we get excited and say hey what can we do sen alan 
simpson wyo said after a meeting between bush and the senate gop 
in the capitol 
were ready to go like a bunch of trout ready to jump out of 
the water were going to get out our assignments and spread out 
across the country said simpson deputy senate republican leader 
and a close friend of bushs 
the bush campaign which has curtailed sharply the vice 
presidents travel plans because it is nearing the federal limit on 
preconvention spending is relying heavily on surrogate 
speakers including republican senators 
on tuesday bush renewed his attack on dukakis for supporting a 
prison furlough system under which the vice president claimed 
convicted murderers were released on weekend passes and he accused 
dukakis of seeking to confuse the issue 
asked by reporters about statements by dukakis that many other 
states had such programs including california while ronald reagan 
was governor bush said its my understanding that none except 
massachusetts had furlough programs for firstdegree murderers 
he can obfuscate it confuse it all he wants but the facts 
are as i stated them and im very interested in his response 
bush said 
reacting to bushs statemement dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
said there are a number of other states that grant furloughs for 
firstdegree murderers and that massachusetts is no longer among 
them 
george bush is using the furlough issue as a smokescreen to 
hide the fact that he has no record on crime and drugs dach said 
at tuesdays gop luncheon bush declared to a standing ovation 
im convinced we can carry the day i am not going to be 
outhustled by michael dukakis i can guarantee you 
he was presented a letter signed by all 46 senate republicans 
expressing their confidence in his victory in november but stating 
we take nothing for granted 
the letter was inside a large white mailbox with g amp b bush 
1600 pennsylvania avenue emblazoned on it the g amp b stands for 
george and barbara and the address is that of the white house 
the letter from republicans said we realize it will be a 
tough fight on the 1988 campaign trail but there are some heavy 
hitters in this room who wanted to let you know theyll be with you 
every step of the way 
speaking with reporters afterward bush said i came out of 
there feeling 20 feet high 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas who pulled out of 
the gop race in late march and endorsed bush told reporters 
this wasnt just an endorsement it was a willingness to say 
were available send us where he wants were ready to go 
earlier bush met in his office at the old executive office 
building with a presidential task force on drug interdiction and 
called for greater emphasis on intelligence resources in the war on 
drugs claiming that the intelligence currently available was not 
totally satisfactory 
bush also issued a statement tuesday in which he praised and 
sought to take credit for the vow by the industrial democracies 
at the economic summit in toronto to set up a sevencountry task 
force on drugs and moneylaundering 
this is an idea that i proposed following canadian prime 
minister brian mulroneys most recent visit to washington bush 
said i am pleased these ideas have been implemented

the government today ordered a 
dusktodawn curfew banned public meetings and closed more schools 
after at least nine people were killed as thousands of students 
battled riot police 
police arrested 77 people the government radio announced 
the radio said six policemen and three demonstrators were killed 
and that 10 students and three women were among those arrested 
dozens were injured it said 
the radio said the restrictions would last until aug 19 
on tuesday students from the rangoon arts and science 
university surged into the streets after authorities closed that 
and other institutions 
the students had for the past week been peacefully demonstrating 
for the release of detained students and the legalization of 
student unions 
the oneparty regime of ne win did not give in to the demands 
and as it did against similar rioting in march dispatched security 
units to swiftly quell the disturbances 
ne win a socialist has ruled this southeast asian nation with 
an iron hand since seizing power in a 1962 military coup 
the government earlier said five policemen were killed and 26 
seriously wounded as a result of an attack by an unruly mob armed 
with swords sticks and catapults 
it said one rioter was killed and several wounded 
government radio said the mob set fire to one police station and 
the family quarters of another station and damaged governmentowned 
movie theaters and traffic lights 
authorities today suspended classes at three more institutions 
where students had staged peaceful rallies the institute of 
medicine the institute of dental science and the rangoon institute 
of technology 
there was no apparent extra security on the streets which were 
calm but with less traffic few people went to offices or schools 
markets were open but had few customers local officials went into 
residential areas warning people not to gather in groups of five or 
more 
witnesses said the fighting began as about 1000 students of the 
arts and science university marched toward downtown rangoon with 
high school students joining them 
they said about 200 police officers swung batons and hurled 
stones to stop the marchers near the singaporean embassy about two 
miles south of the campus 
the demonstrators by then about 5000 strong hurled stones and 
other objects and forced the police to retreat a block south where 
a strong military barricade stood the protesters then dispersed 
into small lanes 
sporadic clashes also were reported in the nearby sanchaung area 
of the city where security personnel were said to have used tear 
gas and firearms 
it was the worst rioting in the city since march 18 when 
several days of student unrest at two universities climaxed in a 
rampage by students and other protesters that was swiftly crushed 
by police and military units 
diplomatic sources told reporters in bangkok thailand that as 
many as 100 people may have died in the march 18 violence a 
government panel announced only two deaths both students it said 
were shot by riot police

two nuclear weapons were detonated 
simultaneously beneath the nevada desert this morning in a rare 
experiment carried out only a few times in 43 years of nuclear 
testing 
the test was conducted 40 miles from the town of mercury where 
33 soviet nuclear scientists are preparing for a historic series of 
joint nuclear experiments later this summer 
the devices were detonated at 7 am in a 750foot vertical 
shaft drilled in yucca flat about 85 miles northwest of las vegas 
energy department spokesman jim boyer said he felt very very 
slight motion at a control point 17 miles from ground zero 
the devices tested today he said were very very small and 
little ground motion could be expected away from the site 
in golden colo the national earthquake information center 
measured the magnitude of todays explosion at 31 on the richter 
scale spokesman waverly person a quake of magnitude 35 can cause 
slight damage 
the two devices were listed as having a combined force of less 
than 150 kilotons of tnt the exact size of each device was 
classified information boyer said 
the simultaneous test of two devices had been conducted only 
once in the past 20 years boyer has said adding that the 
experiment is a rarity 
energy department spokesman chris west said a check of doe 
records dating back to 1968 showed only one occasion september 
1982 when two devices were detonated simultaneously 
however there have been several occasions when two or more 
tests were conducted the same day 
soviet scientists are at the remote desert site to prepare for a 
blast in midaugust that will determine the ability of the kremlin 
and the united states to measure the size of each others nuclear 
tests 
the devices detonated today were the sixth and seventh tested 
this year at the nevada site six of the soviet scientists have 
been at the nevada site for three of those tests 
the united states has 34 technicians at the soviet test site 
preparing for a joint verification experiment in russia a month 
after the us test 
todays test brought to 682 the number of devices tested at the 
remote desert site since testing began in nevada in january 1951 
the first nuclear tests in the united states began in new mexico in 
1945

the supreme court rescuing employers from 
having to pay potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in 
pension benefits today limited the application of rulings 
requiring equal treatment of men and women in the workplace 
by a 54 vote the court said the state of florida does not have 
to pay 436 million to male state workers who retired since 1972 
the justices limited the retroactive impact of a 1978 high court 
ruling that barred employers from requiring women to make higher 
contributions to pension plans because on average they live longer 
than men and thus receive greater retirement benefits 
the 1978 decision was greatly expanded by the high court in 1983 
when it made it illegal for women to receive smaller monthly 
retirement pay than men solely because of their sex 
the 1983 ruling outlawed the practice of paying women smaller 
monthly benefit checks than men with identical work and earning 
histories 
the outlawed practice was based on actuarial tables statistics 
showing women as a group live longer than men and therefore 
collected pensions for a longer time 
the court ruled that all retirement benefits derived from 
pension contributions made after aug 1 1983 must be calculated 
in a sexneutral manner without regard to the sex of the 
beneficiary 
both pension benefit rulings were based on the civil rights act 
of 1964 banning sex discrimination in the workplace 
until today the court had not answered specifically the 
question whether the sexneutral principles it established in the 
pension cases apply to a vast number of workers who have retired 
since 1964 
the justices used the florida case today to bar retroactive 
application of its 1978 ruling 
the florida state pension plan has been funded since 1975 solely 
by contributions made by state and and city employers 
under one pension plan option women received larger monthly 
benefits than men because they lived longer 
several males sued florida claiming that the system 
discriminated against them on the basis of sex in violation of the 
1964 civil rights law 
florida amended the retirement system in 1983 to adopt wholly 
sexneutral actuarial tables 
but lower courts ruled that male workers who retired after 1972 
must be given additional benefits to raise them to the levels paid 
women the process called topping up meant 436 million in 
additional benefits florida was ordered to pay by lower courts 
the supreme court today threw out the lower court rulings 
justice anthony m kennedy writing for the court said the 
imposition of retroactive liability on employers that offered 
sexbased pension plans to their employees is inequitable 
also he said imposing such extra costs on pension plans would 
threaten their existence and the rights of other workers to collect 
benefits 
some authorities estimated that applying the pension rulings 
retroactively would have forced employers to spend hundreds of 
millions of dollars in extra benefits 
kennedy was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia 
dissenting were justices harry a blackmun william j brennan 
thurgood marshall and john paul stevens 
in other action the court 
said in a decision that could carry some impact for the 
continuing irancontra affair investigation that grand jury 
targets may be forced to help prosecutors get at their accounts in 
foreign banks 
the court by an 81 vote ruled that prosecutors may compel the 
target of a grand jury investigation to provide written 
authorization so foreign banks will disclose records of the 
targets accounts there 
upheld the way texas courts administer that states death 
penalty law dashing the hopes of more than 260 death row inmates 
the justices by a 63 vote ruled that convicted murderer and 
rapist donald gene franklin properly was sentenced to death for a 
1975 crime in san antonio 
upheld by a 54 vote an oklahoma mans murder conviction and 
death sentence even though the presiding judge wrongly refused to 
exclude one juror 
the justices said bobby lynn ross conviction for killing an 
oklahoma city policeman was not tainted because his lawyer used a 
peremptory challenge to oust the juror 
ruled that federal judges may not throw out indictments 
because of misconduct by prosecutors unless the defendants can show 
they would not have been indicted were it not for such misconduct 
the 81 ruling upheld the reinstatment of an indictment in a 
denver case against the bank of nova scotia and others accused of 
setting up and taking part in phony tax shelters 
the pension case is florida vs long 861685

ford motor co will make passenger and 
driverside air bags standard equipment on 1989 lincoln 
continentals the company said today 
the move will make ford the first domestic automaker and the 
second in the world to offer the dual bag system ford vice 
president helen petrauskas said at a news conference 
west germanys porsche has offered dual air bags on its 
fourcylinder cars since 1987 as standard equipment on 944 turbo 
and added the 944 s and 944 turbo s for 1988 porsche spokeswoman 
martha mckinley said 
in may chrysler corp announced it was including driverside 
air bags as standard equipment on six models built after may 15 by 
1990 chrysler plans to have driverside bags as standard equipment 
on all usbuilt models 
ford last year requested and won for the industry a delay in a 
federal passive restraint regulation that would have required air 
bags on both sides of cars not equipped with automatic seat belts 
instead the national highway traffic safety administration 
allowed automakers to count the singlebag driversideonly 
systems as passive restraints while they developed the dualbag 
systems 
petrauskas said the decision prevented slower passengerside bag 
development from holding up installation of driverside bags since 
1985 ford has offered air bags as an option on its small ford 
tempomercury topaz cars 
petrauskas said safety had become an area of intense competition 
among the nations automakers 
that safety race is in high gear she said 
in the dual system the driverside and passengerside bags 
share a single set of sensors which detect impact and computer 
controls which set off an explosive charge that inflates the bags 
in a fraction of a second 
the nhtsa rule required all automakers to include passive 
restraints air bags or automatic front seat belts on 10 percent 
of their cars in 1987 25 percent in 1988 40 percent in 1989 and 
100 percent in 1990 
ford said 11 of its 1990 car lines will have driverside air 
bags as standard equipment with projected sales of 1 million 
vehicles petrauskas said 
on the tempotopaz the driverside air bag is an 815 option 
ford said it has sold about 12000 of the air bagequipped 
tempotopaz models a year since 1985 and expects to sell 50000 
lincoln continentals in 1989 
the dual system is a 3500 option on the base porsche 944 
mckinley said adding that porsche has never offered a 
driversideonly air bag system

the supreme court today ruled that federal 
judges may not throw out indictments because of misconduct by 
prosecutors unless the defendants can show they would not have been 
indicted were it not for such misconduct 
the 81 ruling upheld the reinstatment of an indictment in a 
denver case against the bank of nova scotia and others accused of 
setting up and taking part in phony tax shelters 
justice anthony m kennedy writing for the court said the 
judge who originally dismissed the indictment lacked such authority 
absent a finding that defendants were prejudiced by 
prosecutorial misconduct 
kennedy said the dismissal of an indictment must be based on 
evidence that the grand jury would have voted against indictment 
were it not for the misconduct otherwise he said any violations 
by prosecutors must be deemed harmless 
the case stems from a 20month federal investigation that led to 
a 27count indictment in 1982 against seven individuals and the 
bank of nova scotia the indictment alleged conspiracy mail fraud 
and tax fraud 
there also was one count of obstruction of justice against 
denver businessman william a kilpatrick accused of being 
instrumental in setting up the tax shelters 
us district judge john l kane jr in denver dismissed 26 of 
the counts of the indictment on feb 21 1983 and threw out the 
remaining obstruction of justice charge against kilpatrick after he 
was convicted 
kane said the indictment was defective for several reasons 
including extensive misconduct by federal prosecutors and internal 
revenue service officials 
for example kane said irs agents made frequent appearances 
before the grand jury when they were unsupervised by government 
attorneys the agents also appeared together to read testimony in 
violation of grand jury rules 
also the attorneys allowed the irs to disclose confidential 
grand jury material to other irs agents who were investigating 
civil charges in the case 
there also was evidence that a tax expert who testified for the 
defendants was browbeaten and ridiculed in testifying before 
the grand jury kane said the judge also noted that a prosecutors 
heated argument with the tax expert was overheard by other 
witnesses waiting to testify 
and the judge said prosecutors impermissibly interrogated 
highlevel bank employees outside the grand jury without notifying 
lawyers for the nova scotia bank 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals reinstated the indictment 
in 1987 
the supreme court in upholding that ruling agreed with the 
appeals court that there is a lack of conclusive evidence the grand 
jury would have voted against indictment were it not for the 
alleged misconduct 
justice thurgood marshall was the lone dissenter 
the case is bank of nova scotia vs us 87578

gov bob martinez said today he would 
name a drug czar and create a drug policy task force to wage 
war on narcotics in the sunshine state 
martinez who just returned from a trip to washington where he 
met with vice president george bush and defense secretary frank 
carlucci said the toplevel policy adviser would serve as chairman 
of the task force 
floridas drug problem wont get any better unless we develop 
tougher and more creative policies and penalties martinez said 
we must make the cost of drug trafficking and drug abuse so high 
that individuals wont risk getting involved 
martinez said he wanted the new chairman and 15member task 
force to consider such options as using the florida national guard 
including its air unit to help locate illicit drug shipments into 
the state the national guard is now used in a minor role in 
surveillance 
about 70 percent of the cocaine shipped to the united states is 
believed to come through florida which has more than 1350 miles 
of coastline 
he also recommended that a task force look at random drug tests 
for most state employees especially those who work in the states 
schools in the prisons and on the highways 
he also said the task force would consider extending the death 
penalty statute to major traffickers and drug dealers

a 31yearold mother charged with abandoning her 
five children at a hospital emergency room faced similar charges 
two years ago 
brenda shed was arrested early tuesday after being interviewed 
by police and caseworkers for the state department of children and 
family services said police youth division officer terry belinski 
the five children ranged in age from a 2yearold girl to 
9yearold twin boys the three youngest children were placed in 
foster homes by tuesday night but the 9yearolds remained in an 
emergency shelter said dave schneidman a family services 
spokesman 
the agency he said would seek to win temporary custody of the 
children 
schneidman said the childwelfare agency cited ms shed for 
neglect in 1986 and that her four children were placed in foster 
care for seven months 
the citation he said came after the children were found living 
alone for four days with only minimal food and a neighbor 
looking in on them once a day 
but a juvenile court judge ordered the family reunited in 
november 1986 schneidman said 
there was no followup investigation since then he said 
following her arrest tuesday police said ms shed told them she 
was financially stressed and had been evicted from an 
apartment into which she moved three months earlier from public 
housing 
according to ms sheds account her older sister dorothy 40 
came to the familys apartment as they were being evicted monday 
and said she would drive them to a publicaid shelter 
instead dorothy shed drove to cook county hospital and while 
the childrens mother waited in the car took the youngsters to the 
emergency room there she left brenda sheds name and told a 
security guard ill pick these children up thursday 
youth division officers picked up dorothy shed late monday and 
charged her with contributing to the dependency of a child a 
misdemeanor said belinski 
the children were examined monday and found to be healthy they 
also were welldressed and the three schoolaged children had their 
schoolbooks with them said belinski

ancient ancestors of humans apparently ate soft 
fruits and leaves but their evolutionary cousins chomped on nuts 
and bark a new study of fossil teeth suggests 
the work bears on a longstanding debate over whether the two 
kinds of animals ate different diets or just differing amounts of 
the same food said researcher frederick grine 
the work is reported in thursdays issue of the british journal 
nature by grine associate professor of anthropology at the state 
university of new york at stony brook and richard kay professor 
of anatomy at duke university in durham nc 
they studied detailed replicas of molars that human ancestors 
called australopithecus left 25 million to 28 million years ago 
in south africa and that other beasts called paranthropus left 
there 15 million to 18 million years ago 
the two kinds of animals are also known as gracile and robust 
australopithecines respectively 
both walked upright but after their lineages split 25 million 
years ago the australopithecus group evolved toward modern humans 
while the paranthropus branch eventually died out 
grine and kay studied microscopic patterns of dental wear and 
compared them to teeth from modern animals with known diets 
paranthropus teeth showed more pits and wider pits and 
scratches suggesting a diet of tougher foods than australopithecus 
ate researchers said the difference probably led to the bigger 
teeth and larger jaws of paranthropus they said

alan simpson of wyoming has climbed toward the 
peak of the senates republican ranks with a determined lawmaking 
style thats spiced with a rangeland wit and outspoken irreverence 
ive punched the lights out of every sacred cow in this 
city he says 
despite his blunt independence the 56yearold attorney from 
cody wyo is being mentioned as a possible running mate for 
george bush not surprisingly hes less than enthusiastic 
i just cant imagine myself in the capacity of a vice 
presidential running mate he said citing the loss of privacy 
and freedom hed have to endure it would be a very difficult 
thing for me to do 
i cant get out of a plane in detroit and have somebody hand 
me a speech and tell me what i have to say i have an aversion to 
that its almost physical he said in an interview 
simpson has been writing his own speeches since he entered the 
senate a decade ago after serving in his state legislature 
including majority leader of the wyoming house of representatives 
in 1984 after only a single sixyear term he was named by his 
gop colleagues as deputy majority leader had republican leader bob 
doles campaign for the partys presidential nomination succeeded 
simpson would have been hard to beat for the top job 
his is a distinctive presence on the senate floor 
sixfootseven stoop shouldered thin and balding he stares 
menacingly over his halfframe glasses like a vulture and surveys 
the senate floor for prey 
then he smiles and compares passing a tough bill to giving 
dry birth to a porcupine 
simpson is known as one who fights to win his arguments not 
just go for the easy compromise he arms himself by studying at 
home late into the night 
hes been critical of some of the most popular programs in 
washington including veterans benefits for noncombatants 
costofliving increases for entitlements and rural electric 
cooperatives 
he has sometimes shown impatience with colleagues even gop 
colleagues who use the senates arcane rules to make things 
difficult but his ability to soothe and work with opponents while 
maintaining his priorities has earned him respect from both parties 
simpsons credentials as a conservative are unquestioned but 
hes not aligned with the new right 
his father milward simpson was a governor and a senator his 
leap from the statehouse to washingtons most exclusive club and 
his reelection in 1984 were made with ease 
the marathon and ultimately successful effort to overhaul the 
nations immigration laws has been simpsons most noted 
accomplishment it was he said one of those porcupine bills 
simpson teamed up with rep romano mazzoli dky and spent six 
years crafting and pushing the immigration bill to final approval 
along the way the measure became known simply as 
simpsonmazzoli and it was signed into law by president reagan 
in november 1986 
along with the successes have come frustrations especially 
with the inability of washington to resist special interest 
lobbying and attack federal deficits 
hes not shy about making those feelings known and his humor 
can take an edge when hes on the attack his jokes are my sword 
and my shield he says 
simpson says his friend george bush will find many who are 
qualified to be his running mate he says whoever is chosen hes 
confident the republicans will hold the white house 
on their fishing trips simpson has learned that bush is good 
at anything because hes highly competitive 
and he adds michael dukakis is going to find that out

a political consultant testified that 
he instructed workers to sign others names on petitions for a 
republican presidential candidate but never expected the 
signatures to be used 
rocky mountain said it was probably one of the dumbest things 
ive ever done in my life to give teenagers and other temporary 
workers beer and tell them to sign names from a computerized list 
on state primary petitions for candidate pete du pont 
however mountain said i dont believe it constitutes a 
crime 
the defense rested after mountains testimony on tuesday harris 
county judge sherman ross was to consider motions today and 
attorneys were to deliver closing statements before the case goes 
to the jury 
mountain and the company for which he is a vice president 
southern political consulting inc in houston each were indicted 
on 64 counts of misdemeanor forgery but the judge threw out 26 of 
the counts tuesday on grounds of insufficient evidence 
mountain said he did not intend to defraud or harm anyone but 
simply meant to present the petitions to du pont aide scott 
malfitano mountain said he was angry at malfitano because of 
pressure from the du pont campaign to get signatures 
i wanted to get a whole big stack of petitions dump them on 
malfitanos desk and say you want petitions man heres the 
petitions mountain said he said malfitano used the firms 
offices for several days 
never in a million years did i imagine he was going to turn 
them in to the republican party of texas we all agreed there was 
no way to use those petitions mountain said 
defense lawyers have said they were unable to secure malfitano 
as a witness 
republican party rules required candidates to submit 5000 voter 
signatures to get on the ballot the rules since have been changed 
to allow candidates to pay a filing fee or submit signatures 
mountain contended tuesday that the law was being selectively 
enforced he and his firm are the only ones to be indicted 
mountain noted even though apparently forged signatures were found 
on a number of presidential candidates petitions 
mountain faces a fine of up to 2000 per count and up to a year 
in jail the firm could be fined up to 10000 per count

the autographed manuscript of the plough and the 
stars by irish playwright sean ocasey was sold on wednesday for 
about 68000 auctioneers christies said 
the buyer was bernard quaritch leading london book dealers the 
seller was not identified 
the manuscript on lined paper stapled to make a school exercise 
book was of the type that ocasey used for the two earlier plays in 
the trilogy on which his fame rests the shadow of a gunman and 
juno and the paycock 
kate hedworth head of christies manuscripts department said 
ocasey used the cheap books for the manuscript because he was very 
poor at the time he wrote them 
the plough and the stars is about the effects on the people 
of a dublin tenement of the violent easter rising in the city in 
1916 against british rule 
when staged at dublins abbey theater in 1926 the play provoked 
riots as ocasey was accused of distorting irish life 
on the fourth night the poet william butler yeats jumped on the 
stage and told the audience to calm down he said they had failed 
to recognize ocaseys genius and they were bringing disgrace 
on ireland 
but the uproar and the abbeys rejection in 1928 of his next 
play the silver tassie led ocasey to quit ireland for good 
he made his home in england where he died in 1964 at age 84

senior leader deng xiaoping confidently assessed 
his own economic policies wednesday while condemning as leftist 
mistakes those followed by mao tsetung for two decades an 
official report said 
the xinhua news agency said deng acknowledged that his 
marketstyle economic reforms face serious problems including 
inflation and wage inequities that have caused widespread 
discontent he said the problems will take five or six years to 
resolve 
but in a meeting with visiting ethiopian president mengistu 
haile mariam deng criticized chinas policies from 195776 for 
bringing the country to a virtual standstill xinhua said 
deng apparently did not mention mao by name mao died in 1976 
after 27 years as the most powerful man in communist china 
criticism of maos 1957 drive to form huge communes and the 
196676 radical leftist cultural revolution have become routine 
under deng twice purged by mao 
but dengs condemnation was unusually sweeping rejecting the 
entire two decades as a time when chinas productive forces went 
undeveloped and peoples living standards did not improve 
he blamed the eras emphasis on class struggle and policy of 
isolating china from the outside world 
at the start of the meeting with mengistu in the great hall of 
the people deng reminisced about his political exile under mao 
you made your first visit to china 12 years ago that is in 
1976 he told mengistu 
at that time i was not in beijing i was confined in what we 
call a cowshed for the second time he said using a chinese term 
for places of punishment for those purged during the cultural 
revolution 
deng was branded a capitalist roader in 1968 and exiled to 
rural jiangxi province he was reinstated in his posts in 1973 but 
was purged again three years later 
he gradually consolidated power after maos death and became top 
leader in 1978 he since has made economic development his top 
priority and declared that talk of reaching communism is premature 
until china becomes prosperous 
communism consists of two stages deng told mengistu head 
of ethiopias marxist government as he expounded chinas current 
line that it is only in the first stage of socialism 
deng said his current policies guarantee that production will 
develop at a comparatively good speed xinhua reported 
he said price increases which averaged 11 percent in the first 
quarter of the year and wage inequities pose serious problems 
our plans call for taking five or six years to overcome these 
barriers xinhua quoted him as saying there are many risks 
but we believe we can overcome them

feuding between rival palestinian 
factions has been fanned by a statement from a close aide to plo 
chairman yasser arafat that the movement is prepared to live in 
peace with israel 
the unusually conciliatory statement by bassam abu sharif 
arafats chief spokesman was clearly aimed at pushing the united 
states to deal directly with the palestine liberation organization 
it was branded high treason by five dissident syrianbacked 
guerrilla groups who broke away from the plo five years ago in a 
dispute with arafats policies 
the statement initially circulated earlier this month sparked 
a new outburst of heavy fighting between arafats fatah faction and 
a radical group fatahuprising in the refugee shantytowns on 
beiruts southern outskirts 
at least 51 people have been killed and 204 wounded since the 
fighting flared 13 days ago 
when abu sharifs statement was published monday on the front 
page of the leftist assafir newspaper it led to the collapse of a 
fourday truce in the camps battle 
abu sharif labeled his statement a policy breakthrough 
it said the plos raison detre is not the undoing of israel 
but the salvation of the palestinian people and their rights 
including their right to democratic selfexpression and national 
selfdetermination 
the plo backed by the arab world wants an independent homeland 
in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip where the 
israelis have been fighting to quell a 6monthold palestinian 
uprising 
abu sharif added that as for the fear that a palestinian state 
would threaten its neighbor the palestinians would be open to the 
idea of a brief mutually acceptable transitional period during 
which an international mandate would guide the occupied territories 
to democratic palestinian statehood 
beyond that the palestinians would accept indeed insist on 
international guarantees for the security of all states in the 
region 
abu sharif also said that the means by which the israelis want 
to achieve a lasting peace and security is through direct talks 
with no attempts by any outside party to impose or veto a 
settlement the palestinians agree 
the arabs have endorsed the plos role as the sole 
representative of the 5 million palestinians but the us and 
israel refuse to deal directly with the palestinians 
abu sharif proposed an internationally supervised referendum in 
the west bank and gaza to allow the 15 million palestinians living 
there to decide whom they want to represent them the plo or any 
other group of palestinians that israel or the united states 
wishes to nominate 
arafat himself has yet to publicly endorse abu sharifs 
statement which was first circulated at the algiers arab summit 
earlier this month without abu sharifs signature 
abu sharifs statement was similar in outline to remarks arafat 
made in baghdad last january 
arafat told the associated press that he was prepared to 
recognize israels right to exist and accept un resolutions 
declaring israels right to exist behind secure borders if 
washington dropped its objections to plo attendance at an 
international peace conference 
abu sharif reiterated that the plo would accept security council 
resolutions 242 and 338 if israel accepted general assembly 
resolutions that recognize palestinian rights 
the plo has not unconditionally accepted those resolutions 
because they make no reference to palestinian selfdetermination

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
june 15 
the intelligencer wheeling wva on us aid to nicaragua 
the president has warned the sandinista regime in nicaragua that 
he is prepared to ask congress to renew military aid to the 
resistance fighters 
this will happen if the marxists running nicaragua fail to live 
up to their pledges for democratic reforms under a central american 
peace accord 
a lasting peace in nicaragua must be based on more than an end 
to the shooting and the release of a few political prisoners 
there were promises made by the sandinistas that broad 
democratic reforms would be effected these promises must be kept 
unless they are then it seems to us the congress will have no 
honorable alternative save to resume fullscale military aid to the 
contras

the baltimore sun on railroad safety 
the rail safety improvement act of 1988 will close a huge 
loophole in the running of the nations rail systems 
it seems so eminently logical now but it took 21 years for 
congress to grant federal railroad administration officials the 
authority over the personnel who run the trains to match their 
authority over the companies that manage the system 
it is imperative now that congress finish what it started 
rail administrators want to develop rules for preemployment 
postaccident and unannounced random drugtesting among train 
personnel with predictable opposition from rail unions 
the evidence of drugs influencing those who operate the nations 
rail passenger and freight trains is too pervasive to allow any 
group however wellmeaning to block reforms 
congress can and should help by buttressing fra authority in 
this critical area

the west palm beach fla post on the tobacco liability trial 
for the first time ever a court has held a tobacco company 
responsible for the consequences of cigarette smoking 
this crack in the dam as one attorney called it is yet one 
more signal of changing attitudes 
a federal jury in newark nj has ordered liggett group to pay 
400000 to antonio cipollone whose wife died of lung cancer in 
1984 
the tobacco firm had failed to warn customers of health risks 
before such warnings were required in 1966 and had misled the 
public in its advertising the jurors said 
the award is small enough mrs cippoline was found to bear 80 
percent of the blame herself so that it will not encourage a rush 
to the courthouse door if it is thrown out on appeal the 
incentive will be even less 
nevertheless it tells the industry that the times they are 
achangin

austin texas americanstatesman on congressional pay 
the house mindful of the election year on june 14 reportedly 
reluctantly voted to deny its members and other top federal 
officials a costofliving pay raise for the second year in a row 
while some may applaud the decision the fact is that lawmakers 
are underpaid at 89000 a year considering the cost of 
maintaining a residence in both washington dc and at home plus 
the importance and nature of their jobs 
the relatively low pay is one reason why some lawmakers keep 
getting in ethical snags 
one should not have to be either rich or ethically bent in order 
to serve in congress 
the way to get the most service from the best people is to make 
the pay commensurate with the job and to forbid by law any outside 
earnings that could constitute a conflict of interest 
but it will take political fortitude from the congress and the 
understanding and agreement of the us taxpayer and 
unfortunately both appear to be lacking at this time

the record hackensack nj on the tobacco liability case 
the jury was right not to buy the picture of rose cipollone as 
an innocent victim trapped in her smoking habit by addiction and 
by glossy ads but the jury was also right not to let the liggett 
group off free 
after all liggett ran ads suggesting that smoking was safe 
tobacco cases are different from those in which the risks of 
the product were unknown outside a specific industry smokers are 
aware and have been for years that theyre taking a risk 
the most appropriate place to fight against cigarettes is 
outside the courts 
welldesigned antismoking ads have educated millions of 
americans about the danger of cigarettes congress has required 
strict warnings on cigarette packs and in ads 
many states have restricted the right to smoke in public 
places a number of private employers have chosen to go even 
farther and prohibited smoking in the workplace 
manufacturers of cigarettes can afford to worry a bit less about 
the danger of expensive jury awards 
but the cipollone verdict will encourage those fighting for new 
restrictions on cigarette smoking

the daily times maryville tenn on catastrophic illness 
insurance 
obviously it will mean an increase in taxes but one of the most 
important bills passed in recent days is the one which provides 
catastrophic illness insurance 
the bill passed the senate 8611 and earlier passed the house 
32872 president reagan at the urging of health and human 
services secretary otis r bowen sent the insurance proposal to 
congress more than a year ago it passed with some features the 
president doesnt like but it apparently is acceptable 
it will give 29 million elderly americans vastly improved 
protection against financial ruin if they are stricken with 
socalled catastrophic diseases such as cancer 
for the first time general prescription drug benefits will be 
paid under medicare a real boost for elderly people trying to make 
ends meet on small fixed incomes 
the plan provides full hospital coverage after a onceayear 
deductible estimated at 564 in 1989 
little has been done for longterm home health care for disabled 
and chronically ill people of all ages but the plan passed will 
provide some peace of mind to millions of elderly who now live in 
fear that an extended hospital stay will wipe them out financially

the honolulu advertiser on george bush and james baker 
more important now than than who george bush picks for vice 
president may be who runs his campaign 
despite denials treasury secretary james baker iii may be asked 
to join the campaign fulltime the old friends already talk 
regularly and bush often takes bakers advice 
baker is known as a superb organizer able to anticipate 
political problems and avoid them 
in 1981 he went from working against reagans nomination to 
being one of the new presidents top advisers along with edwin 
messe and michael deaver 
baker is one of the most important but least scrutinizd figures 
on the political landscape today he may believe he can do more for 
bush in november by staying at treasury and keeping the economy 
humming 
but if bushs campaign continues to falter and he asked baker to 
come on board perhaps sometime after this weeks toronto 
economic summit its unlikely baker could say no

as commentators have taken to repeating endlessly our society

company and themselves 
unsuspecting parents who thought they were buying nutritious 
apple juice for their babies were getting caramelcolored sugar

the new mexican santa fe nm on day care 
congress can soon be expected to get serious about day care 
the need for day care has become a national emergency as 
working parents scramble to make do with the best care they can 
find at a price they can afford 
this is not an issue just for mothers or an issue just involving 
day care it involves the way we are acquiescing to a restructuring 
of our entire economic and societal life 
the situation will not right itself until we unravel the 
economic knots we have bound ourselves in 
while we muddle with the immediate issue of day care 
legislation we ought to be taking a long view as well and bearing 
in mind that no particular future is inevitable 
we can march down a seemingly inexorable path or we can find 
new ways to create choice for the next generation of children

the supreme court today made it easier for 
people to sue in state court those public officials they accuse of 
violating federal civil rights laws 
the justices by a 72 vote reinstated a milwaukee mans 23 
million lawsuit against 10 city policemen the suit contends that 
the white officers used excessive force and falsely arrested bobby 
felder because he is black 
state courts had thrown out felders suit because he did not 
comply with a state law imposing procedural hurdles against those 
who sue state and municipal officials 
but writing for the high court today justice william j brennan 
said the wisconsin law cannot be applied when the lawsuit alleges 
violation of federal civil rights law 
the wisconsin law requires that anyone filing suit in state 
court against a state or local government official must notify the 
defendant within 120 days of the alleged injury 
the defendant then has 120 days to reach an outofcourt 
settlement if one is not reached the lawsuit may be filed within 
six months of the defendants refusal to settle 
felder sued in state court charging violations of a postcivil 
war federal law enacted to protect the rights of blacks he could 
have sued in federal court 
felder had not notified the policemen about his complaints 
within 120 days of his arrest and his case was thrown out of state 
court for that reason 
we think it plain that congress never intended that those 
injured by governmental wrongdoers could be required as a 
condition of recovery to submit their claims to the government 
responsible for their injuries brennan said 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice sandra day 
oconnor dissented 
felder became involved in a confrontation with the police on 
july 4 1981 when they stopped him for questioning outside his 
milwaukee home the police were looking for a man reported to be in 
the neighborhood 
police said felder was uncooperative and began to shout 
profanities at them as a crowd of neighbors gathered police said 
felder shoved an officer 
felder was arrested on disorderly conduct charges he said 
police officers beat him with batons and threw him into a police 
van while he was semiconscious 
the case is felder vs casey 87526

fires blamed on arab arsonists destroyed more 
than 60 acres of treasured forest in northern israel today and a 
rash of stonethrowing signaled new momentum in the 6monthold 
palestinian uprising 
prime minister yitzhak shamir called the new wave of violence an 
attempt to destroy the jewish state 
there is a wave of aggression whether arson or murder 
against the jewish presence everywhere in the land of israel 
shamir told israel army radio the problem is one of survival 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip most businesses and 
schools were shut today by a general strike called for in leaflets 
from the uprisings underground leadership 
israeli troops captured four armed palestinian guerrillas trying 
to infiltrate from south lebanon and wounded three after a brief 
firefight the army said 
it was the 15th infiltration or attempted infiltration since the 
arab uprising began dec 8 
the army said in a statement the guerrillas planned to attack 
one of israels northern settlements it said there were no 
injuries to israeli forces 
israel radio said the guerrillas were captured north of israels 
selfdeclared security zone and belonged to the prosyrian popular 
front for the liberation of palestine 
also a woman was injured when palestinians stood in the middle 
of a west bank highway and stoned a bus heading for the jewish city 
of ariel israel radio reported it said the bus also was hit by a 
firebomb but not set ablaze 
police firefighters and volunteers backed by army helicopters 
and planes were on alert for arson the uprisings leaders had 
ordered palestinians to set fire today to israels farms forests 
and factories 
eight fires erupted and all but one of those were suspicious 
police said david angel spokesman for the jewish national fund 
said that was less than the 18 average daily fires last week 
its because we had so many people out looking he said 
angel said he believed the fires wednesday were probably set or 
started by carelessness because an overnight shower and cool 
weather made spontaneous combusion unlikely 
the largest fire scorched 50 acres of woodlands in mt gilboa 
70 miles north of jerusalem some of it part of a reforestation 
program the blaze began overnight 
you see years of work go up in smoke in a few minutes 
avraham yariv head of the gilboa regional council told israel 
radio you stand helpless before this terrible sight 
yariv said the fire was obviously arson because it started in 
four places 
angel said another blaze destroyed 10 acres of woodlands near 
kfar qassem north of tel aviv this was a young forest first 
planted a couple of years ago he said 
the destruction of trees is especially painful to israelis who 
take pride in having made the desert bloom many of the trees were 
bought by american jews in memory of relatives 
police commissioner david krauss said the fires were set by 
palestinians some of them as young as 8 or 9 
in the past two months fires have destroyed 35000 acres in 
israel much of it cherished farmland and forest about 10 times 
last years total 
officials have blamed at least half the fires on the uprising 
which has claimed 210 palestinian and four israeli lives 
the arson has brought the arab revolt into israel proper and has 
been augmented by stone and firebombthrowing in israeli cities 
and highways 
two female soldiers were slightly injured in separate incidents 
tuesday when rocks smashed the windows of passenger trains near tel 
aviv and netanya also stoned smashed the windshields of two cars 
on highways around tel aviv 
some of these attacks are apparently carried out by palestinians 
working in israel as many as 140000 arabs from the occupied lands 
are employed by israelis and some live part of the time in jewish 
cities 
todays general strike was ordered in the latest in a series of 
leaflets that plobacked resistance leaders use to communicate with 
the 15 million palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip which 
israel seized during the 1967 middle east war 
in many west bank towns and cities palestinian students 
boycotted classes despite army threats to close down their schools 
which were reopened last month after a fourmonth suspension 
the military government says it will close them again if 
students fail to attend class regularly 
in the west bank city of hebron students blocked streets with 
rocks and stoned israeli troops who fired tear gas to disperse the 
demonstrators witnesses said

nadezhda nuzhnaya will bid her son and 
husband goodbye thursday and board a train for moscow this month 
the woman who paints tea sets for a living is one of the 5000 most 
important people in the soviet union 
ms nuzhnaya 36 has been chosen to represent her fellow 
communist party members in the northern ukraine at a national party 
conference the first in 47 years that will pass judgment on a 
program designed to make soviet political life more democratic 
this will be one of the most important events in my life 
the shy woman a party member since 1978 said in an interview 
but it will also be an important event for every communist for 
every citizen of our country 
mrs nuzhnaya whose candidacy was supported by coworkers in 
the porcelain factory where she has worked for 19 years is one of 
the winners in a soviet electoral process unlike any in recent 
memory but whose choices often seem to differ little from past 
party elections 
along with mrs nuzhnaya fully half of the communists chosen to 
represent the sumy region in the southeastern ukraine are party and 
government bureaucrats whose privileges and perks would be deeply 
affected if the reforms proposed for the conference are enacted 
in recent weeks protests over ballotrigging by party 
apparatchiks and some of the delegates chosen for the conference 
has brought soviet citizens into the streets from the pacific ocean 
island of sakhalin to the baltic republic of estonia 
by my estimate 90 to 95 percent of the delegates are of the 
same type that have attended past party meetings said a 
moscowbased western diplomat true the other 5 or 10 percent 
may give us some fireworks 
who exactly will attend the conference that convenes june 28 in 
the kremlin is crucial because the more than 5000 delegates will 
be asked to vote on proposals that would more firmly separate party 
from state and limit apparatchiks to two fiveyear terms in office 
in a may 7 speech mikhail s gorbachev ordered that there be no 
attempt as in the past to impose quotas from above for so many 
workers so many peasants so many woman and so on the sole 
criterion the communist party chief insisted was that delegates 
be active supporters of perestroika 
gorbachevs apparent strategy was to form an alliance with the 
grassroots party membership against the middleechelon bureaucracy 
but if the sumy region about 400 miles south of moscow is any 
indication the grip of the apparatchiks may be unshaken 
of the 24 delegates elected in the marylandsized district 
eight are local party and government bureaucrats four more hold 
posts in the armed forces and ukrainian or national governments 
including vladimir m lukyanenko soviet minister for petroleum 
machinebuilding 
there are also seven workers three economic managers and two 
collective farmers 
only the local party first secretary ivan g grintsov and the 
head of the regional soviet or government served as delegates to 
the partys 27th congress in 1986 but that may be deceptive 
at a meeting with foreign reporters this week grinstov the 
sumy areas party boss for 13 years dominated the discussion mrs 
nuzhnaya and another conference delegate lathe operator viktor 
plavich 34 said virtually nothing 
we unanimously support the theses submitted to the 
conference said grintsov 53 a stocky man with graying hair 
the two other delegates present did not demur 
mrs nuzhnaya said she did not know if she would seek to speak 
at the conference she said she backed gorbachevs campaigns for 
glasnost or openness and perestroika or economic and 
social restructuring and wanted to make the party closer to the 
citizenry 
one thing i believe is that we have to free grassroots party 
leaders from the enormous paperwork they have so they can spend 
more time with the people with party members and workers said 
mrs nuzhnaya 
many prominent proponents of perestroika have accused midlevel 
bureaucrats in the 20 millionmember party of stacking the 
candidacies to exclude them and their likeminded comrades from the 
conference 
not all primary party organizations took part in the 
elections and if they had taken place in a more democratic and 
open atmosphere then there would be more perestroika supporters 
among the delegates yuri n afanasyev a historian and 
conference delegate from moscow told a news conference in moscow 
on friday 
in sumy local party cells like that in mrs nuzhnayas 
porcelain factory first nominated 50 candidates to represent 
communists in the region which has a population of 16 million 
the regional party bureau headed by grintsov then relayed 
those names to a may 21 meeting of the local party committee held 
in the sevenstory party headquarters in sumy that session chopped 
the list down to 24 candidates and elected all of them as 
delegates 
the frunze machinebuilding works which employs more than 
25000 people and has been a showcase for gorbachevs economic 
reforms had nominated a work brigade leader svetlana yeris and 
the enterprises director alexander a voronko 
the plenum threw out ms yeris candidacy and elected voronko 
meaning that the communists at sumys single largest industry will 
not be represented by a worker but by their boss

into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in 
payoffs to obtain nobid government contracts 
the prosecution concluded by telling the jury about biaggis 
federal indictment on charges of accepting vacations paid for by 
meade esposito the former brooklyn democratic chairman in return 
for seeking favorable treatment by the navy and coast guard for a 
client of espositos insurance firm 
assistant us attorney howard wilson also told the jury tuesday 
that biaggi was convicted of accepting an unlawful gratuity but is 
appealing the verdict 
biaggi was sentenced to 30 months in prison for that conviction 
but has remained free on bail pending appeal 
us district judge constance baker motley told the jurors they 
could only consider biaggis prior conviction for determining his 
intent regarding extortion and bribery charges in the wedtech case 
prosecutors charge biaggi demanded and was given 5 percent of 
wedtechs stock and split that with his former law partner 
bernard ehrlich because of congressional rules limiting his 
outside income prosecutors contend biaggi placed his stock in the 
name of his eldest son richard who like ehrlich is a codefendant 
besides simon the other defendants are wedtech founder john 
mariotta former small business administration regional 
administrator peter neglia and neglias friend ronald betso a 
former police officer 
several witnesses including four former wedtech executives who 
pleaded guilty to corruption charges and testified in exchange for 
leniency linked biaggi with the wedtech stock 
one former wedtech chairman fred neuberger also said simon 
sought 50000 in cash charitable and campaign contributions from 
wedtech in return for his help in a city realestate transaction 
but neuberger also was forced to admit that he lied to the jury 
during the trial about hiding his assets

the supreme court in a decision that could 
carry some impact for the continuing irancontra affair 
investigation today said grand jury targets may be forced to help 
prosecutors get at their accounts in foreign banks 
the court by an 81 vote ruled that prosecutors may compel the 
target of a grand jury investigation to provide written 
authorization so foreign banks will disclose records of the 
targets accounts there 
compelling such action does not violate the constitutionally 
protected privilege against selfincrimination because providing 
written authorization is not testimonial justice harry a blackmun 
wrote for the court 
the justices rejected arguments by a man identified in court 
documents only as john doe who is under investigation by a federal 
grand jury in texas the grand jury is looking into alleged 
fraudulent manipulation of oil cargos and receipt of unreported 
income 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled in does case that 
he properly was held in contempt for refusing to authorize banks in 
the cayman islands and bermuda to provide his bank records to 
prosecutors 
todays decision upheld the 5th circuit courts ruling 
preserving the governments victory 
the ruling also could have a bearing on efforts to obtain 
foreign bank records in investigations of the irancontra affair 
the senate irancontra committee unsuccessfully sought a court 
order to compel retired air force maj gen richard secord to 
authorize the release of swiss bank records of corporations he 
headed 
the companies helped arrange the sale of us arms to iran and 
diversion of profits to nicaraguan rebels 
the senate is appealing a federal judges refusal to order 
secord to release the records 
also secords former business partner albert hakim is 
fighting an effort by independent counsel lawrence e walsh to 
subpoena records of swissbased corporations that hakim and secord 
ran that case is pending before a federal appeals court 
in todays decision blackmun said forcing doe to sign the 
authorization form does not amount to forcing him to testify 
against himself 
because the consent directive is not testimonial in nature we 
conclude that the district courts order compelling petitioner to 
sign the directive does not violate his fifth amendment privilege 
against selfincrimination blackmun said 
justice john paul stevens was the lone dissenter 
in a case dealing with a related issue the court said a 
custodian of subpoenaed corporate records may not withhold them 
from the government by claiming the act of providing the documents 
could incriminate the custodian 
by a 54 vote in a case from magnolia miss the justices said 
the subpoena must be honored even when a corporation is 
familyowned and the custodian of the records is the principle 
owner of the business 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
granting such custodians the right to withhold documents would 
jeopardize the governments fight against whitecollar crime he 
called that fight one of the most serious problems confronting 
law enforcement 
the court upheld a ruling that randy braswell head of worldwide 
machinery sales inc and worldwide purchasing inc must provide 
records the government sought in a tax investigation 
braswell is the sole officer of both corporations the only 
other corporate employee was his sisterinlaw who acted as his 
secretary 
braswells wife and mother also served nominally as directors of 
the corporations 
the internal revenue service in 1986 subpoenaed braswell to 
produce all corporate records for a federal grand jury he said the 
mere act of producing the records might tend to incriminate him in 
violation of his constitutional rights 
rehnquist was joined by blackmun stevens and justices byron r 
white and sandra day oconnor dissenting were justices anthony m 
kennedy william j brennan thurgood marshall and antonin scalia 
the case is braswell vs us 873 
the bank records case is doe vs us 861753

prime minister noboru takeshita went to the toronto 
summit seeking commitments from his economic partners on five 
points by the time the summit ended he got nearly everything he 
wanted 
the result pleased leaders here who called it a sign that japan 
is now exercising some of the clout it has won by building one of 
the worlds leading economies 
as a whole it was strongly felt that japans international 
role has heightened said keizo obuchi chief cabinet secretary 
a political cartoon in the nationwide newspaper asahi shimbun 
summed up japanese feelings toward the summit showing the 
diminutive takeshita towering over president reagan and canadian 
prime minister brian mulroney boosted in stature by recent 
agreements resolving disputes over beef and oranges and a new aid 
package for developing countries 
to ensure a cordial if not warm reception in toronto japan 
announced on the eve of the summit that it was absolving 17 of the 
poorest third world countries of 1 billion in debt in the next 
five years japan also rushed to conclude an agreement with the 
united states on beef and oranges eliminating a major source of 
trade friction 
before leaving for the summit takeshita indicated japan no 
longer was willing to take a back seat in world affairs 
seen from the international perspective it is fit that japan 
has gained the status of an economic power i believe it is my 
responsibility to assert that strength in terms of a specific role 
japan should play he said 
however takeshita also acknowledged he was a man of few words 
often content to sit in the background working for a consensus 
this has upset many japanese who think it is time for their 
country to be more assertive 
thus many imageconscious japanese were eager to see what kind 
of reception takeshita would get 
there was more than a little concern here when takeshita got 
elbowed to the edges during a formal photograph session for the 
world leaders reporters were quick to note it was the first time 
japan missed an inside spot in the official photo since former 
prime minister yasuhiro nakasone first managed to place himself 
between reagan and british prime minister margaret thatcher at the 
1983 williamsburg summit 
however any stature he might have lost in japanese eyes he 
regained at the negotiating table 
before leaving for toronto takeshita said he wanted to get 
commitments on 
coordinating economic policy 
preventing trade protectionism 
cooperation on the international debt problem 
a statement on policies toward the newly industrialized 
economies and 
a statement of support for the seoul olympics 
the final summit communique urged continued progress toward 
reducing agricultural subsidies called for special attention to 
heavily indebted countries endorsed the freemarket economics 
urged by reagan and mrs thatcher agreed on rescheduling the debt 
of the worlds poorest countries and urged constructive talks with 
the newly industrialized economies of hong kong taiwan south 
korea and singapore 
japan was praised for spurring domestic demand and urged to 
continue promoting landuse reform 
the communique did not include a statement on the olympics 
partly over concern about linking politics and sports however 
mulroney issued a special statement hours after the summit ended 
saying summit leaders expressed support for the games the 
statement came after strenuous prodding from japan 
it was a symbolic victory for takeshita who had promised asian 
leaders he would attend the conference as a regional representative 
at a news conference following the summit takeshita said he was 
happy with the declaration on newly industrialized economies and 
said he viewed the summit with a sense of fulfillment 
another major success for takeshita was something that did not 
occur at the summit the japanbashing that has preoccupied 
previous sessions 
takeshita took special steps to ensure that wouldnt happen this 
time 
in addition to initiatives on beef and oranges and foreign aid 
japan announced june 14 it was more than doubling its overseas 
development aid to at least 50 billion in the next five years 
michihiko kunihiro chief cabinet councillor for external 
affairs said takeshita also won compliments for japans recent 
success in boosting imports and narrowing its trade surpluses 
in the end he said statistics talked on our behalf

canada expelled eight soviet officials last week 
for spying on scientific technological and military targets and 
has in recent months barred nine others from returning to the 
country government sources say 
prime minister brian mulroney said tuesday that the diplomats 
and trade representatives were engaged in improper and 
unacceptable behavior 
the officials were believed to have links to both the kgb and to 
the gru intelligence organizations run by the soviet military 
government sources told the canadian press news agency on condition 
of anonymity 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov 
said the expulsions were entirely groundless and invented 
here we have an apparent provocation planned in advance that 
has nothing to do with the activity of soviet citizens in canada 
gerasimov said the provocation of the canadian authorities will 
naturally not remain without due reply 
well reply as appropriate as soon as possible gerasimov 
said when asked whether the soviets would reciprocate 
government officials in ottawa said the eight soviets expelled 
last week included two people from the soviet embassy and six 
others who held diplomatic status and were based in montreal 
the other nine completed their normal tours of duty in canada 
and returned home at various times over the last six months or so 
the sources said all have been declared persona non grata meaning 
they cannot return to canada 
the sources said the targets of the expelled soviets were 
primarily scientific and technological one told canadian press 
there were military objectives as well 
mulroney confirmed the expulsions tuesday at a final summit news 
conference when asked about them by a canadian broadcasting corp 
reporter 
i will confirm the government of canada took some action last 
week in regard to the improper and unacceptable behavior by 
representatives of the soviet government in canada he said 
mulroney said foreign minister joe clark would make a statement 
on the action in parliament today 
canadian press said the expulsions appeared not to be connected 
to the arrest last week on spying charges of stephen joseph ratkai 
a nova scotian of hungarian descent ratkai was accused of 
gathering classified us military documents from a 
submarinetracking station at argentia newfoundland 
mulroney said that despite the summits endorsement of soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs reforms western leaders are under 
no illusions about the soviet union 
spokesmen for canadian security intelligence service and 
external affairs also declined comment as did solicitor general 
james kelleher 
more than 40 diplomats from the soviet union and east european 
countries have been publicly ordered out of canada since world war

here at a glance are highlights of actions 
taken wednesday by the supreme court 
 
pension benefits 
 
the court rescuing employers from having to pay potentially 
hundreds of millions of dollars in pension benefits limited the 
application of rulings requiring equal treatment of men and women 
in the workplace 
by a 54 vote the court said the state of florida does not have 
to pay 436 million to male state workers who retired since 1972 
the justices limited the retroactive impact of a 1978 high court 
ruling that barred employers from requiring women to make higher 
contributions to pension plans because on average they live longer 
than men and thus receive greater retirement benefits 
the case is florida vs long 861685 
 
foreign bank accounts 
 
the court said in a decision that could carry some impact for 
the continuing irancontra affair investigation that grand jury 
targets may be forced to help prosecutors get at their accounts in 
foreign banks 
the court by an 81 vote ruled that prosecutors may compel the 
target of a grand jury investigation to provide written 
authorization so foreign banks will disclose records of the 
targets accounts there 
the case is doe vs us 861753 
 
corporate records 
 
the court said a custodian of subpoenaed corporate records may 
not withhold them from the government by claiming the act of 
providing the documents could incriminate the custodian 
by a 54 vote in a case from magnolia miss the justices said 
the subpoena must be honored even when a corporation is 
familyowned and the custodian of the records is the principle 
owner of the business 
the case is braswell vs us 873

death penalty law dashing the hopes of more than 260 death row 
inmates

rapist donald gene franklin properly was sentenced to death for a 
1975 crime in san antonio 
the case is franklin vs lymaugh 875546 
 
murder conviction 
 
the court upheld by a 54 vote an oklahoma mans murder 
conviction and death sentence even though the presiding judge 
wrongly refused to exclude one juror 
the justices said bobby lynn ross conviction for killing an 
oklahoma city policeman was not tainted because his lawyer used a 
peremptory challenge to oust the juror 
the case is ross vs oklahoma 865309 
 
prosecutors misconduct 
 
the court ruled that federal judges may not throw out 
indictments because of misconduct by prosecutors unless the

denver case against the bank of nova scotia and others accused of

the state departments chief spokesman 
expresed alarm today at the arrest of aides to deposed haitian 
president leslie manigat and called on the new military government 
in haiti to respect human rights 
charles e redman assistant secretary of state for public 
affairs reacted to confirmation by haitian authorities that an 
unspecified number of prisoners have been held since mondays 
military coup by lt gen henry namphy 
we find that alarming as one of the first acts of the namphy 
regime redman said of the arrests we have taken that issue up 
with haitian officials making clear that we expect strict 
respect forinternationally recognized human and civil rights 
us diplomats in haiti who have not had contact with namphy 
since the takeover voiced their concern over the arrests to lower 
level officials redman said 
meanwhile the reagan administration will continue a 36 million 
humanitarian aid program and try diplomacy to nudge the caribbean 
nations new military government toward democracy 
there is no break in the diplomatic relations were not 
contemplating it state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
said tuesday 
once again she denounced the coup as a setback for democracy 
but she and other state department officials some of whom spoke 
on condition of anonymity made clear that the united states would 
work with the new military regime 
i think there are examples of many governments around the 
world of whom we dont particularly approve with whom we have 
relations and have dealings she said 
were talking about the situation as it evolves in haiti 
were continuing the operation of our embassy there the 
spokeswoman said 
she said there are no plans to halt us humanitarian 
assistance which is distributed directly to haitians by 
nongovernmental agencies including many based in the united 
states this fiscal years plan calls for 30 million for 
development and relief programs and 6 million in the form of 
surplus american food 
a us diplomat said there was no thought of interrupting 
this assistance who would it hurt if we stopped the aid the poor 
people of haiti not the leaders 
economic sanctions also have been ruled out the diplomat said 
such sanctions would hurt the estimated 40000 haitians who have 
jobs assembling products for american markets these 40000 people 
in turn each support an average of five other people he said 
haiti has the lowest per capita income in the western hemisphere 
about 60 million in direct us assistance to the haitian 
government was suspended last november and will remain frozen 
the reaction to events in haiti are in stark contrast to what 
the united states did in an analogous case the removal of 
panamanian president eric delvalle by military chief manuel antonio 
noriega earlier this year 
that sparked swift action by the reagan administration which 
continued to recognize delvalle as the legitimate leader of the 
country and imposed massive economic sanctions on panama in an 
effort to drive noriega from office the effort has failed 
a state department official said that before acting in the 
noriega case the administration took into account the longstanding 
relationship between the united states and panama and we saw a 
significant element of dissatisfaction among the people of panama 
that we thought could be translated into his noriegas downfall 
the united states appears to have less influence among the 
people of haiti which had been a virtual hemispheric outcast for 
decades under the dictatorship of francois duvalier and his son 
jean claude duvalier who fled the country in february 1986 
haiti is so poor economically and inexperienced in the formation 
of democratic institutions that tough measures would have little 
impact the official said 
namphy is immune to certain kinds of pressure because he 
doesnt have much to lose the official said haiti is already 
at the bottom 
the official also noted there has been little pressure on 
capitol hill for tough measures against the new haitian regime 
while in the case of panama many members of congress called for 
stern action

a school administrators group unveiled a 
manual wednesday to help teach superintendents how to get the most 
out of their schools 
the guide challenges for school leaders summarizes advice 
from national reports on school reform and from such bibles of 
modern business techniques as in search of excellence by thomas 
peters and robert waterman 
the study by the american association of school administrators 
singled out six key challenges for superintendents and other school 
leaders sharing decisionmaking attracting and rewarding good 
teachers curriculum leadership educating the disadvantaged 
forging partnerships with businesses and other organizations and 
promoting greater parental involvement 
richard miller president of the association told a news 
conference that strong leadership is essential for effective 
schools 
if things are going to happen it will happen largely because 
of the expertise or lack thereof of the leadership that exists on a 
site level or on a systemwide level he said 
he took exception to education secretary william j bennetts 
characterization of public school administrators as a blob that 
grows even when enrollment shrinks 
miller said however it is vital to provide more leadership 
training for school executives because more than half the existing 
administrators are expected to retire or leave the profession in 
the next seven years 
strong superintendents already are moving to give teachers a 
larger role in decisionmaking and to give local schools wider 
authority to manage their own affairs miller said 
bennett has also suggested that schools experiment with hiring 
business executives and other leaders from outside the education 
establishment to run public schools 
it would be interesting if we could take a lee iacocca or ross 
perot and give them the same resources and the same regulations 
that richard greene as chancellor of the new york city schools 
operates under to see how effective they could be miller said 
the report quotes management expert peter drucker as writing 
that effective executives do not make a great many decisions 
they concentrate on the important ones they try to think through 
what is strategic and generic rather than solve problems

syria has located the place in lebanon where 15 
foreign hostages are believed held by iranianbacked guerrillas 
the independent newspaper reported today 
the london daily quoted unidentified syrian intelligence 
officers as saying the hostages are imprisoned inside the hay madi 
barracks of hezbollah or party of god in beiruts southern 
suburbs 
the report could not be independently confirmed 
in washington state department spokesman charles e redman said 
that report is not new we have never been able to confirm the 
exact location of the hostages and we cannot confirm this latest 
report 
although information on the hostages is conflicting and rarely 
reliable we have always believed that some of them are in beiruts 
southern suburbs we continue to pursue all leads about the 
hostages 
the independent said the syrian officers are convinced the 
hostages and their kidnappers are bottled up in an area no more 
than 1000 yards square and that there is no possibility of the 
captors moving out 
but the syrians also acknowledged that the hostages cannot be 
rescued by force and that negotiations are needed with hezbollah a 
proiranian shiite moslem militant faction if the hostages are 
to be extricated alive wrote correspondent john bulloch 
the barracks is situated close to the line dividing 
hezbollahcontrolled territory from the chiyah suburb dominated by 
the prosyrian amal militia the newspaper said 
amal and hezbollah guerrillas had been fighting for control of 
lebanons slums until a ceasefire was called in may 
the report said the singlestory building is guarded by about 
250 men including iranian revolutionary guards and contains three 
sections including a closed section for special guards who 
give the orders 
the newspaper quoted unidentified intelligence officers in 
beirut as saying us marine lt col william r higgins 43 who 
was kidnapped near tyre on feb 17 was moved to the barracks 
before the syrian army entered south beirut last month 
the syrians entered the slums as part of the ceasefire 
agreement between amal and hezbollah 
the syrians established the hostages whereabouts from 
observation and tipoffs and from amal fighters captured during 
fighting with the hezbollah who were later released in prisoner 
exchanges the report said 
eighteen foreigners including nine americans are missing in 
lebanon the longestheld hostage is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent of the associated press who was kidnapped in 
beirut on march 16 1985 
anderson was also reportedly among the hostages in the barracks 
the three hostages reportedly missing from the barracks were 
alec collett 66 a british citizen and two other hostages of 
unknown nationality 
collett a new yorkbased journalist was kidnapped march 25 
1985 while traveling south of beirut on april 23 1986 the 
revolutionary organization of socialist moslems said it killed 
collett in retaliation for british complicity in the april 15 us 
air attack on libya a videotape purporting to show collett hanged 
was made public 
the two unidentified hostages were kidnapped on jan 26 1987

sparks from a makeshift food stall were 
blamed wednesday for a fire that killed 47 christian pilgrims most 
of them children who had camped outside a monastery to pay homage 
to the virgin mary 
hundreds of tents lay in smoldering heaps in the wake of the 
tuesday night blaze fed by exploding butane lamps 
witnesses said monks quickly closed almuharraq monasterys 
massive front door after the fire broke out and some of the dead 
were trampled as panicking pilgrims rushing to the door turned back 
toward a gate in the fence around the campground 
about 5000 pilgrims were at the monastery for the feast of the 
consecration of the church of the virgin 
held every june 2128 the feast commemorates the farthest south 
that the holy family reached in its flight to save the infant jesus 
from king herods order that newborn boys in palestine should be 
slain the monastery is built on the cave in mount qousqam where 
coptic christian lore says joseph mary and jesus were sheltered 
the church called the church of the cave has its altar atop a 
stone where the holy family is said to have rested the altar is 
dated 747 
neither the church nor the monastery a 10acre compound with 70 
to 80 monks in residence was damaged in the tentcity fire 
a senior provincial security officer for assiut the governorate 
capital 240 miles south of cairo said 26 children 15 men and six 
women died from burns smoke inhalation or from being trampled he 
said 15 others were injured trying to escape 
the blaze began when sparks from the food stall which provided 
pilgrims with tea coffee and sandwiches set afire nearby tents 
he said this in turn ignited about three dozen butane lamps said 
the officer who spoke on condition he not be identified 
the officer said the stands two owners both copts were 
arrested but that the fire clearly was an accident 
there was a big rush from the pilgrims toward the main gate of 
the camp some children fell and were trampled to death he said 
a survivor who appeared dazed said eight pieces of 
firefighting equipment arrived from nearby villages but not until 
a full hour after the fire started he said there was no water 
at the tent city to fight the blaze 
a preliminary police report estimated damage at 420000 
several of the burned tents were occupied by merchants catering to 
the pilgrims many of whom were camped for the duration of the 
religious festival or moulid 
in egypt such festivals are common among both moslems almost 
90 percent of the 54 million egyptians and coptic christians 
whose ancestors gave to the world the concept of monasticism 
unlike most monasteries whose ascetic founders in the first 
years of christianity usually wandered away into the desert for 
solitude almuharraq monastery is relatively accessible it is in 
alqusiyyah near a welltraveled route and the nile river about 35 
miles north of assiut 
moreover because of its importance to the copts as the 
southernmost haven for the holy family in egypt its moulid is 
among the most famous in the coptic orthodox church founded by st 
mark 
almuharraq formerly was called the virgin mary monastery anba 
sarabion the coptic bishop for public services in cairo said it 
took its current name apparently because of the reddish color of 
the rocks in the area the name means the burnt monastery

the house foreign affairs committee gave 
partyline approval wednesday to a bill designed to tighten 
congressional control over foreign covert intelligence action 
after defeating a republican attempt to ease the restrictions 
the 2217 vote sends the bill to the full house where it is 
expected to be passed later this summer it remains unclear 
however whether the measure will attract enough support to counter 
an almost certain presidential veto 
the bill which grew out of the congressional irancontra 
hearings last year would spell out more specifically how a 
president must notify the house and senate intelligence oversight 
committees when he authorizes a covert action 
such actions are defined as government activities designed to 
influence political economic or military conditions abroad while 
concealing the us role 
under the proposal a version of which already has been passed 
by the senate the president would be required to report any covert 
action to the intelligence committees within 48 hours of its 
authorization 
in extremely sensitive cases the president could limit 
notification to a socalled gang of eight the chairman and 
ranking minority member of the house and senate intelligence 
committees and the majority and minority leaders of each chamber 
current law requires only that the president give an undefined 
timely notice to congress and the irancontra investigators 
concluded that president reagan exploited the loophole to put off 
notification on the iran armsforhostages deals for more than 10 
months 
foreign affairs chairman dante fascell dfla a member of the 
irancontra investigating panel called the bill a modest but 
appropriate adjustment in the current law 
the democraticdominated panel defeated 1913 an amendment by 
rep william broomfield rmich that would have limited 
notification in sensitive cases to only the minority and majority 
leaders of the two chambers and would have let the president waive 
the 48hour notification limit in rare extraordinary 
circumstances where national security was at stake 
arguing for the amendment rep henry hyde rill a member of 
the house intelligence committee noted cases in which other 
countries had come to the united states for help in a covert action 
but asked that congress not be notified because of a perception 
that lawmakers cant keep secrets 
he cited cases in which an algerian effort several years ago to 
damage the standing of libyas moammar gadhafi was blown by an 
apparent us leak to the news media and where covert aid to 
philippine president corazon aquino to combat communist rebels was 
disclosed in a news report 
but rep lee hamilton dind a former intelligence committee 
chairman who headed the house irancontra panel said the 
legislation is necessary to ensure that congress can exert a 
balancing effect on administration decision making he said that 
need outweighs the risk of occasional leaks 
if you grant the president power to withhold information the 
whole oversight process is irreparably damaged hamilton said 
information in this town is power 
the panel also defeated 1310 an attempt by rep gerald 
solomon rny to impose criminal penalties on government 
officials who leak classified national security information

companies contemplating a 1990s version of the 
name game might be well advised to stick with the old and 
familiar 
an illconceived name chance can hurt a company says landor 
associates a san franciscobased consulting firm 
landor recently asked 1000 consumers in shopping malls in 12 
cities to rate 672 different names in terms of familiarity and 
esteem 
sara lee ranked in the top 15 percent in the latest survey that 
was a marked improvement from the days when it was known as 
consolidated foods and ranked in the bottom 10 percent of the 
landor sample 
allegheny airlines once ranked in the bottom 20 percent in the 
landor survey but placed in the top 40 percent after changing its 
name to usair 
in the 90s major corporations will rediscover the raw image 
power of their established names and may find it much more 
efficient to modify or add meaning to them rather than start from 
scratch said landor president john diefenbach 
the survey said consumers scoff at some of the hightech names 
such as usx primerica and unisys 
the old names of those corporations us steel american can 
and the premerger burroughs and sperry each had placed higher in 
previous surveys 
the message is very simple diefenbach said meaningless 
names and symbols can confuse and alienate the consumer

driver and passengerside air bags will be 
standard equipment on 1989 lincoln continentals ford motor co 
announced wednesday in a move that safety advocates said will 
trigger adoption of the restraint system throughout the auto 
industry 
this is the final event that will make the air bag inevitable 
as a standard safety feature in american automobiles ralph nader 
said following fords announcement 
fords plan will make it the first us automaker to offer air 
bags as standard equipment on both sides of the front seat west 
germanys porsche since 1987 has offered twin air bags as standard 
equipment on some models 
helen petrauskas ford vice president for environmental and 
safety engineering told reporters that safety has become a quality 
that sells among car buyers 
the safety race is in high gear she said oldfashioned 
word of mouth about safety features will provide the biggest 
spark for selling safety 
the continentals airbag system will have four sensors on the 
front of the car to trigger the air bags in the event of a frontal 
crash equivalent to a 25 mph collision with a parked car said 
robert munson director of the ford automotive safety office 
the system is designed to be used with seat belts not to 
replace them 
the air bags inflate with nitrogen gas in 125th of a second and 
deflate immediately design of the passengerside air bag was 
difficult technically because the bag must cover both the window 
and center positions of the front seat and also must travel a 
greater distance on inflating ford said 
the company had no firm estimate of how much the air bags would 
add to the cost of the continental ford said each bag would cost 
the company 300 to 350 
ford in 1985 made driverside air bags standard equipment on its 
tempo and topaz models the automakers 1990 line will have 11 
models with standard driverside air bags with projected sales of 
1 million petrauskas said 
the company last year successfully opposed a federal regulation 
to require air bags on both sides of cars not equipped with 
automatic seat belts petrauskas said the delay in the requirement 
allowed the company to install driverside bags without waiting for 
development of passengerside bags 
besides ford chrysler corp has adopted air bags for some 
models the company in may said driverside air bags would be 
standard equipment on six models built this year and by 1990 on 
all models built in the united states 
general motors corp the nations largest automaker in 1988 
offered driverside air bags as an option on one model the number 
will be expanded to five in 1989 and the next year 500000 gmmade 
cars will have driverside air bags as standard equipment gm 
spokesman don postma said in detroit 
the center for auto safety a consumers group that monitors the 
auto industry said only honda among the japanese automakers offers 
an air bag as standard equipment on any model 
nader criticized other automakers for not keeping up with ford 
and chrysler in safety features 
it is not nice to see gm and the japanese automakers lagging 
behind nader said theyre jeopardizing their customers 
lives

submarine hunters believe they hit and 
probably damaged a foreign submarine prowling off southern sweden 
earlier this month the military said wednesday 
a search of the area failed to produce evidence of damage and 
the intruding ship apparently escaped said an armed forces 
statement 
the incident was one of nine livefire engagements in the last 
two months between the antisubmarine warfare unit and suspected 
foreign vessels from unidentified countries 
on two of those occasions the sub hunters found they had blasted 
submarineshaped rocks said armed forces spokesman hg wessberg 
sweden has reported underwater snoopers every summer for the 
last decade it refuses to say whom it suspects for the violations 
of its territorial waters 
but it has accused the soviet union twice once in 1981 when a 
soviet sub grounded near swedens largest naval base at karlskrona 
and after a series of incidents the following year moscow has 
denied it has recently intruded into swedish waters 
the military statement its first communique issued since the 
incidents also indicated that the rulesofengagement were being 
relaxed to give commanders on the scene the power to decide when to 
open fire 
this is necessary to get results and at the same time to 
increase the risk for an intruding power the statement said 
our antisubmarine activities have continuously improved it 
said 
ship commanders previously needed higher authority to open fire 
and were required to warn suspected intruders that they could be 
fired upon 
defense analysts believe neutral sweden is growing more 
important in the war planning of both the nato alliance and the 
warsaw pact as both sides focus more attention on the naval theater 
of the northern seas 
the swedishdanish straits control the bottleneck into the 
baltic sea along which the soviet union has a network of dry docks 
for maintenance and repair 
in one incident two weeks ago wessberg said the sub hunters 
opened up on an intruder with more firepower than sweden has ever 
been used against a single target at sea 
the prowler was detected and trapped in 282 feet of water near 
the gustav dalen lighthouse off the city of oxelsund about 60 
miles south of stockholm he said in an interview 
contact was lost amid the noise of exploding depth charges and 
underwater grenades and the sub apparently slipped away in the 
roil of water 
when we played back the tapes we saw that the submarine was 
exactly where we thought it was wessberg said adding that 
its probable the ship was damaged 
in other incidents this year the navy detonated remotecontrol 
mines lacing the waters around sensitive bases but failed to score 
any hits he said the navy was investigating the why the intruders 
escaped apparently unharmed he said 
earlier this year the government approved a special allocation 
for the unit of 83 million and an extra ship it was the third 
time since 1980 that extra money was earmarked for the unit 
bringing the total to 333 million 
the unit is comprised of two swedishmade corvettes 12 
submarines 7 minedetector vessels 16 patrol boats and 12 
sonarequipped helicopters wessberg said

of ballistic missiles 
especially disturbing are sales to such regional hot spots as 
the middle east we have raised these concerns with china and other 
countries he said 
the chinese have exhibited their m family of 
surfacetosurface shortrange ballistic missiles at arms shows we 
would view the sale of such missiles to syria with deep concern as 
we would proliferation of other ballistic missile systems redman 
said 
he noted that the us concern about missile proliferation in 
the middle east was raised with the soviets during president 
reagans summit trip to moscow 
the united states also has complained to china about sales of 
longrange ballistic missiles to saudi arabia

communist party was chosen prime minister wednesday radio hanoi

assembly session the broadcast monitored in bangkok said he 
replaces pham hung who died of a heart attack in march 
do muoi 71 is the thirdranking member of the politburo the 
nations top policymaking body 
a party communique meanwhile said the party has decided to 
regularly change its leadership to promote efficiency and economic 
reforms 
the communique of the central committees recent session said 
that when the party elects members to its upper echelons onethird 
of the membership should be changed 
the central committee is the policyimplementing arm of the 
13member politburo it had 124 full members and 49 alternate 
members when it was elected in december 1986 
at the national assembly session vo van kiet who had been 
acting premier noted among other serious economic problems an 
acute food shortage in the northern provinces since early this 
year vietnam has appealed for foreign emergency aid to offset the 
shortages caused by crop failures last year 
kiet said that because production stagnated as the population 
grew the amount of food available per capita in those provinces 
dropped from 581 pounds in 1982 to 506 pounds in 1987 
he called for continuation of economic reforms based on 
decentralized management and material incentives according to the 
official vietnam news agency

the no 2 man in the party secretariat where he is said to have 
directed a purge of inept and corrupt elements in the 18

government posts during the struggle against the french 
colonialists and then the americans and south vietnamese 
in several top economyrelated government posts after the 1975 
communist victory do muoi helped forge the strict marxist policies 
which the party now says led to vietnams ruin 
southerners are said to resent him for having led a disastrous 
effort in 1978 at socialist transformation of the private 
business and commerce in the traditionally capitalist south 
vietnamese sources had said do muoi was the most likely choice 
as premier because of his reputation as a party organizer and 
disciplinarian 
some western diplomats have said the choice of do muoi would 
send a wrong signal to the average vietnamese who preferred acting 
premier vo van kiet 66 a leading pioneer of economic reform the 
selection of do muoi could slow down the reform momentum the 
hanoibased diplomats said 
the pragmatic party chief nguyen van linh called for the 
continuation of purges begun since he took power in december 1986 
according to a partial text of his speech obtained from a western 
embassy in bangkok on wednesday 
since the party was founded in 1930 its leaders have largely 
been veterans of the revolutionary struggle against the french 
americans and south vietnam lately the party has given top 
priority to economic reform and said that incompetent 
conservativethinking members can no longer remain in top posts

a 13yearold girl who survived a 
fiery bustruck accident that killed 27 people has sent a message 
of forgiveness to the driver charged with murder in the case 
katrina muller recorded her thoughts on tape and said afterward 
that she didnt know if larry mahoney should be put to death or 
not but he should be punished 
mahoney 34 allegedly was drunk and driving the wrong way on 
interstate 71 near carrollton last month when his pickup truck 
collided with the bus loaded with youngsters returning from a 
cincinnati amusement park to a church in radcliff 
two days later mahoney was booked on 27 counts of murder and a 
commonwealths attorney said he would seek the death penalty 
katrina made the tape and sent it june 3 while still 
hospitalized in louisville and undergoing three skin graft 
operations her face right arm and both hands were burned badly in 
the fire that followed the may 14 collision 
she was released from the hospital saturday 
the tape is now at the kentucky correctional psychiatric 
center where larry is being evaluated said one of his attorneys 
russell baldani of lexington 
baldani said he checked wednesday with mahoney and he hasnt 
heard the cassette but he knows about it from his family im going 
to talk with the centers director tomorrow at lagrange to see if 
he will release it to us 
the teenagers mother mickie muller said the idea for the 
tape came during one of those days when katrina was having a lot 
of pain this was in the midst of some of the worst time she was 
having 
she recalled her daughter saying i wish larry mahoney was 
right here in front of me i would tell him i forgive him and maybe 
itd make him feel better 
mrs muller said that on the tape katrina introduced herself 
and told him some things about herself just to make herself not 
just a statistic but a real person 
aware of reports that mahoney had become a bornagain christian 
mrs muller said katrina hoped that the rumor was true 
just keep on doing right katrina said to mahoney and 
then when its your time to go then youll be with the children 
whove go on before most of the victims were teenagers 
katrina also sent along a photograph taken of herself before the 
crash 
mrs muller said i cant honestly say im not still angry with 
larry mahoney not as a person but as a drunk driver but thats 
all right too the bible says to be angry and sin not 
despite her anger she said she still could forgive

a falloff in aircraft orders caused a 22 
percent plunge in overall orders to us factories for big 
ticket durable goods in may the steepest drop in nine months 
the government said wednesday 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years totaled a seasonally adjusted 
1148 billion last month down from 1174 billion in april 
economists who had expected more than a 2 percent rise in 
orders were suprised but noted that the governments survey 
apparently did not include several multibilliondollar orders 
placed to seattlebased boeing co 
even though the overall may decline was the largest since 
augusts 23 percent fall analysts saw little cause to worry that 
the report was forecasting a significant decline in manufacturing 
which has been booming as the cheaper dollar bolsters export sales 
of us goods 
transportation orders which includes aircraft fell 9 percent 
to 286 billion following a 02 percent increase in april 
military orders another category which swings widely from month to 
month was down 166 percent to 83 billion in may after rising 
19 percent in april 
excluding defense goods orders fell only 09 percent excluding 
airplanes they rose 06 percent 
its really not a report of great consequence in terms of 
showing any fundamental weakness in the manufacturing sector 
said jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national association 
of manufacturers 
before may durable goods orders rose three months running the 
april increase which previously had been pegged at 10 percent 
was revised on wednesday to a stronger 18 percent 
i think what were seeing is what we want to see which is 
continued growth but maybe some moderation of the pace said 
cynthia latta senior financial economist of data resources inc a 
lexington mass consulting firm 
the financial markets and the white house read the report as 
good news for inflation many traders and some analysts have been 
concerned that the export boom coupled with steady consumer demand 
in the united states would strain manufacturers capacity and 
cause shortages and price increases 
rallies in early trading wednesday on both the stock and bond 
markets was attributed to a rise in the value of the dollar and to 
the durable goods report 
white house spokesman b jay cooper said the report offered 
more news that inflation remains under control it is good news 
the key category of nondefense capital goods considered a sign 
of business expansion plans fell 69 percent last month following 
increases of 34 percent in april and 38 percent in march 
despite the setback in may analysts still expect 
exportproducing manufacturers to spend heavily on modernization 
and expansion at the current rate of shipment capital goods 
manufacturers would need five months to eliminate their order 
backlog even if they received no new orders 
orders for primary metals such as steel zoomed 55 percent 
following a 16 percent rise in april 
orders for electrical machinery also posted a strong gain 35 
percent following a 50 percent rise a month before 
there was a 24 percent decline in orders for nonelectrical 
machinery more than erasing a 12 percent gain in april 
shipments of durable goods rose 15 percent in may to 1144 
billion following a 09 percent decline in april the backlog of 
unfilled orders edged up only 01 percent to 4054 billion

we handle almost on a weekly basis conventions that large and

well and i think atlanta and georgia are going to do the same 
thing he said

the 10 films will be chosen from a field of 30 nominated by each 
side and will be shown in five us and soviet cities said the

cinematography

a car bomb in christian east beirut 
killed one person and wounded 18 on wednesday while palestinian 
militias battled in the citys refugee camps in a power struggle 
that has claimed more than 50 lives 
a police spokesman said a green sedan loaded with 44 pounds of 
explosives detonated at 11 am in a narrow alley in the karantina 
district 
the blast set six shops on fire and damaged eight cars parked 
nearby according to the spokesman who asked not to be identified 
wednesdays explosion raised the death toll from six car 
bombings in lebanon this year to 94 people killed and 251 wounded 
the lebanese forces the main rightwing christian militia that 
controls east beirut said explosives experts defused another car 
bomb in karantina minutes before it was to explode the lebanese 
forces said in a statement that the car contained a 22pound time 
bomb 
the second car bomb was meant to explode shortly after the first 
one to inflict as many casualties as possible among rescuers 
the statement said 
police could not confirm there was a second car bomb 
the lebanese forces blamed the recent bombings in east beirut on 
a rival militia force led by elie hobeika a syrianbacked 
christian leader 
the leader of the lebanese forces samir geagea ousted hobeika 
as the militias commander in a bloody rebellion in january 1986 
after hobeika signed a syrianbrokered peace treaty with rival 
moslem warlords in lebanon 
hobeika then set up a base in the syriancontrolled bekaa valley 
also in moslem south beirut on wednesday police spokesman said 
five people were killed and 18 wounded in clashes between yasser 
arafats fatah guerrilla faction and col saeed mousas 
syrianbacked fatahuprising 
mousa broke away from arafats palestine liberation organization 
in 1983 and set up headquarters in damascus the syrian capital 
the casualties raised the death toll to 51 people killed and 206 
since the latest round of fighting between the two palestinian 
militias erupted 13 days ago 
the factions are fighting for control of the devastated chatilla 
and bourj elbarajneh camps both sides are using howitzers 
rockets and mortars to pound each others positions in the camps 
already badly battered from years of violence 
a fatah spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity accused 
unidentified other sides of supporting mousas fighters with 
artillery fire from positions in syrianpoliced west beirut 
arafats guerrillas dislodged mousas followers from the two 
camps on beiruts southern outskirts in earlier battles but the 
dissidents regrouped in syriancontrolled territory along the edges 
of the shantytowns 
libyan mediators and other palestinian factions have failed to 
secure a ceasefire to end the fighting 
arafats loyalists and mousas dissidents have been fighting for 
supremacy in the camps despite a reconciliation between the plo 
chief and syrian president hafez assad in damascus in april 
their efforts were aimed at ending the often bloody 5yearold 
feud over who would control the palestinian movement 
the battles between rival palestinian factions have been fanned 
by arafats chief spokesman who has said that the plo is prepared 
to live in peace with israel 
the unusually conciliatory statement by bassam abu sharif 
initially circulated earlier this month and repeated again monday 
on the front page of beiruts leftist assafir newspaper led to 
the collapse of a fourday truce in the camps battle 
the statement which sharif labeled a policy breakthrough 
said 
the means by which the israelis want to achieve a lasting 
peace and security is through direct talks with no attempts by any 
outside party to impose or veto a settlement the palestinians 
agree 
the palestinians would accept indeed insist on 
international guarantees for the security of all states in the 
region 
the plo backed by the arab world wants an independent homeland 
in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip where the 
israelis have been fighting to quell a 6monthold palestinian 
uprising 
arafat himself has yet to publicly endorse sharifs statement 
which was first circulated at the algiers arab summit earlier this 
month without abu sharifs signature

pope john paul ii on wednesday issued a plea 
for unity within the roman catholic church as archbishop marcel 
lefebvres continued defiance threatened a schism with the vatican 
lefebvre on tuesday reaffirmed his decision to elevate four 
priests among his traditionalist followers to bishops rank in a 
ceremony on june 30 
creating bishops without papal permission is against the 
churchs canon 
the 82yearold frenchman has rebelled for two decades against 
the reforms enacted by the vatican after the second vatican council 
of 196265 which simplified and modernized the roman catholic 
liturgy 
john paul has given lefebvre permission to consecrate only one 
bishop aug 15 the vatican has also formally warned lefebvre that 
he would be automatically excommunicated if he goes ahead with his 
consecration plan 
in these days we are particularly worried for the unity of the 
holy church in the faithfulness to the revealed truth the pope 
told 13000 people who attended his weekly audience at the vatican 
lets return to the prayer of christ who during the last 
supper exhorted his disciples to be one when we say the our 
father at the end of this audience lets recite it with this 
particular intention john paul told the audience 
a showdown that might cause the first schism in the church in 
more than 100 years has loomed since lefebvre reneged on a may 5 
protocol that called for compromises by both the vatican and the 
traditionalists 
under the protocol lefebvre would have promised to be faithful 
to the church and pope and to accept the teachings of the second 
vatican council 
in 1976 pope paul vi barred lefebvre from saying mass and 
giving the sacraments but the archbishop has ordained more than 
200 priests who continue to use the 16th century tridentine mass a 
latin rite for which special permission is required his movement 
claims millions of followers worldwide 
lefebvre founded the traditionalist st pius x fraternity based 
in switzerland and named after piux x who was pope in 190314 and 
who condemned religious modernism

a house panel on wednesday approved a 400 
millionayear aids testing and counseling bill that includes stiff 
penalties for breaching the confidentiality of a patients test 
results 
the bill in the works for a year before the house energy and 
commerce committee would give grants to states and to clinics 
health centers and hospitals to expand testing programs it would 
require posttest counseling to all who take the test for the fatal 
disease whether they were infected or not 
the committee sent the bill to the house floor on a voice vote 
after sponsors took out a section banning discrimination against 
people with aids or the virus that causes it 
the broad privatesector nondiscrimination policy was 
clearly too controversial for the current political climate said 
rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of the committees health 
panel 
rep ron wyden dore called the omission a terrible public 
health mistake he said those most likely to have and transmit 
aids would be reluctant to come in for tests if they could lose 
their jobs insurance or housing on the basis of the results 
the presidents commission on aids recently recommended a 
federal policy banning discrimination against victims of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome wyden said he would use the 
recommendation in an attempt to build bipartisan support for 
restoring the provision on the house floor 
however waxman said he was pessimistic about the chances of 
winning back the ban on discrimination unless president reagan 
specifically backs the panels recommendation 
we need the president not the presidents commission he 
said without it reagans support i cant see that members are 
going to be willing to vote for it have the courage to vote for 
it in an election year 
waxman also said elimination of the discrimination portion 
removes the biggest objection that some of the rightwingers 
have and makes it much less likely that the bill would be blocked 
in the senate where it is pending in a committee 
in work sessions tuesday and wednesday the committee rejected a 
long series of amendments sponsored by rep william dannemeyer 
rcalif most of them proposals that had failed earlier in 
waxmans subcommittee 
among them were attempts to require testing of all prisoners 
marriage license applicants and hospital admittees the bill does 
require that states test people convicted of prostitution sexual 
assault or crimes related to intravenous drug abuse in order to 
qualify for federal testing and counseling money 
dannemeyer also failed to win approval of a requirement that 
people with aids or the aids virus be reported to authorities by 
name the bill requires that cases be reported with statistical and 
demographic information but does not require identifying 
information 
other unsuccessful dannemeyer amendments would have reduced from 
10000 to 2000 the maximum fine for intentional or negligent 
violation of confidentiality required states to outlaw gay 
bathhouses in order to receive money and required doctors to 
notify spouses sex partners or iv needle partners if the patient 
didnt notify them within a reasonable period 
the last was rejected after members of both parties said the 
bill already exempts doctors from confidentiality requirements in 
such situations they said a notification requirement would

the acne drug accutane which can cause birth 
defects in pregnant women prevents skin cancer in people at 
extremely high risk of the common malignancy a study concludes 
experts cautioned that the treatment is too toxic to be used 
routinely by most people who are afraid of skin cancer but they 
said it raises the possibility that similar drugs may someday be 
given safely to prevent this and other forms of cancer 
until now medicines have been given almost exclusively to 
attack cancers once they occur rather than to prevent them 
this is the first study that has scientifically proven in 
humans that skin cancer can be prevented by any means said dr 
howard koh of boston university school of medicine we use sun 
screens because they should work but we still have not rigorously 
proven in a scientific way that skin cancer can be prevented with 
that method sun is considered the main cause of skin cancer 
however he cautioned that the study conducted on just five 
people is very small and it is unclear whether the findings will 
apply to those at lower risk of skin cancer 
dr kenneth h kraemer who directed the research at the 
national cancer institute believes the study could represent a 
step toward cancer prevention 
he noted that accutane is one of more than 2000 synthetic forms 
of vitamin a and some of these could prove safe and effective for 
routine use in warding off skin cancer in lowrisk people 
you are better off preventing it by avoiding the sun at the 
beginning kraemer said but if that isnt the case this is an 
indication that drugs may be developed to prevent the progression 
of the damage to cancer 
the study was conducted on victims of xeroderma pigmentosum an 
inherited skin disorder that occurs in about one in 1 million 
people their skin is unable to repair genetic damage caused by 
sunlight and they are more than 1000 times more likely than the 
average to get basal cell or squamous cell cancer of the skin 
in the general population these are the most common kinds of 
cancer striking about 500000 people in the united states each 
year these tumors which are usually curable occur most 
frequently in lightskinned people 
in the study published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine five patients took high doses of accutane for two years 
doctors compared the number of tumors before during and after 
treatment in the two years before taking accutane the five 
patients had a total of 121 tumors while on the drug they had 25 
when the drug was stopped they had nearly a ninefold increase in 
the frequency of tumors 
but side effects caused two people of the seven who started in 
the study to drop out one had high levels of blood fats while the 
other showed signs of liver abnormalities 
the researchers currently are checking to see if a dose 
onequarter as large will work as well but be less hazardous 
kraemer said high doses of accutane could be warranted for some 
people such as sailors and farmers who have frequent skin cancers 
because of their lifelong exposure to the sun 
accutane known generically as isotretinoin is already widely 
used to treat severe acne because of its possible danger for 
pregnant women the us food and drug administration last month 
ordered its maker hoffmanla roche to warn customers by printing 
a picture of a deformed baby on the drugs packaging 
at least two other studies using accutane to treat precancerous 
ailments have been published over the last two years one showed 
that the drug clears up oral leukoplakia precancerous white 
patches in the mouth that are common among smokers the other found 
that it improved the survival of people with myelodysplastic 
syndrome a preleukemic disorder 
some experts also believe that beta carotene the form of 
vitamin a found in food helps prevent cancer 
dr harley haynes of brigham and womens hospital in boston said 
that vitamin a drugs similar to accutane may someday be used to 
treat other tumors of epithelial tissue such as cancers of the 
lung stomach colon bladder cervix and breast

dissidents within the nicaraguan contras assembled 
wednesday to demand drastic leadership changes as the usbacked 
rebel group prepares for massive layoffs and cutbacks 
contra director pedro joaquin chamorro backed the dissident 
former military commanders at an unprecedented miami headquarters 
news conference apparently widening the split in the movement 
against the sandinista government of nicaragua 
the six commanders and their supporters many of whom were fired 
by rebel military chief col enrique bermudez stopped short of a 
full break with the contra umbrella organization the nicaraguan 
resistance instead they announced the formation of a new 
current within the group 
chamorro denied the open split hurts the image of the 
financially strapped contras just as the reagan administration goes 
back to congress to ask for more aid in march congress adopted a 
limited 479 million budget limited to humanitarian aid 
what hurts the image of unity is to marginalize people who 
have so much support inside the movement said chamorro it 
hurts the image to throw them out in the street like dogs 
chamorro confirmed that massive administrative layoffs are being 
planned but refused to give details saying only that as many as 
400 people in rebel political offices in miami washington latin 
america and europe might be affected 
contra spokeswoman marta sacasa said the cuts would not affect 
troops in the field or financial support for their families and 
were part of a wholesale restructuring of the rebel 
organization 
chamorro said the dissidents formation of a group was no 
different from the shifting alliances within the directorate 
itself which has been bitterly divided since peace talks began 
with the sandinista government he said 
the dissidents wednesday demanded total restructuring and 
renovation of the movement accusing the directors of serving us 
interests instead of those of nicaragua 
we want the resistance be open to everyone and not subject 
the interests of the nicaraguan people to foreign pressure said 
diogeenese hernandez known as commander fernando 
hernandez said new faces in the sixmember directorate would 
be healthy but did not specify any names 
he once again called for the removal of bermudez as he and the 
other commanders did when they were expelled from the military but 
the dissidents offered a conciliatory solution to bermudezs 
departure suggesting he be elected to the empty seat in the 
directorate which would force him to resign as commander of the 
rebel forces 
the commanders strongly backed the peace talks with the 
sandinistas although they accused the nicaraguan government of 
failing to fulfill its commitments under the ceasefire agreements 
chamorro said no date has been set for the next round of talks

president reagan still wants global farm 
subsidies eliminated by the year 2000 despite the economic 
summits more moderate call for only a reduction in the handouts 
treasury secretary james a baker iii said wednesday 
the presidents position remains the same and will be advanced 
in montreal in december baker told reporters after addressing a 
canadian importers association luncheon 
the 200 billion subsidy war in which support for farmers has 
caused surplus production and slumping prices caused the most 
heated debate of the sevennation summit that ended tuesday 
the united states proposed the phaseout of all subsidies by the 
end of the century while most european countries and japan said 
that was unrealistic and canada looked for compromise language 
everyone agreed the summit was not the place to reach the 
final agreement baker said noting that the real deadline for 
action is the december midterm review in montreal of the current 
uruguay round of talks within the 96nation general agreement on 
tariffs and trade the gatt system sets rules for international 
trade 
what we wanted to do was direct our negotiators at the midterm 
review to develop a framework that includes both longterm and 
shortterm measures baker said 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney said at a summitending 
news conference tuesday that the farm subsidy clause in the 
declaration was not perfect but sent a strong signal to gatt 
negotiations for reform of a system that is draining treasuries and 
dislocating economies 
in his speech baker termed the toronto summit the best of the 
eight he has attended as chief of staff and then treasury boss for 
reagan but he added that the multilateral trading system remains 
threatened by new forms of protectionism and the belief by some 
countries that exports are good but imports are bad 
he said the united states might explore a market 
liberalization club approach to trade if the current 
renegotiation of gatt rules does not reduce tariff and nontariff 
barriers around the world 
he pointed to the uscanada free trade agreement facing 
ratification hurdles in both countries but due to take effect jan 
1 as an important catalyst for this new trade policy strategy 
in ottawa meanwhile british prime minister margaret thatcher 
gave a ringing endorsement to the free trade agreement during an 
address to a joint session of the canadian parliament 
she termed it courageous and dismissed canadian opposition party 
claims that the deal might result in canada losing its identity 
on the basis of britains experience of joining the european 
community you need have no fear that canadas national personality 
will be in any way diminished mrs thatcher said fifteen 
years of european community membership have left our people no less 
british 
later in an angry exchange opposition party leaders blasted 
the mulroney government for allowing mrs thatcher to make such 
partisan comments they said it was like a canadian prime minister 
telling the british what to do about northern ireland 
but foreign minister joe clark snapped back if members 
opposite think prime minister margaret thatcher lets other people 
tell her what to say then they know a different margaret thatcher 
than i do 
the thatcher and baker testimonials to free trade a deal that 
would eliminate all tariffs in 10 years and more closely integrate 
the canadian and us economies were in contrast to 
behindthescenes battling during the economic summit 
mulroney had sought strong backing for the treaty in the final 
communique but the french and japanese were among governments 
concerned that the sweeping bilateral agreement could deprive them 
of market share in north america 
the tentative draft of the communique said only that summit 
partners welcome the uscanada deal but under last minute 
pressure from canada that was changed to strongly welcome 
which british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson pointed out 
was awkward english but agreed to accept 
baker said the pact will enhance trade liberalization and break 
ground by covering services investment and technology and possibly 
dislodging differences over agriculture 
canada and the us are lowering barriers between themselves 
not raising barriers to others he said the rewards of this 
agreement offer an incentive to other governments 
we hope followup liberalization will occur in the uruguay 
round if not we might be willing to explore a market 
liberalization club approach through minilateral arrangements or 
a series of bilateral agreements in this fashion north america 
can build steady momentum for more open and efficient markets 
baker spoke as crews cleaned up the metropolitan toronto 
convention center where 1500 delegates and 3000 journalists 
gathered for the 16 million summit 
reagan and the other six heads of state or government pledged to 
ease the debt burden of the poorest third world nations combat 
drug trafficking and continue a policy of encouraging growth 
without inflation 
the 3000member security force assembled for the summit was 
relieved to see the leaders go apart from two demonstrations 
resulting in more than 160 arrests and an arson attack on a 
derelict building a block from reagans hotel the meetings went 
off without incident

the baltic republics of estonia and latvia have 
made radical demands to next weeks national communist party 
conference that they be given control over virtually all their own 
affairs 
a published platform for the 32 delegates from estonia and a 
letter signed by hundreds of latvian intellectuals to the 
conference demand the republics take charge of their own finances 
ecological policy culture education media and foreign affairs 
both documents also voice strong criticism over ethnic policies 
demanding the right to control migration to their republics where 
ethnic estonians and latvians are in the minority and to 
strengthen the place of their indigenous languages in their 
schooling and arts 
the demands from the two republics long the most 
westwardlooking soviet regions are the most radical from the 
soviet unions 15 republics since mikhail s gorbachev launched a 
liberalization that has given rise to increased outbursts of 
national feeling 
public protests and media articles in recent months in estonia 
latvia and the third baltic republic lithuania suggest the 
proposals to the 5000 delegates of the party conference opening 
june 28 have strong popular backing 
radio moscow reported wednesday that a crowd of 100000 people 
turned out in estonia to see the republics 32 delegates off to the 
conference 
both their platform and the even more radical demands of the 
latvian intellectuals were published in staterun republican media 
in the past two weeks ensuring a broad audience is familiar with 
the proposals 
according to the june 11 edition of the newspaper soviet latvia 
the latvians demanded effective sovereignty over their own 
resources and treatment of latvia as a sovereign national state 
with the right to its own membership in the united nations and 
other international organization and its own team at the olympics 
in unequivocal terms the letter says the dictatorship of all 
union ministries and enterprises under soviet power has become a 
serious brake on the economic social and cultural development of 
the national republics 
in the proposals to next weeks conference known as the theses 
there is only scant mention of ethnic questions that have erupted 
into fierce violence that has killed at least 34 people in the 
southern soviet union 
the republics of armenia and azerbaijan are at loggerheads over 
the fate of the mainly armenian enclave of nagornokarabakh which 
was incorporated into azerbaijan in 1923 
the latvian letter made no mention of the violence in the 
caucasus or other ethnic strife but it said the hundreds of 
writers and other intellectuals who signed the missive consider 
that the subject of national questions and ways to solve them is 
undervalued in the theses for the conference in the mass media 
and in the speeches of state leaders 
latvian writer yanis peters told the weekly literaturnaya gazeta 
on wednesday that we must develop and strengthen soviet 
federalism on the basis of the leninist principle that union 
republics are like sovereign states and not like territories on 
which it is profitable to dump this or that industrial capacity 
the latvian and the estonian documents demanded rehabilitation 
for republican victims of mass deportations in 1941 and 1949 
neither mentioned however is the 1940 annexation of the baltic 
republics by soviet troops under a secret clause of the treaty 
josef v stalin concluded with nazi germany in 1939 
the latvian intellectuals resolution demanded publication of 
the agreement 
both radical baltic demands stopped short of calling for 
secession from the soviet union which is sometimes demanded by 
dissident groups and emigres but made clear they want much more 
genuine autonomy from moscow 
similar demands have been voiced in recent months in meetings 
and in the media in lithuania where a historian recently launched 
an unprecedented attack on the stalinist repression of the 194452 
partisan war in the republic 
in march the lithuanian writers union held a startlingly frank 
open meeting on ecology in the republic and followed up on april 4 
by calling openly for the adoption of lithuanian as the republics 
official language the abolition of duallanguage russian and 
lithuanian schools and schools for lithuanian minorities outside 
the republics borders 
ecology is a particularly strong worry to the citizens of the 
baltic republics who say that industrialization forced on them 
under soviet rule has ruined their environment 
the estonian conference platform published in the republics 
newspapers on june 18 devotes a section to ecology demanding that 
the soviet republics be granted full rights to decide on how to use 
their natural resources 
like the latvian document it demanded the republic receive full 
rights starting in 1991 to determine prices wages and investment 
policy it also urged referendums on policy questions and called 
for constitutional reform 
estonias new communist party leader vaino vyalyas told the 
government newspaper tuesday the conference platform is a unique 
document worked out with the participation of nonofficial groups 
such as the environmental greens and the national front set up with 
apparent official backing in april

if there are fewer cherries to bake into pies 
this fall part of the blame can be put on the drought gripping 
much of the nation an agriculture department report indicated 
wednesday 
production of tart cherries is expected to drop 41 percent from 
last years harvest of 3585 million pounds down to 211 million 
pounds in michigan the largest producer the crop was estimated 
at 150 million pounds down 43 percent from 1987 
severe spring freezes drought and a high june drop of fruit 
were blamed for the decline in michigan production and rain is 
needed within the next few weeks for the remaining cherries to 
grow properly the report said 
production in the four leading states accounts for about 94 
percent of this years expected tart cherry production others 
include new york 23 million pounds down from 35 million in 1987 
utah 15 million down from 29 million and wisconsin 9 million 
down from 14 million 
the crop of sweet cherries was forecast at 175400 tons down 17 
percent from last years harvest of 210800 tons 
department officials say that sweet cherry output in the western 
states is mostly quoted by the ton while eastern practice favors 
pounds since most production is in the west the agency reports 
sweet cherries in tons 
the top four producers of sweet cherries in this years forecast 
are california 32000 tons down from 45000 last year michigan 
22000 down from 32000 oregon 45000 down from 50000 and 
washington 67000 down from 74000

the commercial depicted a group of visiting soviet sailors who 
discover the companys henry weinhards private reserve beer and

afghanistan and the spirit of glasnost has made it possible to put 
the ad on television 
the goal of our advertising is to entertain the viewer and 
sell beer not to make political statements clark said in 
todays climate however we feel the commercial can be aired and 
accepted for what it is 60 seconds of entertainment that we hope 
sells beer 
filmed in 1979 the 200000 commercial portrays a group of 
soviet sailors touring the city in 1973 after two russian fishing 
trawlers collided off the central oregon coast and one had to be 
docked in coos bay for two weeks for repairs 
the sailors keep telling their hosts that life in the soviet

senate supporters of a bill imposing harsh new 
sanctions against whitedominated south africa acknowleged 
wednesday they do not have the votes to override a certain veto by 
president reagan 
but they said that in order to highlight opposition to south 
africas racial policies they would battle for senate passage of 
the bill which requires an end to most trade with south africa as 
well as the withdrawal of all us corporate investment 
testifying before the senate foreign relations committee deputy 
secretary of state john c whitehead strongly opposed the harsh 
sanctions measure as counterproductive 
and sen jesse helms rnc the leading opponent of using 
sanctions to increase pressures on south africa to adopt majority 
rule reforms said he will introduce legislation repealing the less 
severe sanctions bill passed over president reagans veto two years 
ago 
whitehead said that while the reagan administration believes 
apartheid is repugnant sanctions are the wrong tool because 
south africa has the resources to resist an economic siege and has 
been preparing for such a contingency for many years 
he said it has become clear over the past two years that the 
industrial allies of the united states will resist the us lead 
and will not impose sanctions of their own 
he said south africa could at will cut off exports of strategic 
minerals vital to us industrial efforts 
americans must accept the fact that us leverage in south 
africa is limited whitehead said 
resorting to drastic remedies such as the misuse of american 
power to destabilize the south african economy only increases the 
chances of a catastrophic outcome for all south africans 
whitehead said 
instead he said our mission should beone of using all 
available means to maximize our influence and leverage 
sen alan cranston dcalif a strong sanctions supporter said 
the administrations attitude demonstrates that the thoroughly 
discredited administration policy of constructive engagement 
to nudge south africa toward reform still survives 
sen paul simon dill said the 1986 sanctions bill has not 
produced results because the administration has been dragging its 
feet creating loopholes doing nothing to urge our allies to join 
in the sanctions 
but he and other senators said the drive to impose virtually 
total economic sanctions likely will fall short at least for now 
candidly right now i dont think we have the votes to 
override a veto simon said 
but he said the effort should proceed to demonstrate the breadth 
of the us opposition to apartheid and to support internal 
pressures for change in south africa 
sen edward m kennedy dmass another sanctions supporter 
told the committee there are those who say that waging economic 
war against south africa will only hurt the people we want to help 
the black workers but those people are already being hurt more 
profoundly by apartheid than any trade sanction we could possibly 
devise or impose 
the sanctions measure calls for the total removal of all us 
corporations and businesses from south africa and for the end of 
twoway trade except for us imports of certain strategic south 
african minerals 
a similar sanctions bill apparently has gathered stronger 
momentum in the house 
so far it has been consdidered favorably by the house foreign 
affairs intelligence armed services and banking committees and is 
pending before the ways and means committee 
it is likely to be considered on the house floor at a relatively 
early date passage is expected by a large majority probably 
greater than the twothirds needed to override a veto

soldiers on wednesday captured four teenage 
palestinian guerrillas who were trying to sneak across the border 
with submachine guns and grenade launchers to attack a settlement 
in northern israel the army said

they gave up after a halfhour skirmish 20 feet from israeli 
territory the army reported no israeli casualties 
in the rafah refugee camp in the occupied gaza strip 
16yearold talad khalil zakoot was killed during a clash with 
troops an arab reporter quoted the boys relatives as saying 
an army official said troops fired in the air to disperse 
stonethrowing arabs in rafah and that the body of a palestinian 
youth from rafah was later taken to nasser hospital in nearby khan 
yunis hospital officials refused comment 
the official said the army was investigating whether the youth 
was killed by army gunfire 
soldiers in nablus in the occupied west bank shot and wounded 
two palestinians when a gang of youths some wearing masks threw 
stones and bottles at them an army spokesman said 
officials at al ittihad hospital nablus said both young men 
aged 15 and 17 were shot in the right leg 
if confirmed wednesdays fatality would bring to at least 211 
the number of palestinians killed in the rebellion that began dec 
8 about 15 million palestinians live in the west bank and gaza 
strip which israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war 
four israelis also have died 
prime minister yitzhak shamir urged tougher tactics against 
arson firebombings and stoning that have given new impetus to the 
revolt 
we have to step up our activities in every sphere against this 
phenomenon and we mustnt sit and wait for some political solution 
to come from heaven he said on army radio 
shamir called the uprising a challenge to national survival and 
declared there is a wave of aggression whether arson or murder 
against the jewish presence everywhere in the land of israel 
another general strike ordered in underground palestinian 
leaflets virtually shut down the west bank and gaza but fire 
officials said a special alert thwarted calls for a rash of arson 
against israels forests and factories 
a new leaflet circulated wednesday exhorted palestinians to 
destroying the properties of our fascist enemy and expanding 
the revolt against occupation 
it orders two more general strikes next tuesday to protest the 
anniversary of israels annexing arab east jerusalem and on on 
july 5 
our uprising is intensifying and escalating shattering the 
delusions of the occupier that the flames of revolt can be 
extinguished said the leaflet signed as usual by the united 
national leadership of the uprising which is linked to the

150 family and friends gathered around his american gravesite to 
bid him farewell

cemetery and he will be buried in budapest near his mother and 
wife 
as we are immensely proud to know that he was very hungarian 
we are aware that he and his lifes work belong to the whole 
world gyorgy banlaki the hungarian consul general told the 
gathering he was international he is international and we want 
to keep it that way 
on hand were bartoks sons bela jr 78 of budapest and 
peter 64 of homossassa fla they decided to move their fathers 
body during the younger sons visit to budapest last year

should be there said peter bartok after the ceremony it 
became my wish too here my father is entirely alone there are 
all the people who were close to him in life he will never be 
alone

colors of the hungarian flag 
thomas simons us deputy assistant secretary of state praised

music and incorporating it into his own works banlaki said the

a delegation of israeli leftwingers and 
moderates challenged a 2yearold law by attending a conference 
along with palestine liberation organization observers a 
participant said wednesday 
the delegates could face three years in jail if they are found 
to have violated a law passed in august 1986 which bars israelis 
from meeting with members of the plo viewed by israel as a 
terrorist group 
in the first test case last month a court convicted four 
israelis for meeting with plo officials in costinesti romania in 
november 1986 the four have not yet been sentenced 
moshe amirav an israeli delegate told the associated press the 
israeli group attended a threeday symposium last week along with 
palestinian academics at the invitation of the free university in 
amsterdam 
two plo officials afif safieh and ilan halevy attended the 
conference as observers but did not take part in its proceedings 
he said 
the law is stupid but we will continue meeting in such a way 
that we wont be able to be accused of anything amirav said 
adding that none of the delegates had been summoned for police 
questioning 
the daily hadashot reported amirav actually met with the plo 
officials but amirav denied the report 
other sources who attended the conference and refused to be 
identified said some members of the israeli delegation did meet 
with the plo officials 
amirav said other israeli delegates included nitza shapiralibai 
of the leftleaning labor party a former adviser to thenprime 
minister shimon peres on womens affairs former leftwing 
legislator meir pail and human rights lawyers naomi chazan and 
david kretzmer 
amirav is a former activist in the rightwing likud bloc who was 
expelled from his party for advocating direct talks with the plo 
and farreaching selfrule for palestinians in the occupied 
territories 
he enraged party leaders last year by meeting with faisel 
husseini a resident of arab east jerusalem billed by israeli 
authorities as the plos representative in the occupied west bank 
amirav now a member of the liberal center party said the 
israelis found the palestinian academics surprisingly moderate 
he said the academics told him the plo was ready to recognize 
israel and end the middle east conflict in return for the 
establishment of an independent palestinian state in the west bank 
and gaza strip 
we were stunned by their attitude he said they said they 
recognized israel and believed there should be two independent 
states 
the delegation was the third known group of israelis to attend a 
forum with plo officials and the first to include moderate 
participants more representative of the israeli consensus 
the other groups openly defied the law and met directly with plo 
officials arguing the group was not terrorist

dissident historian roy medvedev expelled from 
the communist party almost 20 years ago and officially silenced 
since emerged wednesday to espouse his independent marxism at a 
governmentsponsored news conference 
it was the first official appearance in decades for medvedev 
and occurred less than three weeks after andrei d sakharov nobel 
peace prize winner and former political exile met with reporters 
at the soviet foreign ministry press center 
the officially sponsored appearances by two men who were leading 
figures in the evolution of the soviet dissident movement would 
have been unimaginable a couple of years ago they reflected not 
only the soviet unions more liberal atmosphere under mikhail s 
gorbachev but an effort to consolidate support for the soviet 
leaders reforms 
medvedev said he was not seeking readmittance to the communist 
party but that he would accept it if offered 
i would take it with appreciation but im not going to write 
to anybody to ask for it he said 
in his decades of dissident medvedev has emphasized reforms in 
soviet society rather than complete changes in its character but 
he was expelled from the party in 1969 and his major works have 
only been published abroad 
asked how he felt about being given a public forum to state his 
views he said of course its hard to obtain the same form after 
20 years but its pleasant to answer your questions 
best known for his book let history judge a work on 
dictator josef v stalin never published in the soviet union 
medvedev said he was invited tuesday by the government news agency 
novosti to take part in a news conference the next day about the 
soviet unions review of stalins purges 
despite the review of stalins dictatorship soviet authorities 
have an equal right to govern the soviet union as the us 
government has to rule its land he said 
we are reviewing our history very deeply but the review 
wouldnt undermine the legal basis of our state he said it 
has emerged and will continue to function in the future 
he defended the communist partys monopoly on power through the 
oneparty system saying the soviet union must develop a democratic 
spirit both within and outside the party but that at the same 
time we need centralism because without subservience to the 
decisions of the central organs without subservience to the local 
centers we may have anarchy 
but he said minorities must always have the right to their 
opinions 
medvedev also cited george orwells novel of totalitarianism 
1984 a reference that until recently would not have been 
possible in an officially sponsored meeting in answer to a 
question about the torture of old bolsheviks killed by stalin he 
said orwell understood well the pressure that could be brought on 
people to confess to crimes they didnt commit 
medvedev and his brother zhores were among the first prominent 
members of what eventually evolved into the soviet dissident 
movement zhores a biochemist and gerontologist was placed in a 
psychiatric hospital before being forced to leave the soviet union 
for london in 1973 
sakharov has said that medvedevs views were an important 
influence even though they later separated and were leading 
figures in contrasting dissident movements 
roy medvedev remained in the soviet union despite being 
expelled from the party and being unable to publish he was 
tolerated by authorities and became a valuable unofficial source 
for journalists who often sought his views on history and kremlin 
politics 
on june 12 the weekly paper moscow news published a commentary 
he wrote about the roots of stalinism he told the news conference 
wednesday that several stateowned publishing houses were 
interested in publishing his books that so far have only been 
released abroad 
his appearance came on the 47th anniversary of the nazi invasion 
of the soviet union in world war ii on monday the party newspaper 
pravda blamed stalin for the poor preparation of soviet forces that 
allowed nazi forces to drive deep into soviet territory before they 
were stopped 
medvedev declined to tell reporters which members of the ruling 
politburo he thinks support gorbachev and which might oppose him 
but another panelist philosopher yuri koryakin said soviets 
need much more information about the personal views of politburo 
members and said he was very worried about statements by kremlin 
no 2 leader yegor k ligachev 
in his public statements ligachev has taken a more conservative 
line than gorbachev on the question of how much openness to allow 
in soviet society

the alsoran democratic candidates are 
pitching in with a 2500aperson dinner thursday to help likely 
presidential nominee michael dukakis raise the 83 million the 
party can spend to elect him in november 
as part of the effort to achieve a democratic party first 
raising the maximum allowable general election fund three of the 
candidates and their finance chairmen were scheduled to attend the 
dinner at the georgetown home of developer joseph kaempfer 
democratic national committee spokeswoman julie anbender said 
wednesday 
she said former candidates sen albert gore jr of tennessee 
rep richard gephardt of missouri and sen paul simon of illinois 
would attend the event with their finance chairmen earlier in the 
day the finance chairmen as well as finance representatives of 
dukakis and candidate jesse jackson will meet with dnc officials to 
discuss fundraising plans for november 
dnc officials said the democratic candidates have established a 
cooperative attitude toward helping the man who beat them all in 
the primaries 
there is by all accounts more unity and cooperation than any 
time in the recent past that anyone can remmeber said tony 
blinken deputy director of the dncs victory fund for november 
so far the party has raised about 15 million of the 83 
million that election law allows the party to spend on its nominee 
said anbender 
that money is in addition to the 46 million each candidate 
receives from the federal treasury to fund his campaign 
the party already has more than 4 million in socalled soft 
money which it will distribute to the state party officials to 
spend on their own state activities which ultimately can help the 
national ticket as well 
robert farmer the boston money whiz who engineered dukakis 
successful fundraising effort has pledged to raise 42 million in 
soft money 
soft money refers generally to funds that are banned in federal 
elections like union and corporate donations but that are 
permitted in many states and can be used for such activities as 
voter registration which ends up helping the national ticket as 
well 
among other planned fundraising events the democrats hope to 
raise 200 at each of 10000 televison parties on the last night of 
the democratic national convention next month 
people will be invited to pay admission to attend one of the 
parties nationwide and watch the dukakis acceptance speech the last 
night of the conventon 
in addition the party is sending out direct mail and is asking 
50 top fundraisers to pledge to raise 100000 each anbender said 
the soft money is going extremely well she said 
in 1984 when the hard money limit for the parties was just over 
6 million the party raised a total of 24 million said anbender

a prosecutor told a jury wednesday that 
a collection of body fragments were sufficient to prove that an 
airline pilot killed his wife and disposed of her body with a wood 
chipper 
states attorney walter flanagan mounted photographs of hair 
strands skull fragments a thumb a toe bone and other body 
fragments on a picture of a body outlined in charcoal on white 
poster board 
in closing arguments to the 12week trial flanagan acknowledged 
that only one tooth recovered by police was positively identified 
as belonging to helle crafts but he told the jurors you can put 
everything together and you look at other evidence 
mrs crafts a 39yearold flight attendant for pan american 
world airways wasnt the type of person who would have abandoned 
her three young children as the defense has argued flanagan said 
richard crafts was upset over his wifes plans to file for 
divorce giving him a motive and he was the last person to see his 
wife alive the prosecutor said 
but defense attorney daniel sagarin sought to cast doubt on the 
evidence saying that the 75 or so body fragments weighed no more 
than twothirds of an ounce 
ask yourself whats not there you say to yourself where 
is the evidence we have a very small amount of evidence were 
dealing with he said 
crafts a 50yearold pilot for eastern airlines and parttime 
police officer is charged with murdering his wife who was last 
seen nov 18 1986 after returning from an overseas flight 
the prosecution has alleged that crafts killed his wife cut up 
her body with a chain saw and then fed the body parts through a 
rented woodchipping machine 
flanagan told the jurors they could be convinced that the body 
parts found by police along the banks of the housatonic river in 
southeast connecticut and in a uhaul truck rented by crafts were 
indeed from his wife he reminded jurors that an expert had 
identified a tooth as belonging to mrs crafts 
but sagarin noted that dr henry lee the states top forensic 
expert testified that a tooth crown also presented as evidence was 
not made at the laboratory where mrs crafts had her dental work 
done 
flanagan also reminded jurors that mrs crafts had paid an 
attorney 2500 in cash to represent her in divorce proceedings 
this is an indication that she intended to pursue a divorce not 
to flee he said 
sagarin contended there was reasonable doubt whether crafts 
could have committed murder 
the case is expected to go to the jury thursday

prolonged exposure to high temperatures can lead 
to a variety of serious ailments in which the body either loses 
fluids too rapidly or body temperature rises to dangerous levels 
doctors say 
the problem is especially serious in older people but vigorous 
exercise poor ventilation heavy clothing and certain prescription 
drugs can make anyone more susceptible to heat stroke or heat 
exhaustion 
among the drugs that can aggravate heatrelated disorders are 
antihistamines certain psychiatric drugs and cocaine 
according to the merck manual a standard reference source for 
doctors heat stroke occurs when the body during hot weather is 
unable to cool itself and remain at normal temperature symptoms 
include headache weakness and sudden loss of consciousness 
people suffering from heat stroke have hot red dry skin 
little perspiration and rapid pulse the remedy is emergency 
cooling with cold water or ice and immediate hospitalization 
heat exhaustion is a very different disorder it occurs when the 
body loses too much fluid and it is marked by gradual weakness 
nausea anxiety excessive sweating and fainting 
victims of heat exhaustion have pale grayish clammy skin and 
a slow pulse appropriate treatment is to lower the head and 
replace lost salt and water usually by mouth 
excessive salt loss can cause heat cramps which are often 
experienced by manual laborers in such surroundings as engine rooms 
and steel mills 
the pain of heat cramps comes on suddenly with the arms and 
legs usually affected first 
drinking fluids or eating foods containing salt will usually 
rapidly relieve the symptoms

nasa may have to conduct extensive 
psychological testing including some experiments that could last 
years before it can select crews for deep space flights such as a 
voyage to mars an advisory panel said wednesday 
in a study of nasas future needs for space exploration the 
panel said the agency will have to conduct extensive test programs 
and develop new criteria for the selection of astronauts 
the study exploring the living universe outlines in broad 
terms the changes the national aeronautics and space administration 
must make in order to be ready to staff a space station in earth 
orbit for months at a time or to develop the equipment and 
personnel for exploration beyond earth orbit 
life sciences as it has been is inadequate to support the 
goals of nasa said frederick c robbins a nobel laureate who 
was chairman of the study committee 
robbins said the space agency must strengthen research areas not 
only to learn how to send humans into space for long periods of 
time but also to explore the universe for possible life forms and 
to study the planet central to the human species the earth 
he said the studies should gather more knowledge about the 
effect of mankind on the earths environment because the threat 
to our environment is real and is becoming more important to us all 
the time i would suggest that this research might provide a 
mechanism for our continued existence on this planet 
robbins said nasa will have to gain significantly more knowledge 
about the effects of weightlessness and forced confinement on the 
human body before the agency can hope to attempt longterm space 
flight aboard the space station or to attempt a voyage to mars 
us experience in longterm space flight is limited to the 84 
days of skylab 3 and this is not enough data to commit to missions 
lasting years such as a voyage to mars robbins said 
he said the soviet cosmonaut yuri romanenko holds the world 
space record of 326 days but the soviet union has yet to share the 
specific phsysiological data collected on that mission 
the weightlessness of space causes muscles to atrophy bones to 
lose minerals and become thinner and the cardiovascular system to 
decondition this reaction called the space adaptation syndrome 
must be understood thoroughly before longterm space flight is 
possible 
gerald carr a former astronaut who commanded the 84day skylab 
flight and who helped prepare the report said nasa also must study 
the psychological aspects of longterm space flight 
carr said the current astronaut selection methods are not 
adequate for choosing crew members for flights that could last 
years 
nasa is going to have to conduct very longterm tests in 
situations where the test crew knows it cant kings x and walk 
away from it carr said he said what is currently known about 
the confinement for years of small group of people in hazardous 
situations such as space flight is inadequate because nobody 
has ever done a study 
carr said that the criterion used for selecting astronauts in 
the past must be changed because future astronauts will face 
stresses far more complex than those known to the people of apollo 
and skylab 
william c schneider a former nasa executive who headed the 
skylab program and who also was on the study committee said it is 
quite likely that nasa will have to conduct tests that could 
last 500 days to 600 days to determine the criteria for selecting 
crew members for longduration space flight 
there simply is no other way to gather the data he said 
in other recommendations the committee said nasa should 
conduct an intensified program of orbital experiments on human 
life support in space including development of selfcontained 
systems that recirculate oxygen and water 
increase studies on the effects of gravity and weightlessness 
on earth life forms including plants 
increase studies related to the possible existence of life 
forms beyond the earth and on issues related to the evolution of 
life

a consultant to a defense contractor was given top 
security clearance and two days of free travel on a pentagon vip 
jet after being wrongly identified as an aide to rep bill chappell 
jr the dallas morning news reported wednesday 
chappell dfla is one of five house members reportedly under 
scrutiny in a massive fbi investigation into allegations that 
defense consultants obtained classified and proprietary information 
through bribery and fraud chappell who is chairman of the house 
appropriations defense subcommittee has denied the allegations 
according to air force records obtained by the newspaper w 
leonard killgore jr a consultant to oshkosh truck corp rode 
aboard an air force c20 jet from washington to daytona fla to 
portland ore and back to washington on sept 2728 1987 
killgore has been a private consultant to defense contractors 
since 1980 but the air force order authorizing the flights and 
security clearance listed him as legislative assistant to 
representative chappell according to the records obtained 
through a freedom of information act request 
killgore rode in on the jet which picked up chappell and his 
wife in the congressmans home district they flew to portland for 
the annual meeting of the national guard association of the united 
states and returned to washington the next day travel records show 
i was invited to make that trip and i made it killgore said 
capt andrea shaffron an air force spokeswoman said tuesday 
that the service was unable to explain immediately how the 
authorizing order was issued 
killgore and chappell aide kay thomas told the news the orders 
description listing killgore as an aide was an apparent error 
mr killgore was invited by the guard association to be a 
guest at their convention and to travel on the airplane under 
appropriate air force orders ms thomas told the news when 
the air force personnel prepared the aircraft manifest they 
apparently assumed that mr killgore was a member of chairman 
chappells staff until you raised the issue no one had noticed 
the mistake 
chappell was in a conference wednesday and was unavailable for 
comment his office told the associated press 
killgore a retired national guard colonel said the national 
guard bureau granted him the authority to board the plane 
but lt col jim ragan a spokesman for the national guard 
bureau said the air force c20 jet is not one the bureau could 
authorize private citizens to ride 
the cost of the 117 hours of flight time logged by the aircraft 
during the twoday trip was 2956590 air force records show 
killgore was one of three oshkosh officials at an april 1987 
breakfast where several members of the house armed service 
committee received 2000 honorariums only hours before a vote to 
force the army to buy 500 more oshkosh trucks than the army wanted

a rise in the dollar spurred a rally in the bond 
market wednesday which in turn propelled the stock market to its 
highest level since the october crash 
the dow jones industrial average closed 4303 points higher at 
215220 easily eclipsing the previous postcrash high of 213140 
set a week ago 
three stocks rose for every one that fell on the new york stock 
exchange where 21751 million shares changed hands 
the catalyst for the rally appeared to be a surprising surge in 
the value of the dollar overseas which eased worries about 
inflation 
that fed a rally in bond prices that pushed yields on the 
closely watched 30year treasury bond back under 9 percent which 
buoyed stock prices

irans ranking diplomat in london said wednesday 
he is very optimistic that better relations between his country 
and britain will lead to freedom for englishmen held hostage in 
lebanon 
charge daffaires mohammad akhoond zadeh basti made his comments 
as the first british lawmakers to visit iran since the monarchy was 
overthrown in 1979 returned to london the legislators said tehran 
will use its influence with the kidnappers 
they called the mission a success but said they could not raise 
the question of american hostages because of intense hostility in 
iran toward the united states 
the independent newspaper reported wednesday that syria has 
located the hiding place for 15 foreign hostages believed held by 
the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god in the shiite moslem 
slums of south beirut 
it added however that the syrians said the hostages cannot be 
rescued by force and negotiations with hezbollah are needed 
in washington state department spokesman charles e redman 
said that report is not new we have never been able to confirm 
the exact location of the hostages and we cannot confirm this 
latest report 
although information on the hostages is conflicting and rarely 
reliable we have always believed that some of them are in beiruts 
southern suburbs 
eighteen foreigners are missing in lebanon including nine 
americans held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 and is reported to be among the 15 
basti was asked on channel 4 television news whether diplomatic 
progress could mean the release of the three britons held 
anglican church envoy terry waite journalist john mccarthy and 
teacher brian keenan 
im very optimistic about the process that has been initiated 
and i believe that there are wonderful areas where the two 
countries can talk can discuss and i believe that the 
opportunities are ample he replied 
asked whether it would take months or years basti said 
let us not be hasty let us welcome the initiatives as they 
take their own course i think that one has got to be very 
optimistic in the context of the latest diplomatic move 
both governments reduced their diplomatic representation to 
caretaker status last year but on june 10 announced agreement to 
exchange compensation for damaged embassy buildings that will net 
iran about 18 million 
on sunday the british legislators flew to tehran on a private 
mission organized by waites boss archbishop of canterbury robert 
runcie 
i think our mission was a success said conservative 
lawmaker cyril townsend delegation leader by talking to senior 
members of the administration we played some part in putting the 
relationship on a better basis he said 
the timing was really rather good because since about 
february the pragmatists in the government have been looking for a 
chance in my view to patch up the quarrel between our two 
countries 
townsend said the delegation met with alireza moayyeri deputy 
prime minister hojatoleslam mehdi karroubi deputy parliament 
speaker and mohammed javad larijani deputy foreign minister 
a church official john lyttle was allowed to visit roger 
cooper a british businessman jailed in tehran since december 1985 
on espionage charges cooper has not been tried 
lord tordoff of the centrist social and liberal democratic party 
quoted larijani as saying we are willing to use our good offices 
to free the british captives it takes a lot of patience 
irans official news agency quoted moayyeri as saying tuesday 
night that iran will ask its friends in lebanon to help locate 
the britons 
townsend said his group could not deliver a request by a support 
group for anderson that a us delegation to be allowed into 
tehran he said the proposal would have been totally 
counterproductive and frankly daft at the present time 
because the iranians have an obsession about the united states 
they see the united states in a very different category to 
western europe so im afraid the iranian lever for american 
hostages in the lebanon is not one one can easily pull he said

a badly divided screenwriters guild made 
lastminute maneuvers before a bicoastal vote wednesday on whether 
to end a 4monthold strike 
leaders of the writers guild of america have urged rejection of 
the proposed contract from the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers which claims its offer is worth 71 million 
over the next four years 
a dissident group within the union has urged approval and a 
return to work as the new television production season gets under 
way jobs from craft workers to caterers would be affected by a 
prolonged strike 
the vote during membership meetings wednesday night in los 
angeles and new york comes on the eve of the television production 
season results of the vote will be announced thursday 
both sides within the union predicted an angry gathering 
brian walton the guilds chief negotiator and its west coast 
executive director found his leadership challenged publicly on 
tuesday by a dissident group within the union that urged approval 
of the producers offer 
the guild is at an important crossroads walton told members 
in a mailed message that forecast the acromony you and your 
guild are likely to be bombarded with an intense pr barrage from 
the alliance and its allies designed to persuade you that their 
third and latest offer is good enough for you to vote up and and 
that you have no realistic choice 
members of the loosely formed writers coalition said at a news 
conference tuesday they believe the union has already squeezed far 
more from producers than most expected 
the group includes some of hollywoods top writerproducers such 
as steve bochco john hughes john milius and stephen cannell who 
also is a member of the alliance 
some of us were surprised that as much has been accomplished 
as has been in the last 16 weeks bochco said one wonders how 
much further we would go in another four six eight 10 or 12 
weeks it has an economic impact that hits everyone in our 
business people arent working he said 
the 9500member writers guild struck on march 7 over the issue 
of payments for reruns of onehour domestic television shows and a 
bigger share in the increased foreign market they also sought 
better guidelines to protect a writers work and allow writers to 
reacquire unproduced scripts 
agreement was reached on matters of creative control but both 
sides remain divided on the economic package 
writers agreed with the producers position that the rerun 
payments known as residuals for onehour television shows should 
be tied to a sales formula rather than a fixed payment 
producers have argued that the market for such shows has grown 
soft and it was unfair for them to pay writers a big residual for 
selling the rerun package in only a few markets 
but walton has claimed the producers failed to reciprocate with 
a more generous offer in the area of foreign distribution 
residuals the union has linked the two economic items

republican george bush on wednesday 
called for tougher sentences for crimes against law enforcement 
officers saying that for too long politicians and judges held 
captive by civil libertarians have controlled the nation 
the allbutcertain republican nominee called for establishing 
tough mandatory penalties for any violent crime against a law 
enforcement officer and said the fbi should have clear authority to 
investigate attacks against law officers anywhere in the united 
states 
for too many years weve been held hostage by wellmeaning 
but misguided politicians and judges who get their legal views from 
the aclu american civil liberties union bush told a meeting of 
the national sheriffs association 
the comment won hearty applause from the audience of sheriffs 
later bush told local reporters that dukakis had called himself 
a cardcarrying member of the aclu that was a quote of his 
bush also said bulletproof vests should be made available to 
every officer in the country who wants it 
a lot of lives could be saved we owe it bush said holding 
up a police vest that he said had been fired at three times at 
pointblank range without injuring the wearer 
he did not indicate who would pay for such protective clothing 
as an aside the vice president joked when he held up the vest 
that the bullets were not fired by carl rowan i might add they 
hit right here in the middle 
rowan a syndicated columnist last week shot a backyard 
intruder in the hand 
bush in a speech he claimed was nonpolitical took another 
swipe at what is becoming a favorite target a massachusetts prison 
furlough system 
the vice president claims that the program administered by his 
democratic rival massachusetts gov michael dukakis permitted 
convicted firstdegree murderers to go free on weekends to 
terrorize innocent people 
he called such a program naive and irresponsible but without 
mentioning dukakis by name 
however one member of the audience robert c rufo sheriff of 
suffolk county boston mass took issue with bushs comments 
this is no more than a republican smokescreen to try to divert 
attention from where they are weak rufo who was wearing a 
dukakis button on his lapel told reporters after bushs speech 
rufo claimed dukakis inherited the furlough program and that it 
no longer applies to convicted murderers 
youre never an unmovable object in politics im not and he 
dukakis is not he shares the vice presidents views on furloughs 
for convicted murderers rufo said 
the vice president also reiterated his support for tougher 
sentences for drug offenses and the death penalty for drug 
kingpins if this is a war lets treat it as such lets get 
these killers off the street bush said 
he said drug offenders should be put in prison and that a 
federal rule that suppresses evidence obtained in warrantless 
searches the socalled exclusionary rule should be abandoned 
theres someting wrong with the system when the modernday 
version of a prison break is crawling through a loophole bush 
said 
and he accused liberals in the senate of derailing new 
sentencing guidelines for a federal death penalty 
but later in the interview bush said he would not urge the 
death penalty for crimes involving drunken driving in kentucky 
the issue is an emotional one in the wake of a bustruck accident 
that left 27 people dead the driver of the truck who has been 
charged with murder allegedly was drunk 
i dont think a death penalty for drunk driving is proper 
i dont think a drunk driver is making a conscious decision under 
the influence do i think drunk driving is bad do i think they 
ought to pay a penalty absolutely but i draw the line there 
bush also called for a denial of parole of some convicts 
saying the view that all convicts can be rehabilitated is not 
just naive its dead wrong 
when firstdegree murderers sentenced to life without parole 
get unsupervised weekend furloughs and commuted sentences that 
view goes from naive to dangerous from wellmeaning to 
irresponsible bush said 
bush recounted details of the case of willy horton a convicted 
massachusetts murderer who was released on a weekend furlough and 
accused of raping a woman while he was free 
rufo who is the president of the massachusetts sheriffs 
association told reporters that there were 121000 successful 
furloughs before that incident 
speaking with reporters aboard air force two bush accused 
dukakis of waffling on many issues including his support for the 
prison furlough program and his public statements on the b1 bomber 
people need to know wheres the guy coming from said bush 
i cant count on others to do this ive got to spell it out and 
then get surrogates those other people who believe as i do to 
spell it out 
bush denied he was engaging in a negative campaign against the 
likely democratic nominee 
its the record what he favors and what i favor its not 
namecalling he said

iraq said its troops backed by 
helicopter gunships on wednesday recaptured two mountain peaks in 
its northern border region iran said it repulsed an iraqi attack 
in the area and killed or wounded 3000 iraqi soldiers 
farther south along the countries 730mile border iranian 
rebels based in iraq said they withdrew from the town of mehran 
after a threeday offensive in which they reported capturing 
military hardware they estimated to be worth 2 billion 
in the persian gulf iran said its navy destroyed an 
unidentified iraqi ship during a clash with several enemy 
vessels in the northern end of the waterway iraq denied the 
report 
the offical iraqi news agency said iraqi troops recaptured the 
heights of safrah and basawa in a threeday battle that began 
monday the two mountains are about five miles northwest of mawat 
a town in the kurdistan mountains of northeastern iraq 
iraq said its helicopter gunships flew 337 missions in the 
battle wednesday 
the iraqis last friday claimed to have recaptured mawat and 
several other peaks all seized by iran last summer 
iran reported its fighter bombers on wednesday heavily bombed 
iraqi positions and troop concentration sites in the mawat 
region the bombing inflicted considerable losses in men and 
equipment said the report by the official islamic republic news 
agency monitored in nicosia 
tehran radio also monitored in nicosia said iranian forces on 
tuesday destroyed at least 15 tanks and set ammunition dumps ablaze 
and 3000 iraqi troops in the region 
iraqi forces in recent weeks have driven the iranians out of 
territory captured in southern iraq earlier in the 8yearold war 
and have been pressing iranian forces in the kurdistan mountains 
for 10 days 
on april 16 iraq seized the initiative in the stalemated land 
war with an assault that recaptured the faw peninsula in southern 
iraq ending two years of iranian occupation 
a sudden iraqi switch from years of static warfare behind 
formidable defenses caught the iranians by surprise iraq struck 
again a month later driving irans forces from their bridgehead 
around salamcheh east of the southern port city of basra 
two defeats in a row jolted the iranians and forced them onto 
the defensive for the first time since early in the war which 
began with an iraqi invasion in september 1980 after weeks of 
border skirmishes 
iran was hit again saturday night when iraqibacked iranian 
rebels of the national liberation army crossed in the central 
border sector to capture mehran which has been fought over several 
times and devastated by the war 
dispatches from tehran said the threepronged assault was 
carried out by iraqi regulars supported by fighterbombers dropping 
chemical bombs but rebel commander massoud rajavi denied the 
hollow claims 
statements from the national liberation army said 22 of its 
fighting brigades including armored units and one made up of 
women seized hills around mehran several miles inside western iran 
on sunday and occupied the town 
jeffrey ulbrich an associated press correspondent taken to 
mehran by the rebels sunday said it was filled with jubilant nla 
fighters 
a rebel statement received wednesday from nla headquarters in 
baghdad said the insurgents withdrew across the border tuesday 
night 
the offensive called operation forty stars was the biggest 
since rajavi organized the rebel army a year ago around his 
mujahedeen khalq peoples holy warriors the main movement 
opposed to ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
according to the statement 8000 iranians were killed or 
wounded and more than 1500 captured in the battle for mehran and 
about 16000 iranians were involved the nla gave its own losses as 
71 killed and 240 wounded 
iran acknowledged the attack but said it was repulsed with 
thousands of enemy casualties 
conflicting claims cannot be reconciled because foreign 
journalists are not allowed into battle areas except for occasional 
guided tours like the one on which ulbrich was taken 
rebel units using tanks captured in earlier battles cut the main 
iranian supply routes in the sector and blew up two bridges the 
statement said captured materiel was worth 2 billion and included 
40 tanks 20 armored personnel carriers scores of 155mm and 130mm 
artillery pieces usbuilt tow antitank missiles and batteries 
of hawk antiaircraft missiles also americanmade 
reporters taken to the area said roads were jammed with rebel 
trucks hauling the booty home 
in the persian gulf an american missile cruiser on patrol off 
saudi arabia rescued six crewmen from the greek oilrig supply boat 
notora which later sank us officials reported 
they quoted the captain as saying the notora apparently 
foundered because of a leak in its engine room 
maj charles boyd of the us central command said the missile 
cruiser halsey went to the notoras aid after it radioed a distress 
signal at 1054 pm tuesday from 40 miles northeast of the saudi 
oil port ras tanura

us envoy richard murphy touring the 
middle east is expected in baghdad over the weekend to smooth 
diplomatic feathers ruffled by the visit of an iraqi kurdish rebel 
leader to the state department 
iraq is unhappy with us officials for receiving jalal talabani 
earlier this month the visit was perceived here as a diplomatic 
slap and unsettled what had been a year of improved usiraq 
relations 
six kurdish groups formed an alliance in may to fight for 
selfrule in northern iraq and with iranian help have turned the 
kurdistan mountains into another front of the iraniraq war now 
nearly eight years old 
by publicly meeting with talabani who leads the patriotic union 
of kurdistan us officials were regarded by baghdad as dealing 
with an enemy of the state and interfering in iraqs internal 
affairs 
washington said it was following the policy of listening to 
anyone who wants to talk not sending diplomatic signals after 
meeting with the kurdish leader state department officials said 
iraq had no reason to question overall us policy 
president saddam husseins government called us regional 
policy into question in an editorial attributed to the political 
editor of the official iraqi news agency and another editorial in 
althawra official newspaper of the ruling baath party 
foreign minister tariq aziz canceled a scheduled meeting with 
secretary of state george p shultz 
the news agency editorial recited a list of iraqi grievances 
including allegations that united states supplied direct or 
indirect technical assistance to iran and gave it intelligence 
information about iraq 
is this also a fault committed by a junior officer or is it 
once more a badly calculated move pushed by zionist hatred the 
editorial asked referring to the us explanation of arms sales to 
iran arranged through lowerechelon white house officials working 
with israeli arms dealers 
in essence the talabani meeting was a very grave and serious 
mistake which clearly and directly infringes on the principle of 
noninterference in the internal affairs of iraq it said 
murphy an assistant secretary and specialist in middle east 
affairs is on an eightnation tour for talks about arabisraeli 
peace and the war between iran and iraq

democratic presidential contender jesse 
jackson told a labor convention wednesday that a national health 
insurance plan proposed by expected democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis is not sufficient 
however jackson told a news conference later that he would 
support dukakiss health program because it is an improvement 
over what we have now 
jackson also reaffirmed that he and dukakis discussed the 
massachusetts governors selection of a vice presidential running 
mate in their private meeting here tuesday but again refused to go 
into any specifics 
we talked in more detail than i choose to talk about now the 
process is in motion jackson said 
asked if he wanted the vice presidential nomination jackson 
replied i have not yet made that decision 
the head of jacksons convention team ron brown was asked by 
reporters in washington if jackson had asked dukakis to put him on 
the ticket 
he did not brown replied that has not been his public or 
private position he said repeating the campaigns position that 
jackson deserves serious consideration for the job 
and when asked if he would be disappointed if dukakis didnt 
offer him the no 2 spoton the ticket jackson said tersely i 
choose not to respond to that now 
however jackson did say that his campaign has received dukakis 
request for the personal financial information he is seeking from 
potential running mates and that his wife and attorney among 
others were reviewing the request in chicago 
in his address to about 3500 delegates to the national 
convention of the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees jackson cited the same health insurance 
statistics and voiced the same concerns dukakis recited in his 
tuesday address to the afscme convention 
but jackson offered a much broader health program and criticized 
the dukakis plan 
describing heath care as the birthright of every family and 
every citizen dukakis told the labor convention that as president 
he would seek to extend nationwide the program he signed into law 
in massachusetts to require every employer except a few very small 
firms to provide health insurance for all of their employees 
jackson told the labor convention there is no question that 
the massachusetts plan applied nationally would be a great leap 
forward but then he suggested it wasnt the best approach 
its time to jump in another direction we do not need a great 
leap forward throwing more money into our wasteful publicprivate 
patchwork medical delivery system we need to move away from 
the precipice towards a rational comprehensive plan jackson said 
instead of dukakis proposal jackson outlined a much broader 
federally funded and publicly administered health plan for all 
americans which he said ultimately would cost less that dukakis 
patchwork proposal 
a health care program that is not adequate should not be 
supported jackson said 
asked if that meant he would oppose the dukakis plan jackson 
said no 
if he puts it forward in legislation i certainly would 
support it but i would also seek to amend it and expand it 
jackson said it is an improvement over what we have now but it 
is not sufficient 
jackson also charged that the pentagon procurement scandal is 
no aberration it is systemic and a product of president 
reagans policies 
whats the result costplus contracts that remove risk 
solesource contracts that remove competition systematic waste 
pervasive corruption jackson said reagan loved private 
enterprise so much that he even privatized his foreign policy what 
else was the irancontra scandal all about

five fishermen came home wednesday 
after 144 days adrift in the pacific ocean vowing to return to sea 
despite a grueling odyssey they survived by living off sharks 
turtles and rainwater 
the sea is the source of life for us and our families a 
moisteyed joel omar gonzalez 27 said hugging his wife after 
arriving at juan santamaria airport from los angeles were sea 
dogs the sea calls to us 
a japanese tuna boat rescued the crew of the 33foot cairo iii 
drifting 700 miles southeast of hawaii on june 15 
the cairo iii set sail january 19 from puntarenas west of san 
jose for what was to be an eightday fishing trip a storm 
disabled the boat five days later leaving it adrift in the pacific 
capt gerardo obregon 33 and his crew gonzalez juan cernas 
bolivar 47 pastor lopez rojas 30 and jorge hernandez castillo 
22 said they survived by catching turtles and sharks and 
collecting rainwater 
doctors in honolulu pronounced the five sailors in perfect 
health after their rescue 
costa ricas first lady margarita de arias joined the 
relatives friends neighbors and fellow fishermen who arrived in 
buses from puntarenas 95 miles away 
it was a torment for us not knowing if he was alive or 
dead mrs lopez said as her sons 3yearold alvaro and 
2yearold roger clung to their fathers knees 
obregon was unwilling to discuss the ordeal at length 
imagine he said our little boat in the middle of the 
ocean directionless the hot sun of the daytime the darkness of 
the night the stars and the cold they were truly terrible days 
gonzalez said the most critical point of the 3600mile journey 
was being without water for four days there was a moment when 
were drinking the blood of a turtle and i looked at pastor and he 
was foaming at the mouth gonzalez said 
after a news conference the sailors headed for the cathedral at 
nearby cartago to give thanks for their rescue 
the cairo iii was left where the tuna boat found it drifting in 
the pacific stripped of much of its wood by the stranded fishermen 
desperate for firewood 
an official at the puntarenas naval base said the cairo iii and 
its crew may have broken the record for survival at sea 
the guinness book of world records lists the record for survival 
on a raft as 133 days set by a hong kong man who was adrift in the 
atlantic ocean from nov 23 1942 to april 5 1943 after his ship

the judge in the irancontra case signaled his 
determination wednesday to bring oliver l north to trial by 
ordering the fired white house aide to specify which government 
secrets he wants to disclose in court 
us district judge gerhard a gesell provisionally rejecting a 
defense challenge to the constitutionality of the classified 
information procedures act announced what he termed a possible 
remedy to the problems posed by reams of secret documents collected 
by independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
gesell gave north until july 11 to list the classified documents 
he wants to disclose in his defense against charges he conspired 
with former national security adviser john m poindexter and arms 
dealers albert hakim and richard v secord to illegally divert 
iranian armssale profits to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
gesells ruling coupled with last weeks finding that walsh did 
not make use of three defendants immunized congressional 
testimony is a further indication the judge is trying to fashion 
procedures for bringing north to trial by this fall 
gesell has ordered separate trials for the other defendants 
the defense contended that a requirement in the classified 
information law that it notify the government before trial what 
secrets it wants to disclose would tip walsh to its strategy 
putting the defendants at a tactical disadvantage 
lawyers for north and his codefendants asked gesell to declare 
the law unconstitutional as applied to the case 
gesell acknowledged that a strict application of the 1980 law 
would be impossible because of the cases broad intrusion into 
classified areas of information 
walsh has identified some 50000 pages of classified documents 
that might be relevant to the defense plus an additional 150000 
pages at various stages of review by an interagency task force 
it probably was never contemplated that classified information 
problems of this magnitude would be presented to a trial judge in a 
single case the judge said 
but he said that when congress enacted the law it gave trial 
judges leeway to fashion creative and fair solutions to 
problems posed by a large number of classified materials 
while afforded this leeway the court is unable to determine 
definitively at this stage whether or not the classified document 
problems presented by this case can be resolved gesell said 
it proposes to make the effort but the complexity of the 
situation defies obvious answers final ruling on the defense 
motion must await further developments 
a way must be found to preserve defendants constitutional 
rights that still affords adequate protection or national security 
concerns the judge said 
accordingly gesell said he will initially review norths list 
of secret documents without consulting with the prosecution 
the judge scheduled a closed hearing for july 14 to be attended 
only by north and his lawyers to hear arguments why certain 
government documents are relevant to the case 
gesell said the documents deemed relevant will be reviewed by 
the interagency task force to determine whether the disclosure in 
court of any documents would compromise national security he gave 
the task force until aug 1 to complete this task 
after that gesell said he would conduct closed hearings with 
both the prosecution and defense to determine a way to disclose the 
information contained in the sensitive documents without 
compromising secrecy 
the law empowers the court to order substitution of a document 
with a statement of facts it would prove if it were introduced at 
trial but if there is a sufficiently large number of documents 
that cannot be disclosed in court the judge could dismiss the 
charges 
gesell said he wont review norths trial testimony in advance 
but when and if he is about to testify his counsel will advise 
the court if it then appears the testimony will involve classified 
national security disclosures beyond those authorized in prior 
rulings 
in a statement walshs office said we are pleased with judge 
gesells ruling on the constitutionality of the classified 
information procedures act as it applies to this case and we are 
prepared to move forward as directed by the court 
in a brief footnote gesell again rejected the defenses request 
for a large array of highly sensitive government documents 
including records of a telephone conversation between president 
reagan and a foreign leader and two meetings vice president george 
bush had with a foreign leader neither leader was identified

democratic officials said wednesday that a 
preliminary draft platform will be waiting for a platformwriting 
panel when it resumes work friday in denver 
the draft will incorporate the language from issue papers 
hammered out by party staff members and representatives of the 
michael dukakis and jesse jackson campaigns at an earlier session 
of the democratic platform drafting committee 
the platform committee also released two final working papers on 
national security and political empowerment the former reflects 
the dukakis campaigns insistence that the platform call for 
stable defense budgets not the freeze that jackson wants the 
latter in a nod to jackson commits the party to removing 
impediments to the oneperson onevote principle 
rosemary freeman executive director of the democratic platform 
committee said the preliminary draft was still being completed 
she said it contains language from the issue papers that emerged 
from the june 1012 sessions on mackinac island mich 
michael barnes a former maryland congressman who is the chief 
dukakis liaison with the platform committee said there will be 
a draft put before the members friday morning referring to the 
issue papers he said it pulls them all together 
but barnes added that the two sides have not settled differences 
on whether the platform should advocate higher taxes on the rich 
and a pentagon freeze as jackson wants 
whatever emerges friday from the 16member drafting committee 
chaired by rep william h gray iii dpa will be subject to 
further discussion and revision when the full 186member platform 
committee meets over the weekend in denver it will be the first 
meeting for the full committee 
freeman said the preliminary draft was a collective effort 
by the same party and campaign representatives who produced the 
earlier papers on the economy drugs education civil rights and 
other issues grays group also agreed on mackinac island to brand 
south africa a terrorist state 
the new working paper on national security says 
our strength has been sapped by a defense establishment that 
has wasted money on duplicative and dubious new weapons instead of 
investing more in readiness and mobility we further believe that 
our strength is enhanced by stable defense budgets and by a 
commitment by our allies to assure their fair share of the costs 
and responsibilities required to maintain peace and liberty 
it says the democrats will promote peace and prevent war not 
by trading weapons for hostages not by sending brave americans to 
undefined missions in lebanon and honduras not by toasting a 
tyrant like marcos as a disciple of democracy but by maintaining a 
stable nuclear deterrent sufficient to counter any soviet threat 
in standing up to any american adversary whenever necessary and 
sitting down with him whenever possible 
it says the democrats will promote human rights and decry 
oppression in nations friendly and unfriendly communist and 
anticommunist 
it charges the republicans abandoned the peace process in the 
middle east and have consistently undermined it in central 
america 
it calls for maintaining the special relationship with 
israel while promoting a middle east agreement that reflects the 
camp david accords 
it says that a democratic administration will end all vestiges 
of the failed policy of constructive engagement and will declare 
south africa a terrorist state and impose comprehensive 
sanctions 
the paper on political empowerment would commit the party to 
sameday voter registration and registration by mail 
we must remove impedidents to the oneperson onevote 
principle by ending those schemes that dilute the effect of an 
individuals vote it says it also calls for statehood for the 
district of columbia and promises to minimize the domination and 
distortion of our elections by moneyed interests 
jackson who won 29 percent of the primary votes and has 27 
percent of the national convention delegates in the latest 
associated press tally has complained about the way delegates were 
allocated in some states

republican george bush resumed criticism of michael dukakis on 
wednesday saying he has waffled on major issues and permitted a 
murderer to win a prison furlough dukakis his search for a 
running mate in full swing said jesse jackson was getting very 
serious consideration 
bush denied he was engaging in namecalling in his attacks on 
dukakis and said he would continue to point out differences between 
himself and the democratic presidential nomineetobe 
its the record what he favors and what i favor its not 
namecalling the vice president and republican presidential 
candidate told reporters aboard air force two en route to 
louisville ky 
bush also accused dukakis in his talk with reporters of waffling 
on many issues including public statements on the b1 bomber 
dukakis opposed the b1 but aides say he would not cancel 
contracts for purchases 
people need to know wheres the guy coming from bush said 
dukakis spending the day in boston was peppered with questions 
about his vice presidential search including the polling his 
campaign is conducting on the running mate question and requests 
for background information from at least two potential candidates 
the massachusetts governor also picked up the endorsement of 
former rival sen joseph biden of delaware who dropped out of the 
race in september 
bidens departure came after dukakis top aide john sasso 
distributed an attack video that depicted biden borrowing 
without credit a speech by a british politician biden quit as 
other allegations of plagiarism and resumepuffing surfaced sasso 
left the dukakis campaign after admitting his role in the incident 
on the matter of a running mate dukakis said jacksons lack of 
government experience does not necessarily rule him out for the 
no 2 spot on the democratic ticket and said he was getting very 
serious consideration 
he sidestepped questions about whether jackson would be a 
liability on the ticket based on public polls 
im not going to be checking a lot of polls believe me 
dukakis said we all have our strengths and our weaknesses 
jackson refusing to concede the democratic presidential 
nomination to dukakis despite the massachusetts governors delegate 
majority spoke to a union audience in california and later 
declined to say if he wanted the vice presidential nomination 
i have not yet made that decision he said despite earlier 
statements that it should be offered to him jackson aide ron brown 
said that when the two met on tuesday jackson did not ask for the 
no 2 spot 
appearing before the same union of government workers where 
dukakis stressed increased health care programs a day earlier 
jackson dismissed dukakis plan for national health insurance as 
not sufficient 
jackson offered his own broader program but said he would 
support dukakis plan as better than nothing 
holding a statehouse news conference dukakis said his search 
for a running mate would expand beyond the candidates who have been 
asked for background information they include jackson and sen bob 
graham dfla 
one senator popular with dukakis sen bill bradley of new 
jersey has said he is not interested in joining the ticket and 
according to his office has not been asked to provide background 
information 
but dukakis said that doesnt mean bradley has been ruled out 
he pointedly said bradley has not told me personally that he 
shouldnt be considered but bradleys office said flatly the new 
jersey senator is not interested 
bush spoke to the national sheriffs association where he called 
for tougher sentences for crimes against law enforcement officers 
and said bulletproof armor should be made available to every 
officer in the nation who wants it 
he avoided mentioning dukakis by name but again pointed to what 
has become a favorite target a massachusetts prison furlough 
system administered by dukakis as governor 
bush recounted details of the case of willy horton a convicted 
massachusetts murderer who was released on a weekend furlough and 
accused of raping a maryland woman while he was free 
the view that all convicts can be rehabilitated is not just 
naive its dead wrong bush said 
when firstdegree murderers sentenced to life without parole 
get unsupervised weekend furloughs and commuted sentences that 
view goes from naive to dangerous from wellmeaning to 
irresponsible bush said 
bush also declared that for too many years weve been held 
hostage by wellmeaning but misguided politicians and judges who 
get their legal views from the aclu a reference to the american 
civil liberties union 
dukakis is a member of the aclu 
dukakis defended himself against bushs attacks saying he had 
tightened eligibility requirements to exclude firstdegree 
murderers from the furlough program 
he charged bush was focusing on the escape case because he had 
no record of his own on crime issues and pointed to decreased 
crime rates in his state 
dukakis attended an event touting a massachusetts state program 
that provides job training for welfare recipients it marked the 
graduation of the 50000th participant 
in other developments 
in atlanta where the democratic national convention will be 
held in less than a month host mayor andrew young said the city is 
85 to 90 percent ready for the convention that opens july 18 
he dismissed critics who say the preparations arent adequate 
i dont care what people say about atlanta young said 
anybody who doesnt like altanta can go somewhere else 
whatever we need for the convention is going to be ready by the 
time the convention gets here 
some of the rivals dukakis defeated for the nomination were 
pitching in to help dukakis raise money by attending a 
2500aperson dinner thursday in washington the money will go 
toward the 83 million the democratic party can spend on the fall 
election aside from federal campaign financing 
former candidates sen albert gore jr of tennessee rep 
richard gephardt of missouri and sen paul simon of illinois plan 
to attend 
credentials battles involving several states were resolved in 
private negotiations between jackson and dukakis campaigns 
increasing the potential for a peaceful democratic convention as a 
result jackson will pick up a handful of delegates in kansas and 
dukakis a few in maine

a former ministers wife who has been in a coma 
since she was attacked 14 months ago has improved but there is no 
way to know if she will ever communicate again a doctor said 
wednesday 
margaret peggy railey who was choked nearly to death in the 
garage of her dallas home last year entered baylor institute for 
rehabilitation under tightened security tuesday for a comprehensive 
recovery program 
mrs railey is the wife of a former prominent methodist 
minister walker railey who resigned his ministerial credentials 
and moved to california after the april 21 1987 attack 
no criminal charges have been filed but raileys attorney has 
characterized him as the prime suspect in the attack authorities 
say their investigation is at a standstill 
doctors will try to bring mrs railey out of the coma and 
develop therapies to improve her longterm comfort and care during 
the program which could last two months said dr william l 
parker medical director for the institute 
if we can establish anything that seems to stimulate a 
response that could be interpreted as functional then we would 
continue to try through repetition to improve on that and then 
other responses would follow parker said at a news conference 
wednesday 
mrs railey 39 had been in a nursing home in tyler 100 miles 
southeast of dallas since leaving another dallas hospital last 
fall parker said his team is making the first comprehensive 
evaluation of mrs raileys injuries at the request of her parents 
there has been what looks like some slight improvement in her 
condition parker said 
mrs raileys eyes sometimes focus and follow movement he said 
she also can turn her head and hear but doesnt process what she 
hears he added 
parker said he didnt think his team would be able to determine 
definitely whether mrs railey will communicate again 
theres no total way to tell parker said i cant say 
that she will never no i think the odds are probably going to be 
against it but time is the only thing thats going to tell 
railey former senior pastor at the first united methodist 
church in dallas said he found his wife unconscious on the garage 
floor of their home the night of the attack 
not long afterward railey attempted suicide later he moved to 
san francisco with a dallas psychologist lucy papillon who 
admitted a romantic relationship with railey dating back to 1986 
mrs raileys parents filed a civil lawsuit accusing their 
soninlaw in the attack railey failed to respond to the suit and 
a judge in april found him financially liable in the incident 
a jury trial is pending this summer to determine the damages 
railey must pay bill arnold lawyer for mrs raileys parents has 
said 
railey has not been contacted since he was served with notice of 
the lawsuit feb 2 he is believed to be in california 
parker said the hospital had taken extra security measures 
for mrs railey

ten years after rose hoffman began her 
search among the citys motorcycle gangs for her missing son 
police reported on wednesday they have charged three men with his 
murder 
it had to happen this way said hoffman 53 who held a 
large framed photograph of gus henry hoffman my gussie who 
was 20 when he disappeared off a street 
god knew if i found out then 10 years ago i wouldnt have 
been able to handle it im having a very hard time of it now 
hoffman said in a tearful interview 
hoffman never really expected gus to turn up alive he was last 
seen at an intersection being chased by two other motorcycles and a 
car filled with people police said they suspect he was killed for 
his motorcycle 
his body has not been found 
i have no grave to go to said hoffman it wont be over 
until i find my son 
hoffman is grateful for the work by detective sgt jeff ouimet 
and detective jack baxter who were assigned in february 1987 when 
the homicide bureau chief turned over some unsolved murders to 
night detectives 
what they did was fantastic said homicide sgt john kracht 
they just put it all together 
hoffman said she intends to see that the two officers are 
honored 
but she wonders why she had to spend a decade searching for tips 
in bikers bars and other unsavory hangouts before witnesses who 
kept silent for 10 years came forward 
i went everywhere she said night and day i lived this 
and my family suffered she and her husband are considering 
holding a memorial service for gus the secondborn of their four 
children 
san jose homicide lt richard gummow said wednesday afternoon 
case files were not immediately available for more details on mrs 
hoffman or how she investigated her sons death 
we reinterviewed a number of people many of them and some of 
those previously interviewed modified their statements and someone 
else came forward who had not come forward before gummow said 
police charged michael allen hodges 36 of sunnyvale and 
richard morris dollar 32 with murder in the case both are being 
held in santa clara county jail on 1 million bail 
a third man john michael sluggo stelle 47 has been a 
fugitive since february when he failed to report to his parole 
officer after serving time at san quentin prison for a drug 
conviction and parole violation 
one of the tips hoffman received during her investigation 
involved a fourth suspect michael lee stevenson a biker linked to 
the hells angels and the nowdefunct forgotten few stevenson was 
shot to death two years ago at age 37 by an elderly man stevenson 
tried to extort for property police said 
that animal said hoffman a biker girl told people who 
told me that stevenson said my son was dead and wed never find his 
body 
stevenson was convicted in 1981 of sexually assaulting and 
killing a modesto man who owed him money 
the suspects had come up before said ouimet but the 
witnesses were afraid to talk before stevenson was killed 
i know the witnesses were fearful said hoffman but they 
should turn it around and feel as a mother would then they would 
say please tell it like it is 
among the scraps of paper in hoffmans boxes of notes is a 
yellowed newspaper clip telling how stevenson was arrested in 1977 
and accused of holding a woman cative and torturing her while she 
was chained in a closet for a month the woman escaped to tell her 
story but stevenson who was bound over for trial was never 
convicted 
the girl he captured wouldnt testify against him because she 
feared for her life said hoffman if he had been put away 
then my son would be alive today

farm lawmakers responded to reports of a 
worsening drought by approving a broad blueprint for aid to the 
grain belt on wednesday but cautioned that producing actual 
legislation would take longer 
the bad news is that the drought is spreading its worsening 
something has to be done house agriculture committee chairman e 
kika de la garza dtexas told a congressional drought task 
force 
approval of the battle plan came after chief agriculture 
department meteorologist norton strommen warned lawmakers that rain 
must come to the central corn belt in three weeks or so to avoid 
the type of drought damage currently hitting the grain belt 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt 
issued a sharply worded warning to food companies not to take 
advantage of the drought to raise prices 
he noted that beef and pork prices actually are falling and said 
there was no reason to raise consumer prices although eventually 
there may be 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng said president reagan did 
not mean that he opposed federal aid to droughtstricken farmers 
when he suggested at a toronto news conference that there was 
little he could do 
lyng said reagan merely exhibited some of the frustration that 
some of the rest of us have that you cant do anything to make it 
rain he said the president actually favors some form of 
assistance 
the task force was formed a week ago to search for ways to 
combat the drought after lyng told lawmakers to be ready to pass an 
assistance package but not to make anything final until the full 
scope of the problem was known 
the battle plan approved by the task force contained a number of 
features that would not require congressional action 
it did call for action to guarantee the income of farmers in 
droughtstricken areas a move that eventually could wind up as the 
central feature of any drought bill approved by congress but it 
offered no specific means of doing so a number of ways have been 
suggested 
the blueprint called for speeded up action by the agriculture 
department to allow farmers in disaster counties to get 92 percent 
of their normal incomesupport payments even if they were 
prevented from planting a crop because of drought conditions 
this would be part of usdas zero92 program designed to cut 
the link between the amount of a farmers production and the amount 
of his federal payments believed by some to contribute to farm 
surpluses 
the task force plan urged maximum flexibility in applying a 
requirement that farmers must plant cover crops such as perenniel 
grasses on land idled for conservation uses 
the plan also would 
search for ways to make sure producers will have sufficient 
herds to resume livestock breeding when the drought ends breeders 
are selling off stock because of lack of feed 
assess the need for supplemental feeding programs for the poor 
next winter with an eye toward possible food scarcity caused by 
drought 
find ways to expand participation in the federal crop insurance 
program 
use all authority provided in last years bailout bill for the 
financially troubled farm credit system to restructure loan 
repayments for farmers hard hit by drought 
provide emergency loans to farmers if drought conditions 
persist 
task force members have been attempting to discourage their 
fellow lawmakers from dumping a spate of electionyear drought aid 
bills in the hopper but two michigan lawmakers pushed ahead 
wednesday saying there was no time for delay 
sen don riegle dmich and rep bob traxler dmich offered 
a measure that would use inkind payments to reimburse farmers for 
up to 50 percent of their major losses traxler said the 
legislation had no dollar limit and that it might not pass this 
year

president reagan acknowledged wednesday that 
many items on his agenda will be left to his successor and he urged 
the next administration to continue his push for freer markets and 
more open trade 
we must leave whatever part of our agenda is unfinished to 
those who will follow us trusting that they will benefit from the 
lessons we have learned reagan told a dinner gathering of the 
nations leading business executives 
the president used the speech to review the outcome of this 
weeks sevennation economic summit in toronto but he also touched 
upon his legacy an issue that has been creeping into his comments 
in recent weeks 
reagan who has less than seven months left in office asserted 
that his philosophy of free enterprise and belief in the creative 
power of the individual must be allowed to flourish if the united 
states is to retain a robust economy and a position of leadership 
among the economic powers 
the president spoke to the business roundtable an organization 
of top executives of the nations leading 200 corporations 
in his speech reagan pointed to the uscanadian free trade 
agreement as an example of what remains left to be accomplished in 
his term as wel as something the nations future leaders should 
build on 
he called the pact one that will show the better way because 
it will do away with all the bitterness all the destructiveness 
of round upon round of trade battles 
i would hope that those who follow me will not view it as an 
item of finished business but rather as only a beginning reagan 
said i would hope that americas leaders will fix upon the 
vision of a day when all borders become what the uscanadian 
border so long has been a meeting place rather than a dividing 
line 
he said he even hoped that the free flow of trade will come 
to envelope the entire western hemisphere in a bond of mutually 
beneficial exchange 
reagan said his years in office have done much to act upon 
the vision of economic freedom and the proof is that his 
administration has paved the way to new jobs lower taxes steady 
growth 
saying the nation stands on the verge of an economic and 
technological future of vast promise reagan warned against 
those voices that would construct barriers on this road of 
economic prosperity 
and with a nod to november reagan intimated that the choice 
between a democratic or republican president may be a referendum on 
his beliefs 
these are the decisions that will be made over the next 
several months individual opportunity and incentive or renewed 
government restriction and burden he said 
his policies reagan asserted have gotten attention even in the 
communist bloc 
around the world reagan said state control of the economy is 
loosening in favor of freer markets the lesson is clear if you 
want economic growth work for economic and individual freedom 
after my visit to moscow its my belief that human 
creativity expressed in economic freedom can transform even the 
nations of the soviet bloc he said 
but reagan acknowledged that he didnt always get his way during 
his threeday session in toronto with the leaders of the worlds 
most powerful democracies the presidents call for the total 
elimination of agricultural subsidies by the year 2000 was rejected 
by his summit colleagues 
in toronto the other leaders and i confirmed once more that 
free markets must be our goal that doesnt mean that areas of 
disagreement dont remain reagan said 
he acknowledged that many believe the meetings are just so 
much sound and fury but he insisted that the leaders are working 
more closely together than ever before and the summits are a key 
reason why 
even during last years stock market crash the international 
economy stayed steady working together we guided the world ship 
through the storm he said

prime minister margaret thatcher of britain 
praised canadas trade agreement with the united states on 
wednesday and opposition legislators accused her of interfering 
mrs thatcher addressing parliament was cheered repeatedly by 
prime minister brian mulroneys conservatives as she also urged 
nato to modernize its nuclear arsenal despite soviet moves toward 
liberalization 
on the basis of britains experience of joining the european 
community you need have no fear that canadas national personality 
will be in any way diminished the british conservative party 
leader said of the trade agreement with canadas giant southern 
neighbor 
fifteen years of ec membership have left our people no less 
british and no less proud of their history and independence said 
mrs thatcher who stopped in the capital for a day on the way home 
from the sevennation economic summit in toronto 
after the speech to a joint meeting of the house of commons and 
senate her second in five years mrs thatcher signed agreements 
on drugs and air services with mulroney 
ed broadbent leader of the opposition new democratic party 
said mrs thatcher abused her diplomatic status by praising the 
free trade agreement before parliament 
the pact signed by mulroney and president reagan in january 
which must be approved by parliament and congress would eliminate 
trade barriers over a 10year period and more closely integrate the 
two economies 
opposition leaders claim canada sacrifices soverignty in the 
agreement including control of its energy and natural resources 
along with opposition liberals the new democrats also sat in 
silent disapproval while mrs thatcher urged nato to modernize its 
nuclear and conventional arsenals the new democrats oppose 
canadian membership in the 16nation north atlantic treaty 
organization 
canadian television carried the address live underlining mrs 
thatchers high profile during the threeday summit of the united 
states france britain west germany italy japan and canada 
the drugs agreement was part of a british bid to get some 40 
nations to sign a reciprocal agreement allowing for the seizure of 
trafficking profits and making money laundering an offense britain 
and the united states have signed a similar agreement

house republican leader robert h michel on 
wednesday requested a house vote on a senatepassed welfare 
overhaul bill saying there isnt enough time to work out a 
compromise with a much more expensive house bill 
normally i would not be inclined to suggest such a course of 
action michel rill said in a letter to house speaker jim 
wright dtexas 
but michel said the time and the opportunity for welfare 
reform and the hope it holds out for many american families is 
slipping beyond our grasp because the end of the 100th congress 
is approaching he said the needs of welfare families could be best 
served by setting the house bill aside 
but rep tom downey dny chairman of the house subcommittee 
that handled the welfare bill dismissed michels concerns as 
nonsense 
the 28 billion senate bill and the 7 billion house bill both 
centered on a major new jobs education and training program for 
welfare recipients are awaiting reconciliation in a housesenate 
conference committee 
michel said only 25 working days at most are left before the 
last push of the congress in september after which members will 
return home to campaign for reelection 
such constraints make the prospects for a successful 
conference and a presidential signature very dim michel wrote 
michel cited last weeks 933 vote for the senate bill sponsored 
by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny as evidence of a powerful 
bipartisan consensus 
he said the house which passed its bill much more narrowly and 
along party lines could muster similar broad support if we can 
bring ourselves to relinquish pride of authorship as well as some 
both controversial and costly provisions 
i believe that i could convince the president to sign such a 
bill michel said 
sticking points between the house and senate negotiators are 
likely to include 
a house provision giving states financial incentives to raise 
cash benefits not included in the senate bill 
cash benefits to poor twoparent families which the house 
requires yearround and the senate requires for only six of any 12 
months 
the amount of federal money available for the jobs education 
and training programs the states will have to set up the senate 
bill starts at 500 million and moves gradually to 1 billion the 
house bill is uncapped 
downey said he and moynihan are the best of friends and can 
deal with these problems thoughtfully and quickly 
he added there is no need for house to somehow suggest that 
welfare reform can only be dealt with by the senate we have a 
better bill and i think we will make their bill better

joan galvin the daughter of a defense 
consultant under investigation in the pentagon fraud case will no 
longer handle military issues for rep andy ireland rfla an 
aide to ireland said wednesday 
but ms galvin 28 remains on irelands staff as a legislative 
assistant dealing with labor tax and veterans matters among other 
things said doug hattaway irelands spokesman 
hattaway said the congressman and ms galvin agreed it would put 
her in an untenable position to continue dealing with military 
affairs since her father william galvin is a principal in the 
investigation 
moreover ms galvin would face a possible conflict of interest 
if the house armed services committee of which ireland is a 
member investigates the allegations of fraud at the pentagon 
hattaway said 
federal agents searched galvins office as well as that of his 
stepson ken brooke in their investigation of allegations that 
consultants provided defense contractors with information obtained 
illegally from the defense department no charges have been brought 
galvin who has links to several of the subjects of the 
wideranging investigation has not returned several telephone 
calls placed to his office 
joan galvin joined irelands staff in 1985 18 months before the 
congressman was named to the armed services panel he sits on a 
procurement subcommittee 
she was hired through a jobplacement service on capitol hill 
where she formerly worked for rep larry hopkins rky hattaway 
said 
ireland is one of five congressmen who have been reported as 
under scrutiny in the probe though all have said they are not part 
of the inquiry 
the others are reps bill chappell dfla chairman of the 
house appropriations defense subcommittee thomas downey dny 
samuel s stratton dny chairman of the house armed services 
procurement subcommittee roy dyson dmd a member of strattons 
subcommittee along with ireland 
henry hudson the us attorney for the eastern district of 
virginia who is heading the investigation told congressional 
leaders wednesday that no subpoena has been sought for any member 
of congress no wiretap has been directed at any member of congress 
and no search warrant has been directed at any member of 
congress according to house speaker jim wright dtexas

the house beat back an attempt wednesday to 
divert 400 million from space station funds to social programs and 
voted to appropriate 107 billion to run the national aeronautics 
and space administration next year 
the measure still must pass the senate whose appropriations 
committee on wednesday also voted 107 billion for nasa the 
senate bill however assumes that 600 million will be transferred 
to the space station from unspent defense funds 
that proposed fund transfer was called unacceptable in a letter 
that president reagan sent to sen john c stennis dmiss and 
mark hatfield rore the chairman and ranking minority member of 
the appropriations committee 
at the same time however the president said that letting the 
space station wither for lack of funds would be totally 
unacceptable 
nasa had asked for 967 million in the fiscal year that begins 
oct 1 to start the design phase of the 16 billion space station 
under the bill passed by the house the agency would get 902 
million 
the nasa funds are part of a 597 billion appropriation bill 
for the department of housing and urban development and 15 
independent agencies that passed the house 37740 
that appropriation is 4 percent or 24 billion more than the 
current level and 2 percent or 1 billion more than the reagan 
administration had requested it provides substantially more 
funding than the administration requested for lowincome housing 
assistance community development block grants environmental 
protection agency construction grants and pollution control and 
veterans medical care 
before voting on the appropriations bill the house turned down 
256166 an amendment by rep charles e schumer dny that would 
have distributed 400 million from space station funds among 
programs for the homeless veterans and the elderly and urban 
development 
this amendment is a disaster said rep jack brooks dtex 
whose district includes the johnson space center 
on the senate side one appropriations subcommittee had voted 
only 200 million last week for starting the design phase of the 
16 billion space station a level that would not allow the program 
to go forward on tuesday another senate subcommittee acted to add 
600 million by transferring unspent defense funds 
the full appropriations committee on wednesday voted the 200 
million the committee was expected to approve the 600 million 
transfer from defense funds on thursday 
i wish the administration would work with us on this sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas told reporters frankly i think we have 
a way of accomplishing the objective i was very pleased to see the 
house beat back an amendment that would have in effect gutted the 
space station it shows there is strong support for it 
in his letter reagan recalled that he had made the space 
station a priority and that he had asked nearly a billion dollars 
for it next year 
this is not the time to turn our backs on the future or on 
needed defense spending the president said 
funding the station with only 200 million would be totally 
unacceptable reagan wrote adding equally unacceptable 
however would be any plan that takes critical funds away from 
another national priority our countrys defense budget 
he said such a money shift would be not only counterproductive 
for both the defense and space station programs but funding the 
space station at the expense of national security violates the 
budget agreement that the white house reached with the 
congressional leadership last november 
the president offered no substitute money source 
the united states is about to sign agreements with the european 
space agency canada and japan for their participation in the 
station agreements that call for the partners to spend a total of 
7 billion 
the congress failure now to fund adequately this vital 
project will significantly undermine our national space effort and 
raise serious questions about our reliability as a leader and 
partner reagan said

three lebaneseborn canadians who the 
government alleged were members of a middle east terrorist group 
were sentenced wednesday to up to 16 years in prison for smuggling 
a bomb into the united states 
us district court judge albert coffrin told the men it didnt 
matter to him whether they belonged to an extremist political 
party but he said there was little doubt that the explosive device 
the men had been carrying could have caused serious damage 
the lethal potential however is clear coffrin said any 
victim of a bombing is an innocent victim 
coffrin sentenced george younan and codefendant walid kabbani 
to 16 years each in federal prison walid mourad who pleaded 
guilty before the others went to trial was sentenced to eight 
years in prison the men faced maximum sentences of as much as 35 
years 
the defense attorneys claimed victory with the sentences saying 
they were less than 20year terms that the government had offered 
in a plea bargain that the defendants rejected 
the attorneys had described their clients as bunglers rather 
than terrorists but even they say they have no idea what the men 
were planning to do with the bomb younan and kabbani pleaded 
innocent but never testified in their trial 
us attorney george terwilliger iii said the sentence was 
appropriate saying their acts attacked the country at its very 
foundations and that violence in the pursuit of any goal is 
unsatisfactory 
the three were arrested last october and charged with smuggling 
a homemade bomb into the united states through richford a small 
town on the vermontcanadian border 
the us government claimed the men were members of the syrian 
social nationalist party the party was founded in the 1930s and 
was devoted to the formation of greater syria which would have 
united lebanon and what was then palestine but is now israel 
under syrian hegemony 
floyd clarke an assistant director of the fbis criminal 
investigative division said members of the group have claimed 
responsibility for the 1982 assasination of lebanese 
presidentelect bashir gemayel 
last month justice department spokesman john russell said the 
men were believed to be the first alleged middle eastern terrorists 
arrested in the united states carrying explosives 
attorneys for kabbani and mourad have denied their clients were 
members of the ssnp a cousin of younans said younan belonged to 
the party but denied that it was a terrorist group 
none of the three defendents addressed the judge wednesday 
their attorneys said the governments allegations of their 
political affiliations were greatly exaggerated 
he says im not a terrorist kabbanis attorney mark 
keller said he simply says i know what i am he asked me not 
to beg on his behalf not to grovel on his behalf 
but terwilliger dismissed defense claims that the men were 
amateurs 
there is a real naivete at work when you look at these 
individuals as bumblers or amateurs or whatnot or that they dont 
look like terrorists he said what do terrorists look like 
what someone out of central casting out of hollywood would decide

in its first proposal aimed at protecting 
groundwater from pesticides the environmental protection agency 
said wednesday it will require at least 10 states to adopt 
additional controls on highly toxic aldicarb or lose use of that 
chemical 
aldicarb sold under the trade name temik has been found in 
groundwater in 16 states in 11 of them in concentrations above 
what epa considers safe 
the proposal published for public comment contained an 
alternative that could require as many as 24 states to act 
the 24 were not identified but epa said the 10 from which it 
plans to require pesticide management plans are pennsylvania 
michigan north dakota georgia and alabama where aldicarb has not 
been found and maine new york wisconsin minnesota and florida 
where it has been found in concentrations above epas health 
advisory of 10 parts per billion sometimes 50 times greater 
but epa considers the 10 states it selected the most vunerable 
because of the characteristics of the groundwater and the pattern 
of aldicarb use in those states the proposal comes as a result of 
epas draft groundwater strategy which would leave most key 
decisions to the states 
aldicarb also has been found in california massachusetts north 
carolina new jersey rhode island and virgina in concentrations 
above 10 ppb and in arizona arkansas oregon texas and washington 
below that overall onethird of some 35000 groundwater samples 
tested by epa contained some aldicarb 
florida new york and wisconsin have aggressive aldicarb 
programs of their own said john a moore epas assistant 
administrator for pesticides 
the only manufacturer rhonepoulenc ag co of research triangle 
park nc would be required to monitor groundwater in 16 other 
states where epa considers it highly vulnerable 
those states are connecticut hawaii idaho illinois indiana 
kansas massachusetts missouri montana nebraska new hampshire 
ohio rhode island south carolina south dakota and vermont 
the draft would forbid use of aldicarb within 300 feet of a 
well and would add label warnings that would force state training 
programs for applicators to discuss groundwater 
epa said it was still checking residues on food but 
rhonepoulenc said a new study showed residues were rarely 
present 
the company said epas plan reflects sound principles for 
drinking water protection and said it would cooperate 
the us public interest research group which frequently argues 
for tighter pesticide controls attacked the agencys plan as 
insufficient to prevent contamination of future drinking water 
much of the criticism was directed at the agencys draft 
groundwater strategy which would permit states to decide that some 
groundwater should not be protected 
asked if states could submit plans that permit aldicarb 
contamination of groundwater moore said i would say yes but we 
would require them to clearly state that to the citizens of the 
state and the citizens would have to have a chance to comment 
if a state refuses to submit a plan i would say we would 
cancel the use of adlicarb in that state moore told reporters 
epas decision is not a license to pollute up to 10 ppb 
moore said if youve got 10 ppb youve failed i would expect at 
1 ppb about the limit of detection you would kick in step two 
of the management plan more heroic surveillance additional 
restrictions on use and things like that 
state plans might also ban use in certain areas or at certain 
times like rainy months reduce peracre use limit frequency of 
application or other measures 
because their own wells are often contaminated there is such 
an interest on the part of people that use this i think the 
chance of compliance is very high compared with a lot of things we 
do moore said 
epa expects to adopt aldicarb requirements in about a year and 
state plans under it should take effect two years from then 
as much as 57 million pounds of aldicarb are used each year to 
protect potatoes citrus peanuts and other crops against insects 
root worms and mites epa said banning aldicarb could cost farmers 
135 million 
widespread contamination of groundwater frequently at 200 ppb 
or more led suffolk county on new yorks long island to ban its 
use and 3100 homes have costly activated carbon filters on their 
wells 
more than 1000 people were reported poisoned in 1985 in seven 
western states and canada from california watermelons contaminated 
with aldicarb two babies were stillborn 
aldicarb breaks down in soil in a few weeks but in groundwater 
it can last decades 
it works by inhibiting nerve transmission and can cause 
digestive upset dehydration blurred vision disorientation 
seizures unconsciousness and eventually death

residents of this southern illinois town 
thought they were building for the future when they loaned 63000 
to attract a new doctor but the intended doctor developed cancer 
and filed for bankruptcy before completing his training 
im losing a lot of sleep about some of these widows that 
helped recruit a doctor said james rowland 45 i just cant 
pay them back 
i just dont know what to say 
the town has other doctors but residents arent happy about 
losing the money 
sometimes you win and sometimes you lose said investor 
edward d taylor sr adding that the city just had some bad 
luck 
residents of this town of 5100 contributed 63000 in loans and 
outright donations to the vandalia civic advancement association to 
attract rowland at least 45 investors loaned between 250 and 
10000 each 
the association loaned the money to rowland who came to town in 
1980 with his wife ann a registered nurse with the county health 
department and two daughters aged 10 and 13 
however rowland developed cancer in his left kidney and had it 
removed by july 1983 cancer has spread since into his bones and 
cannot be treated rowland believes he has little chance for 
recovery 
the illness kept him from completing a residency program or 
repaying his loans a former chemical engineer in pittsburgh 
rowland enrolled at the american university of the caribbean for 
four years or medical school in 1975 he said he subsequently 
received clinical training at three chicago hospitals 
the civic association has no cash to repay the investors 
president steve stombaugh said it tried to recoup the money by 
suing rowland in fayette county circuit court in april for 
13115176 to cover the loans and interest 
but rowland stalled the lawsuit by filing for bankruptcy may 18 
his first meeting with creditors is set for thursday at the keller 
ramada inn in effingham 
theres no argument i owe the money rowland said they 
raised it in good faith and i came here in good faith but i had an 
illness 
documents on file in us district court in east st louis show 
rowland has earned no income since 1986 his wife made 22684 in 
1987 
about the only way investors appear likely to recoup their money 
is if rowland dies the civic association has 100000 in life 
insurance on rowland and his wife he said 
they didnt take out disability insurance

about 8000 people gathered 
wednesday night to pay tribute to six british soldiers killed by an 
irish republican army bomb explosion 
in another development a sniper shot a british soldier in the 
arm wednesday in belfast but the man was not seriously wounded 
police said the outlawed ira claimed responsibility for the 
shooting 
security forces checked all cars entering this town seven miles 
from belfast and armed soldiers patrolled from rooftops as 
townspeople gathered for a memorial service in lisburns market 
square 
mourners many weeping laid wreaths at a simple monument by the 
traffic lights where the soldiers van blew up june 15 as they were 
returning to their barracks after taking part in a charity footrace 
a bugler played taps as mayor billy bleakes laid a wreath on 
behalf of lisburn home of the british army headquarters in 
northern ireland 
the rev howard cromie former presbyterian moderator for the 
province observed that both protestants and roman catholics turned 
out for the service 
there is no difference between catholic tears and protestant 
tears when tragedy strikes he said 
the way forward cromie added is certainly not down the 
blind alley of retaliation reprisals for that is something which 
must be repudiated in the strongest possible terms 
three of the six soldiers killed in the bombing were buried with 
full military honors wednesday in their hometowns in mainland 
britain 
in claiming responsibility for the bombing the ira vowed to 
wage unceasing war against british security forces in the 
province 
the guerrilla group in its modern form has been fighting for 
nearly 20 years to force the british from northern ireland and 
unite the protestantdominated province with the mainly catholic 
irish republic to the south 
earlier wednesday sir john hermon the provinces police chief 
for eight years announced that he will retire next year 
hermon 59 chief constable of the royal ulster constabulary 
could have stayed on until 1994 the mandatory retirement age is 
65 but he said that after 38 years on the force he felt it was 
time to retire 
he said his decision had nothing to do with allegations that his 
force operated a shoottokill policy six years ago 
john stalker a police officer from england appointed to inquire 
into the six killings by the police was suddenly pulled out of 
northern ireland before completing his task 
stalker later quit the police and wrote a book claiming hermon 
refused to cooperate with him and that there was a conspiracy to 
conceal the truth 
at his news conference hermon repeated his earlier dismissal of 
the book as rubbish

sen edward m kennedy unveiled a scaleddown 
proposal wednesday to increase the federal minimum wage 120 to 
455 an hour over the next three years 
the laborsupported proposal from the massachusetts democrat 
came as the senate labor committee began deliberations on kennedys 
earlier minimum wage bill republican sens strom thurmond of south 
carolina and dan quayle of indiana immediately expressed their 
opposition 
kennedys original bill would have boosted the minimum wage now 
at 335 per hour by 50 cents next year 40 cents in 1990 and 40 
cents in 1991 with automatic increases tied to inflation to keep 
it at 50 percent of the average wage nationally 
the house labor committee already has completed action on a 
measure that would raise the federal minimum wage to 505 an hour 
over the next four years it is understood however that the house 
panels chairman rep augustus f hawkins dcalif will offer 
the kennedy proposal as a substitute when the measure gets to the 
house floor sometime after the july 4 recess 
in its brief meeting wednesday the senate labor committee 
rejected 124 an amendment by sen paul simon dill who wanted 
puerto rico to be required to keep the federal minimum wage 
kennedys proposal includes puerto rico but permits the country 
to exempt itself if the islands minimum wage board certifies to 
the labor secretary that there is a substantial finding of 
unemployment 
in introducing his substitute bill kennedy said the current 
minimum wage has fallen to its lowest point since its inception 50 
years ago with todays minimum of 335 per hour representing only 
36 percent of the average hourly earnings 
historically he said the minimum has been maintained at a 
figure of onehalf the hourly average 
congressional action to restore the minimum wage is long 
overdue he said 
thurmond said however said he was opposed to a significant 
increase in the minimum wage because it is inflationary it 
reduces entrylevel and parttime jobs for teenagers and unskilled 
workers as well as decreases services to consumers 
he said only big labor would benefit from an increased 
minimum wage 
minimum wage legislation has always been promoted by labor 
unions and other special interest groups for their purely 
selfserving political considerations thurmond said the labor 
unions in our country are looking to this measure as a means of 
securing their positions and turning around a decline in membership 
that they have experienced in recent years 
quayle said he would propose an amendment which would increase 
the minimum wage to 4 and combine it with a reform of the earned 
income tax credit similar to an approach presented in the house 
labor committee by rep tom petri rwis but rejected by the 
panel

whose offices were searched last week is cooperating with the 
government in the pentagon bribery probe sources familiar with the 
investigation said wednesday night 
another pentagon official whose offices were searched victor 
cohen also is negotiating with the government on whether to 
cooperate with authorities said the sources speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
the twoyear probe included wiretaps on the telephones of gaines 
and cohen 
shortly after the investigation became public june 14 federal 
investigators sounded out gaines about the possibility of 
delivering information to the government said the sources 
gaines made an appointment to hire a washingtonarea defense 
lawyer but then abruptly canceled the meeting after getting a call 
from a federal investigator who told him that you have until 9 
am tomorrow to decide whose side youre on according to one 
source gaines decided several days ago to cooperate said the 
sources 
abc news reported that the government has made no deal with 
gaines for lenient treatment in a possible prosecution but that 
such an arrangement is expected later abc news also reported that 
another key figure in the probe former pentagonofficialturned 
consultant melvyn paisley has so far refused to help authorities 
paisleys attorney lawrence barcella refused to comment 
gaines was deputy assistant navy secretary for acquisition 
management while cohen was deputy assistant air force secretary in 
charge of buying tactical command control communications and 
computer systems because of the bribery investigation both men 
have been reassigned to jobs having nothing to do with procurement 
the offices of both men were searched and sealed last week by 
fbi agents as investigators obtained 38 search warrants in 12 
states to seize documents at the offices of 15 defense contractors

the house of commons gave overwhelming approval 
wednesday to a 1987 accord recognizing quebec as a distinct 
society and bringing the frenchmajority province back into the 
constitution 
but the vote of 200 to 7 was not the final hurdle for the 
controversial meech lake accord signed by the federal government 
and all 10 provinces at meech lake quebec 
the historic change also requires ratification by the 10 
provinces and so far only five have done so at least two have 
demanded amendments before putting the accord to a vote 
eightyone percent of quebecs population speaks french the 
provinces official language quebec has its own system of civil 
law established by its french founders and proponents of the 1987 
accord want constitutional guarantees their legal and social 
traditions will not be altered by the federal government 
prominent opponents of the pact include former liberal prime 
minister pierre trudeau who claims it will erode ottawas power and 
lead to the disintegration of the canadian federation 
conservative prime minister brian mulroney a native of quebec 
has made a constitutional settlement with quebec one of his main 
priorities he says arguments over special rights for other 
minority regions native groups and women can be settled later 
the liberaldominated senate an appointed body held up the 
accord for months but all of its proposed changes were defeated 
when the measure was sent back to the elected house of commons 
the leaders of both opposition parties john turner of the 
liberals and ed broadbent of the socialist new democrats voted for 
the accord and persuaded most of their followers to do likewise 
however members from the northwest territories and yukon 
territory voted against meech lake because it will make it more 
difficult for their remote regions to become full provinces 
under the accord the approval of all provinces will be needed 
before the territories can obtain provincehood at present it only 
requires approval by twothirds of the provinces containing at 
least 50 percent of the canadian population 
the house of commons originally ratified the accord 24216 in 
october but the senate sent it back with amendments requiring a 
second final vote 
quebec has boycotted constitutional affairs since 1981 when 
trudeau repatriated the constitution from britain and added a new 
charter of rights and freedoms but failed to recognize quebecs 
distinct culture

the coast guard set limits wednesday on 
the number of barges towboats can work on the droughtshoaled 
mississippi river while a growing backlog of hundreds of delayed 
barges accumulated at memphis 
the new rules which apply from caruthersville mo to 
greenville miss are the first such restrictions set for a major 
portion of the mississippi though temporary barge limits have been 
imposed for small areas said coast guard cmdr michael donohoe 
with the new limits southbound towboats must have no more than 
20 barges while northbound boats will be limited to 25 only 16 of 
which can be loaded barges can draw a maximum of 85 feet of water 
mississippi river workboats which are called towboats even 
though they push their loads generally can handle 40 or more 
barges each industry officials say they lose 4000 to 10000 in 
income for each barge left behind 
the limits were sought by barge company representatives and are 
aimed at preventing towboats operators from running their loads 
aground in the shrunken mississippi donohoe said 
a continuing lack of rain throughout the mississippi river 
region has dropped the river to more than 20 feet lower at memphis 
than it was last june and most towboat operators already have cut 
their loads to 20 barges 
donohoe said industry officials worry that some boat captains 
might take on more than they can safely handle in the low water 
were got to make sure that somebody doesnt get out there and 
mess it up for everybody he said 
the barge limits will apply as long as the low water persists 
donohoe said and could be tightened further if the river continues 
to drop 
the barge limits were set as towboats with more than 600 barges 
lined up on the river near memphis the mississippi has been closed 
six miles above the city while the lenel bean a 240foot dredge 
scoops out a 1500footlong buildup of sand on the river bottom 
authorities said the dredging would take until friday afternoon 
and more than 1200 barges many of them recently freed from 
similar backlogs to the north and south were expected to stack up 
in the memphis area 
brig gen thomas sands president of the mississippi river 
commission said the army corps of engineers has located more than 
30 spots on the lower mississippi that will likely need dredging 
this summer 
sands said the river will remain open to commercial traffic 
throughout the summer even though dredging will cause temporary 
barge backups from time to time 
sands said controlled runoff from reservoirs on the missouri 
river and other rivers feeding the mississippi will keep it open 
mississippi tributaries are low too however and sands said a 
continuing lack of rain could at some point shut down commercial 
traffic on the river but he said that was unlikely 
theres got to be a doomsday point out there somewhere right 
now i dont know anybody that ive talked to who can give me any 
idea where that is right now we are not on the brink of 
disaster he said 
the river measured 86 feet below zero on the memphis river 
gauge wednesday zero on the gauge was set in the 1800s at 18391 
feet above sea level and the river measured more than 12 feet 
above zero last year this time 
the record low before the latest drop was set in 1981 at 73 
feet below zero and the corps of engineers said the reading could 
be more than nine feet below zero by next week

about 5000 striking auto workers 
rallied for a second day wednesday to protest low wages the state 
tanjug news agency reported 
workers of the tam company yugoslavias largest producers of 
trucks and vehicles gathered on a square in the northern city of 
maribor in slovenia to demand a 50percent pay increase the news 
agency said they were joined by workers from a nearby textile 
mill it said 
the protesters who staged another rally on tuesday elected a 
strike committee to voice their grievances after slovenias vice 
premier janez bohoric told them wednesday that nobody has the 
money needed to fulfill your demands the news agency said 
last month the yugoslav government linked wages to productivity 
as part of an economic recovery program designed to cut inflation 
currently running at 170 percent and overcome a severe economic 
crisis 
the austerity measures have sparked a wave of labor unrest 
in belgrade wednesday vice premier janez zemljaric attended a 
meeting at an agricultural machinery plant whose striking workers 
staged a noisy demonstration last friday in front of parliament 
protesting low wages and demanding government assistance for their 
firm zmaj 
zemljaric reportedly said the government was determined to 
introduce a more marketoriented economy adding that the 
consequences of the market forces for lossmaking companies will 
be very serious 
an estimated quarter of all yugoslav enterprises are lossmakers 
that have so far been kept afloat with substantial government 
grants 
under the terms of an agreement signed with the international 
monetary fund the yugoslav government has pledged to phase out the 
subsidies officials claim there is no alternative if the country 
is to repay its 21 billion foreign debt

information minister emmanuel bowier called the may 29 article 
erroneous and misleading

the associated press in nairobi where he is based 
harden who has reported in africa since 1985 wrote an article 
describing how doe and his close associates allegedly circumvent 
usimposed spending controls american experts were invited by 
does government to curb crippling official corruption 
the report quoted liberian businessmen as arguing the invitation 
is another example of does manipulation of washington 
at a news conference monday bowier denied hardens assertions 
that 17 american economists accountants and consultants hold 
deputy ministerial rank and cosigned government checks 
but a us information services document explaining the twoyear 
184 million economic stabilization project said the 
technocrats will be assigned at the deputy minister or equivalent 
level and will coapprove revenue and expenditure documentation 
bowier said hardens article was part of blatant distortions 
and the misinformation campaign launched against the doe 
administration because he said mrs graham was decorated by

amnesty international in a report for publication 
thursday urged the israeli government to investigate reports that 
army misuse of tear gas in quelling palestinian unrest has caused 
the deaths of men women and babies 
the londonbased human rights group said it was concerned the 
gas although made for use in the open air has been thrown into 
houses clinics schools hospitals and mosques during the 
sixmonthold uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the gas has frequently been used in high concentrations in 
residential areas where it can drift into peoples homes the 
report said 
amnesty international cited seven cases in which palestinians 
ranging from five days to 57 years old died as a result of inhaling 
tear gas and said local doctors had reported more than 40 such 
deaths 
it said the usmade cs and cn gases carried strict 
instructions against their use in enclosed areas and noted that 
the united states last month announced it was halting their export 
to israel because of reports of their misuse 
eviatar manor an israeli embassy spokesman in london said 
amnesty international reports are always studied carefully by the 
israeli authorities and once this report arrives in israel it will 
be given the usual serious study and an authoritative reply will be 
forwarded to amnesty international 
the organization cited reports from various sources that israeli 
soldiers were using tear gas not only for riot control but also 
in such a way as to constitute a punitive measure to harass and 
intimidate palestinian residents 
the gas has sometimes been used at night as a punitive measure 
against residents of villages or refugee camps who had clashed 
earlier in the day with israeli army soldiers it said 
it has been used when israeli soldiers have been pursuing 
demonstrators often when they have taken refuge in hospitals or 
near peoples homes there has been at least one case in which an 
individual was deliberately shut in a room which was then sprayed 
with tear gas the report said 
amnesty international expressed concern that israeli authorities 
made no public statement condemning the use of tear gas in confined 
spaces and that the israeli army appeared to have made very few 
investigations to ascertain whether there is any truth in the 
allegations 
it also accused the israelis of failing to inform hospitals of 
the gases contents and of ways to treat victims

gen manuel antonio noriega on 
wednesday again denied reports that cuban or libyan soldiers are in 
panama saying his own armed forces have no need for them 
rumors of cuban or libyan troops in panama have circulated here 
in washington and elsewhere for more than two months but us 
officials have tended to discount them 
the latest report of armed cuban involvement in panama surfaced 
in the united states earlier this week in a syndicated column by 
rowland evans and robert novak the writers quoted unidentified 
intelligence sources 
but noriega scoffed at the report he called alleged incursions 
by cuban commandos onto us military bases near panama city 
earlier this year the phenomenon of the palm trees 
panamas governmentcontrolled press has long referred to the 
incidents as the battle of the palms claiming that us 
marines shot at shadows and waving palm trees 
there are no cuban commandos no libyans or other foreigners 
in this territory noriega said because the panamanian 
defense forces do not need them 
noriega spoke at the closing session of the third assembly of 
antiimperialist organizations of the caribbean and central america 
the more than 100 delegates attending the threeday meeting 
adopted a resolution denouncing the aggressive and destabilizing 
campaign of the reagan administration against the people and 
constitutional government of panama 
washington has been seeking noriegas ouster since last fall 
the general who is chief of the defense forces and panamas de 
facto ruler was indicted on federal narcotics charges in florida 
earlier this year

michael dukakis said wednesday that jesse 
jacksons lack of government experience did not necessarily 
rule him out for the no 2 spot on the democratic ticket and said 
his search for a running mate would expand beyond people who have 
been asked for background information 
meanwhile dukakis was endorsed by a former democratic rival 
sen joseph biden of delaware who dropped out of the race last 
fall before the primary season began 
biden quit amid allegations of plagiarism and puffing up his 
academic record dukakis top aide john sasso resigned after 
admitting to being the source of an attack video showing clips 
of biden giving a speech that had been largely lifted from from 
british politician neil kinnock 
at a boston news conference the massachusetts governor was 
peppered with questions about his search for a running mate but 
offered little insight into the process 
i dont think its helpful to do it with press conferences 
at the end of the driveway everytime you talk to somebody 
dukakis told a statehouse news conference weve just begun the 
process 
dukakis danced around repeated questions about whether jacksons 
lack of government experience and whether polls showing that 
jackson might hurt the democratic ticket would affect his choice 
i dont know that you have to have held public office to in 
fact be qualified to be president said dukakis it helps 
he said jackson was under very serious consideration 
later pressed about whether he thought jackson would be a 
liability dukakis said 
im not going to be checking a lot of polls believe me 
we all have our strengths and our weaknesses 
according to sources florida sen bob graham and jackson have 
been asked to supply the dukakis campaign with background and 
financial information campaign sources indicated similar requests 
were made of at least several more members of congress including 
ohio sen john glenn and georgia sen sam nunn spokesmen for glenn 
and nunn declined comment 
one source said house majority leader thomas foley of washington 
was also among those being asked for background information but 
another source said no decision had been made regarding foley 
one senator considered mentioned frequently as a possible 
dukakis running mate new jerseys bill bradley said through a 
spokesman that he had informed the dukakis campaign that he was not 
interested 
new jersey sen bill bradleys office said tuesday that it had 
not been asked to supply the dukakis campaign with background 
information 
dukakis answered with a quick no when asked if that meant 
bradley would not be considered he added that bradley who has 
said he is not interested in the vice presidency has not told me 
personally he did not want to be considered 
but bradley spokesman nick donatiello said that bradley had 
made it absolutely clear both publicly and privately to 
dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas that he was not interested 
in the no 2 slot on the ticket brountas is heading the search for 
dukakis 
hes absolutely unambiguous about this donatiello said 
dukakis was asked about a statement by jacksons campaign 
manager that his rival would not concede the nomination before the 
roll call vote at the convention 
its over dukakis responded adding thats a decision he 
has to make 
dukakis continued to defend himself against certain republican 
nominee george bushs attacks on a massachusetts furlough program 
that allowed for the release of a murderer who then escaped while 
on furlough and raped a maryland woman 
dukakis noted that he had since tightened eligibility 
requirements for furloughs to exclude firstdegree murderers and 
that 45 states and the federal government have some form of 
furlough system 
he said bush was focusing on the furloughescape case because he 
had no record of his own to promote on crime issues 
before the news conference dukakis attended a celebration 
marking the graduation of the 50000 participants in employment 
training a massachusetts program that provides job training for 
welfare recipients he said the program had helped reduce the 
states welfare caseload by 35 percent in five years 
i think of all the things that ive been involved in et is at 
the top of the list dukakis said 
he called the welfare reform bill before congress a major 
major step forward and took credit for job training provisions 
he said were modeled after the massachusetts program

safety standards may not be stringent enough in the 
cruise industry the chairman of a federal agency investigating the 
march engineroom fire aboard the scandinavian star said wednesday 
the cruise ship industry is generally not operated under the 
us flag you do have visits by the coast guard but those are 
paper certifications said jim burnett chairman of the national 
transportation safety board 
there may not be sufficient safety standards he said 
adding that his agency has probed fires aboard four cruise ships in 
the past five years the potential for loss of life is enormous 
the march 15 engineroom fire aboard the star carrying 439 
mostly american passengers was discovered by a crew member as the 
ship returned from cozumel mexico to its tampa home port 
smoke detectors apparently failed as did an automatic system to 
douse flames also the ships emergency generators didnt work for 
an hour leaving the vessel without power in rough seas in the 
yucatan channel according to ntsb reports released as the agencys 
threeday hearing opened here 
although there were no injuries or deaths the failure of the 
vessels safety systems highlights the potential for a catastrophic 
loss of life in this accident and future vessel fires burnett 
said 
the safety board will examine whether the existing coast guard 
procedures and international regulations are adequate to protect 
passengers or whether more rigorous standards are needed 
because the ntsb lacks regulatory authority and because cruise 
ships are often registered outside the united states he said his 
agency can only make recommendations these might have to be 
followed up with congressional action or with new treaties with 
nations where ships are registered burnett said 
the 465foot star operated by miamibased seaescape limited is 
registered in the bahamas its engine room was badly damaged by the 
fire and there was smoke and water damage throughout the 
17yearold frenchmade ship which has since been repaired 
burnett estimated damages at about 20 million but seaescape 
officials did not answer questions at the hearing 
seaescape lawyer nils linfors jr vowed to challenge in court 
the ntsbs authority to hold such public hearings as wednesdays 
atissue is that the board does not permit crossexaminations and 
contentions that the bahamianregistered ship is outside the 
agencys jurisdiction 
an ntsb report said the fire ignited when pressurized fuel 
leaked from a line and sprayed against a hot engine exhaust 
manifold the leak continued for 13 minutes after the fire was 
discovered feeding the flames the report said 
because smoke detectors apparently werent working capt peter 
schaab said he had to send an officer to the engine room to confirm 
there was a fire 
firefighting efforts were hampered when an automatic carbox 
dioxide extinguishing system failed and had to be operated by 
hand but the fire was contained to the engine room 
there was no further spreading said schaab who was praised 
by burnett for his 268member crew acting quickly to move 
passengers from ship discos bars shows and dining rooms there 
were no serious injuries to passengers or crew 
ntsb records show that between september 1987 and february 1988 
there were at least six leaks in fuel pipes that feed the engines 
the official analysis of the fire and any recommendations that 
come out of the hearings will be adopted by the full ntsb board in 
washington later this summer

two nuclear devices were detonated 
simultaneously wednesday in a rare experiment just 40 miles from a 
tiny desert town where 33 soviet scientists are preparing for a 
historic series of joint nuclear tests 
unlike some larger tests that send shudders through highrise 
hotels wednesdays blast was not noticed in las vegas 85 miles 
from ground zero 
one of the tests was listed as a safety test which is designed 
to confirm that a nuclear explosion will not occur in case of an 
accidental detonation of the explosive used to trigger the device 
the test was conducted 40 miles from mercury nev the hub of 
the nevada test site where the soviet nuclear scientists are based 
the devices were detonated at 7 am in a 750foot vertical shaft 
drilled in yucca flat 
the shock measured 31 on the richter scale at the national 
earthquake information center in golden colo according to 
spokesman waverly person a quake of 35 magnitude can cause slight 
damage 
many previous tests have registered 55 and above 
energy department spokesman jim boyer said he felt very very 
slight motion at a control point 17 miles from ground zero 
he said the devices tested wednesday were very very small 
and little ground motion could be expected away from the site 
the two devices were listed as having a combined force of less 
than 150 kilotons of tnt boyer said the exact size of each device 
was classified information 
energy department spokesman chris west said a check of doe 
records dating back to 1968 showed only one occasion when two 
devices were detonated simultaneously in september 1982 
soviet scientists are at the remote desert site to prepare for a 
blast in midaugust that will determine the ability of the kremlin 
and the us to measure the size of each others nuclear tests 
the devices detonated wednesday are the sixth and seventh tested 
this year at the nevada site six of the soviet scientists have 
been at the nevada site for three of those previous tests with 25 
arriving at mercury monday 
the united states has 34 technicians at the soviet test site 
preparing for a joint verification experiment in russia a month 
after the us test 
wednesdays test brought to 682 the number of devices tested at 
the remote desert site since testing began in nevada in january of 
1951

how many ways are there to look at immigration 
playwright joanne akalaitis has found a great many and written them 
into green card as scenes and vignettes 
its interesting and well played by a versatile cast that keeps 
switching accents and becoming new characters but the production 
doesnt build the way a play with a narrative line does impact 
also is lessened because the evening has an overall sense of 
classroom learning about it 
green card first performed at the mark taper forum in los 
angeles in 1986 is now running at the offbroadway joyce theater 
the play is part of the first new york international festival of 
the arts and is the first entry in this summers american theater 
exchange at the joyce 
green card opens with jesse borrego as a standup comedian 
specializing in racialinsult remarks from that startling 
beginning green card moves to the expected a jewish 
immigrant at ellis island telling of lithuanias pogroms then 
running a sewing machine in new york and finally proclaiming next 
to work the most important thing is learning 
dana lee appears from time to time as a welldressed vietnamese 
marshall nguyen cao ky who says he went on the lecture circuit 
because his agent told him that hed only be good for a year a 
young woman lists events of her day as an illegal alien cleaning 
houses a boy tells of being arrested as an illegal and of being 
held and mistreated before deportation to san salvador 
repeatedly somebody says he was a victim of spirits of this 
country last night when he died he was watching the incredible 
hulk light touches are inserted by two women who cross the stage 
burbling beverly hills rich matron chitchat he combines massage 
with mantra 
act 2 becomes much more heavy with a history of vietnams 
conquerors a travelogue of cambodia faded vietnam war films a 
lecture on the latin american disappeared and torture methods 
miss akalaitis seems in act 1 to disparage the values of 
americans whose ancestors immigrated some time ago and to say that 
america is better than the other countries she mentions in act 2 
the playwright who also directed developed her material over a 
twoyear period with a rockefeller foundation

a houston political consultant and his 
firm were convicted wednesday of forging signatures on petitions 
that put former delaware gov pete du pont on the states 
republican party presidential primary ballot 
jurors found the consultant rocky mountain and his firm 
southern political consulting inc guilty of 38 counts each of 
misdemeanor forgery after about four hours of deliberations 
punishment phase of the trial was to begin thursday 
mountain 27 allegedly masterminded a forgery party at 
which workers signed phony signatures on petitions to put du pont 
on the march 8 primary which was won by vice president george 
bush du pont withdrew from the race 
mountain who testified he did not intend the petitions to be 
submitted faced a fine of up to 2000 per counts and a year in 
jail the company faced a fine of up to 10000 on each 38 count 
mountain said he was disappointed after the verdict but did 
not comment further kevin burnette president of southern 
political declined comment 
martin testified tuesday that he instructed temporary employees 
to forge the signatures only as an angered reaction after a du pont 
official goaded him about the inability to get legitimate 
signatures 
was there an intent to defraud or harm i dont think so 
joe bailey mountains lawyer said in wednesdays closing 
argument he said mountain told the du pont official not to submit 
the phony petitions 
du pont and his campaign officials have denied any knowledge of 
the forgeries and no one from the du pont campaign testified 
prosecutor casey obrien dismissed mountains claim that he did 
not intend to deceive anyone 
charles soechting attorney for southern political consulting 
told jurors the company was innocent because mountain though a 
vice president of the firm was working as a du pont volunteer when 
he masterminded the forgeries 
soechting also argued that mountain and the firm were being 
singled out for prosecution because they are not liked by texas gop 
officials 
the defense tried to show that supporters of bushs presidential 
campaign were upset because mountains firm helped organize a 1987 
houston presidential debate in which bush did not want to 
participate 
under texas gop rules candidates needed 5000 signatures to get 
on the presidential primary ballot 
seven people testified during the trial that mountain bought 
them beer and showed them how to forge signatures at a dec 19 
party 
mountain and the company also were implicated in possible 
forgeries on petitions submitted for gop presidential candidates 
sen robert dole and alexander haig but no indictments were 
returned in those cases

the pentagon corruption investigation focuses 
on 75 to 100 defense contracts worth tens of billions of 
dollars the chief prosecutor told congressional leaders 
wednesday and he said indictments might not be returned until 
after the november election 
a lot of individuals are involved and people will be shocked 
when they hear all the information said sen strom thurmond 
rsc after hearing from prosecutor henry hudson it appears 
they have very good evidence 
in another development a major figure in the probe deputy 
assistant navy secretary james gaines is cooperating with 
authorities by providing information sources told the associated 
press gaines phone was tapped by the fbi as part of the 
investigation 
abc news citing sources it did not identify said authorities 
have made no deal with gaines for lenient treatment in a possible 
prosecution but they expect that later 
hudson the us attorney for the eastern district of virginia 
made an unusual trip across the potomac river from his office in 
alexandria va for two closeddoor briefings of house and senate 
leaders on the case which has caught washingtons fulltime 
attention 
hudson also said the investigation is pursuing three areas of 
potential misconduct chiefly involving the sale of inside 
information by private consultants who were acting as middlemen 
between the pentagon and defense contractors said house speaker 
jim wright dtexas 
the prosecutor said it was possible no indictments would be 
returned until after the nov 8 election 
im hopeful that if indictments are appropriate in the case 
they will be secured by the end of the year hudson told 
reporters if we can proceed at a faster pace well attempt to 
do it 
attorney general edwin meese iii said last week that he expected 
indictments in 30 to 90 days 
rep john dingell dmich said hudson told the house group 
that 75 to 100 contracts are under scrutiny in the 2yearlong 
probe the total value of the contracts is in the tens of 
billions of dollars dingell said 
elsewhere former defense secretary caspar weinberger in an 
interview with the associated press denied responsibility for 
whatever corruption may be found by the investigation just as 
president reagan had one day earlier at a news conference in 
toronto 
i had briefings regularly once a week or every two weeks on 
the major weapons programs weinberger said but no matter how 
careful you are youre not going to be able to eliminate 
dishonesty 
we need to keep a sense of proportion without jumping to 
conclusions the pentagon awards 52000 contracts every single day 
and inevitably there may be some faithless or dishonest people 
weinberger headed the defense department at the time a private 
consultant offered to sell confidential bidrelated information to 
a former navy employee working for a defense contractor the 
exnavy man reported the incident to the naval intelligence 
service touching off the investigation 
said weinberger you dont close a bank because theres been a 
bank robbery and you dont conclude that we dont need a strong 
defense because of the actions of some faithless employees 
the washington post reported in thursdays editions that 
weinberger wrote meese a letter last august complaining about the 
comments by thenassistant attorney general william f weld before 
a house subcommittee about problems presented by the often close 
relationships between pentagon procurement officials and defense 
contractors 
in the aug 11 1987 dear ed letter weinberger called 
welds statement that military officials overlook infractions of 
defense contractors most objectionable and a disservice to 
the administration to the department of defense and to the many 
men and women involved in defense acquisition according to the 
post which obtained a copy of the missive 
weinberger added a handwritten postscript that said ed we 
are understandably i think very sensitive to charges such as 
this 
at the time weld already was directing the investigation into 
possible corruption in defense contract procurement weinberger and 
meese had not been told of the probe at that time 
reagan on tuesday had said it should be understandable how 
such things can happen in something as big as our government is 
about weinberger reagan said i think he was one of the 
finest secretaries of defense this country has had and i think he 
was doing all that he could to bring a national security out of 
chaos the kind that we inherited 
meanwhile joan galvin 28 the daughter of a defense consultant 
under investigation and an aide to rep andy ireland rfla was 
relieved of handling military issues for the florida congressman 
one of five members of the house whose names have come up in the 
case 
hudson told the congressmen that none were implicated the 
members reported later but it was like pulling teeth to get 
them to make this statement said rep bill dickinson rala 
ms galvin remains on irelands staff as a legislative assistant 
dealing with labor tax and veterans matters among other things 
said doug hattaway irelands spokesman 
hattaway said the congressman and ms galvin agreed it would put 
her in an untenable position to continue dealing with military 
affairs since her father william galvin is a principal in the 
investigation 
william galvins offices and those of his stepson ken brooke 
were searched eight days ago when the fbi conducted searches 
across the nation in pursuit of evidence of defense procurement 
wrongdoing

robert bennett a lawyer for the company said the subpoena 
demands any business records that may relate to probe suspects but 
said bdm was not a target of the investigation the paper reported 
bdm employs vicki paisley the wife of melvyn paisley a key figure 
in the investigation 
wright said hudson indicated the investigation is focused on 
three areas 
the first involves the deliberate sale of proprietary 
government information by consultants to individual corporations 
and contractors 
the second involves the manipulation of bid specifications in 
ways to favor certain contractors over their competitors 
the third involves indications of collusive bidding on the 
part of individual contractors 
wright said hudson said that no subpoena has been sought for 
any member of congress no wiretap has been directed at any member 
of congress and no search warrant has been directed at any member 
of congress 
five house members have been reported as being under scrutiny 
although all have said they arent involved 
the five are reps bill chappell dfla chairman of the house 
appropriations defense subcommittee thomas downey dny samuel 
s stratton dny chairman of the house armed services 
procurement subcommittee and roy dyson dmd and ireland both 
members of strattons subcommittee 
before meeting with hudson wright had criticized leaks naming 
the house members 
i think its thoroughly outrageous that people would be 
leaking statements that are thoroughly untrue absolutely 
unfounded he said i dont think it is in any way honorable 
for members of the executive branch to maliciously leak the 
names of innocent members of congress with the expectation they can 
start rumors 
the rumors are deliberately planted it appears and without 
foundation and it is a despicable thing in my opinion the 
speaker said 
wright did not say who he thought planted the rumors 
justice department spokesman patrick korten agreed with wright 
saying in an interview we too find that practice to be 
completely unacceptable it is not only unfair for anyones name to 
be dropped but it is completely against justice department 
procedures we absolutely condemn any such action 
meantime the pentagon said in a statement that former navy 
secretary john lehman jr had not been briefed on the 
investigation which was started by the naval investigative service 
in september 1986 
when he was still in office the scope of the investigation 
did not indicate that it was necessary to brief him the pentagon 
said in a statement only later did it become clear that the 
matter warranted the attention of the secretary of the navy 
lehman resigned his post and returned to private industry in 
april 1987 
one of the wiretaps recorded a conversation that can be 
interpreted as suggesting that lehman warned his former navy aide 
melvyn paisley about the investigation according to sources who 
would speak only on condition of anonymity 
paisley also quit in april 1987 and quickly was hired as a 
consultant by a number of major defense contractors paisley has 
emerged as a key figure in the investigation

when hungarian composer bela bartok 
found out in 1938 that his works were not included in a nazi 
exhibit on degenerate music he protested to german authorities 
bartok an opponent of racism wanted his works included in the 
show because he did not want to be seen as favored by the nazis 
even by implication 
this incident is related in an exhibit compiled by two west 
german music experts recreating the 1938 nazi display the 
exhibit was in zurich through june 30 then moved to west germany 
the 1938 dusseldorf exhibition part of a larger nazi music 
festival condemned atonal music jazz and works by jewish 
composers as ungerman 
it did not draw large crowds and was not really a propaganda 
success according to the zurich exhibit jazz for example 
remained popular despite being formally banned in the third reich 
but the exhibit shows how adolf hitler tried to dominate the 
arts in an attempt to keep them purely german and aryan 
in music this translated into antisemitism and antimodernism 
that led to the banning of works by such composers as felix 
mendelssohn bartholdy giacomo meyerbeer and jacques offenbach 
conservative germans had already displayed antisemitic musical 
tastes in the 1920s partly due to jealousy of the success of those 
composers the exhibit says 
they also hated what they considered ugly music a prime example 
being arnold schoenbergs 12tone system or atonalism a modern 
system of harmony in which there is no key 
atonal music was viewed by conservatives as a musical equivalent 
of bolshevism and jewish internationalism the exhibit says 
the 1938 catalog put it this way atonality signifies 
degeneration 
the exhibit includes scores by schoenberg and paul hindemith 
who were considered two of germanys best and most daring new 
composers during the weimar republic which preceded the third 
reich 
the caption from the 1938 exhibit describes them as the most 
dangerous destroyers of our popular and racial instincts for clear 
pure real and organic music it branded them international 
rootless charlatans 
also described as degenerate and frivolous spiritualartistic 
bolshevism were works by kurt weill who collaborated with 
bertolt brecht on the threepenny opera and austrianborn 
jewish composer gustav mahler 
unfortunately german musicologists seemed in large numbers to 
tolerate or even approve the defamation and ban on degenerates 
the catalog says there were no clear public protests though 
these would not have been possible anyway 
many musicians fled germany to escape persecution including 
schoenberg and weill who went to the united states 
during the war banned music was broadcast to germany on 
shortwave by the british broadcasting corp and the voice of 
america at the exhibit visitors can listen through headphones to 
some of those programs and to other selections including speeches 
by hitler and richard strauss 1936 olympic music 
strauss is an example of the dilemma facing nonjewish german 
musicians at the time in february 1934 he was appointed head of 
the newly created reichsmusikkammer or music department which 
hitler set up to try to control german musical development 
strauss was distrusted by the nazis because of his collaboration 
with jewish librettist stefan zweig but they accepted him because 
of his worldwide reputation strauss took on the post because he 
liked the idea of organizing german musicianship into a single 
unit but he was forced to resign a year later after the gestapo 
intercepted a letter he wrote to zweig criticizing the nazis 
antijewish policy 
strauss continued to conduct at third reich musical events 
however including the 1936 olympics and the opening of the 1938 
music festival the reichsmusiktage that included the degenerate 
music exhibit 
but his fall from favor continued eventually prompting party 
chancellor martin bormann to instruct the nazi press in 1944 not to 
celebrate strauss 80th birthday because he had failed seriously 
in his duty toward the requirements of the german community 
as the exhibit says the nazis could never explain why despite 
their theory of a superior aryan race so much great music was 
written by jews 
and some opposition did exist friedrich blume a professor in 
kiel questioned the nazis racial purity theory writing in 1938 
all the music which we know and understand grew from different 
nationalities and is therefore racially mixed

when one of harares main hotels banned 
smoking at selected restaurant tables last year the local 
antismoking lobby hailed it as a breakthrough 
but the nosmoking signs were soon removed when freespending 
foreign tobacco buyers threatened to boycott the hotel 
while government and private agencies vigorously crusade against 
public smoking the tobacco industry is a kingsize earner of 
export income for zimbabwe formerly the british colony rhodesia 
antismoking lobbies here concede their efforts have not become 
a burning issue at a time when smoking in public is being stubbed 
out in many parts of the world 
our lobbying is gaining little ground because of the economic 
importance of tobacco and because people are not aware of the 
dangers observes kindness paradza research officer at the 
privately funded zimbabwe consumer council one of our main aims 
is to stop children from smoking 
we are very much affected by the antismoking campaign says 
maurice rooney chief executive of the tobacco industry council 
tic the umbrella body for private companies in zimbabwe every 
cigarette not smoked simply means less business for us 
rooney a nonsmoker sits at a desk with a calendar published 
by the montrealbased smokers freedom society featuring cartoon 
caricatures of great men in history puffing on cigarettes and 
cigars among them winston churchill sigmund freud orson welles 
oscar wilde and vincent van gogh 
official statistics offer a clue to the importance of tobacco in 
zimbabwe the worlds third biggest exporter 
the annual crop of 100000 ton earns 22 percent of all export 
income accounts for 12 percent of the gross domestic product and 
keeps a tenth of all employed zimbabweans in jobs from pickers on 
the tobacco farms to sales teams that travel the world 
the industry also pumps 24 million annually in excise duties 
into the state coffers revenues that help finance the socialist 
governments education and health programs 
while president robert mugabe discourages smoking in his 
presence he boosted the 900 fulltime commercial growers morale 
when he officially opened the 10 millionwillowvale auction 
complex in harare the zimbabwe capital two years ago 
when we were growing up our parents and teachers forbade 
us to smoke mugabe said but one thing they never said was 
dont sell tobacco if we sell it we must grow it as well it is 
our industry and we must support it 
the world health organization which spearheads global 
antismoking campaigns takes a back seat in zimbabwe we dont 
get involved in that sphere a who spokesman said in harare 
private tobacco companies routinely spend hundreds of thousands 
of dollars each year promoting sporting events including soccer 
clubs in poor black residential areas 
the industry also helps fund the local cancer association an 
independent organization to the extent that it recently decided 
against pressing for a national symbolic nosmoking day 
smoking is banned in cinemas and theaters but for safety not 
health reasons 
one restaurant in harare reserves four tables for nonsmokers 
but cigarettes are permitted on public buses the state airline 
and even in some doctors waiting rooms 
while lobbies caution on radio television and in newspapers 
about the reported hazards of smoking local manufacturers 
advertise freely in the media and are not required to carry health 
warnings on cigarette packs 
researchers estimate that half of the men in this country of 82 
million people are smokers who pay about 50 cents for packs of 20 
cigarettes but they consume only 2 percent of all tobacco grown in 
zimbabwe 
about half of all tobacco exports are sold to european countries 
where manufacturers fear tougher curbs coupled with a growing 
antisocial stigma toward smokers will shrink the market 
as a result the exporters are looking more to africa and the 
far east to keep sales up 
if every chinese smoked one more cigarette a day says 
jeremy webbmartin president of the tobacco trade association 
our problems would be over

at workers hotel no 6 near the ursus 
tractor plant on the outskirts of warsaw men mill in the lobby or 
sprawl lazily on couches in their small rooms watching television 
girlfriends may visit until 10 pm and one movie theater is in 
the district but for the most part the men have little to do 
especially on a salary the equivalent of about 100 a month 
these are young single polish workers trapped they say with 
virtually no chance for upward mobility in what was supposed to be 
a workers state frustrated not only off the job but by the 
tedium and low pay on the job 
for polands communist authorities they are a tinderbox 
thousands of ursus workers live in hotels like workers hotel no 
6 or small privately rented rooms because of the shortage of 
apartments in poland 
you have to be very strong psychologically to avoid 
drinking said one of them 20yearold mariusz szulecki for 
some its the main recreation 
at workers hotel no 6 five men cram into a tworoom suite 
sharing a small kitchen and bathroom the building is modern and 
clean but the conditions are like those of a college dormitory 
during a wave of labor unrest across poland april 25may 10 
activists of the banned solidarity trade union said they were 
surprised by the militancy of younger workers who rallied to the 
strike actions 
zbigniew bujak a dismissed ursus worker who led the national 
underground of the banned solidarity union during the martiallaw 
years in poland of 198183 describes the life of the young workers 
first of all they are not paid enough to make a living they 
cant afford even a bicycle they would have to pay the entire 
monthly salary to buy a normal good bicycle they cant even dream 
about buying a motorcycle unless they get some big money from 
their parents in the countryside 
they cant see any chance of getting an apartment they mainly 
drink when i ask them well how long are you going to keep 
getting drunk they say what else can we do what can you 
suggest we have no chances 
bujak added that workers are demoralized by inefficiency in the 
factory and embarrassed by the shoddiness of the goods they are 
told to produce 
they feel that if we are supposed to be making changes then 
we should change everything only then can they see the chance for 
them to mean something in this country 
the assessment is shared to some extent by alfred miodowicz 
member of the politburo of the polish united workers party as the 
communist party is called and the leader of the officially 
recognized allpoland trade union alliance 
we unfortunately are losing these youths he was quoted as 
saying in a recently published interview in the weekly przeglad 
tygodniowy 
a big group is growing of impatient people they want to 
act they are full of determination one has to create a chance 
for them 
official trade unions launched after the banning of solidarity 
have tried to provide an outlet for the frustration though still 
derided by solidarity activists as subservient to the authorities 
the unions in recent months have spoken out for higher wages and 
better housing 
membership in official unions nationwide is about 7 million 
compared to solidaritys 10 million in 1981 
in an evenings conversation four ursus workers active in 
unofficial organizing activities at the plant spoke about the poor 
pay lack of housing lack of efficiency in the plant a feeling 
that they have no future 
thinking about marriage about families is out of the 
question said henryk tachasiuk 26 the wages provide a 
vegetation existence for one person and it spoils life for me and 
my girl 
he added that if he and his girl got married they would have to 
continue to live separately because he could not find an affordable 
apartment 
to get married just to be married makes no sense so we are 
all bachelors 
the workers said they have trouble earning enough for stereos or 
television sets 
the tiny polish fiat 126 designed as the car for the common 
man when the government started producing it in the 1970s is now 
for them the utmost dream 
at the plant there is no organization at all said 
28yearold marek jarosinski 
he said his department is idled in the first two weeks of the 
month by lack of materials 
in the second half they will bring them and we will have to 
make it up by the end of the month 
only about a third of the plants 14000 workers are directly 
involved in production and onefifth are in administration and the 
rest are supporting personnel said tachasiuk 
our work has to provide for all these clerks he said 
its discouraging 
nevertheless they stay on basically because they have no place 
else to work ursus is one of the countrys biggest factories and 
the men said they dont think the situation is any better at other 
plants the only option would be to emigrate 
to quit the job means to ask for a passport said tachasiuk 
jarosinski said he wants to stay and try to change things even 
if it means suffering defeats like workers in past years 
every generation gets its whipping at least in our country 
he said 
but tachasiuk conceded its a dream of many young people to 
leave and earn some real money thats their only real chance to 
get an apartment or a car 
during the aprilmay labor unrest there was an attempted strike 
at ursus but it fizzled after a protest march through the plant 
and a rally in a factory canteen according to bujak older workers 
were reluctant to join in and most of the wouldbe strike leaders 
had been detained tachasiuk said another strike was certain 
there will be one and probably soon definitely this year 
the four said virtually everybody in the plant feels as they do 
and that workers join the official union only because it controls 
benefits ranging from vacation facilities to daycare services and 
waiting lists for housing 
asked if government attempts to reform the economy and 
authorities stated desire for dialogue would change their outlook 
the workers were skeptical 
said zbigniew budukiewicz 29 who has been working at ursus for 
seven years the greatest enemy of the peoples government is the 
working class

congress appears close to passing legislation 
designed to take some of the potential pitfalls out of the business 
of borrowing on the equity in a home 
but even with a consumer protection measure on the books 
prospective homeequity borrowers will need to proceed with caution 
before they commit themselves to a deal 
homeequity loans have become a financial boom town of sorts 
over the past couple of years thanks in part to changes in the 
nations tax system 
under the tax reform act of 1986 federal income tax deductions 
for interest on most forms of consumer borrowing such as on credit 
cards is being phased out by contrast interest on up to 100000 
borrowed against a taxpayers house can still be deducted 
total equity loan balances grew from 20 billion at the end of 
1985 to 64 billion at the end of 1987 according to the american 
bankers association a further increase of 40 percent has been 
projected for this year 
as in any booming new market the potential for excesses and 
abuses runs high 
a bill passed by the house is aimed at cracking down on what one 
congressman called carnivaltype advertising that features 
artificially low initial interest rates on adjustablerate loans 
among other things it also would restrict lenders ability to 
demand a speedup of repayments or reduce arbitrarily the amount of 
credit extended 
the house bill must still be reconciled with legislation 
approved earlier by the senate so the measure in its final form is 
not yet ready for scrutiny 
whatever it provides for however financial advisers say a good 
deal of the responsibility will still fall on individual borrowers 
to make certain they are making a sensible move 
the typical homeequity loan setup is a line of credit that can 
be tapped at any time by simply using a credit card or writing a 
check 
this can plainly be a handy and useful arrangement allowing you 
to borrow only as much as you need when you need it furthermore 
since they are backed by a property of known value as collateral 
the loans usually come at relatively low interest rates 
but the cost of borrowing this way can be higher than it looks 
depending on the lender fees may be charged when you open the 
account when you borrow on it or even when you dont borrow on it 
that last is called an inactivity fee if a lending 
institution has agreed to make credit available to you it doesnt 
want the money to sit there for extended periods of time earning no 
interest 
be sure high annual fees and other costs do not outweigh the 
tax advantage of the home equity loan especially if you are 
borrowing only a small amount advises the american institute of 
certified public accountants in a consumers guide booklet it 
has published on the subject 
if the loan comes with an adjustable interest rate the rules 
already require that the lender set a specified cap or maximum 
rate the house bill would require the lender to calculate changes 
in adjustable rates on the basis of some interestrate index that 
it doesnt control 
the aicpa also urges borrowers to evaluate carefully how they 
expect to pay off a homeequity loan both principal and interest 
and to have a contingency plan for a sudden change in their 
circumstances such as the loss of a job 
the institute also sounds the bynowfamiliar but still 
important caution that home equity shouldnt be put at risk for 
purchases that have no lasting value 
single copies of the aicpa booklet are offered at no charge to 
those who request them by writing the aicpa order department po

first series pilot deal with nbc he had no idea how to get there 
to sign the contract 
i didnt know how to get to burbank and nbc joked spelling 
who until recently had an exclusive contract with abc since 1970 
spelling the prolific producer of such hit shows as 
dynasty hotel the love boat fantasy island 
charlies angels and family did find the offices of nbc 
and the welcome mat was out 
they led me to the elevator and when it opened nbc 
entertainment president brandon tartikoff was inside he said 
they had a band playing yellow rose of texas in honor of my 
home state a red carpet and a banner saying welcome to nbc 
the deal spelling reached with nbc was for a possible series 
nightingales about a group of young nurses in training the 
twohour pilot will air monday it stars mimi kuzyk susan walters 
britta phillips chelsea field kristy swanson and galyn gorg 
spelling has also produced a theatrical movie satisfaction 
financed by nbc 
the idea for the series was young student nurses who come to a 
big city hospital for training he said its very hard to 
recruit nurses so each student has a secret reason why she wants 
to become a nurse brandon even suggested one of the secrets he 
suggested chelsea fields for a role he participated in virtually 
every meeting i was amazed at his handson participation 
once we got the goahead we had to work around the clock 
because of the impending writers strike the second draft was 
delivered on a saturday the writers struck on monday 
susan walters was an actress he had released from hotel to 
star as priscilla presley in the movie elvis and me she had an 
agreement to return to hotel which has been canceled or do a 
pilot 
another casting suggestion came from spellings 15yearold 
daughter who saw kristy swanson in flowers in the attic and 
insisted he had to see her 
this is a show thats aimed at young people said spelling 
it will be a serial it would be difficult to schedule 
although all the secrets are revealed in the movie there are 
unresolved questions that would fuel a series 
the future of the series depends on the reception the show gets 
a couple of cautionary signals nbc is airing the show in the 
summer at a time of low ratings and as the air date drew near no 
review tapes were being made available 
spelling currently has two series on the air abcs durable 
dynasty and heartbeat a midseason replacement that did 
well in the ratings and is on the fall schedule 
heartbeat is the first time i ever did a medical show he 
said its a very realistic show people sent us letters with 
money to help keep the show on the air that hasnt happened since 
family heartbeat deals with unique medical problems 
nightingales is sheer entertainment it deals with medicine but 
there isnt a lifeanddeath case every few minutes 
spelling said he has a series commitment at nbc but he doesnt 
know yet whether it will turn out to be nightingales or another 
show he also has a deal with abc for five more series and with cbs 
for one series 
fox broadcasting co plans to have angels 88 a new version 
of charlies angels on its schedule next season but it has to 
wait until the writers strike ends 
spelling said he has also been approached by ted turner the 
atlanta entertainment entrepreneur about doing some shows for 
turner broadcasting 
and spelling has a movie for cbs called day one which tells 
of the manhattan project and the first atomic bomb dropped on japan

a bargain vacation this summer doesnt 
necessarily mean pitching a tent at a nearby campground or driving 
out to see grandma in florida 
but it may mean packing in a big hurry 
a growing number of discount travel programs has emerged in 
recent years offering travelers savings of anywhere from 5 percent 
to 80 percent for exotic and notsoexotic vacations worldwide 
the catch is travelers have to wait almost to the last minute to 
book these trips in some cases as little as three days since 
theyre buying distressed merchandise deluxe or standard hotel 
rooms left vacant from late cancellations leftover airline 
tickets cruiseship cabins or tours 
for annual fees ranging from 30 to 50 companies such as 
vacations to go inc in houston stand buys ltd in chicago and 
encore marketing international inc in lanham md offer travelers 
telephone hotlines listing several discounted trips most broken 
down regionally many also regularly mail newsletters and postcards 
with other details 
they say the average savings are about 30 percent to 40 percent 
each has about 100000 members nationwide 
and about a year ago miamibased eastern airlines started an 
11city weekender club for those looking for short lastminute 
getaways the carrier sends out a regional weekly travelgrams 
listing two to fourday trips about a week in advance the annual 
fee is 100 for a single member and 175 per couple but the 
airline says most if not all that fee could be recouped after 
just one trip 
essentially theyre liquidators said james v cammisa jr 
publisher of the monthly newsletter travel industry indicators 
they liquidate perishable inventory for airlines cruise ships and 
hotels and provide a service to the consumer who can plan on short 
notice and effect the savings 
once a ship sales away its empty cabins are valueless said 
jackie clarke a vice president at encore anything they can get 
is better than nothing 
but experts say there are some drawbacks to investing in such 
clubs aside from the fact that the average departure dates are 
about two weeks after booking 
for one thing tickets are rarely refundable and the fastpaced 
hotline messages can sometimes be a bit confusing 
callers often dont find out the suppliers name until they make 
reservations or contact the broker separately while airlines 
cruise ships hotel and tour guides like to make money on otherwise 
empty space they dont like advertising these bargainbasement 
rates 
cammisa also warns theres no exclusivity on bargains the 
thing that you need to make clear is that the inventory is in 
constant change and subject to supply and demand fluctuations 
sometimes equally good bargains can be found through retail 
travel agents who deal with air consolidators companies that 
purchase airline seats by bulk and offer discounts for advance 
purchases noted ron kurtz senior vice president for miamibased 
windstar sail cruises who also is researching a book on affordable 
vacations 
the key to traveling today is shopping around and comparing 
kurtz said 
still many consumers feel its worth investing in at least one 
discounttravel club for the chance at a topnotch vacation at a 
fraction of the normal price 
encores preferred travelersshort notice club for instance 
recently offered an allinclusive sevennight trip to jamaica from 
st louis for an average 400 per person it said the regular price 
runs about 750 per person 
among the biggest supporters of these programs are retirees like 
dorothy and kent cox of austin texas with plenty of time on 
their hands for leisurely travel at a moments notice 
we traveled with some nonmember relatives once on one 
caribbean cruise and their fare was at least 25 percent more than 
ours said the 64yearold mrs cox a vacations to go member 
i candidly told them that we were paying much less 
e gordon seiler a 61yearold market planning manager for 
georgiapacific corp in atlanta likes jetting off for long 
weekends in different cities every three months he said one recent 
trip to san francisco booked through easterns club cost 175 
round trip the cheapest comparable airfare i was able to find 
was 268 he said 
but seiler concedes you have to have a job that allows you to 
pick up at a weeks notice and you have to have freedom im just 
very flexible 
people think theyre more flexible than they really are 
said vacations to go president alan fox adding that only about 10 
percent of his companys members actually go on at least one 
advertised trip a year

for 10 years el teatro de la esperanza 
toured the united states with a mission to reach theaterstarved 
rural audiences and show middle america that not all hispanics are 
farmworkers 
but the members of el teatro decided their company needed to 
change its focus and find a home where a regular audience could 
appreciate its original bilingual plays the ragtag theater 
ensemble brought its act to san francisco 
two years later el teatro has established itself as the only 
professional hispanic theater company in san francisco and has 
produced three plays including its latest teos final spin a 
punfilled play that follows the misadventures of teo from 
collecting garbage to fumbling about in nicaragua 
we wanted to develop kind of a consistent audience that at its 
core was hispanic said rodrigo duarte clark el teatros 
artistic director 
el teatro set down roots in the heavily hispanic mission 
district the southofmarket neighborhood filled with latino 
restaurants car repair shops and liquor stores 
despite its success with a regular audience el teatro de la 
esperanza or the theater of hope has not completely abandoned 
touring because its members continue to feel a responsibility to 
take theater to rural areas mental institutions and prisons 
last month el teatro ended a sixweek tour of teos final 
spin to the southwest and midwest 
inside el teatros plain small office in a threestory building 
that also houses a daycare center the 39yearold duarte clark 
fondly recalled his troupes semiannual treks to del rio texas 
where they always enjoyed good audiences 
the reaction from the latino audiences is appreciative 
because its a rare thing said duarte clark a member of el 
teatro since 1973 it has a certain authenticity to it because 
its done by latinos 
on the other hand reaction from nonhispanics sometimes ranges 
from curiosity to confusion because people outside the southwest 
may never have seen a play that portrays hispanics as everyday 
people not just farmworkers or recent immigrants 
in general it opens up their vision of what latinos are 
like duarte clark said 
in 1970 el teatro was founded as a student group at the 
university of californiasanta barbara five years later the 
nonprofit company moved toward establishing itself as a 
professional theater group with fulltime paid staff 
since the mid1970s el teatro had mostly been a touring 
company making regular spring and fall tours throughout the 
southwest and midwest in some cases the theater group took its 
production abroad to various international festivals 
in 1985 the company adapted dario fos we cant pay we wont 
pay called no se paga no se paga it was performed in 
tours to san francisco and mexico 
the following year the theater group inaugurated its move to 
san franciscos mission cultural center with a revised production 
of loteria de pasiones a bilingual play about an old womans 
memories of love and guilt centered on the mexican bingo game 
loteria 
not everything has gone well for el teatro since its relocation 
financial woes have plagued it for years and duarte clark pointed 
out that company members are often forced to work several jobs to 
keep productions going 
ruben castro ilizaliturri an actor from mexico city who joined 
el teatro in 1979 said that when the company first moved to san 
francisco the facility where they were to perform was unfinished 
company members had to work as carpenters to help complete 
construction 
right now we have to do everything direct write be 
technicians carpenters he said and thats hard 
the ideal situation for el teatro would be the availability of 
sufficient funds to allow the artists to concentrate on their work 
according to duarte clark 
to some extent financial limitations create artistic 
limitations said duarte clark a ucsanta barbara graduate who 
last summer directed el teatros production of hijos once a 
family which examined a troubled chicano family 
el teatro plans to take teos final spin to san antonio for 
a july 8 show as part of the 14th annual tenaz festival of chicano 
latino theater 
booking manager nancy levidow said the play will return to the 
san francisco bay area july 22 when it will appear at san rafaels 
dominican college as part of the performance at forest meadow 
summer festival 
next spring the company plans to produce two plays la 
victima a story about the immigration and migration of a mexican 
family in the united states and la cantata de santa maria de 
iquique which deals with a miners strike in chile that ended in 
the south american countrys bloodiest massacre

curtis crawford a black man owes part of his success to 
affirmative action a process that a decade ago denied allan 
bakke a white man admission to medical school 
both men are symbols of the evolving struggle for racial 
equality in america 
crawford who runs a 35 billion annual program for ibm says 
affirmative action played a big part in his rapid rise to 
highpowered executive with one of the nations corporate giants 
but he says hard work and personal sacrifice were essential as well 
ibms commitment to affirmative action played a very major 
role in providing a place for me to develop to my fullest he 
said at the same time i think i earned everything based on my 
abilities i put in a lot of hard work and pain 
in the 10 years since the supreme court first endorsed the 
concept in the case of bakke a wouldbe medical student 
affirmative action has become even more of a fixture in american 
society in private enterprise in law and medical schools in 
local police and fire departments 
but preferences based on race and gender remain highly 
controversial particularly fixed quotas that spark heated debate 
over reverse discrimination 
the supreme court on june 28 1978 ruled that bakke then a 
37yearold engineer wrongly was denied admission to study 
medicine at the university of california at davis 
the justices by a 54 vote said a fixed quota for racial 
minorities at the medical school unlawfully excluded bakke because 
he is white he had been passed over while lessqualified 
applicants were admitted under a special program 
but a different 54 alignment said colleges may consider race as 
one factor in deciding who gets admitted 
the bakke case galvanized public opinion as have few legal 
battles in the nations history 
but it marked only the start of a continuing debate on how far 
the nation should go to redress past discrimination 
bakke himself has since graduated and become a doctor while 
studiously avoiding the limelight and declining to discuss his case 
bakke said he has been working as an anesthesiologist at the 
olmstead medical group in rochester minn for about the past two 
years he said the multispeciality group is not associated with 
the mayo clinic where he took residency training beginning in 
1982 asked if he would consent to an interview he said i just 
really dont want to do it at all 
ibm executive crawford started with the company 15 years ago 
about a year out of college 
today he is a vice president at the companys plant in montvale 
nj in charge of marketing its line of new personal computers 
the personal system ii yearly sales are around 35 billion 
crawford son of factoryworker parents and reared in what he 
describes as the poor part of joliet ill is no friend of racial 
quotas 
ive never been in favor of specific numbers thats not the 
way to achieve equality he said 
he is a strong supporter of american institutions that 
demonstrate steady commitment to equality by providing 
opportunities for minorities and women to get ahead 
we believe affirmative action makes good business sense he 
said the company also is fulfilling its social responsibility 
crawford is a symbol of the boon affirmative action can be to 
middle class blacks hispanics other minorities and women 
on the other hand civil rights leaders say it has failed to 
ease spiraling unemployment that helps hold the nations inner 
cities in the grip of poverty despair and drugs 
the reagan administration has fought a losing rearguard battle 
for the past eight years to restrict back pay or other compensation 
in suits based on claims of affirmative action violations to 
individuals who can prove they were victims of bias 
the nations highest court rejected that argument in a series of 
cases but fragmented voting among the justices and the advent of 
new reagan appointees on the court could mean an uncertain future 
for affirmative action 
in recent rulings the court has embraced preferential treatment 
for women and minorities in hiring and promotion it even has 
endorsed quotas as long as they are narrowly tailored to overcome 
proven past discrimination and do not trammel unnecessarily the 
rights of white males 
american business also has demonstrated support for affirmative 
action particularly big corporations and industry leaders like ibm 
were allowing people in this country to participate in the 
economic process its well worth it says walton e burdick 
ibms vice president of personnel 
ibm began recruiting at black colleges in the early 1950s and 
burdick emphasized the continuing need for longterm commitment 
there has to be a sustained effort he said you cant 
decide on friday night to be a leader in the fight for equality and 
be there monday morning 
the national association of manufacturers in its official 
policy regards affirmative action as an effective method of 
achieving civil rights progress industry realizes that it is good 
business policy to encourage and promote programs that enhance 
minority and female participation at all levels within the 
workplace 
clearly defined legal standards for such preferences also can be 
a bulwark against lawsuits by white males who believe they were 
denied jobs or promotions unfairly 
still many companies are reluctant to talk about their 
affirmative action programs

bakkes alma mater is one institution proud of its civil rights 
record and willing to discuss it openly 
we have actually a diverse class we think its of great 
academic benefit said dr hibbard e williams dean of medicine 
at the university of californias davis campus 
after the bakke ruling there was drop in minority enrollment for 
five years at davis minorities seemed to believe the school was 
not for them even though college officials had defended quotas all 
the way to the supreme court 
blacks hispanics asians american indians and other minorities 
comprise nearly half of the enrollment at the medical school today 
there is no fixed quota but recruitment of minorities is intense 
and is intended to produce a model of the diverse racial makeup of 
california 
students in general learn a great deal from their own 
colleagues says williams they get a more accurate view of 
life out there from alcoholics to the destitute aged individual 
who is demented to the wealthy businessman with a heart attack 
the sentiment is hardly universal 
officials at atampt recently were embarrassed by a white 
supremacist group that called for the telecommunications giant to 
phase out its affirmative action program 
the proposal was supported by those voting 86 percent of the 
company shares while a counterproposal to expand affirmative 
action won 6 percent of the vote neither resolution will be 
implemented since neither won a majority vote 
ironically some resistance to preferential treatment is coming 
from black executives and professionals seemingly the leading 
beneficiaries of these programs 
the wall street journal reported this month a growing exodus of 
talented blacks from mainstream white businesses 
many are leaving to join blackowned businesses or start their 
own firms the newspaper said their reasons include social 
polarization and discrimination at whiteowned companies 
unrelenting pressure there to prove themselves and a need to 
demonstrate they can make it on their own without an 
affirmativeaction boost 
whatever the problems of black professionals some civil rights 
leaders say they are nothing compared to the growing ghetto poverty 
that remains untouched by affirmative action 
a commission on americas minorities reported last month that 
the nation is moving backwards in efforts to achieve equality 
the panel which included former presidents jimmy carter and 
gerald r ford said 31 percent of blacks and 27 percent of 
hispanics were living in poverty nearly three times the rate for 
whites black unemployment is nearly triple and hispanic 
unemployment about double that for whites 
david ginsburg who was executive director of the kerner 
commission that reported on racial inequality 20 years ago said 
the nation needs to rededicate itself to an expanded vision of 
affirmative action 
its impossible for the innercity poor to escape poverty by 
pulling up their socks without outside help he said the 
notion they can do it themselves i regard as a total absurdity 
on the positive side one measure of growing equality in at 
least some sectors of american society is the number of elected 
black officials 
there were only 200 holding office in 1965 a time when 
exuberance over the civil rights movement was at its peak by 1986 
that figure had grown to 6500 
blacks and other minorities also have made significant progress 
in highly visible areas ranging from the media and law enforcement 
to business and the professions 
yet some controversial issues remain unresolved 
while there may never be another case like bakkes to rivet the 
nations attention key aspects of affirmative action and alleged 
discrimination will continue to be argued before the supreme court 
the justices will examine the power of local governments to 
require minority participation in public works projects supporters 
of such local quotas note that the court in 1980 upheld the power 
of congress to require 10 percent of federal public works contracts 
be earmarked for minoritycontrolled businesses 
the court also has agreed to decide whether sexual stereotyping 
even if unconscious is grounds for a finding of discrimination 
the case involves a woman denied partnership in a leading 
accounting firm she said she was discriminated against for not 
behaving in a sufficiently feminine way 
the court also has said it will explore anew the right of white 
males to challenge courtapproved voluntary affirmative action 
agreements between public employers and minorities the case 
involves white firefigthers who say they were denied promotions 
unlawfully by birmingham ala officials 
the cases are on the court agenda for the new term beginning in 
october with decisions likely in 1989 
the role of the newest member of the court justice anthony m 
kennedy will be watched closely he succeeded retired justice 
lewis f powell the man whose vote controlled the outcome of the 
bakke case powell also proved to be a pivotal figure in subsequent 
affirmative action decisions by the court

a year later the students question still 
disturbs philosophy professor jeffrey barker 
why do we have to study world hunger the student asked 
barker who teaches a course on contemporary moral problems 
including a unit on hunger at albright college in reading pa 
weve already solved that problem we had live aid its no 
longer in the news 
barkers anecdote became a favorite at a conference on how to 
teach undergraduates about world hunger held at colgate university 
this month it drew 68 college professors from 50 schools in 21 
states 
the students question also illustrated two sad truths apart 
from attending benefit concerts like live aid which sent 
millions of dollars to starving african nations in 1985 american 
students seem barely aware of world hunger and where and why it 
occurs and most colleges do little to end that ignorance 
the conference enabled college professors to swap lesson ideas 
such as assigning students to spend only a dollar a day on food to 
experience how poor people have to stretch their money 
they also got firsthand reports on food problems and solutions 
in ethiopia india and other hungry nations presented by veteran 
relief workers from eight religious organizations 
frank conlon program director for africa with lutheran world 
relief showed how simple technologies are helping west africans 
survive animal power harnessed for irrigation cow manure turned 
into natural gas to fuel stoves and lanterns special ditches dug 
to keep goats from gardens 
alan berg nutrition adviser to the world bank told of the 
baffling insistence of javanese mothers to nurse their infants only 
with their left breasts which commonly leads to malnutrition 
such hard realities of other countries efforts to feed their 
people seldom reach college classrooms in the united states 
step 1 is information many of my students dont even know 
where these countries are said barker 
hunger at the college level is dealt with by taking walkathons 
or swims weve let hunger on campus but not in the classroom we 
want it in the official curriculum said monsignor robert j 
coll executive director of interfaith hunger appeal a new 
yorkbased umbrella organization representing roman catholic 
protestant and jewish relief services which cosponsored the meeting 
with colgate 
the point of such courses is not to create legions of altruistic 
student volunteers flocking to third world countries hunger 
field work is no place for amateurs said coll its expensive 
and its dangerous 
whats needed said coll and other conference organizers is 
activism steeped in knowledge of how us corporate and 
governmental policies affect hungry nations sometimes for the 
worse 
im not training peace corps volunteers im training citizens 
of the world said gary larson himself a former peace corps 
worker in gambia who now teaches biology at bethany college in west 
virginia 
such courses should also lead students and teachers to ponder 
that universities may themselves be culprits in worsening world 
hunger said jack kloppenburg a rural sociologist from the 
university of wisconsin 
kloppenburg gave an example university and corporate 
biotechnologists have collaborated for years to develop heartier 
seeds for various crops and theyve often gathered rare varieties 
from third world countries they claim such genetic resources are 
mankinds common heritage like the air we breathe and resist 
the idea that countries should be compensated for those resources 
but the companies eventually turn around and claim patent rights 
and make hefty profits from the resulting products 
it is hardly surprising that less developed countries see an 
asymmetry exploitation gene robbery said kloppenburg 
conference participants stressed that the teaching solution 
wasnt as simple as concocting new courses titled hunger 101 
faculty members especially younger ones with no tenure could risk 
their careers by pushing for courses that dont fit neatly into 
academic departments 
larson said a course hes planning at bethany college next 
spring which will examine nutrition around the world may not earn 
him favor at his school 
i may now be looked upon as an oddball in my biology 
department for teaching out of my field he said 
and the other problem is how am i going to present the 
subject of world hunger to kids who are paying 12000 a year and 
whom im supposed to be equipping for the jungles of new york or 
medical school i have to work this through so as not to 
overemphasize it but to make students more aware of the world and 
how to solve a problem larson said 
there is no shortage of literature on hunger the conference 
displayed more than 100 books and a dozen periodicals on the 
subject but the plentiful information means little unless a 
department head or dean backs a new course with time and money 
many agreed that world hunger lends itself to an 
interdisciplinary approach teachers from 22 disciplines were 
represented at the colgate conference including social and natural 
scientists philosophers geogragoal its mainly a question of whether 
working with the hunger problem is a moral obligation rather than 
just charity

eight years ago anyone living in 
this community would have laughed at the suggestion that one day 
there would be more people than available houses more jobs than 
people to fill them more school children than classrooms to hold 
them 
but then came honda 
since the early 1980s the presence of honda of america 
manufacturing inc the fourthlargest automaker in the nation 
and the arrival of its numerous suppliers have beefed up coffers in 
14 ohio counties but nowhere more noticeably than here in logan 
county 
nobody knows whats going on here said leland dorsey 
executive director of the logan area chamber of commerce you 
just have to come see for yourself its pretty unbelievable 
bellefontaine which is between the honda auto complex in 
marysville and its engine plant in anna and a mile or two west of a 
new honda auto plant under construction in east liberty is a prime 
growth target he said 
were becoming the center of honda because of where we are 
dorsey said 
suppliers have begun moving in and a new warehouse called honda 
express specifically aimed at warehousing parts for honda is 
planning to open a 1 millionsquarefoot operation on the 
loganunion county line 
hondas growth has caused problems as well this community of 
11500 at the beginning of the decade had enough housing to serve 
its needs but a recent survey showed the county was at least 2200 
units short of demand dorsey said 
there is not an apartment to be had in the city said doug 
zimmerman of levan and zimmerman realty zimmerman said his office 
gets about 20 inquiries about apartments every day 
there isnt a one available ive never seen anything like 
it he said i was a farmer for 10 years before i got out of 
it i guess if ive made one right decision in my life this sure 
is it 
although he would not say what has happened to the price of 
purchasing a home he said the number of listings the two levan and 
zimmerman offices in logan county handle have soared 
honda buyers can now buy houses in the 60000 to 80000 
range whereas a few years ago they just couldnt afford that he 
said this is a really exciting place to be right now builders 
are in here every day looking for land people are moving in its 
a real sellers market the skys the limit 
but dorsey said there are other problems even though 
unemployment has dropped from an early 1980s high of almost 8 
percent to around 5 percent smaller employers are having trouble 
filling lowerpaying jobs because honda and its suppliers pay more 
and traffic is becoming a problem 
logan county sheriff michael henry says his 12 road officers 
have seen a significant increase in traffic problems vandalism and 
drug trafficking as the population has risen 
the construction of the new honda plant and a projected county 
population of 42000 by 1990 up 9 percent from 39155 in 1980 
will create more patrol problems he said population in the city 
also has grown in 1980 census figures show the count was 11880 
since then it has risen to about 12500 and estimates show that it 
could reach 13500 by the end of the decade 
the attitude in the benjamin logan school district on the 
countys eastern border remains nonetheless optimistic once one of 
the poorest school districts in the state hondas planned east 
liberty expansion will add 24 million into the districts annual 
budget the districts annual budget currently is 5 million said 
anne schrader district treasurer 
officials who have watched honda and other japanese firms around 
the state say bellefontaines attitude toward growth and the 
japanese helped make it grow 
a study commissioned last year by the institute for japanese 
studies at ohio state university cited bellefontaines 
international friendship center opened to help the japanese and 
other foreign investors learn american ways as a model for other 
communities hoping to attract foreign investment 
the center organized in 1986 and funded by churches private 
organizations and donations assists japanese families in the 
transition from their native country

george bush arrived in texas in 1947 with his 
wife his studebaker and a job lined up by his investment banker 
uncle he learned the ways of the oil patch and helped establish 
tiny zapata petroleum co much later zapata grew into the giant 
pennzoil co but bush was long gone to politics heres a look at 
bushs years as an oilman 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in 1952 a young oilman just getting his feet wet 
in politics drew the task of arranging an airport campaign stop for 
richard nixon 
he set up a stage decorated it brought out a crowd then 
george bush stood in the back with his business partner john 
overbey as the vice presidential candidate spoke 
nixon said a few words when a couple of seedylooking 
characters started yelling at him and waving signs overbey 
recalled bush took one look at them and tore over there he 
ripped up their signs and told them to get the hell out 
he can be a pretty aggressive guy you know overbey said 
the vice president isnt known for such forcefulness in 
washington but in the texas oil patch he is remembered as an 
energetic businessman who headed west to make his mark in the 
corporate world he succeeded not only by quickly learning the 
ins and outs but also by relying on generous amounts of family 
money for backing 
the republican presidential contender was known then as now 
as a team player who built decisions by consensus and was 
considered a faithful friend 
bush who went to congress in 1966 tagged with the label texas 
oil millionaire saw some risky drilling ventures pay off during 
his oil career but he actually left the wheelingdealing days of 
the 1950s west texas oil boom with only modest success by local 
standards 
george made a comfortable amount of money out of it said 
his friend and onetime partner pennzoil co chairman j hugh 
liedtke it was a substantial sum but hes not what in texas is 
called big rich 
at age 24 after a tour as a navy pilot and three years at yale 
university bush decided against joining the family business 
investment banking he wrote in his autobiography that he was 
turned down for a job at procter amp gamble and considered farming 
but thought it too risky 
so he set out to make it in oil he began as a trainee for an 
equipment supply company in 1948 a job arranged through the 
family and one that included long days painting scalding hot pump 
jacks and pipe he became an equipment salesman moving from odessa 
to california then to midland texas 
it was there that he quit the company and went out on his own 
with overbey a neighbor and pal from touch football games and 
barbecues in a venture called the bushoverbey development co 
i was trading minerals and royalties he decided he wanted to 
get involved in exploration and he suggested he could raise the 
money overbey said we didnt set the woods on fire but we 
stayed in the black for three years 
bush and overbey bought and sold portions of other firms 
projects instead of drilling their own wells the financial backing 
of 350000 was arranged through bushs uncle george herbert 
walker jr and the investors included bushs father prescott and 
eugene meyer owner of the washington post 
after three years bush and overbey decided to join forces with 
bill and hugh liedtke who also had their own trading company the 
liedtkes raised 500000 in tulsa okla their hometown bush 
raised 500000 on the east coast and they named their venture 
zapata petroleum after the famed mexican rebel leader portrayed by 
actor marlon brando in viva zapata 
the partners tried to be conservative liedtke said and never 
made a move unless all agreed 
i think george has always been kind of a team player and i 
think the rest of us were kind of that way he said when 
youre young you dont have enough sense to get scared 
zapatas first play was a 1 million bet on one oil field hugh 
liedtke was convinced the oil under a series of six wells spread 
across coke county texas was actually part of one huge source 
zapata threw its entire 1 million into the jamieson field took on 
45 million in debt and raised a second 1 million from the same 
investors 
for a time it seemed the company was imitating the movie it 
wasnt clear whether zapata was a hero or bandit then slowly but 
surely the jamieson field came out a winner 
we drilled around 130 wells and never got a dry hole said 
liedtke now a corporate legend who steered pennzoil to an 11 
billion court judgment against texaco over texacos takeover of 
getty oil 
but the toughest business decision for the partners came when 
they found they had to fire employees most of whom were also good 
friends before the fields paid off bush often refers to that 
painful experience on the campaign trail 
eventually zapata split bush and his east coast investors took 
over zapata offshore based in houston and the liedtkes and their 
backers stayed in production 
in houston the bushes and their five children settled into a 
comfortable lifestyle although bush at one point developed a 
bleeding ulcer 
dad shielded us from his business activities said jeb bush 
now florida commerce secretary he spent a lot of time away and 
when he was there we didnt talk about business we talked about 
baseball and sports 
bush moved up quickly in local politics which were dominated at 
the time by democrats he became harris county republican chairman 
in 1962 and ran unsuccessfully for the us senate in 1964 in 
february 1966 he resigned as chairman of zapata offshore to wage 
a fulltime campaign for the house and he won a seat in november 
on his way to washington he sold his 6 percent stake in zapata 
netting 11 million within 18 months the zapata stock under new 
management took off doubling in value liedtkes zapata gave 
birth to pennzoil 
if he had stayed in he could have made an enormous amount 
of money if that had been what he really wanted to do liedtke 
said 
that was not his aim i dont think i think he wanted to 
prove to himself and perhaps to others that he could and once that 
was accomplished well i dont think he was really interested in 
it

soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has revived the 
communist party conference last used by stalin 47 years ago in 
an effort to promote the perestroika reforms he wants the 
conference opening june 28 will be a testing ground for gorbachev 
and his ideas here is a report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fortyseven years after josef stalin dominated the 
last communist party conference mikhail gorbachev is reviving the 
forum in an attempt to break the partys chokehold on society and 
wrest control from entrenched bureaucrats 
the conference will provide a political arena for gorbachevs 
battle to modernize the soviet union come to grips with the 
stalinist legacy and improve the living standards of the countrys 
284 million people 
selection of the 5000 conference delegates shows how gorbachev 
has changed the political atmosphere and opened up new areas for 
discussion a stormy debate over alleged ballotrigging sent 
hundreds of demonstrators into the streets of moscow and leningrad 
to protest the delegateselection process 
for the first time since before the first world war and the 
early 1920s some of these things are being debated openly one 
veteran western kremlin watcher observed thats really very 
extraordinary 
among the delegates to the 19th allunion conference of the 
communist party of the soviet union will be a substantial number 
gorbachev counts as opponents and there are indications the 
57yearold party chief has scaled back some of the original goals 
of the conference 
both soviet and western analysts have suggested that the 
delegateselection procedures which by soviet standards were 
surprisingly open enabled gorbachevs conservative opponents to 
gain enough seats to prevent implementation of radical measures 
gorbachev nonetheless is expected to open the proceedings 
tuesday in the kremlins glass and marble palace of congresses with 
a call to limit the tenure of party officials and their authority 
over the conduct of government and the economy 
but as the first party conference since 1941 drew near 
communist officials sought to dampen expectations that the 
delegates representing the countrys 20 million communist party 
members would do more than debate a list of recommendations or 
consider the personnel issues that could decide the fate of 
gorbachevs reform program 
some observers said gorbachev may have decided after watching 
the delegateselection fight not to risk secret ballots on his key 
projects 
thirty pages of theses put forward by the partys policymaking 
central committee as a platform for discussion at the conference 
bear the imprint of gorbachevs own ideas 
one theme that clearly emerges is the effort to come to terms 
with and overcome the stalinist past the theses blame the late 
dictator for stifling debate in the party a vicious practice 
that continued through the rule of leonid i brezhnev 
in calling for a limit of two fiveyear terms for elected party 
positions the proposals strike at the foundation of a system of 
personal power and privilege built for decades by party officials 
some executives started thinking that they had been appointed 
to their posts for life the theses said they considered 
themselves infallible abused power and neglected the interests of 
rankandfile party members and working people 
in its new role envisaged by gorbachev the communist party 
would retain its dominant role in soviet society but exercise its 
power less directly 
the communist party shall steer its political course via 
communists working in bodies of state authority in all spheres of 
societys life the program said 
vladimir kluyev party leader of the lenin district of moscow 
and a conference delegate said the plan would leave daytoday 
management to government officials and economic administrators 
but proposals to diminish the partys control over the 
government and economy raise the question whether the party can 
control strategic decisions if it gives up its authority to decide 
everyday matters 
kluyev told reporters it is clear that no organizational 
questions will be considered at the conference indicating 
gorbachev will not attempt to cement his leadership position by 
making major personnel changes as stalin did 47 years ago

other party sources however speaking privately said there may 
be some new appointments to the 300plusmember central committee 
to replace officials who have died or retired since their election 
at the last party congress in february 1986 
but rules governing the rarely used party conferences are vague 
and apparently give the leaders latitude to discuss what they want 
at the conference 
the way the conference is conducted will be one indication of 
how open the gorbachev leadership is prepared to be will 
freewheeling debate be allowed and how much of the debates and 
speeches be made public 
although gorbachev will make a report to the conference little 
is known about who else will speak or how the meeting will be 
structured soviet press reports indicate the opening and closing 
sessions will be televised and some official press reports of the 
speeches and actions of the conference are expected to be published 
after the fact 
but most of the proceedings probably will take place in secret 
when the conference was announced last june it was assumed 
gorbachev would use the forum to attack resistance to his reforms 
and sweep some of his opponents off the central committee 
but some prominent gorbachev supporters have been left off the 
delegate slate as local party officials rammed through their 
personal choices the party hierarchy had to scramble early this 
month to find spots for such wellknown reformers as historian yuri 
afanasyev and filmmaker elem klimov 
others including outspoken editor vitaly korotich of the weekly 
magazine ogonyok found safe seats from their home districts far 
from moscow after being denied slots from moscow 
boris n yeltsin the former moscow party chief who was sacked 
after criticizing the slow pace of reform was elected a delegate 
from karelia a region bordering finland 
economist nikolai shmelev a leading proponent of radical 
changes and sociologist tatyana zaslavskaya regarded as an 
influential gorbachev adviser failed to be named delegates 
some reports circulating in moscow predict gorbachev will use 
the conference to institute major economic changes to hasten the 
impact of his modernization program known as perestroika or 
restructuring 
soviet consumers have yet to feel any major effects of three 
years of talk about reform 
for instance some sources have said gorbachev may attempt to 
win endorsement of a system that would permit families to lease 
sections of collective farms from the state and sell their produce 
back to the collective at prevailing prices such a step could have 
a relatively quick impact on the countrys notoriously inefficient 
agricultural system that in recent years has forced the soviet 
union to import food 
other sources anticipate some party statement on nationalities 
problems which have broken into the open in recent months as 
armenians have sought to claim a territory held for 65 years by the 
neighboring republic of azerbaijan 
there also is unrest in the three baltic republics of lithuania 
latvia and estonia 
among those seeking the attention of the party conference to 
redress grievances are a group that wants to build a memorial to 
stalins victims and crimean tatars campaigning for restoration of 
the homeland stalin took from them to punish them for alleged 
collaboration with nazi forces in world war ii 
otto latsis deputy editor of the theoretical journal kommunist 
and a conference delegate said he sensed an expectation of an 
instant miracle at the conference 
common people to some extent expect that all the problems 
that havent been solved will be solved and that there will be a 
firm guarantee that perestroika will become irreversible latsis 
said 
but he added i dont think that after three days of the 
conference we are going to be in quite another world well have a 
better understanding of our progress on perestroika

the club of economic summitry is viewing with 
apprehension the forced retirement of president reagan aware that 
none of its remaining members can fill the void and uncertain about 
who might 
if seniority were the only key prime minister margaret thatcher 
might certainly be voted most likely to assume the summit 
leadership but she is clearly aware that taking the job requires 
more economic wherewithal than her country has 
the united states is the largest most prosperous nation in the 
world and lets be thankful she has taken a leadership role the 
threeterm british leader said in a march radio interview none 
of us can substitute for it we could all help with it 
french president francois mitterrand the host of the 1989 
economic conclave has not shown any inclination to don the mantle 
of world leadership his country is not even a member of natos 
military structure although it does participate in the alliances 
political bodies and his leftleaning economic policies are at 
odds with those of the other allies 
japan fast overtaking the us economy in many ways cannot 
assume leadership of the summit seven its markets are virtually 
closed to the outside world its ability to expand militarily is 
limited by constitutional restraints and it is not a member of the 
nato alliance to which the other summit countries belong 
there is no evidence of any country in the world anxious to 
replace us in our leadership position said penelope 
hartlandthunberg an international affairs scholar at the center 
for strategic and international studies in washington the cost 
and responsibility of leadership is something they wish to avoid 
still the economic decline that has turned the united states 
from the worlds biggest creditor in 1982 to its biggest debtor in 
1988 has left a leadership vacuum begging to be filled 
even at this his final summit reagan was unable to sway his 
partners on his agenda priority the elimination of all 
agriculture subsidies by the end of the century 
the summitteers are hoping reagans successor can turn things 
around 
but the stakes are high and many of the summit leaders would 
prefer that reagan be replaced with a known quantity like george 
bush his vice president who has pledged to carry on the 
presidents program said simon serfaty an academic at the school 
of advanced international studies of john hopkins university in 
washington 
this was underlined by the newest member of the summit club 
italian prime minister ciriaco de mita who emphasized to the other 
leaders the importance of continuity in us policy 
obviously the current policy has been so successful we want 
to ensure it goes on said an italian official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
some of the other leaders feel a republican like bush also would 
be more likely to maintain the free market policies that led to a 
surge of prosperity in the summit countries during the reagan 
administration said serfaty 
but the other presidential hopeful michael dukakis also 
appears to be an economic moderate in a broadranging foreign 
policy speech recently dukakis stressed the importance of 
cooperating with americas allies 
regardless of who wins the november election reagan has left 
for his successor little maneuvering room given the us 
indebtedness that resulted from his economic policies of deep tax 
cuts and enormous military buildup 
the heavy debt to japan and other summit countries growing 
foreign investment and bulging budget and trade deficits virtually 
ensure the continued closeness that has characterized the club in 
the reagan years 
reagan leaves a difficult legacy serfaty said

some recently developed muscle was used in 
reaching a new agricultural trade agreement with japan and us 
negotiators are hoping the rest of the world is suitably impressed 
the pact will open japans door to more us beef and citrus 
over the next few years gradually edging away from the restrictive 
quota system that has been in effect 
fresh from the victory in tokyo us trade representative 
clayton yeutter swirled through news conferences last week to 
explain what was done and how it was accomplished 
the united states had demanded that japan move immediately to 
remove all quotas this brought emotional protests from japanese 
farm groups including threats to boycott us grain and warnings 
to japanese consumers that american beef could be contaminated by 
chemicals 
but yeutter said the us pressure for total and immediate 
removal of quotas was a negotiating tactic 
it would have been impossible for the japanese government to 
make that agreement and survive he said so we had to work out 
a way to achieve full market liberalization as quickly as 
possible 
as it turned out japan agreed to phase out quotas on imported 
beef and fresh oranges within three years and orange juice in four 
years 
yeutter said there had been a fundamental change in the attitude 
of japanese leaders who showed a new willingness to reach an 
agreement 
if there was a sudden dawning or enlightenment among japanese 
officials it was helped along by stepped up us pressure for 
agricultural trade liberalization 
the pressure came from two sources in my judgment yeutter 
said the first is a generic one the fact that weve just been a 
lot more aggressive in opening up markets around the world over the 
last three years or so than we have in the past 
and the government of japan finally has concluded that were 
serious about this and they couldnt stall us off in other words 
they successfully procrastinated on this for 20 years and finally 
concluded that we were coming after them this time 
the second source of pressure he said resulted from us 
decisions to push hard for settlement of trade disputes under the 
94nation general agreement on tariffs and trade which has is 
headquarters in geneva switzerland 
we have finally begun to use the gatt challenging import 
restrictions like this that we believe to be inconsistent with the 
gatt and illegal internationally yeutter said 
late last year a gatt ruling on a complaint by the united states 
held that japan should ease import restrictions on a dozen 
agricultural products including dairy products fruit purees 
tomato juice ketchup dried peas and beans sugars and syrups and 
prepared beef and pork products 
with this victory yeutter said japan was served notice that the 
united states was prepared to go again to gatt for relief of the 
beef and citrus restrictions 
yeutter and others are hopeful that the successful pursuit of 
the japanese agreement on beef and citrus will provide momentum in 
dealing with the european economic community and negotiations of 
new gatt terms for agriculture 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng as well as yeutter and 
many others has been a steady critic of eec policies and has 
plugged heavily for reforms of subsidy programs worldwide 
in september 1986 a gatt meeting in punta del este uruguay 
agreed to seek new trading rules for agriculture in july 1987 the 
united states formally proposed phasing out all subsidies direct 
or indirect that affect agricultural trade and all tariff and 
nontariff barriers over a 10year period 
lyng continues to be optimistic that the process of 
negotiations has been moving along on the us proposal but 
acknowledged last week it will take a lot of work to convince 
other countries during the socalled uruguay round of trade 
negotiations 
in europe leaders of the 12nation trading bloc have denounced 
the us nosubsidy as unworkable and unrealistic 
but yeutter echoing lyngs resolve said the proposal makes 
sense and ought to be faster than the 10 years proposed for the 
subsidy phaseout the eec and the world would better off if it 
were he said

a rush of buying in gasoline futures contracts 
has provided some support for an otherwise bearish energy market 
the july contracts for crude oil which were due to expire came

generally were higher 
july unleaded gasoline gained 052 cent to 4999 cents a gallon 
while home heating oil gained 010 cent to 4328 cents a gallon 
the buying in gasoline was sparked by traders staking positions 
in advance of the release of new supply figures traders believe 
demand will be high and supplies tight for gasoline during the 
summer driving season analysts said 
but analysts said the fundamental tone of the market remained 
bearish following the lack of new initiatives to contain production

texaco incs management may be turning its 
focus back to the oil patch but corporate raider carl c icahn is 
likely to remain a thorn in the oil giants side for some time 
he lost a critical proxy battle for five seats on texacos 
14member board but icahn still owns 149 percent of the companys 
outstanding shares a formidable force to reckon with 
and if a parallel can be drawn to his encounter with usx corp 
icahn may buck popular wisdom and hang onto his texaco shares 
when the steelmaker stymied his buyout overtures last year 
experts predicted icahn would sell out his stake but he did 
nothing of the sort and continues to be usxs largest single 
shareholder 
right now icahn is a passive investor in the pittsburghbased 
steel and energy company but with 10 percent of the outstanding 
shares theres always the possibility that if hes not satisfied 
he might try to acquire the company said dennis sperduto an 
analyst with argus research corp 
texaco sperduto said is far more vulnerable to criticism than 
usx was at the time and icahns exchanges with texaco management 
have been frosty at best 
both sides have swapped barbs and icahn has been on record as 
saying he has no intention of staying with existing management 
said paul ting an analyst at oppenheimer amp co 
after conceding defeat monday in the proxy contest icahn 
announced that he was weighing his options including making a 
hostile tender offer holding his shares or selling them to a third 
party 
time is not of the essence if icahn is to sell his stake he 
must wait until july 20 before pocketing the profits under the 
shortswing profit rule a holder of more than 5 percent of a 
companys stock must keep those shares for at least six months 
otherwise any profits earned revert back to the company 
because a significant amount of stock was voted for icahn 
texaco management is under the gun to perform said rosario 
ilacqua vice president of equity research at nikko securities co 
international inc 
they have to live up to all of the things that the 
shareholders who voted for them are expecting he said 
icahn is taking at least some credit for the reorganization 
texaco has embarked upon 
a keystone of the companys plan was a 3 billion payment to 
pennzoil co to settle a lawsuit resulting from texacos 1984 
acquisition of getty oil co after pennzoil had made earlier moves 
to acquire getty 
in addition texaco has begun selling off up to 5 billion worth 
of marginally profitable assets and says it will distribute 17 
billion of the proceeds to shareholders 
a source close to texaco said that with the restructuring 
underway and the proxy battle over some stability is offered 
now and the management can return to the oil patch 
management also is considering a stock buyback program which 
coupled with the regular quarterly dividend texaco has resumed 
paying could amount to a handsome return for icahn if he decides 
to hold his stake 
one thing most experts agree icahn will not do is dump his 
shares on the open market a move that would have a depressing 
effect on texacos stock price 
more likely would be the sale of his shares in a block to a 
third party but selling the stake could pose a problem for texaco 
management particularly if icahn lined up another oil company as 
the buyer or even the new york investment firm kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co 
kohlberg kravis ensured icahns defeat in the proxy fight by 
voting its 12 million shares for texaco management while the firm 
no longer owns that 49 percent stake it stated it might consider 
purchasing shares in the future and that remained interested in 
the companys progress 
in tuesday trading on the new york stock exchange texaco jumped 
162 a share to close at 4850 amid rumors that the company was 
about to unveil the buyback program and that kohlberg kravis was 
purchasing more shares or mulling a leveraged buyout of the oil 
company

arbitron ratings co plans to offer a national 
television ratings service in the fall of 1990 that will be the 
first to also keep tabs on what the survey families are buying 
the announcement tuesday comes as budgetconscious advertisers 
increasingly are looking beyond the major tv networks to 
alternatives such as cable television special event sponsorships 
and instore promotions to boost sales 
the national television ratings services already being offered 
by ac nielsen co and agb television research measure who watches 
specific shows but not what those viewers end up buying 
aj aurichio president of arbitron a unit of control data 
corp said his service would help national advertisers and ad 
agencies relate what they are spending on television commercials to 
sales results 
he said the service should give the networks information to 
convince advertisers of the selling potential of their medium 
arbitron calls its service scanamerica and has been operating in 
the denver area since april 1987 
at a news conference aurichio said arbitron plans to begin 
operating the scanamerica national service in the fall of 1989 
using a sample of 1000 households in five major markets 
he said the size of the sample would be increased by the fall of 
1990 to 2600 households that would be representative of the 
national population the sample would be increased gradually to 
5000 households by the end of 1992 
aurichio said arbitron expected to lose 125 million over the 
next four to five years introducing the system which would not be 
not expected to break even until 1995 
arbitrons announcement comes as agb another newcomer to the 
national ratings business is putting on a push to get the three 
major networks to subscribe to its ratings service 
agb reportedly has told the three major networks it will cease 
operations unless they buy its service this season agb took on 
nielsen headtohead this past season for the first time cbs 
signed up but abc and nbc did not 
nielsen a unit of dun amp bradstreet corp has been the leader 
in compiling national audience ratings for 30 years arbitron has 
never done national ratings but has compiled local market ratings 
for nearly 40 years 
aurichio said arbitron expects to get as much as 40 percent of 
its revenue from advertisers 35 percent from the networks and 
other television outlets and 25 percent from ad agencies 
the rates for the networks and ad agencies will be comparable to 
those being charged by nielsen he said 
advertisers will be charged about 75000 for each product 
category he said in return they will get ratings and sales data 
as well as information on what brands people bought compared with 
what they watched 
arbitron nielsen and agb each collect viewing information with 
what are known as people meters viewers register when they are 
watching television by punching buttons on a device that resembles 
a remote control handset the meter records who is watching 
specific shows 
arbitrons scanamerica system also includes a product scanner 
that families are asked to use to record what they have purchased 
they pass the wand over the universal product code symbol on each 
package 
the viewing and purchase information is collected electronically 
overnight by arbitrons computers 
in addition to creating the national ratings service arbitron 
said it plans to use the scanamerica system in at least 20 top 
local markets by the end of 1995 including six that currently use 
handwritten diaries and 13 that use meters

in the fastpaced hightech world of the 1990s 
companies thinking about name changes may be better off sticking 
with something old and familiar 
thats one bit of advice from landor associates a san 
franciscobased consulting firm that recently completed a survey of 
consumer perceptions of the names of some of the nations biggest 
corporations 
landor asked 1000 consumers in shopping malls in 12 cities to 
rate 672 different names in terms of familiarity and esteem 
sara lee ranked in the top 15 percent in the latest survey that 
was a marked improvement from the days when it was known as 
consolidated foods and ranked in the bottom 10 percent of the 
landor sample 
allegheny airlines once ranked in the bottom 20 percent in the 
landor survey but placed in the top 40 percent after changing its 
name to usair 
in the 90s major corporations will rediscover the raw image 
power of their established names and may find it much more 
efficient to modify or add meaning to them rather than start from 
scratch said john diefenbach president of the image management 
and strategic design consulting firm 
the survey said consumers thought none too highly of some of the 
hightech names such as usx primerica and unisys 
the old names of those corporations us steel american can 
and the premerger burroughs and sperry respectively each had 
placed higher in previous surveys 
the recently abandoned name allegis as another example ranked 
in the bottom 5 percent of the latest landor survey but the name 
of allegis biggest subsidiary united airlines placed in the top 
15 percent 
shareholders recently dumped the allegis name and returned to 
ual corp as the parent company previously was known 
the message is very simple diefenbach said meaningless 
names and symbols can confuse and alienate the consumer 
so how can companies avoid similar pitfalls 
diefenbach says when new names are considered companies need to 
remember the longstanding equity built up in longstanding brand 
images 
when new names are required he recommends they provide 
genuine favorable and recognizable meaning to the consumer 
otherwise illconceived name changes can destroy good will 
and obscure consumer recognition diefenbach said

proclaiming that safety features are becoming a 
new competitive battleground for automakers ford motor co has 
announced it will make passengerside as well as driverside air 
bags standard equipment on its 1989 lincoln continental 
the move will make ford the first domestic automaker to offer 
the dual bag system ford spokesman bill peacock said tuesday 
chrysler corp already offers a driverside air bag system as 
standard equipment on six models built after may 15 and has been 
touting the devices heavily in advertising by 1990 chrysler plans 
to have driverside bags as standard equipment on all usbuilt 
models 
ford executives scheduled a news conference today in washington 
to give details on which other models would receive the dual bag 
system for 1990 and how the automaker planned to meet government 
requirements for passive restraint systems 
west germanys porsche has offered dual air bags on its 
fourcylinder cars since 1987 as standard equipment on 944 turbo 
and added the 944 s and 944 turbo s for 1988 porsche spokeswoman 
martha mckinley said 
ford last year requested and won for the industry a delay in a 
federal passive restraint regulation that would have required air 
bags on both sides of cars not equipped with automatic seat belts 
instead the national highway traffic safety administration 
allowed automakers to count the singlebag driversideonly 
systems as passive restraints while they developed the dualbag 
systems 
peacock said the decision prevented slower passengerside bag 
development from holding up installation of driverside bags since 
1985 ford has offered air bags as an 815 option on its small ford 
tempomercury topaz cars 
were phasing in the right front air bag in much the same 
fashion we did the driverside bag peacock said 
in the dual system the driverside and passengerside bags 
share a single set of sensors which detect impact and computer 
controls which set off an explosive charge that inflates the bags 
in a fraction of a second 
the nhtsa rule required all automakers to include passive 
restraints air bags or automatic front seat belts on 10 percent 
of their cars in 1987 25 percent in 1988 40 percent in 1989 and 
100 percent in 1990 
ford offers motorized automatic front seat belts on some of its 
smaller cars 
on the tempotopaz the driverside air bag is an 815 option 
peacock said ford has sold about 12000 of the air bagequipped 
tempotopaz models a year since 1985 and expects to sell 50000 
lincoln continentals in 1989 
the dual system is a 3500 option on the base porsche 944 
mckinley said porsche has never offered a driversideonly air bag 
system

rc bigelow inc said tuesday a federal 
appeals court injunction has blocked thomas j lipton inc from 
acquiring celestial seasonings inc pending bigelows appeal of 
the dismissal of its challenge to the acquisition 
in reversing a us district court ruling and granting a stay 
the 2nd district us circuit court of appeals in new york was 
required to find that bigelow has a substantial chance of 
prevailing on the merits of its appeal bigelow said in a news 
release 
bigelow a familyowned maker of herbal teas has contended the 
combination of liptons 32 percent market share with celestials 52 
percent share would constitute an effective monopoly created for 
the specific intent of eliminating competition 
norwalkbased bigelow has a 13 percent share of the us herbal 
tea market 
the appeals court noted bigelows citation of an internal lipton 
memorandum in which a senior lipton executive stated that 
eliminating competition is the course we should pursue 
bigelow also noted liptons agreement to acquire celestial for 
55 million to 75 million more than twice the valuation 
established by kraft inc celestials parent 
they are cheaply buying a monopoly not just a company and it 
would be naive to believe they wont use in any way they can the 
power for which they are paying such an enormous premium bigelow 
chairman david bigelow stated 
lipton a subsidiary of the anglodutch consumer products 
conglomerate unilever group said the large premium it would pay 
for celestial was justified by efficiencies that would be achieved 
through consolidation of operations bigelow stated 
lipton is based in englewood cliffs nj

general motors corps plans to build a 
parts plant aimed at supplying foreign automakers is a big step for 
the auto giant analysts say but there is some skepticism gm can 
make it work 
gms delco products division announced tuesday it would build an 
82000squarefoot plant that would utilize high technology and new 
management techniques to make struts for smaller frontwheeldrive 
cars in this dayton suburb 
plant manager james a bridenbaugh said the lowmass strut 
dampers will be aimed at japanese automakers locating plants in the 
united states although he also expects interest from domestic 
automakers 
production is scheduled to begin next year with 60 people 
expanding to 150 by 1992 said delco spokesman charles w kronbach 
the plant will feature flexible manufacturing cells instead of the 
traditional assembly line and increased responsibilities for 
workers 
it is a bit of a surprise its a big step for them said 
thomas ogrady industry analyst and president of integrated 
automotive resources inc 
kronbach said the struts already had been accepted for use on 
gms new saturn models and on toyota camrys to be built in 
georgetown ky 
delco executives consulted officials of the international union 
of electronics workers local 755 which represents many of the 
3000 delco employees at delcos main kettering plant and 
headquarters kronbach said 
both sides agreed that we needed to find a greenfield site 
like our japanese competitors here with few ties to the main 
plant kronbach said it gives us a fair shot to try our new 
teamwork and technology approach 
gms competitors kayaba showa and tokico are building 
plants in ohio indiana and kentucky close to japanese auto 
assembly plants known as transplants he said 
kronbach said the new plant would be unionized 
maryann keller an analyst with furman selz mager dietz amp 
birney was skeptical saying she had heard a lot of sweeping 
statements about selling to the japanese not only from gm but 
from chrysler corp 
i hope they do it i think working with the transplants will 
create a discipline that they probably lack she said 
they sell to the transplants now they just never put up a 
greenfields site with the specific intention of selling to the 
transplants ms keller said 
kathleen heaney an analyst with nikko securities international 
warned there may be limits to how often gm can establish a new 
plant and new work culture 
they can probably get away with this once the more that they 
try to start building new plants while theyre talking about their 
other plantsnot being competitive and trying to close those 
down i think theyre going to have a hard time she said

the drought is bearing down hard on farmers 
but agriculture department experts say consumers wont feel much of 
the pressure as they do their grocery shopping this year 
if the drought continues food prices will rise but the 
increases are likely to be moderate a senior usda economist said 
tuesday the effects of such higher food prices on the overall 
rate of inflation would be negligible 
although the forecast will be revised next month a preliminary 
analysis shows that 1988 food prices may rise by an average of 3 
percent to 5 percent the report said until the drought usda 
economists predicted the increase would be in the range of 2 
percent to 4 percent compared with a 41 percent gain in 1987 
the report was prepared by assistant secretary for economics 
ewen m wilson who acknowledged that much of the nations 
cropland has been gripped by a searing drought which threatens to 
imperil this summers crop harvests 
no forecast was issued for 1989 predictions for the following 
year traditionally are not released by usda until late november or 
december 
but many economists believe some droughtrelated price increases 
will not appear until next year particularly in meat prices large 
livestock sales by droughtplagued farmers this summer and fall 
could create an initial market glut but could also lead to shorter 
supplies and higher prices later 
wilson said the prospect of reduced production has driven up the 
farm prices of crops and that shriveled forage supplies already 
have forced many producers to reduce their livestock inventories 
as a result there has been apprehension over the possibilities 
of food price increases and even renewed inflation wilson said 
we will see some price runups in certain foods he said 
for example pasta products made from durum wheat and oatsbased 
cereals but overall food price inflation in 1988 will be held to 
moderate levels 
wilson added the upward adjustment of our food price estimate 
will have a negligible impact on the overall rate of inflation in 
the united states 
it is still too early in the crop production cycle to assess the 
full extent of drought damage he said however the impact on 1988 
food prices will be modest for a number or reasons including 
accelerated marketing of livestock will add to already record 
supplies of meat and poultry 
large inventories of corn and other feed grains can help ease 
the damage to livestock and poultry feeding operations 
diverse production areas and irrigation mean that fruit and 
vegetable prices will be largely unaffected even though production 
in some of the great lake states will be down 
soybeans and wheat will be affected but the farm price of 
these account for a relatively small share of the retail value of 
their products such as shortening and bread 
record large global supplies of vegetable oils will moderate 
the price impact on cooking and salad oils 
the most seriously affected crops such as oats and durum 
wheat will have a retail impact but products made from these 
crops represent only a small part of the governments inflation 
indicator 
food accounts for about 16 percent of the governments consumer 
price index or cpi used to gauge changes in living costs for 
urban consumers the most widely used measure of inflation wilson 
said 
food prepared at home accounts for about 10 percent of the 
overall cpi while food purchased or consumed away from home 
mainly restaurant meals accounts for 6 percent 
since food accounts for 16 percent of the overall cpi a 1 
percent boost in food prices translates into an increase of less 
than twotenths of 1 percent in the overall cpi wilson said 
however inflation is a monetary phenomenon dependent upon 
monetary policy there is no reason to believe that a onetime 
droughtinduced boost in farm commodity prices will lead to higher 
overall inflation the metal markets and oil prices continue to be 
well behaved and wage increases are moderate 
according to usda records a rise of 3 percent to 5 percent 
would be the sharpest since food prices rose an average of 79 
percent in 1981 as the nations general inflation spiral was 
winding down 
wilson said higher commodity prices this year will bring about 
a production response in 1989 
more than 78 million acres of us farm land have been taken 
from production this year under federal programs including 24 
million acres in a longterm conservation reserve program 
the immediate problem is not one of food shortages or food 
price inflation except in certain specific instances but rather 
the problem is one of responding in a compassionate way to the 
losses faced by american farmers wilson said

antiunion laws japanese work 
techniques and a scarcity of jobs have begun to transform britains 
oncemilitant labor unions 
singleunion and nostrike deals are spreading provoking a 
bitter fight among the countrys declining unions and threatening 
to split their umbrella organization the trades union congress 
the tuc 
in this ugly redbrick yorkshire city of 59000 a new 
93million plant being built jointly by cocacola co and cadbury 
schweppes plc is bringing 500 new jobs to a region where 
unemployment is 127 percent nearly 4 percentage points above the 
national average 
the plants work force will be represented by a single union 
where past practice would have meant each worker category would 
have had its own union 
but while that may be bad news for the 120yearold tuc it is 
no big issue in places like wakefield where the decline of 
traditional coal and textile industries makes getting a job much 
more important than defending union rights 
unions are on the way out said wakefields nigel bilton 22 
years old and unemployed i think unions should be abolished 
thirty singleunion deals 10 of which include nostrike 
provisions have been struck in british industry up from six 
singleunion deals and zero nostrike agreements five years ago 
according to the amalgamated engineering union aeu 
the number is growing we envision it doubling by the end of 
this year says john mann the unions research manager 
such deals under which one union represents all the workers at 
a plant and arbitration replaces strikes are expected to multiply 
even faster after a stunning defeat for the unions in scotland this 
past march 
japanese then american and now british companies have sought 
these new singleunion deals because they find it simpler and 
cheaper to negotiate with one union rather than several 
the 42000 workers at ford motor co in britain for example 
have 12 different unions 
ford has scrapped plans to build an electronics plant in dundee 
in scotland because it couldnt get its unions to accept the 
singleunion deal it had reached with the amalgamated engineering 
union 
the dramatic reversal scuttled what would have been fords 23rd 
british plant cost 450 new jobs and provoked widespread anger 
against what scottish secretary malcolm rifkind termed the unions 
neanderthal attitudes 
opponents of singleunion deals maintain however that one 
union cannot adequately represent a work force ranging from 
engineers to typists 
championing the new union deals are the 800000member aeu and 
the 360000member electrical electronic telecommunication and 
plumbing union eetpu 
membership in the 84union tuc has shrunk from 13 million to 9 
million since 1979 and the government can now boast that the days 
when britain could be crippled by strikes are over days lost to 
strikes have fallen from 29 million in 1979 to just 25 million in 
the year up to march 
unemployment is one reason but another is prime minister 
margaret thatchers legislation which forces unions to take strike 
votes and obtain a 55percent yesvote before calling a walkout 
the legislation also outlaws secondary picketing and no longer 
requires employers to recognize a union even if employees have 
chosen it in a vote 
the trades union congress is threatening to expel the eetpu 
electricians at its annual meeting in september over singleunion 
deals 
at the same time the eetpu is asking its members in a ballot 
whether to pull out of the tuc and talking to the aeu about joining 
forces to form their own breakaway organization that would take 
away oneninth of the tucs membership 
such a split in the union movement would change the face of 
industrial relations and have serious implications for the labor 
party the independent newspaper wrote 
the labor party is the main opposition to mrs thatchers 
conservative party government and the unions are the laborites 
power base 
the wakefield factory which is europes newest softdrink 
plant is going to mean a lot for the community of wakefield 
said mayor george parkinson 
dick croft a local official for the engineering union that will 
represent the wakefield plant workers said the community was lucky 
that coke and cadbury decided to have any union at all 
the new style has been introduced largely by egalitarianminded 
japanese companies that have abolished separate dress codes put in 
employee canteens and provided parking lots for hourly workers as 
well as for management 
they offer enticing wages in return for high productivity and 
shopfloor moderation british workers have embraced the change 
confounding those who accuse them of resisting change and upholding 
class distinctions 
norman willis the tucs general secretary argues that 
singleunion deals encourage damaging competition among unions for 
a smaller pool of members in the trade union movement 
the 135millionmember transport and general workers union 
britains largest also is a major opponent of the new style for 
pretty much the same reasons 
but up here in yorkshire the engineering unions croft said 
the world is changing we dont enjoy the same franchise we had a 
few years ago

ashland oil inc attorneys have asked a 
federal judge to set aside a nearly 70 million civil award to two 
former vice presidents citing trial errors and excessive damages 
the motions filed monday asks that us district judge william 
o bertelsman hold a new trial if he wont overturn the verdict 
after an eightweek trial a jury earlier this month awarded 
former ashland oil vice presidents bill e mckay 144 million and 
harry williams 77 million in lost earnings and benefits 
the two claimed they were fired in 1983 for refusing to bribe 
foreign officials to obtain crude oil or to help cover up such 
illegal payments 
lawyers for ashland and the other defendants chairman john 
hall senior vice president richard spears and former chairman orin 
atkins dispute the verdicts in the documents filed monday 
the filing claims ashland deserves a new trial because the 
defendants werent given time to present their case bertelsman 
allowed improper evidence to be introduced and the damages awarded 
were beyond what mckay or williams could have earned with ashland 
the motions also say bertelsman gave confusing instructions to the 
jury 
the amount of the awards had been tripled because jurors also 
found ashland had engaged in a pattern of illegal interstate 
activity paying bribes to foreign officials the two men were 
awarded punitive damages on top of the triple damages

orders to us factories for big ticket durable goods 
plunged 22 percent in may the steepest dive in nine months the 
government said today 
the commerce department said orders for durables goods items 
expected to last three or more years totaled a seasonally adjusted 
1148 billion last month 
the report which showed the biggest drop in new orders since 
august surprised economists the entire may decline can be 
accounted for by a precipitous 9 percent decline in orders for 
transportation equipment 
many experts had predicted a rise of more than 2 percent in 
orders on the strength of two big orders late in may to boeing 
commercial airplanes co one from united airlines the other from 
american airlines but those orders apparently were not recorded in 
the commerce departments preliminary estimate of durable goods 
on tuesday a government report of lowerthanexpected inflation 
during may encouraged the stock market but the good news was 
offset by a surge in commodity prices related to the farm belt 
drought 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 2524 points to 
210917 on tuesday bond prices were flat and the dollar was 
narrowly lower 
the labor department said consumer prices rose a modest 03 
percent in may 
but drought fears drove corn futures prices up their daily limit 
for the sixth straight day on the chicago board of trade soybean 
futures also rose sharply while wheat futures retreated 
the drought will push up food prices this summer but costlier 
food will add only about half a percentage point to the overall 
rise in the consumer price index predicted john hagens an 
economist for the wefa group of bala cynwyd pa 
for the first five months of 1988 consumer prices have risen at 
an annual rate of 44 percent the same pace as in 1987 
where is the inflation bear sandra shaber an analyst for 
the futures group a washington consulting firm said his 
footprints are not in much evidence right now 
but ms shaber and several other economists warned that 
inflation was only hibernating 
higher prices for gasoline and medical costs were behind most of 
the inflation in may but they were offset somewhat by a leveling 
off of clothing prices 
in a related report tuesday the labor department said 
americans average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation 
fell 03 percent in may the decrease follows an increase of 10 
percent in april and a drop of 06 percent in march 
the changes left americans inflationadjusted earnings 07 
percent below a year ago 
in the commodity markets analysts said the national weather 
services latest sixto10 day forecast for hot dry weather in the 
midwest through the end of the month threatened further damage to 
corn oat and soybean crops and inspired new buying of futures 
contracts 
with the corn crop each week that goes by without rain means 
another 10 percent is lost said joel karlin an analyst with 
research department inc in chicago some experts estimate anywhere 
from 10 to 30 percent of the us corn crop already has been ruined 
by lack of rain 
in a report on the nations savings and loan industry the 
government said sampls overall continued losing huge amounts of money 
in the first three months of this year 
the federal home loan bank board said the 3118 federally 
insured sampls lost 378 billion only slightly below the 381 
billion record set in the last three months of 1987

rain answered some prayers in the parched midwest where 
neighbors informed on water wasters by the hundreds but as the 
nation buckled under record heat eastern farmers began worrying 
that drought conditions were heading their way 
more record high temperatures today were expected to burn 
lingering moisture from droughtchoked soil in the nations farm 
belt temperatures topped the 100degree mark in 23 states tuesday 
the first day of summer and set 67 records 
however it looks like things will be not quite as hot as they 
were the last couple days said hugh crowther of the national 
weather service in kansas city mo 
meteorologists forecast no major rainfall in the next few days 
although widely scattered showers and thunderstorms dampened the 
central plains and great lakes region this morning while strong 
thunderstorms lashed parts of wisconsin and michigan 
the heat and lack of rain also continued to shrink water levels 
on rivers staunching traffic on parts of the mississippi and ohio 
as barges ran aground or became snagged in bottlenecks 
i cant keep the mississippi river open said cmdr 
michael donohoe with the coast guard near memphis tenn where 
officials expect a towboat traffic jam of up to 1800 barges 
mother nature is going to make that decision for us

stored for the winter buying feed at higher prices or selling 
their herds in a falling market 
i see tears i see anger said laura koenig of stratford 
wis who runs a program to help farmers deal with stress i see 
very tired men women giving up and walking away children saying 
i dont want to go in the barn

to use that to feed this summer and then im going to sell the herd

al beanblossom assistant manager for the waterford township water 
and sewer department thats why i think people are turning in 
their neighbors 
we laugh about it beanblossom said we say here comes 
another squealer 
there was little laughter in the east however where signs of 
drought began appearing pennsylvania authorities on tuesday warned 
the next two weeks are critical 
things are drying out pretty quickly out there said gene 
schenck spokesman for the state agriculture department the hot 
sun and the breeze take the moisture right out of the soil 
a weekly state survey of 225 farmers and county extension agents 
showed 80 percent reported their soil was short of moisture last 
week schenck said

britains commercial banks heeding a signal from 
the bank of england raised their base lending rate by half a 
percentage point wednesday to 9 percent 
it was the third increase in the benchmark rate in less than 
three weeks and represented a concerted effort by prime minister 
margaret thatchers conservative government to curb inflationary 
pressures and boost the pound 
the bank of england signaled the increase by raising a key money 
market intervention rate 
barclays bank plc responded immediately by raising its base rate 
from 85 percent to 9 percent effective thursday midland bank 
plc national westminster bank plc and lloyds bank plc quickly 
followed suit 
corporate borrowers can obtain loans from commercial banks at 1 
percentage point above the base lending rate 
there was little reaction in financial markets to the increase 
the pound was slightly higher but dealers said the currencys 
response was restricted because the rate hike had already been 
discounted 
commercial banks increased their base lending rate from 75 
percent to 8 percent on june 2 and then to 85 percent on june 6 
the base rate had been cut from 8 percent to 75 percent on may 17 
in an attempt to restrain a strong rise in the pound at the time 
government figures for inflation jobs growth and output have 
highlighted the fact that the british economy continues to boom

for the millions of people who daily board 
the mexico city subway system the price of a ticket is sticking at 
100 pesos less than a nickel a ride 
a stack of tortillas the mainstay of the mexican diet can 
still be bought for about a nickel a pound and the prices of milk 
gasoline and a host of other products havent changed much 
the governments shock program has jolted the worrisome 
tripledigit inflation out of the economy at least temporarily 
government officials are boasting the accomplishments of their 
plan which has frozen the prices of governmentregulated goods 
the minimum wage and the exchange rate of the peso currency it 
also calls for federal spending cuts a tight monetary policy and 
opening the economy to more foreign trade 
so far the results of the economic solidarity pact have been 
impressive consumer prices skyrocketed a record 155 percent in 
january but rose 19 percent in may for the slowest gain in 6 
years 
still some analysts say its too soon to tell whether high 
inflation has been permanently chased away 
were in the honeymoon stage said jonathan heath 
coordinating director of the forecasting firm macro asesoria 
economica 
you cannot say it is successful nor a failure because the pact 
has only one objective that is to reduce inflation permanently 
said heath whats been done so far is reduce inflation 
temporarily the only real verdict well be able to give of the 
pact is down the road 
rogelio ramirez de la o of the ecanal consulting firm agreed 
its too early to say whether theres a permanent reduction in 
inflation 
to the man on the street not much seems to have changed 
construction worker ismael carrasco waiting for a job in the 
downtown zocalo plaza dismissed the goverments program as a 
lie 
instead of helping us they are grinding us down day after 
day more and more everything is going up he complained 
across the street at monte de piedad the national pawnshop 
dozens of people lined up early on a recent morning to hock their 
valuables for a little money to meet expenses 
it is still very difficult said norberto godinez a watch 
repairman who pawned a watch to get 35000 pesos about 1550 
to buy parts for his work inflation is the same 
president miguel de la madrid unveiled the solidarity pact in 
middecember after officials became worried that mexico was on the 
verge of spinning into the hyperinflationary swirls of other latin 
american countries 
consumer prices rose a record 1592 percent last year well 
above the 1057 percent posted in the previous year analysts were 
predicting the 1988 pace could well hit the 200 percent mark 
moreover the stock market once one of the worlds top 
performers collapsed speculation in the peso currency was 
widespread 
it was a wise thing to do something when the situation went 
out of control in november 1987 said ramirez de la o it is 
probably the only thing that could have been done 
analysts are predicting an inflation rate in the range of 40 
percent to 50 percent for 1988 if the government maintains its 
tight clamp on wages prices and the exchange rate through the end 
of november when de la madrids sixyear term ends the government 
has already said the program will run through august 
de la madrid is virtually certain to be succeeded by carlos 
salinas de gortari the standardbearer of the ruling institutional 
revolutionary party salinas de gortari has said in campaign 
speeches that he intends to press the inflation fight 
we feel that the new administration will continue the 
antiinflation policy to eradicate inflation hopefully bringing it 
below doubledigit inflation in 1989 said abel beltran del 
rio executive director of the mexican forecasting project 
ciemexwefa in bala cynwyd pa 
we feel this is the program that is going to end the inflation 
decadeandahalf of mexico he said 
mexico is at the cutting edge in terms of macroeconomic 
policy of highdebt countries said a knowledgeable analyst who 
spoke on condition of anonymity mexicos foreign debt is 100 
billion the second highest in the developing world after brazil 
the initial goal of the solidarity program was to trim the 
inflation rate to 2 percent a month by years end 
government officials have said in recent weeks the price pace 
should be similar to that of mexicos trading partners inflation 
is running just over 4 percent in the united states mexicos no1 
trading partner 
under the solidarity pact prices on goods and services 
regulated by the government have been frozen since march 
government officials have applied pressure on business leaders to 
keep a lid on their prices resulting in a virtual economywide 
freeze 
before the freeze the government nearly doubled some official 
prices giving a sharp kick to costs throughout the economy 
the government also ordered in march a hold on the exchange rate 
of the peso currency it has ranged between 2240 pesos and 2280 
pesos to the dollar since then the peso lost about a fifth of its 
value in a sharp devaluation in december 
the minimum wage in mexico city has been maintained at 8000 
pesos a day about 350 since april unskilled workers got 
raises of a cumulative 38 percent before the freeze 
with the wideranging holds analysts say the inflation rate had 
to ease 
but some worry that once the freezes are lifted prices could 
resume their upward climb argentina and brazil which have used 
shock programs in recent years have still been unable to lick high 
inflation 
heath suggests that the mexican government thaw its frozen 
prices at the depths of the economic downturn now beginning to be 
felt with low economic activity there would be little need for 
businesses to boost their prices sharply 
we dont expect an explosion of prices beltran del rio 
said we anticipate increases sure but not increases of 30 40 
or 50 percent 
analysts also say the government needs to stick to efforts to 
pare its spending 
if the government does not adjust its public finances we will 
see that inflation will pick up again said ramirez de la o if 
the government does adjust we can take for granted controls can be 
removed without inflationary consequences 
but he said its too early to say the government has taken 
the pill of austerity

the mexican stock exchange one of the 
worlds hottest before octobers global collapse is regaining some 
of its lost luster 
the index of prices and quotations the main gauge of market 
activity has recently surpassed the 200000 mark surging more 
than 90 percent from the start of the year

8660675 on jan 7 before beginning its slow rebound 
rogelio ramirez de la o of the private ecanal forecasting firm 
describes the market as cautiously up 
other analysts say the exchange may be reflecting the initial 
success of the governments economic solidarity pact the 
antiinflation program put in place in middecember by president 
miguel de la madrid 
the program has frozen the minimum wage the prices of 
governmentregulated goods and services and the pesodollar 
exchange rate it also has promised to cut government spending 
restrain monetary and credit policy and open the economy to more 
foreign trade 
since its inception interest rates have tumbled sharply the 
interest rate on 28day treasury bills has plunged from a high of 
nearly 160 percent in february to about 40 percent bank interest 
rates have taken a similar dive 
with a steady exchange rate mexicans have been bringing their 
money back from foreign mostly us banks and investing in 
shortterm instruments and the stock market analysts said 
a breakdown of index figures by sector shows the value of mining 
stocks soared 51 percent from the end of january to the end of may 
manufacturing stocks were up 40 percent construction stocks 
increased 17 percent and communications and transportation issues 
climbed 59 percent the stocks of service companies were off 8 
percent during the same period 
the index gained 124 percent in all of last year off from the 
stunning 321 advance of 1986

entrepreneurs who believe the american 
dream can be found in a footlong submarine sandwich travel here 
each month to learn how to make mounds of money stuffing pounds of 
food into freshbaked buns 
their teacher and inspiration is fred deluca the man who would 
be and is the king of subs 
twentythree years after deluca opened his first sub shop in 
nearby bridgeport to raise money for college his fastfood chain 
has grown to more than 2200 stores and new shops are opening at a 
rate of between 20 and 30 a week 
his company subway sandwiches amp salads is one of the fastest 
growing fastfood chains in the country and was recently named 
americas top franchise by the magazine entrepreneur which 
compiles a franchise 500 
subway subs are being gobbled up at quite a clip the chain says 
it is selling 15 million feet of sandwiches a week to customers 
who like to watch their meals take shape before their eyes and to 
their specifications 
last year gross sales totaled 360 million an 89 percent 
increase over the year before when there were only about half as 
many franchises 
subway has its origins in petes super submarine sandwiches a 
business deluca opened in 1965 at age 17 with the help of a family 
friend peter buck as the story is told buck suggested the idea 
to deluca as a way for him to make money for college gave him 
1000 in starting capital and agreed to be his partner 
aided by the decision in 1975 to start franchising the company 
was able to meet its 10year goal of 32 stores and begin expanding 
in earnest subway opened its first store in alaska this spring and 
will soon have franchises in every state except wyoming and south 
dakota 
subway shops can also be found in canada the bahamas and 
bahrain and starting sometime this month folks down under will be 
able to try out such specialties as the subway club a combination 
of roast beef turkey and ham when several stores open around 
perth in western australia 
the recent explosion in growth is the result largely of 
franchisees investing in additional stores deluca said 
new franchisees learn about bookkeeping hiring management 
costcontrol and the finer points of making subs during twoweek 
courses that begin every other monday at the companys headquarters 
here now spread out over four locations but soon to be 
consolidated in a new building 
the students spend half their time at stores where the owners 
have agreed to help take part in training 
the students of submarinemaking come from all walks of life 
and from all over the world said alexander dembski the director 
of training 
many recent immigrants and other people who are short on cash 
and long on ambition are attracted to the relatively low startup 
costs a typical first store can be opened for about 65000 or as 
much as 20000 less if equipment is leased deluca said the 
franchise fee itself is only 7500 
the students are typically a motley group a salesman 
draftsman fastfood restaurant employee computer consultant 
postal service worker and lumber broker were among the trainees 
enrolled in a recent class 
deluca addresses each class at least three times drumming into 
the trainees heads the importance of such simple notions as 
increasing sales while decreasing costs his dress and his manner 
are casual 
why am i here because they are really joining a new 
society said deluca as several students waited patiently to be 
photographed with their leader after class its important people 
get an orientation as to what the company and its president are 
like 
deluca knows why the trainees have come to his school and it 
is not because they have always dreamed of making subs or hoagies 
heroes torpedos grinders or poor boys as the sandwiches are 
variously called in different parts of the country 
who ever since they were kids wanted to grow up and make 
sandwiches he asks his class prompting a wave of chuckles 
ok he continues why do you want to open a sandwich 
shop the trainees unabashedly declare their true motives to 
make lots of money to get incredibly wealthy to be my own 
boss 
subway officials say much of the success of their business is 
due to the emphasis placed on individualized service on letting 
customers watch as many stages of the sandwichmaking process as is 
feasible including the baking of the rolls about four times 
daily in ovens with glass doors 
the visual appeal of the process is important people want to 
be able to say can i have a little more lettuce said training 
chief dembski people like to see their food prepared expressly 
for them 
added deluca certainly our growth would not have been 
possible if it had not been for companies like mcdonalds leading 
the way and going out and showing the importance of eating 
continuously but lets face it people get burgered out

in the time it takes to read this sentence six 
rows of knitting or about 1000 stitches can be knit on even the 
cheapest home knitting machine 
revolution or evolution the experts arent quite sure but all 
agree that the recent surge in knitting machine sales is changing 
the face of home knitting in the united states 
the growth has already started were in the infancy of a 
knitting machine boom said rick drainville of white knitting 
machines co a division of vws inc in cleveland if you asked 
someone what a knitting machine was five 10 years ago they would 
have looked at you 
i will increase my business at least tenfold in the next four 
years agreed gjoko ruzio president of the kimberly market co 
of stockton nj which imports the lightweight bond knitting 
machine im aiming to sell 250000 units per year by 1992 
us knitting machine sales rose from about 5000 in 1980 to 
50000 in 1986 according to figures compiled by white knitting 
machines it is estimated that about 70000 machines will be sold 
this year 
for the uninitiated knitting machines come in several distinct 
models and price ranges 
lightweight or hobby machines range from 200 to 350 not 
including accessories 
punchcard machines which are able to automatically repeat a 
pattern of up to 24 stitches range from 400 to 850 without 
accessories 
stateoftheart electronic machines some of which can take a 
photocopy of a design and reproduce it on a knitted fabric range 
from 950 to almost 1600 
accessories vary widely from 2 weights that ensure even 
knitting to ribbers that can knit and purl in the same row to 
motors that cost almost as much as the machine itself perhaps the 
most advanced accessory is a computer that allows knitters to 
design their own patterns in color on their television sets 
electronic machines are driving the market demand said 
allen tuchman vice president of knitking corp in los angeles 
each machine with more hoots and bells really does allow you to 
use it more 
all machines save one the harmony autoknitter of maine are 
imported european knitting machines are imported by passap vws 
and kimberly market co japanese machines are imported by brother 
international corp knitking corp singer sewing co studio 
products inc and newtons knits inc 
lightweight machines are beginning to be sold through mass 
market retailers like jc penney co inc but individual dealers 
still sell the vast majority of machines dealers and importers 
offer a number of support systems to help machine knitters expand 
their expertise including lessons and seminars newsletters 
800numbers service centers patterns and clubs 
experts hail the growth of machine knitting as the salvation of 
an industry that has been on the wane 
our lifestyle is not what it used to be handknitting is 
fading because of demands on peoples time said lynne higgins a 
former yarn shop owner in chattanooga tenn who now produces and 
distributes videotape knitting machine lessons 
machines are the best thing happening to the yarn industry 
agreed karen ancona editor of craft amp needlework age in 
englishtown nj yarn sales which had been dropping have 
stabilized 
who is buying knitting machines 
many lightweight machines are being purchased for or by teens 
or by women in their mid20s who have more limited time and income 
than women in the 40to60yearold bracket according to higgins 
cynthia monsky of the singer sewing co says about 40 percent of 
the people who buy singer knitting machines do so in order to sell 
their work some of these knitters supply the colorado and new 
england ski industries 
nancy j thomas editor of vogue knitting says sewers and 
weavers are attracted to knitting machines the former because of 
their familiarity with machines and the latter because they can 
obtain results so quickly 
you can finish a project in less than a day said marlene 
cuniberti owner of the machine knitting studio in englewood nj 
and editor of macknit a magazine for machine knitters ive 
knitted a quilt for a twin bed in a couple of hours 
machine knitting sales are particularly strong but not limited 
to the northeast midwest and california 
knitting used to be dictated by climate but thats no longer 
true said carol nepton spokeswoman for brother international 
corp in piscataway nj florida and texas are in major growth 
patterns because of the popularity of cotton yarns and shortsleeve 
sweaters 
our hopes and dreams are to make the knitting machine as 
essential to the home as a sewing machine said nepton adding 
that 80 percent of us homes own a sewing machine we need to 
get it into the school systems the home economics classes we 
havent even cracked that area yet 
speed and the potential for creativity are cited as the main 
reasons for purchasing a knitting machine 
we want to speak to the lady who is looking for a hobby in 
which she can become creative said kimberlys ruzio we teach 
her to paint by numbers and then give her the tools to become a 
warhol or a da vinci

brazil has reached agreement with 
international bankers on its huge foreign debt the countrys 
finance minister said 
we have concluded all points of the accord finance minister 
mailson da nobrega said tuesday brazil is satisfied with the 
agreement it is the best accord reached so far with bankers 
the agreement which gives brazil 52 billion in new loans was 
not immediately signed but a communique would be issued in new york 
and brazil within the next two days da nobrega said 
brazils 700 creditor banks must still work out the exact amount 
each would give the country however brazil is not involved in 
that part of the agreement da nobrega said 
brazils owes its creditors a total of 120 billion making it 
the largest debtor among developing countries 
finance ministry representatives and a committee representing 
the creditors have been negotiating for months on an accord that 
would satisfy all parties 
brazil is to receive 46 billion this year and 600 million 
during the first three months of 1989 the last installment is 
contingent on brazils compliance with an economic agreement being 
drawn up under international monetary fund guidelines da nobrega 
said 
there is a 12year payback period with a fiveyear grace period 
on the new loan 
in february 1987 brazil announced a moratorium on interest 
payments and said it needed to restructure its debt at that time 
president jose sarney said the countrys reserves had fallen to 
less than 4 billion and it could not afford to make the payments 
under the agreement the interest owed to private bankers on 70 
billion of its overall debt would be paid back over a 20year 
period with an eightyear grace period 
brazil also will pay bankers 300 million to 400 mmillion that 
was due in march 
after brazil announced its moratorium on payments many large 
us banks made large additions to their reserves for bad loans 
the additions resulted in heavy losses for us banking companies 
during 1987

president helen petrauskas said at a news conference 
west germanys porsche has offered dual air bags on its 
fourcylinder cars since 1987 as standard equipment on 944 turbo 
and added the 944 s and 944 turbo s for 1988 porsche spokeswoman 
martha mckinley said 
in may chrysler corp announced it was including driverside 
air bags as standard equipment on six models built after may 15 by 
1990 chrysler plans to have driverside bags as standard equipment 
on all usbuilt models 
ford last year requested and won for the industry a delay in a 
federal passive restraint regulation that would have required air 
bags on both sides of cars not equipped with automatic seat belts 
instead the national highway traffic safety administration 
allowed automakers to count the singlebag driversideonly 
systems as passive restraints while they developed the dualbag 
systems 
petrauskas said the decision prevented slower passengerside bag 
development from holding up installation of driverside bags since 
1985 ford has offered air bags as an option on its small ford 
tempomercury topaz cars 
petrauskas said safety had become an area of intense competition 
among the nations automakers 
that safety race is in high gear she said 
in the dual system the driverside and passengerside bags 
share a single set of sensors which detect impact and computer 
controls which set off an explosive charge that inflates the bags 
in a fraction of a second 
the nhtsa rule required all automakers to include passive 
restraints air bags or automatic front seat belts on 10 percent 
of their cars in 1987 25 percent in 1988 40 percent in 1989 and 
100 percent in 1990 
ford said 11 of its 1990 car lines will have driverside air 
bags as standard equipment with projected sales of 1 million 
vehicles petrauskas said 
on the tempotopaz the driverside air bag is an 815 option 
ford said it has sold about 12000 of the air bagequipped 
tempotopaz models a year since 1985 and expects to sell 50000 
lincoln continentals in 1989 
the dual system is a 3500 option on the base porsche 944 
mckinley said adding that porsche has never offered a 
driversideonly air bag system

orders to us factories for big ticket 
durable goods plunged 22 percent in may the steepest dive in nine 
months the government said today 
the commerce department said orders for durables goods items 
expected to last three or more years totaled a seasonally adjusted 
1148 billion last month 
it was the biggest drop in new orders since august when orders 
plummeted 23 percent and followed a 18 percent increase in 
april revised upward from a previous estimate of 10 percent 
the entire may decline can be accounted for by a precipitous 9 
percent decline in orders for transportation equipment 
at the white house spokesman b jay cooper called the report on 
new orders volatile mays decline should not be cause for 
concern shipments continue to show strength and the backlog of 
unfilled orders remains high 
more news that inflation remains under control it is good 
news copper added 
economists were surprised by the report most had predicted a 
rise of more than 2 percent in orders on the strength of two big 
orders late in may to boeing commercial airplanes co one from 
united airlines the other from american airlines but those orders 
apparently were not recorded in the commerce departments 
preliminary estimate of durable goods 
excluding transportation orders increased 03 percent 
excluding just aircraft overall orders increased 06 percent 
cynthia latta senior financial economist at data resources 
inc a lexington mass forecasting firm said excluding aircraft 
and defense order levels are not half bad 
i think what were seeing is what we want to see which is 
continued growth but maybe some moderation of the pace she 
said stronger growth would inject inflation pressure into the 
economy she said 
orders in the volatile defense goods category fell 166 percent 
to 83 billion following an increase of 19 percent a month 
earlier 
excluding defense orders declined 09 percent following a 18 
percent rise in april 
the key category of nondefense capital goods considered a sign 
of business expansion plans fell 69 percent last month following 
a 34 percent rise a month earlier despite the setback in may 
analysts still expect exportproducing manufacturers to spend 
heavily on modernization and expansion 
orders for primary metals such as steel zoomed 55 percent 
following a 16 percent rise in april 
orders for electrical machinery also posted a strong gain 35 
percent following a 50 percent rise a month before 
there was a 24 percent decline in orders for nonelectrical 
machinery more than erasing a 12 percent gain in april 
shipments of durable goods rose 15 percent in may to 1144 
billion following a 09 percent decline in april

cannon group tentatively agreed to a 33 
million settlement of classaction lawsuits that accused the firm 
of inflating its stock price 
the settlement announced by the company tuesday was 13 
million greater than a partial agreement announced in april 
cannon said it would be required to pay 9 million of the 
settlement with the rest paid by insurance carriers for directors 
officers and former outside auditors who also were defendants 
the tentative agreements will not constitute any admission of 
any liability or wrongdoing the company said adding that its 
board found it in the best interests of cannon and its shareholders 
to settle the suits at this time 
the suits were filed by shareholders last august after cannon 
disclosed that the securities and exchange commission was 
conducting an inquiry into how the firm accounted for its film 
costs 
that inquiry turned into a formal investigation in november when 
the sec filed a fraud complaint 
control of the independent production group shifted in april to 
a consortium of european stockholders led by giancarlo parretti 
who was named chief executive former top executvies menahem golan 
and yoram globus were named to head the firms moviemaking 
subsidiary 
cannon may be required to change its accounting procedures under 
the agreement the firm said

a federal judge ruled today that a government 
agency cant force the financially ailing ltv corp to reassume 
more than 2 billion in pension obligations simply because a new 
labor contract restored previously cut benefits 
since the agencys decision is not sustainable on the 
administrative record the appropriate remedy is to vacate the 
restoration decision giving back responsibility for the pensions 
to ltv ruled us district judge robert w sweet sitting in 
new york 
but sweet also found that while the federal pension benefit 
guaranty corp hasnt proved on the administrative record that ltv 
should take back the plans the agency might be able to do so at 
trial and sent the issue back to the pbgc for further 
consideration 
separately a us bankruptcy court in new york approved the 
sale of subsidiary ltv steel cos warren works to renco group inc 
despite an apparent higher cash bid offered by bmac corp a 
california company the renco offer included about 112 million in 
cash a 30 million promissory note and 5 million in assumed 
liabilities 
ltv a giant steel aerospace and energy company filed for 
protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the us 
bankruptcy code in july 1986 
sweet also said ltv wasnt entitled to block the move restoring 
its pension obligations simply because it is in chapter 11 
proceedings and denied the companys request for an order 
enforcing an automatic stay of the pension plan restoration 
the pbgc which insures the pensions of 30 million us workers 
took over ltvs steel industry pension plans last january after the 
company terminated them the plans were 2 billion in debt making 
the pbgc ltvs largest creditor 
but when a new ltv labor contract restored to workers some 
benefits previously cut the agency claimed that the company was 
taking unfair advantage of federal funds to cut costs and gain 
labor peace 
there is no factual or legal basis for the pbgcs finding that 
ltv has abused the pension termination insurance program sweet 
said in a 126page opinion adding that the court record is not 
sufficiently developed to permit a finding that ltv steels 
financial condition has improved to the point where it can afford 
to sponsor its previously terminated plans 
ltv the nations no 2 steelmaker claims that restoring the 
plans and their deficit will seriously hamper its ability to 
reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade as forecasts for rain 
slowed the droughtdriven rally 
oat futures advanced their daily limit to a new record high of 
334 a bushel and corn for july delivery also closed limitup 
but soybeans finished mixed and wheat closed mostly lower on hedge 
selling as the winter wheat harvest accelerated 
forecasts for light scattered showers in the eastern corn belt 
prompted a wave of profittaking in soybean futures said dale 
gustafson an analyst in chicago with drexel burnham lambert inc 
but corn prices were strong all day on fears that damage to the 
crop was bound to worsen if the midwest continued to swelter in 
hot dry weather 
there was a little nervousness about the rain but there was 
enough commercial buying to offset that gustafson said corn 
has a much shorter time frame than soybeans for it to get some 
beneficial rains 
oat futures soared on reports that 50 percent of the us crop 
had been lost to the drought 
at the close wheat was 4 cents lower to 8 cents higher with 
july at 385 a bushel corn was 4 cents to the limit 10 cents 
higher with july at 344 a bushel oats were 7 cents to 15 cents 
higher with july at 333 a bushel soybeans were 11 cents lower

a delaware partnership said wednesday it has 
acquired a 71 percent stake in zenith electronics corp and may 
seek to acquire the computer and television maker 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission 
brookhurst partners limited partnership said it believes its 
holding of 185 million zenith shares makes it the companys 
largest single shareholder 
brookhurst said in a statement that it does not consider 
itself a passive investor and intends to encourage management to 
enhance stockholder values to that end the partnership said it 
was considering purchasing more zenith shares and making a 
proposal with respect to a business combination with zenith 
a spokesman for glenview illbased zenith had no comment on 
wall street the companys stock rose 87 cents to close at 2925 
a share 
brookhurst began accumulating zenith shares on april 25 for 
about 19 a share the partnership steadily continued its purchases 
until late june when the shares were trading in the 28 range 
according to documents provided by the partnership 
zenith had revenue of 236 billion in 1987 but reported a loss 
of 191 million its third consecutive annual loss the company 
attributed the shortfall to sharply reduced operating results in 
its consumer electronics division as well as the slow and 
costly introduction of new picture tube technology 
earlier this month zenith announced it was continuing to 
examine all options to restore overall corporate profitability to a 
satisfactory level among the options the company hinted at was 
the sale of the consumer electronics operations which generated 
about 11 billion in revenue last year 
the consumer electronics division makes television sets 
videocassette recorders and cable products the companys other 
main business is in personal computers and computer components 
analysts note that zenith is highly debtridden and has little 
cash on hand making it not a particularly attractive takeover 
candidate 
zenith strengthened its shareholderrights provision in april 
saying the takeover defense was intended to guard against abusive 
tactics such as the gradual accumulation of shares and partial 
tender offers 
brookhurst said it was formed expressly to acquire zenith 
shares the group is headed by herbert abelow a former managing 
director of the investment firm first boston corp and nicholas 
ihasz who from 1976 to 1980 directed the floor trading operations 
of ivan f boesky amp co the two now head abelow ihasz amp co of new

gold prices slipped republic national bank of new york quoted a 
bid price of 44880 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 pm edt 
down from 45170 late tuesday

that statement gave the market a signal to buy dollars said 
earl johnson a vice president at harris trust and savings bank in 
chicago 
this was a big jump considering the quiet trading of the past 
couple of weeks he added

the currency a further lift 
the dollar rallied strongly in european dealings in frankfurt

signs of nervousness about whether the dollar could hold at its 
current elevated levels

above 130 yen

interest rates was announced but the move had only a modest impact 
on the pound dealers said

usair group inc officials told a federal 
judge wednesday that the association of flight attendants persuaded 
its members to refuse overtime during the memorial day holiday in 
violation of federal labor law 
it was their position that this is what the union wanted them 
to do usairs pittsburgh flight attendant supervisor robert 
fuhr said of his futile attempts to call employees to work over 
the threeday holiday 
airline managers told us district judge robert standish in a 
courtroom overflowing with flight attendants that notices were 
posted in crew lounges encouraging the overtime boycott 
the airline with executives based in washington and operations 
based in pittsburgh is asking standish to award 2 million in 
damages and to bar the union from instigating a repeat of the 
disruption during the independence day holiday period 
usair said it lost at least 1 million in revenue when it was 
forced to cancel 180 flights and paid at least 100000 to 
accommodate displaced holiday passengers 
officials of the flight attendants union deny any wrongdoing 
they have complained about a proposed lower pay scale for flight 
attendants entering usair through its merger with pacific southwest 
airlines 
we didnt promote this action at all we were shocked this 
happened dee maki an afa spokeswoman said during a break in 
the hearing 
the hearing is expected to continue thursday 
the railway labor act makes it illegal for a union to organize 
disruptive job actions during contract negotiations usair 
spokesman david shipley said talks between usair and 
afarepresented flight attendants at psa got underway before 
memorial day he said 
the airline has proposed bringing psa flight attendants into the 
usair system at a 10 percent salary disadvantage that would 
disappear as their pay rises over three years ms maki said 
they deserve the same money she said they work the same 
as anybody else 
usair has a twotier pay system for its flight attendants and 
the proposal for psa workers would create two additional tiers ms 
maki said 
shipley declined comment on the issue 
usair has about 3000 flight attendants whose base salary is 
40000 after 10 years on the job psa has about 1000 flight 
attendants shipley said 
the union spokeswoman also said usair does not have enough 
flight attendants and those it has are frequently called in from 
offhours and holidays they havent had a pay raise since 1985 
however in its complaint usair said more than a third of its 
flight attendants choose to work beyond 85 hours per month the 
maximum they can be required to work by the airline they may 
volunteer to work an additional 10 hours at straight pay but their 
contract a twoyear pact expiring in august 1989 prohibits 
further hours 
without the regular and predictable willingness of flight 
attendants to fly over 85 hours per month usair would have to hire 
an additional 150 flight attendants fuhr said in a deposition 
the federal aviation administration requires a minimum number of 
flight attendants on board each plane depending on the number of 
passengers and other factors

a usbased organization that includes japanese 
television makers has agreed that a coming generation of improved 
televisions should be compatible with the existing broadcast 
system it was announced wednesday 
the agreement reached by a committee of the electronic 
industries association while leaving many questions unanswered 
helps resolve a key point of conflict between japanese tv makers 
and the us broadcasting and equipment industry 
the committee agreed that any system which is finally adopted 
should be compatible with the existing broadcast system and that 
there should be no discernible degradation in the ntsc signal 
finally received by the home viewer 
ntsc stands for the national television system committee and 
refers to the existing broadcasting format which will eventually 
be replaced or relegated to a secondary role 
the committee also agreed that there should be a smooth 
transition to the new standard for highdefinition television to 
protect both the consumers and broadcasters investments 
japanese television makers have created a version of 
highdefinition television that is incompatible with the existing 
us broadcast system since japanese tv makers are represented on 
the committee of the electronic industries association that met 
wednesday in atlanta the agreement seems to indicate their 
willingness to compromise 
sidney topol chairman of atlantabased scientificatlanta inc 
who is chairman of the committee on advanced television was 
scheduled to testify before a congressional committee on the issue 
thursday

two ailing texas thrifts were taken over wednesday 
by an arizona savings bank after federal home loan bank board 
officials guaranteed 839 million in assistance to complete the 
transaction a part of the southwest plan 
merabank federal savings and loan with 64 billion in assets 
took over first financial a savings association based in el 
paso and brownfield federal savings and loan association in 
brownfield merabank based in phoenix ariz is the largest 
thrift institution in that state and the 25thlargest in the united 
states 
first financial has seven branches in el paso three in 
amarillo two in lubbock one in canyon and one in pampa 
brownfield federal has no branches 
the transaction was the third under the terms of the southwest 
plan which aims to consolidate and recapitalize texas savings and 
loan industry 
merabank which already has seven branches in texas is 
contributing 88 million in new capital to the deal to acquire 
first financial with 330 million in assets and brownfield with 
40 million 
merabank also agreed to acquire a third major insolvent texas 
thrift later this year as part of the transaction it is forming a 
separate subsidiary merabank texas to hold the three texas 
institutions 
the subsidiary will be based in el paso with administrative 
headquarters in dallas bank board officials said they expect 
merabank texas to consolidate all its operations in texas within 
six to nine months 
merabank officials still dont know how much in outstanding 
loans they will have to write off said arthur gonzalez president 
of merabanks texas division 
he said officials have not yet inventoried the two thrifts loan 
portfolios and are unsure how many employees they have inherited 
from the ailing thrifts 
this acquisition was a little unusual in what we agreed to 
do with the federal home loan bank board without lots of 
information gonzalez said 
we had to diversify ourselves said gene rice chairman and 
chief executive officer of merabank any time a bank has all its 
eggs in one basket it can get in trouble our longterm objective 
is to have 20 percent of our bank in arizona 20 percent in texas 
and the balance in other places 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp which insures sampl 
deposits up to 100000 will hold warrants for 20 percent of the 
subsidiarys stock officials said 
first financial and brownfield are the ninth and 10th savings 
and loan cases resolved by federal regulators in texas this year 
while 40 nationwide have been resolved 
the states institutions hard hit by slumps in the oil industry 
and texas real estate accounted for 3 billion of the industrys 
38 billion loss in the first three months of this year 
regulators say 133 of texas 279 thrifts are insolvent under 
generally accepted accounting rules the bank board hopes to reduce 
the number of savings and loans in texas by about 150 this year 
bank board chairman m danny wall said merabanks expansion in 
texas will benefit texas the thrift industry and fslic 
rice called the transaction a tremendous timeconsuming 
process 
they fhlb didnt just walk out there with a tray full of 
fruit and let us pick our fruit said ricewe had to work 
together 
the third thrift to be acquired by merabank which is based in 
phoenix ariz would create a deal worth about 1 billion he said 
thrift industry officials said a 12 billion loss at sunbelt 
savings association of dallas boosted losses by texas savings and 
loans to 35 billion during the first three months of 1988 
analysts and industry officials said the losses were not 
unexpected but house banking finance and urban affairs committee 
chairman fernand j st germain dri said tuesday the report 
raises extremely serious questions about the rosy scenarios being 
peddled by the federal home loan bank board 
operating losses for the 477 institutions in the five states 
served by the dallas office of the bank board widened during the 
first quarter of 1988 to 11 billion from 623 million in 1987 
nonoperating losses primarily funds set aside to cover 
nonperforming assets increased to 28 billion from 609 million

volvo north america corp announced 
wednesday it is buying 20 percent of hertz corp the worlds 
largest car rental company for 100 million 
the us branch of the swedish car manufacturer volvo said it is 
buying the stake from ford motor co which had held 80 percent of 
park ridge corp the holding company for hertz the purchase is to 
be completed by july 31 
ford now holds 60 percent of hertz based in park ridge and the 
remaining 20 percent is owned by hertz executives 
a volvo statement said the purchase would allow the company 
based in rockleigh to increase its share in the hertz fleet of 
400000 rental cars a volvo subsidiary already runs the hertz 
business in sweden 
hertz has 30000 employees in 120 countries and last year rented 
20 million cars it has about 33 percent of the us car rental 
market 
tomas ericson a volvo spokesman said hertzs us fleet now 
includes between 2000 and 2500 volvos he said a supply 
agreement would increase the number in the united states and 
europe but declined to disclose the figures 
we felt it was a good investment in a good company ericson 
said 
a spinoff is that more people will experience driving volvo 
cars he said but were not looking to be the major supplier 
ford will keep that 
ford and the hertz employees formed park ridge corp and bought 
the car rental company from allegis corp in december 1987 
allegis the parent of united air lines since has changed its name 
to ual corp 
volvo north america was in the picture at the time of that 
transaction and kept talks alive until it reached an agreement to 
buy part of fords stake ericson said 
when ford bought into hertz it said it ultimately planned to 
reduce its investment and become a minority owner 
ford officials could not be reached for comment wednesday calls 
to the companys detroit office were not returned 
joe russo a spokesman for hertz said ford wanted to bring in 
others that would be acceptable to both ford and hertz 
he said volvo was attractive because it is part of the car 
industry manufactures a highquality product and already has cars 
in the hertz rental fleet 
ford autos make up more than half of the companys us fleet 
and are featured in its advertising russo said the fleet includes 
cars by other makers but for competitive reasons hertz does not 
disclose figures he said

announcement of her decisions to make sure that farmers securities

nearly 200 retired miners fearing the loss of 
their health care benefits next month in the bankruptcy court 
reorganization of ltv corp picketed the offices of the united mine 
workers health and retirement fund here wednesday 
the miners some accompanied by their wives complained that the 
umw fund has not yet promised to pick up their health care coverage 
when a bankruptcy courtordered mandate for ltv to continue it 
expires july 15 
however umw officials said the company and the union reached an 
agreement last week for ltv to continue financing the coverage 
until the issue of who is responsible is resolved in either the 
bankruptcy or other courts 
the agreement still has to be approved by a bankruptcy court in 
new york where ltv is being reorganized while seeking protection 
from its creditors under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 
wearing placards protesting why do we have to beg for our 
health cards some of the miners directed their ire at umw 
president richard trumka while others met with officials at the 
unions headquarters five blocks away 
mr trumka sold us down the river on this complained 
raymond rush a retired miner from carmichels pa we dont know 
whether they are going to pick up our coverage or not 
the demonstration was planned before the union was able to 
notify the affected umwcovered ltv retirees and their spouses 
according to john duray a union spokesman 
in a letter dated tuesday trumka told the retirees i have 
every reason to believe your medical benefits will continue 
uninterrupted and indefinitely 
affected are 1485 retired umw members and their spouses who 
formerly worked at 11 mines in pennsylvania kentucky and west 
virginia that were owned at one time by the giant steel aerospace 
and energy company 
ltv has left the coal business entirely since filing its 
bankruptcy court petition in july 1986 but it has agreed to 
continue the benefits forever to about 600 of the miners and their 
spouses who worked at five mines sold to other companies 
ltv however maintains that the umw health and retirement fund 
has the obligation under the unions contract with the coal 
industry to pick up the health care costs for retirees at five 
mines that the company has retained ownership of but closed in the 
past two years 
while several legal issues are involved the bottom line is 
simple trumka said 
unlike other companies which have refused to pay those 
benefits while the issue is being decided in court ltv will ask 
the bankruptcy court to allow the company to continue those 
benefits until the issue of responsibility is ultimately resolved 
courts in the past have shifted the obligation for continuing 
lifetime health coverage provided under umw contracts to a benefit 
trust established by the union in 1974 as a safety net to 
handle cases where companies go out of business the industry now 
pays 8 cents for every hour worked by a miner into that fund drury 
said 
robert waime of nemacolin pa one of the picketing retirees 
said their fear was that they may be without any health coverage 
for weeks between the time ltv stopped the benefits and the umw 
fund picks them up

the interstate commerce commission moved 
wednesday to assure that shippers on the delaware amp hudson railroad 
will continue to have rail service after the ailing railroad shuts 
down 
the delaware and hudson filed for protection from creditors 
under the federal bankruptcy laws earlier this week and had given 
notice that it would stop service within days 
icc chairman heather gradison said the railroad planned to stop 
service at 1159 pm wednesday 
as a result she said the commission directed in an emergency 
order that the new york susquehanna amp western railway another 
regional rail line in the northeast assume the service of the damph 
the damph a subsidiary of guilford railroad co provides service 
over nearly 1700 miles of track in vermont new york 
pennsylvania new jersey maryland and virginia 
in cooperstown ny david soule executive vice president of 
delaware amp otsego corp parent of the new york susquehanna amp 
western said the railroad would take over the damph operations 
whenever it officially stops operations 
at that time we are all set to begin operating on damph 
tracks he said 
the new york state department of transportation had asked the 
icc to take the emergency action saying the shutdown of the damph 
will create a transportation crisis in the northeast 
the new york department said in a petition to the icc that 
continued operation of services over the damph rail network was 
essential for the economic wellbeing of new york state and the 
surrounding region 
the icc ordered the new york susquehanna and western to provide 
the service without compensation for 45 days during which the 
commission would determine what essential services should be 
further continued on an emergency basis 
both railroads had offered to provide the service without 
compensation as had conrail but the icc said it selected the new 
york susquehanna and western over conrail because the selection 
would raise fewer potential competitive issues during the interim 
period 
the damph said last friday that it planned to file for protection 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act and did so on 
monday the railroad cited the collapse of efforts to win labor 
concessions as a key reason for the filing saying that under 
current labor contracts it could not run the railroad profitably 
guilford officials claimed that the damph lost 81 million last 
year and at least 8 million so far this year guilford based in 
north billerica mass bought the railroad in 1984 
the damph listed assets of 759 million and liabilities of 1084 
million 
dennis watson an icc spokesman said the commission is inviting 
offers from other railway lines to take over the damph lines after 
the term of the temporary operation has expired 
the icc will be conducting an analysis of the damph lines for 
essential service and at least the temporary continuation of 
service to critical shipping points that do not receive other 
railroad service he said

batus inc sued the california insurance 
department wednesday seeking to reverse the departments ruling 
that batus cannot take over farmers insurance group inc 
the suit filed in los angeles superior court alleges that 
state insurance commissioner roxani gillespie misinterpreted the 
law in denying batus permission to operate a california insurance 
company 
ms gillespie found the louisville ky company unfit because a 
significant amount of the stock of its parent bat industries plc 
of britain is held by government entities 
the suit also alleged that if ms gillespies interpretation of 
the law were correct the law would be unconstitutional 
california is one of nine states where batus hostile 45 
billion takeover effort must be approved by insurance regulators 
arizona the only other state to rule has approved the takeover 
a spokeswoman said ms gillespie was unavailable to comment on 
the suit 
on friday after she issued her ruling ms gillespie said the 
ruling on government ownership was in keeping with previous 
commission decisions 
farmers management is resisting a merger with batus which is 
offering stockholders 63 a share for farmers stock 
about 13 percent of bat stock is owned by more than 100 
government and governmentrelated entities including city councils 
and government pension funds in britain batus said 
batus noted the commissioners report didnt find any indication 
the government shareholders ever had attempted to influence 
business decisions of bat or batus 
the commissioner found batus met other criteria for ownership of 
a california insurer the commissioner ruled a takeover would not 
substantially lessen competition in the industry and that batus did 
notintend to sell farmers assets or make substantial management 
changes 
the commissioner discounted arguments that batus a tobacco 
company might discontinue nonsmoker discounts at farmers and that 
cigarette product liability suits might drain its resources 
batus owns paper tobacco and retailing operations saks fifth 
avenue stores and the maker of kool cigarettes 
farmers is the nations thirdlargest home and auto insurer and 
seventhlargest property and casualty insurer

publisher rupert murdoch modified his proposal 
to put his boston television station in an independent trust after 
concerns were raised by a public interest law firm 
murdochs news america publishing inc last week proposed the 
trust agreement to comply with federal communications commission 
rules barring single ownership of a tv station and a daily 
newspaper in the same city 
under those rules murdoch faces a june 30 deadline to dispose 
of wfxttv a boston uhf station or the boston herald newspaper 
under terms of the trust agreement murdoch would relinquish 
control of the station to former sen edward brooke of 
massachusetts and former new york gov hugh carey the station 
could be sold for more than 35 million if murdoch agrees to the 
financial terms 
murdochs lawyers amended the proposal this week to add that the 
trust managers shall use their best efforts to sell the station 
for a price murdoch considers reasonable additionaly it adds the 
purpose of the trust is not only to comply with the crossownership 
rules but also to permit continued operation of the station while 
the trust managers find a buyer 
andrew schwartzman executive director of the media access 
project a washington dcbased public interest law firm had 
raised concerns that the initial proposal lacked emphasis on the 
trust managers efforts to sell the station 
schwarztman in a filing with the fcc wednesday on behalf of the 
committee for media diversity a coalition formed to support 
retention of the crossownership rules said the group is satisfied 
that murdochs amended proposal meets the terms of the fccs policy 
on trusts but the group still questions the wisdom and 
legality of the policy he said

brazil on wednesday reached agreement on 
a 58 billion refinancing of its foreign private debt the largest 
in the third world but said the pact did not formally end its 
moratorium on interest payments 
the accord with the nations private bankers the first major 
agreement since the moratorium was invoked in february 1987 
includes 52 billion in new loans 
after eight months of long and difficult negotiations brazil 
concluded one of the best refinancing accords ever reached by a 
debtor nation finance minister mailson da nobrega said at a news 
conference 
he said the accord which was simultaneously announced in new 
york did not formally revoke brazils foreign debt payment 
moratorium 
da nobrega said it is possible the moratorium would end 
formally once brazils 700 creditor banks agreed to wednesdays 
refinancing plan which was closed in new york with the committee 
of 14 banks representing all the countrys private creditors 
the accord is not a solution to the countrys foreign debt 
problems da nobrega said but it removes the biggest obstacle 
in our relations with the international financial community and 
eliminates uncertainties over the national economy 
the agreement covers interest due in 1987 1988 and the first 
half of 1989 it gives brazil 52 billion in new money to be paid 
back over a 20 years with an eightyear grace period 
that money will go toward paying the interest on the longterm 
debt with private banks which is 636 billion 
brazil owes a total of 121 billion to private bankers and 
government institutions 
the accord also gives brazil an additional 600 million in 
shortterm credit lines towards the financing of exports and 
imports 
da nobrega said the accord eliminates links with the 
international monetary fund a politically sensitive issue 
however a 600 million payment is dependent on brazil meeting imf 
economic guidelines currently being worked out with the fund in a 
separate agreement 
brazil is the first country to sign a mediumterm accord 
without having to have any rigid links with the fund said the 
finance minister 
he said brazil would make a 345 million payment on its march 
private debt interest on friday through the end of june brazil 
will then pay 1 billion in interest due in april and may 
the agreements interest rate spread the extra interest 
charged to highrisk clients above international interest rates 
of 08125 percent is one of the lowest worldwide da nobrega said 
in addition da nobrega said banks holding brazilian debt would 
be able to swap it for investments in local enterprises this 
applies mainly to smaller banks and will go into effect one year 
after the 700 creditor banks approve the accord 
banks have three years to make the transfer of debt for 
investments at a maximum rate of 50 million monthly and with a 
limit of 18 billion 
da nobrega said the accord allows brazil to pull out of the 
agreement if there are any external economic shocks that impair 
brazils ability to meet interest payments he said this could 
apply to even a drop in brazils trade surplus which has been 
averaging more than 1 billion monthly

four states that accused the oil industry of 
conspiring to create the gasoline shortage of the mid1970s may 
have to pay eight oil companies 13 million in court costs 
stemming from an adverse court ruling attorneys said wednesday 
the states and the companies agreed to the 13 million amount 
in a settlement approved here by us district judge william p 
gray who dismissed the states pricefixing suit in november 1986 
at the time gray awarded the companies court costs but there was 
protracted wrangling over the amount 
however the states of california arizona oregon and 
washington have appealed the dismissal of the suit to the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals 
grays order approving the payment of court costs doesnt take 
effect unless the companies prevail on appeal said mary elizabeth 
alden the assistant california attorney general handling the case 
the 13 million award announced wednesday by defendant mobil 
corp of new york would be split among mobil atlantic richfield 
co of los angeles chevron corp of san francisco gulf oil corp 
now a part of chevron exxon corp of new york shell oil co of 
houston texaco inc of white plains ny and unocal corp of los 
angeles 
the settlement didnt specify how much each state would pay ms 
alden said 
the states in suits filed separately between 1973 and 1977 
accused all 16 major us oil companies of conspiring to fix prices 
by creating the oil crisis of the mid1970s the states sought 
unspecified damages that attorneys believed would have totaled 
billions of dollars 
the suits were consolidated before gray who ruled in dismissing 
the suit that the states hadnt presented any evidence of a 
conspiracy 
the state of florida originally was a party to the case but 
withdrew eight of the oil companies settled out of court 
the appeal is scheduled for a july 15 hearing in pasadena

public service company of new hampshire 
on wednesday received a sevenmonth extension during which it will 
have the exclusive right to offer a bankruptcy reorganization plan 
financial problems stemming from its investment in the stalled 
seabrook nuclear power plant prompted company to seek federal 
bankruptcy reorganization protection earlier this year 
the companys period of exclusivity was extended until dec 27 
a month less than the utility sought the original 120day period 
of exclusivity expired may 27 
us bankruptcy court judge james yacos also ruled that the 
state will have full intervenor standing in the case he allowed 
limited standing to the states consumer advocate and the business 
and industry association on certain issues 
the intended result of this ruling is to grant the state 
an unquestioned place at the bargaining table yacos said 
standing was denied to the state of connecticut seacoast 
antipollution league campaign for ratepayers rights and citizens 
within a 10mile radius an antiseabrook group 
nicholas ashooh a company spokesman said the utility was 
satisfied with the extension 
we have a lot of work to do between now and then well do our 
very best to meet the new deadline he said 
yacos said the company has until feb 28 to get its 
reorganization plan accepted by other parties and creditors 
the complexities of the finances regulatory questions and the 
uncertain fate of the 54 billion seabrook plant completed but 
held up in regulatory challenges made the extra time essential 
yacos said 
he said the case apparently the fourthlargest in terms of 
assets and liabilities which exceed 2 billion was unprecedented 
the utility employs 2700 people and has annual revenue of more 
than 50 million the utility serves nearly 75 percent of new 
hampshires population of more than 1 million
