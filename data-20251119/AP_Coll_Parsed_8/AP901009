an experiment to determine whether 
dolphins can be safely returned to the open sea after years in 
captivity has suffered a setback echo and misha cannot be found 
rough waters and trouble with a coinsized radio transmitter 
have kept researchers from spotting the two male bottlenose 
dolphins who were returned to tampa bay on saturday after two 
years in a california research project 
researchers expected to spot the mammals again when the seas 
become calmer said jay gorzelany a biologist at mote marine 
laboratory in sarasota 
scientists hope the project will prove that captive animals can 
be successfully released thus reducing the perceived need to keep 
dolphins in captivity permanently 
a team of researchers who will monitor the dolphins for a year 
to see how they adjust to being wild again tracked echo and misha 
until dusk saturday the pair stayed close to the coast and were 
once seen racing near shore with a group of wild dolphins 
they were last seen near the site where they were released 
gorzelany said 
echo and misha spent three weeks at the marine lab resting and 
learning how to catch fish again before being set free in the bay 
researchers have been unable to locate the dolphins since then 
because waves whipped up by stiff winds made it impossible to 
distinguish the dolphins dorsal fines from whitecaps on the water 
gorzelany said 
the team had hoped a radio transmitter placed on echo would lead 
them to the dolphins but the device either stopped working or fell 
off gorzelany said however the device was designed to fall off 
after just two weeks 
the research team will concentrate on tracking the dolphins 
visually and expect the pair to remain in the bay 
the team seems pretty unconcerned gorzelany said they 
believe theyre out there staying together and doing fine

a federal appeals court has ordered abc news to 
give a military contractor copies of missing documents the 
contractor says were stolen 
the network used the documents two years ago in a news report 
that suggested fmc corp had overcharged the defense department for 
parts for the bradley fighting vehicle 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals last week upheld a lower 
court ruling that capital citiesabc inc should hand over the 
documents or copies of them because they are fmcs property fmc 
said it doesnt have copies of the missing documents and needs them 
for a defense department audit 
they have something that is ours we asked for it they didnt 
give it back its that simple fmc attorney joe cari of 
coffield ungaretti harris amp slavin in chicago said tuesday 
samuel fifer an attorney for the new yorkbased multimedia 
company said abc may ask the court for a rehearing 
abc disagrees with the ruling because the court considered 
intangible information as property fifer said the broadcast 
company said it has only copies of the documents not the 
originals and thus possesses only information not property 
however the appeals court noted that the since the company no 
longer has the information on the documents the copies are 
functional equivalents of the originals 
in the same decision thursday the federal panel reversed a us 
district courts decision to award the chicagobased fmc damages 
the company had sought unspecified damages contending it had 
suffered financially because of abcs exposure of its military and 
pricing records fmc also has private contracts for food machinery 
and chemicals 
abc refused to supply the company duplicates of the documents 
after they were displayed in a report on world news tonight on 
oct 20 1988 
the story indicated the defense contractor had overcharged the 
government for parts fmc disputed the report 
the documents apparently outline the companys pricing policy 
but fmc is uncertain of their content cari said 
the company realized the papers were missing after seeing the 
news report and searching through its records he said fmc never 
accused abc of stealing the documents 
abc refused to hand over the four pages of documents saying it 
would infringe upon its first amendment rights which ensure 
freedom of the press 
because abc has refused to return copies of the documents that 
fmc has a right to use abcs retention of the documents amounts to 
the exercise of unlawful dominion over them the court said 
fmc maintains it needs the documents because the army contract 
requires the company to keep complete records the company 
typically does not make copies of such documents because contracts 
tend to be hundreds of thousands of pages long cari said

showbizs favorite designer gianni versace 
stole the show with a collection sure to put milan back in the 
fashion limelight 
his styles for the springsummer 1991 are lively sexy and 
avant garde with an endless series of stretch pants and catsuits 
mini shift dresses micro skirts and fiery hot pants 
versace also uses the most colorful palette ever to be seen on 
the milan runway traditionally devoted to drab brown gray and 
black 
circus reds and blues neon greens and yellows disco purples 
and pinks combine to create workofart prints which are sure to be 
the talk of the town in beverly hills where versace is a household 
name 
in fact his clients include such movie and rock star notables as 
jane fonda sylvester stallone and elton john even born in the 
usa bruce springsteen wears versace 
frontrow guests at his springsummer show sunday night included 
top model turned film star carol alt and brazilian formula one 
racing driver aryton senna 
beyond the entertainment bent of his look versace has become 
the trendsetter in milan reaching beyond the classic 
mantailored styles which had put the italian label at the top of 
readytowear but which in recent seasons was taking a back seat 
to the more creative farout french design 
a year ago he shocked the fashion world by hiking the hemline 
so high that panties became a hot fashion item versace knew that 
very few would dare to wear the micro mini but the scandalous 
skirt served to secure a place for short hemlines in the next 
decade 
sexy hiphugging trousers plunging necklines and flesh 
revealing slits were all part of versaces call to women to come 
out of the mantailored closet and flaunt their femininity 
color was another versace innovation unlike most of his 
colleagues who are native northern italians versace grew up in sun 
basked calabria where bright mediterranean shades are the daily 
fare 
while everyone else was dressing women in gloomy city hues 
versace was lighting up the runway with bright reds blues and 
greens sparkling sequins were another of the vivacious designers 
showstoppers 
on the second day of the fiveday springsummer 1991 collections 
it was clear that the versace message has caught on 
styles are short sexy and colorful with bodyclinging stretch 
outfits the favorite style cheerful floral and block prints 
abound and the runway sparkles in a myriad of multicolored 
sequins 
krizia who showed monday morning abandoned her usual accordian 
pleats to burst out in a series of short evening dresses in large 
kaleidoscope sequined prints with matching jewelry and onecolor 
stretch catsuits worn under a loose floral printed silk blouse 
missoni who also showed monday morning transposed the shades 
of his famous knit prints onto a series of glittering unitards and 
floor length evening gowns 
but the real works of art were a versace exclusive his prints 
all designed by the maestro turned the runway into an art gallery 
in motion with geometric designs combining with floral patterns 
and popart decorations such as pictures of hollywood myths james 
dean and marilyn monroe and covers of vogue magazine 
some of the prints were painted onto the fabric usually 
stretch others were stiched in thousands of baubles and spangles 
everything in the collection from shoes and stockings to 
necklaces bracelets and earrings reproduced the printed motif 
the designer who received a standing ovation after the close of 
an hourlong show announced that proceeds from the worldwide sale 
of an elegant silk shirt printed with past and present vogue covers 
will go towards aids research promoted by the cfda the council 
of fashion designers of america

as filipinos are being asked to 
tighten their belts president corazon aquino is preparing to move 
into a multimillion dollar office 
critics are calling this shameless extravagance 
public outrage over mrs aquinos new office a fourstory 
former brewery near her current office emerged after hearings of 
the senate finance committee disclosed last month that the 
administration was spending more than 32 million to refurbish the 
building while the president was urging austerity in government 
nearly half the cost went for furnishings and another 25 percent 
for security equipment according to project manager ernesto de 
castro 
the timing of the construction of such a building is very bad 
especially with a public perception that the executive branch is 
extravagant said opposition rep salvador escudero 
the project also has caught on as a public issue because it 
contrasts so sharply with mrs aquinos early efforts to distance 
herself from the style and excesses of her ousted predecessor 
ferdinand marcos 
since assuming the presidency in february 1986 she had kept her 
office at the presidential guest house to show she was but a 
transient in the nations highest office 
she transformed marcos phrey running and will move 
within 60 minutes

the northern half of the planet seems to be 
losing its snowy blanket but researchers are reluctant to say why 
or predict whether the meltdown will continue 
the area covered by snow was less in 1988 and 1989 than at any 
time in the nearly 20 years that records have been kept 
researchers report 
low snow cover has continued this year david a robinson of 
rutgers university said monday 
robinson and kenneth f dewey of the university of nebraska 
analyzed snow cover records in a report in the journal geophysical 
research letters published by the american geophysical union 
northern hemisphere snow cover during 1988 and 1989 was at its 
lowest extent since the advent of reliable satellite snow cover 
monitoring in 1972 running some 8 percent to 10 percent below 
average they said 
but robinson was not ready to blame the widely reported threat 
of global warming for the disappearance of the snow 
that doesnt mean were in a greenhouse warming he said 
it could totally turn around in the next decade or it could be 
an early sign of global warming but its too early to tell with 
just a 20year record 
it could be that global warming causes the snow to melt but it 
also could be that melting snow exposes more ground which absorbs 
more heat from the sun and that causes more warming 
were starting to look at it on a regional basis to get a 
handle on it but its premature to ascribe it to a chicken or egg 
in the long run ill bet it turns out to be a little of both 
robinson said 
the theory of greenhouse warming predicts that precipitation 
will increase in polar regions if this occurs the snowpack could 
increase again resulting in a cooling in those areas 
the greenhouse theory contends that carbon dioxide and other 
chemicals released into the atmosphere by human activities could 
trap heat from the sun and warm the earth in somewhat the way a 
greenhouse traps heat 
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased 
significantly over the last century however scientists disagree 
over whether any warming has actually occurred during that period 
snow cover information is collected by satellites operated by 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
noaa researcher chet ropelewski has reported that snow cover in 
the northern hemisphere in june and july was the lowest on record 
at about 57 percent of normal in north america and 40 percent over 
eurasia 
in june for example about 135 million square miles of north 
america had a covering of snow in a normal june 247 million 
square miles would be snowcovered 
while monthtomonth variation is understandable the periods 
with highest snow cover tended to occur in the 1970s with a marked 
decline in the 1980s 
maximum northern hemisphere snow cover during the period of 
record was in february 1978 at 204 million square miles the 
minimum was in august 1989 at 1 million square miles

the hospital director in east jerusalem tried 
to calm thousands of anxious palestinians some weeping and others 
vowing revenge as he pushed his way to the emergency ward 
its manslaughter he told reporters 
some of the palestinians at mukassed hospital on monday were 
mourning relatives killed when police fired on arab rioters in 
jerusalems old city others shook with fear over the fate of 
missing children or husbands 
youths some wearing masks waved outlawed palestinian flags and 
shouted for retaliation 
a chant went up from a group of grieving women bring bush 
bring bush they wanted president bush leader of israels 
staunchest ally to see for himself the aftermath of mondays 
bloody confrontation 
arab ambulances arrived from all over the occupied west bank 
sirens screaming they ferried victims from temple mount in the old 
city to mukassed and nearby augusta victoria the main hospitals in 
arab east jerusalem 
israeli police opened fire with tear gas and bullets on the 
temple mount site of one of islams most sacred shrines after 
moslems pelted jewish worshipers with rocks at the adjacent wailing 
wall judaisms holiest site 
scattered shooting incidents followed in the old city 
hospital officials said at least 19 palestinians were killed and 
140 wounded many with live ammunition 
adnan hamad the administrative director of mukassed called it 
manslaughter when he spoke to reporters he tried his best to 
comfort 3000 to 4000 anxious people 
police commissioner yaacov terner said the incident started 
with a major riot which was dangerous 
still he said he felt compassion for the families at mukassed 
families of the dead and wounded i can understand their 
pain terner told israel radio 
mukassad had been thrust right into the violence at one point 
paramilitary border police fired tear gas inside the hospital 
apparently to stop palestinians outside from pushing their way in 
babies coughing from tear gas were passed through hospital 
windows to people outside to get them away from the fumes 
hospital officials called a fire truck to bring fans and other 
equipment to clear the gas from areas housing patients 
mukassed was so overwhelmed with casualties that 11 elderly 
women overcome by tear gas were treated with oxygen in the 
hospitals mosque and library 
in the hospital morgue seven dead palestinians lay on slabs 
all appeared to be in their 20s one had half his head shot away 
blood spattered walls and floors it soaked the bedding on 
stretchers 
police blocked most private cars from reaching the hospital but 
let un buses pass they carried palestinians who had volunteered 
to donate blood 
among the officials who rushed to the hospital was hashem 
mahamid an arab member of the israeli parliament 
he later told israel radio that the tear gas firing was a very 
brutal act 
at augusta victoria hospital khaled shalatef of the west bank 
town of ramallah was treated for head and eye wounds from rubber 
bullets 
we are moslems and we came to defend our mosque said the 
26yearold the palestinians had begun stoning the jews at the 
wailing wall after rumors spread that jewish extremists planned to 
march on the temple mount 
i did not expect jews to perform such terrible massacres 
against unarmed people shalatef said

a modest increase in livestock output is under 
way and agriculture department economists say it could take some 
of the upward pressure from retail meat prices in 1991 
early projections by the departments economic research service 
point to 1991 gains in beef production up 1 percent from this 
year pork 3 percent and broilers and turkeys about 5 percent 
a major reason for the steppedup livestock production is the 
bumper harvest of corn and other crops this fall which has helped 
reduce feed costs improved grazing has helped too 
for example range and wheat pasture conditions a year ago 
deteriorated in many areas pushing larger number of lighterweight 
cattle into feedlots 
this pattern is not likely to be repeated this fall unless 
forage conditions deteriorate the report said recent rains 
have further improved prospects for fall grazing 
prices of stocker and feeder cattle are expected to remain 
well above a year ago this fall it said and with strong demand 
for lighterweight animals to put on pastures fewer will be moving 
into feedlots 
market prices of choicegrade steers averaged about 77 per 100 
pounds in the first two weeks of september but have been declining 
seasonally the report said one factor has been the record weights 
of cattle going to slaughter 
some of that extra weight translated into more beef has been 
due to producers holding back cattle because of the uncertainty 
over the federal budget and the possibility of a furlough of meat 
inspectors plants would have had to cease operations on days 
inspectors didnt work 
however as feedlot marketings become more current meaning 
lighter cattle weights and beef supplies tighten in the late fall 
and early winter fed steer prices are expected to strengthen into 
the upper 70s per hundredweight the report said 
but seasonally larger pork supplies and record poultry 
production probably will compete aggressively with beef at 
retail counters it said that will dampen further price increases 
in the coming months 
beef output in 1991 is forecast to rise about 1 percent from 
this year with all of the increase coming from fed cattle 
hog producers are expected to cautiously expand breeding herds 
this year and in early 1991 despite generally favorable net 
returns through midsummer the report said a sharp drop in hog 
prices late this summer clouded the longterm profit outlook 
even so based on surveys of producer intentions and historical 
trends it appears hog production in the first half of 1991 may 
rise about 2 percent from a year earlier production in the second 
half could be up 4 percent from the yearearlier mark 
hog prices at the major markets may average in the high 40s 
to low 50s per hundredweight in 1991 the report said that 
would compare with the mid50s expected as this years average 
overall commercial pork production next year is projected to 
increase about 3 percent from this year and that means retail 
prices are expected to decline slightly from this years 
record the report said 
looking at broilers the report said production will continue 
growing in 1991 but at a slightly slower pace perhaps 5 percent to 
6 percent above this years level 
wholesale broiler prices for all of 1990 probably will average 
54 to 56 cents per pound and the continued increase in production 
is expected to cause prices to slip slightly in 1991 
retail prices for whole fryers in the second half of 1990 are 
expected to average 85 to 90 cents per pound down 5 percent to 6 
percent from last year 
turkey production is expected to gain only 5 percent in 1991 
about half this years sharp increase the report said the 
prospective slowdown was attributed to this years low producer 
returns 
red meat prices particularly for pork will as usual play a 
key role in fourthquarter turkey prices the report said 
for all of 1990 consumer turkey prices are expected to average 
99 cents to 102 per pound about the same as last year little 
change is expected in 1991 at the retail level

a closeddoor senate ethics committee meeting 
last week revealed no new information to challenge a recommendation 
that sen john mccain be dropped from a savings and loan 
investigation a congressional source says 
mccain of arizona is the only republican among five senators 
under investigation for their ties to a major political donor 
former thrift owner charles h keating jr 
mccain is pressing hard for a committee decision before 
congress adjourns later this month to adopt a special counsels 
recommendation to end the case against him 
sen john glenn dohio who also met privately with the 
committee last week is pushing just as hard for dismissal of his 
case special counsel robert s bennett also recommended dismissal 
of the case against glenn 
bennett proposed that the investigation be expanded against 
democratic sens alan cranston of california dennis deconcini of 
arizona and donald w riegle jr of michigan 
the congressional source speaking on condition of anonymity 
told the associated press that the committees questioning of 
mccain covered the same facts that led to the dismissal 
recommendation 
the source said if any new allegations against mccain had 
surfaced they likely would have been raised at last weeks closed 
testimony when committee chairman howell heflin dala did most 
of the questioning 
mccain and the four other senators intervened with us banking 
regulators as keatings lincoln savings and loan was heading toward 
failure the federal government seized the irvine califbased 
institution in april 1989 and it could cost taxpayers 2 billion 
to cover its losses 
the source familiar with mccains appearance said the questions 
dealt with two crucial meetings mccain and his colleagues held with 
banking regulators on keatings behalf and trips the senator took 
on keatings airplanes also discussed were an investment by 
mccains wife in a keating shopping center and even mccains 
philosophy on what constitutes proper behavior for a senator 
mccain has given public explanations of these same matters 
mccain received 112000 from keating and associates for his 
campaigns some of it donated before keating bought the irvine 
califbased lincoln 
the congressional source said mccain was pressed on why he 
joined cranston deconcini and glenn in meeting with top sampl 
regulator edwin j gray on keatings behalf april 2 1987 mccain 
had told the panel that only a week earlier he threw keating out 
of his office and ended their personal friendship after 
refusing to negotiate with regulators for lincolns owner 
mccain told regulators the source said that he had an 
obligation to make sure a major arizona employer was treated fairly 
after keating complained the regulators were dragging out their 
examination of lincoln lincolns parent company american 
continental corp was based in phoenix 
when asked what constituted proper behavior for a senator in a 
case like this one mccain said it was his role to see that a 
constituent is treated fairly by regulators but he said 
negotiating for the constituent would be improper the source 
commented 
mccain according to the source cited to the committee his 
comments on this theme in an april 9 1987 meeting that all five 
senators had with the regulators who were examining lincoln 
in a transcript made by one of the regulators mccain said i 
wouldnt want any special favors for lincoln and i dont want 
any part of our conversation to be improper 
mccain was asked the source said about vacation flights he and 
his family took to the bahamas from 1984 through 1986 in keatings 
corporate and chartered airplanes 
mccain paid 13433 to keatings company in 1989 for the trips 
which were taken when the senator was a member of the house and 
were not mentioned on his financial disclosure forms 
mccain cited to the committee its own letter saying the trips 
were a matter for the house and a house ethics panel letter saying 
the payments ended the matter 
mccain said the investment by his wife and fatherinlaw in a 
keating shopping center partnership was proper because he was not 
involved and did not benefit from the deal

gov bob martinez is proposing limiting 
lawmakers to 12 years in office and sharply curbing gifts to public 
officials 
in a series of campaign stops the republican governor said 
monday that if reelected he would push for the limit in a 
constitutional amendment that would be placed on the 1992 ballot 
for voters to decide 
the proposal also would limit cabinet members to a pair of 
fouryear terms the same restriction now placed on the governor 
voters in oklahoma approved such a limit earlier this year and 
similar measures will appear on ballots in california colorado and 
missouri next month the measures are seen as examples of voters 
growing dissatisfaction with incumbents 
the governors proposed legislation to curtail the gifts and 
travel lavished on public officials comes amid an investigation by 
state attorney willie meggs of tallahassee into whether lawmakers 
properly disclosed what theyve received from lobbyists over the 
past five years records of both lobbyists and legislators have 
been subpoenaed martinez is running against former us sen

the killings of at least 19 palestinians 
by israeli police set off a barrage of arab warnings and threats 
iraqs ruling arab baath socialist party said today that the 
crime would lead arabs to the liberation of jerusalem and all 
other moslem holy places a reference to saudi arabia where 
usled military forces massed after iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
president hosni mubarak of egypt criticized by iraq and its 
friends for joining the usled force warned that mondays 
bloodbath at the temple mount in jerusalem could lead to grave 
consequences in the middle east 
in new york the un security council delayed action monday 
night on an arabbacked resolution to condemn the killings as a 
criminal act the united states was resisting the proposal and 
israel rejected outright its provision for a threemember un 
mission to investigate the killings 
israeli police opened fire on stonethrowing palestinians on the 
temple mount a site holy to both moslems and jews in the 
bloodiest incident in jerusalem since israel seized its arab sector 
from jordan in 1967 
israeli police minister roni milo said 19 people died and 140 
were wounded police moved in after arabs began stoning jewish 
worshipers at judaisms holiest site the wailing wall which is 
located on one side of the temple mount twentytwo people most of 
them worshipers at the wall also suffered minor injuries 
the clash was touched off by rumors that jewish fundamentalists 
were planning to defile the alaqsa mosque on temple mount islams 
third holiest site 
in the shantytown palestinian camps around the jordanian capital 
of amman hundreds of young men waved palestinian flags and black 
banners shortly after the bloodshed 
mohammed milhem a member of the plos ruling 15man executive 
committee warned that palestinians might start using weapons in 
the 34monthold uprising in the occupied lands 
the massacre heralds a new stage for the intefadeh he said 
an editorial published today in althawra the official 
publication of iraqs baath party said mondays deaths will not 
go without retaliation and the arab nation is certainly capable to 
retaliate and it will 
it will turn into a massive wave of indignation which will 
take the panarab struggle into a step toward the liberation of 
jerusalem and all other holy places and claim the arab homeland 
from treachery and occupation the editorial said 
iraqi leaders and many moslems have denounced the foreign 
presence on saudi soil which they claim is a desecration of 
islams two holiest shrines at mecca and medina 
althawras editorial also criticized saudi arabias king fahd 
and mubarak saying arab indignation over the palestinian deaths 
will sweep them away even if they issue verbal condemnations of 
the crime 
a statement issued by mubaraks office monday night said 
israels savage repressive measures exceeded all limits and 
added that the jewish state is fully responsible for protecting 
islamic shrines in jerusalem 
in jordan where palestinians comprise more than half the 
population of 35 million the foreign ministry called on the 
international community to intervene quickly to halt these 
inhumane practices and protect the palestinian population

the son of former gov scott m matheson 
believes the openair atomic testing whose dangers his father 
fought to expose caused the cancer that killed him 
matheson died sunday at age 61 of multiple myeloma he lived in 
cedar city in the early 1950s when the government conducted dozens 
of aboveground tests 300 miles away in nevada that caused 
radioactive fallout to drift into utah 
as governor from 1977 to 1985 matheson fought to expose the 
dangers of those tests and gain compensation for radiation victims 
an effort that succeeded with the passage by congress last week 
of a compensation bill 
scott m matheson jr said monday his father found it an 
interesting wrinkle that he was diagnosed with a disease that 
congress recognized as having possible links to atomic fallout 
when the doctors diagnosed him they asked whether hed spent 
any time in southern utah the reason was in connection with the 
testing matheson said 
multiple myeloma is a cancer of the bloodproducing bone marrow 
and has been recognized as a malignancy that can be caused by 
radiation 
while its speculation to say anything conclusive about the 
cause it is noteworthy and it adds some cruel irony to the 
sequence of events as they unfolded for him he said 
from 1952 to 1954 matheson was a deputy iron county attorney in 
cedar city from 1951 to 1958 the us atomic energy commission 
set off more than 100 atomic bombs at the nevada test site 
those were some of the heaviest years of open air testing i 
believe matheson said and we were there 
numerous relatives and family friends from that part of the 
state have also died of cancer he said 
the 1963 nuclear testban treaty outlawed atomic tests in the 
atmosphere and under water permitting only underground explosions 
democratic rep wayne owens cosponsored the compensation bill 
with utah republican sen orrin hatch 
matheson was a champion of that cause owens said he 
testified in favor of legislation of the kind we ultimately passed 
not knowing that it would have anything to do with him 
the bill provides for payment of up to 50000 to fallout 
victims or their heirs and lists specific disease and residency 
requirements victims also are to receive a formal apology from the 
government 
the justice department has complained that the measure could 
leave the government open to further liability and opposed its 
passage president bush has said he will let the bill become law 
withot his signature 
the bill followed an unsuccessful attempt by socalled 
downwinders to gain compensation through a classaction lawsuit 
in the early 1980s a federal judge found in favor of the victims 
but the ruling was overturned by an appeals court 
matheson said the family has not discussed whether it will apply 
for the compensation

after failing twice at the polls community 
activists will try a different tack next month in their goal to 
secede from boston and create a new city named for black south 
african leader nelson mandela 
nonbinding referendums in support of carving out a city from 
bostons predominantly black innercity neighborhoods failed by 
wide margins in 1986 and 1988 
but during the next election on nov 6 residents of just one 
innercity legislative district will be asked whether they would 
like to see a study on the financial feasibility of creating a new 
city 
if that nonbinding referendum is approved it could be used as 
a lobbying tool to get the legislature to endorse the study said 
sadiki kambon chairman of project fate or focusing attitudes 
toward empowerment 
the next goal would be a binding referendum on the feasibility 
study in 1992 which could lead to another vote on the secession 
question in 1994 kambon said 
approximately 126000 of the citys 563000 residents are black 
and many live in the innercity area which some black leaders say 
has been allowed to decay over the years to revive it they say 
they must create their own city and take charge of their own 
destiny 
because we dont have any control our community is dying 
said andrew jones a founder of the secession movement 
but lee jackson bostons treasurer says a new city would start 
out in worse financial shape than innercity boston which he said 
benefits from the citys healthy downtown tax base 
youd start with a city that would immediately have a huge 
deficit and be hoping the state would bail it out jackson said 
mayor raymond flynn has also opposed proposals to create a 
separate city saying it would segregate the community some black 
leaders have also opposed the effort on the grounds that the city 
could not survive without bostons tax base 
but kambon said the feasibility study would end questions about 
whether such a city could function he added that he hoped the 
study would also show resources were available to support the city

the temple mount is like a vast ammunition 
depot of emotions that can be set off by the smallest provocation 
both moslems and jews claim it as the symbol of their religious 
and national aspirations its graceful domed mosques and 
honeycolored western wall or wailing wall have long been a fault 
line in the arabisraeli conflict especially in the 34month 
palestinian uprising 
the 35acre platform is venerated by the jews as the site of 
their two biblical temples the temples only remainder the 
western wall lining one side of the platform is judaisms holiest 
site 
the moslems who call the compound haram essharif or noble 
enclosure believe it is the place where the prophet mohammed 
ascended to heaven on a white stallion 
the treelined temple mount site of the al aqsa mosque and 
goldroofed dome of the rock is islams third holiest site after 
mecca and medina in saudi arabia 
when israel captured the old city and surrounding arab east 
jerusalem in the 1967 middle east war it allowed moslems to retain 
control of haram essharif 
but moslems are suspicious that israel and the jews want to 
destroy the mosques and build the third jewish temple in their 
place 
fears are fueled by the temple mount faithful and other 
nationalist jewish groups who demand that israel take control over 
the platform to restore jewish greatness 
on monday tension heightened when the temple mount faithful 
announced plans to lay the cornerstone for the third temple before 
being blocked by police 
successive israeli governments have barred jews from praying on 
the temple mount except in small groups for fear of clashes with 
moslems in addition a rabbinical ruling says jews must keep out 
lest they tread holy ground 
but the temple mount faithful once considered a fringe group 
is winning more and more support in the rightwing government of 
prime minister yitzhak shamir 
science minister yuval neeman of the ultrarightist tehihya 
party on monday denounced what he called israels policy of 
weakness and demanded that jews take control of the temple mount 
israelis claim that palestinian militants take cover behind 
their holy places to stage antiisraeli violence palestinians see 
the haram essharif as the symbol and center of their wouldbe 
palestinian state 
during the early months of the palestinian uprising hundreds of 
masked youths staged weekly demonstrations after friday noon 
prayers hurling stones at border police and raising outlawed 
palestinian flags 
on july 3 1988 moslem preachers used mosque loudspeakers to 
call palestinians to the defense of haram essharif saying the 
israelis planned to dig a tunnel to the shrine 
hundreds of palestinians responded hurling stones at police it 
turned out that the tunnel was part of an archaeological dig along 
the western wall

customers at the lakeside coffee house in 
this affluent chicago suburb would rather talk about baseball not 
murder 
three days after a high school senior was arrested in connection 
with the slayings of a couple and their unborn child residents of 
this city of milliondollar homes and sprawling estates were 
philosophical monday 
if someone gets shot it happens its sad but it happens all 
over just because it happened here doesnt make much difference 
said paola nilsson a waitress at the coffee shop where several 
residents gathered monday to watch the national league playoffs 
but the arrest of david biro 17 of winnetka did rekindle some 
fears first ignited when the bloody slayings of richard langert and 
his pregnant wife nancy occurred last april the couple were 
gunned down in the basement of their townhouse 
it also brought to mind a shooting rampage in 1988 that 
shattered this quiet community of 13000 which has seen only four 
murders in its history 
two years ago laurie dann entered a winnetka elementary school 
and shot six children killing one then she fled and barricaded 
herself in a nearby house shooting a college student before 
killing herself 
people keep it in the back of their minds loretta purcell 
said as she watched the baseball game from the coffee shop counter 
you had laurie dann now youve got this she said whats 
going to happen next you look behind you when you walk down a back 
street i tell my nieces when theyre home alone even in the 
daytime dont answer the door 
until biros arrest the case had baffled police in part 
because more than 500 remained untouched in mrs langerts purse 
police had tracked one deadend lead after another one leading as 
far as northern ireland and the irish republican army 
the chicago suntimes reported sunday that biro was arrested 
after he allegedly told another youth details of the crime that had 
not been disclosed publicly police have refused to confirm that 
report but they have said biro and the victims knew each other 
talk among many residents turned to biro on monday some 
described him as a lonely person who ran twice for class president 
of new trier high school just to attract attention 
he was always like look at me said nilsson 16 who 
spent one year at new trier 
id see him walking around town in an overcoat and a fedora 
he was a strange bird said steve szczepaniak 19 who graduated 
from new trier last year

snarl on congress and the president equally 
the abcwashington post poll interviewed 775 people and the 
cbsnew york times poll interviewed 756 both surveys were done by

a government shutdown ended early tuesday 
after a night of budget breakthroughs in congress that also saw the 
senate give final approval to a 500billion deficitreduction 
plan 
the senate passed an emergency bill on a voice vote monday night 
that would let the government open normally tuesday morning and the 
house concurred 3623 at about 130 am edt 
the white house said president bush would sign the legislation 
and that all federal employees should report to work as scheduled 
shortly after midnight the senate voted 6633 for final 
approval to a separate measure a fiveyear 500billion package 
of tax increases and spending cuts the plan envisioned smaller 
cuts in medicare but possibly higher tax increases than an 
earlier version the house rejected last week 
tonight we reap the bitter harvest of a decade of national 
indulgence said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
majorities of both parties voted for the budget plan democrats 
favored it 4213 and republicans voted for it by a 2420 margin 
this outline plan mapped the way for specific spending cuts and 
tax increases which congress planned to put in a separate bill and 
pass by oct 19 the outline does not require the presidents 
signature but the later bill does 
the emergency spending measure would allow the government to 
operate normally through oct 19 congressional leaders hope all 
budget work will be completed by then and that the members can 
adjourn to work on their reelection campaigns 
the president will sign the continuing resolution the 
emergency bill this morning the government can resume operations 
all federal employees should report to work this morning white 
house spokeswoman laura melillo said after the house gave its final 
approval 
the statue of liberty museums and national parks have been 
closed since saturday because the budget crisis had prevented 
congress from approving any spending legislation for the new fiscal 
year but the full brunt of the federal shutdown was masked because 
of the long columbus day weekend 
earlier in the day lawmakers warned of chaos if the white house 
and congress failed to resolve their monthslong impasse over the 
federal deficit 
were not just dealing with programs warned senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine urging his colleagues to pass the 
measure quickly were dealing with individual human beings and 
families and their hopes and fears and dreams 
this has just een playing marshmallow stuff so far said 
sen alan simpson rwyo the senates assistant republican 
leader referring to the limited impact on the government during 
the columbus day holiday weekend 
any thoughtful reasonable person now knows what happens to 
this government tomorrow 
debate on the budget began in the early evening leaders of both 
parties had spent the day trying to line up support for the budget 
and for a separate measure bringing the shutdown government back 
to life tuesday morning 
this is not a shining moment for anyone senate budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn said of the budget mess 
as debate began and frankly our countrymen are rightly tired of 
it 
the house passed the budget outline 250164 in a postmidnight 
session early monday the measure contains far fewer specific 
spending cuts and tax increases than the version that went down to 
defeat last week putting off those decisions for later in the 
month 
the vagueness of the new package left some senators unhappy 
im not going to sign onto this fillintheblanks package 
said sen phil gramm rtexas who supported and helped write the 
first package 
sasser said of the new proposal the best argument is it 
reduces the deficit by historic proportions over the next five 
years and gives congress flexibility on issues and problems that 
have troubled members and constituents over the last few days 
many lawmakers of both parties believe that in the end the new 
plan will also contain a cut in the capital gains tax rate and 
higher income taxes for the wealthy bush has wanted to slash the 
capital gains tax levied on sales of property for years while 
democrats have demanded the higher rates on the wealthy as a 
tradeoff 
the new proposal would eliminate many of the specifics from 
savings proposals that had driven a majority of both democrats and 
republicans to reject an initial package friday in the house 
gone was onethird of the earlier plans 60 billion in medicare 
reductions including higher costs and lower benefits for 
beneficiaries specifics on higher taxes for gasoline homeheating 
oil alcohol tobacco and other items were also deleted 
instead the new version would pare medicare savings to 40 
billion new taxes over the five years could total 10 billion more 
than the 135 billion in the old package but all decisions about 
specific spending cuts and tax boosts were to be left to congress 
committees 
this approach worked in the house which approved the new plan 
despite opposition from most minority republicans 
like the rejected package the new plan claims to save 40 
billion in the fiscal year that started oct 1 and 500 billion 
over the next five years 
house democratic leaders told their rankandfile that under the 
new plan the medicare deductible paid by recipients for doctors 
costs would rise gradually from 75 to 100 instead of the 150 in 
the old package 
the house also approved the temporary spending bill 305105 
early monday 
without senate approval and bushs signature on that measure 
all but crucial government services would shut down tuesday and 
hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be sent home 
over the threeday weekend the effects of the governments 
legal inability to spend money have been spotty 
essential services such as air traffic control and federal 
prisons functioned normally but the statue of liberty and many 
other national parks shut down

people who think children are brainwashed by 
watching too many television commercials hope president bush will 
overcome his reservations and sign into law a bill that would limit 
the number of tv sales pitches to youngsters 
the legislation passed unanimously by both the house and the 
senate also would require tv stations to pay more attention to the 
educational needs of young viewers 
broadcasters say they can live with the measure but white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said last week the administration had 
very strong reservations about the bill which would condition 
a stations license renewal on how well its programs serve the 
needs of children 
the justice department has advised bush that the bill 
unconstitutionally intrudes into program content and thus would be 
an infringement on the first amendment guarantee of free speech 
the president has not said what he will do 
childrens tv advocates fear he will veto it 
the legislation which received final congressional approval 
last week would limit commercials during childrens shows to 12 
minutes per hour weekdays and 105 minutes per hour weekends 
after similar restrictions were lifted from broadcasters in 
1984 commercial air time crept up to as much as 14 minutes per 
hour for some kids shows while the amount of informational and 
educational programs for kids declined sharply according to a 
survey released by the house energy and commerce telecommunications 
and finance subcommittee 
by comparison regular prime time programming averages less than 
eight minutes of commercials an hour 
the bill would establish a 6 million endowment for childrens 
programming and require the federal communications commission to 
begin a review of socalled programlength commercials programs 
that interweave programming and commercial material usually toys 
some observers have noted however that any fcc rules that 
banned such shows as teenage mutant ninja turtles also could 
be used against programs such as sesame street which also has 
a large commercial spinoff of toys and other products 
the measure has the support of a wide array of childrens 
religious and psychiatric groups and with the unanimous support in 
congress a bush veto probably could be overridden 
there has been some speculation that instead of vetoing the 
bill bush will let it become law without his signature

the nations best and brightest teenagers are 
saying no to drugs and yes to the chinese students of 
tiananmen square according to a nationwide survey 
the report on 2000 high school juniors and seniors paints them 
in a much more conservative hue than their predecessors of 20 years 
ago but with a streak of idealism 
from a list that included mick jagger madonna mchael jordan 
tom cruise and jennifer capriati the teenagers chose the chinese 
students who demonstrated for democracy at beijings tiananmen 
square as the years no 1 heroes 
those surveyed were selected from among the 650000 high 
achievers listed in the 1990 edition of whos who among american 
high school students 
weve heard so much about kids not having heroes paul c 
krouse publisher of the high school whos who said monday 
the good news is yes they do have heroes the bad news is 
that there were no americans among the top choices he said 
among other findings of the 21st annual survey of high achieving 
teenagers 253 percent have had sexual intercourse 66 percent of 
sexually active respondents say they always use a contraceptive 6 
percent would approve of a constitutional amendment making abortion 
illegal and half say theyve changed eating habits for a healthier 
lifestyle 
just 23 percent said they use marijuana compared with 10 
percent in 1970 and 98 percent said they have never tried crack 
heroine cocaine or steroids 
they certainly seem to be much more conservative than the 
students of 20 years ago krouse said go to college get a 
good job and make money theres much less concern for social 
service 
their college goals were topped by studies of medicine business 
and engineering sciences far down the list were teaching law 
journalism and government 
in some areas the teenagers favored increased control by the 
adult world 
nearly half 47 percent said all high school students should 
be tested for alcohol use and 64 percent favored drug testing for 
all 
more than half 57 percent favored warning labels on records 
tapes cassettes and videos containing objectionable material 
such as profanity 
in choosing their heroes the teens named mikhail gorbachev a 
distant second to the chinese students followed by mother teresa 
and nelson mandela president bush beat out professional basketball 
player michael jordan for fifth place by a fraction of a percentage 
point 
black teens selected mandela as their no 1 hero followed by 
jesse jackson 
fortyfour percent of the sexually active students had their 
first sexual experience at age 16 fiftynine percent said they 
have had only one partner 
teens living in rural areas appear to be more sexually active 
than others while 253 percent of those surveyed said they have 
had sex the figure was 306 percent for those from rural areas 
208 percent from cities and 192 percent from suburbs

the dollar narrowed losses against the japanese yen 
and ended slightly lower tuesday in tokyo following approval by the 
us senate of a deficit reduction plan share prices erased early 
gains and fell 
the dollar ended the day at 12995 yen down 010 yen from 
mondays 13005yen close it opened lower at 12965 yen and ranged 
between 12895 yen and 13035 yen tuesdays close was the lowest 
since mar 15 1989 when the dollar closed at 12988 yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 13489 points or 057 
percent ending at 2349511 the index at late afternoon fell 
about 550 points from the days high before narrowing the losses 
toward the end of the afternoon session traders said 
they said the index fell as market players discouraged by the 
slowdown in the yens surge against the dollar started selling 
issues 
meanwhile the dollar inched up in mixed trading after opening 
lower following a substantial amount of dollar selling in the 
sydney market which opens earlier than tokyo dealers said 
they said the dollar turned upward in the late morning when the 
bank of japan made rate check phone calls to some japanese 
banks a rate check does not involve any market activity but is a 
tactic the central bank uses to make banks voluntarily refrain from 
too much dollar selling 
also reports that the us senate gave final approval to a 500 
billion deficitreduction plan helped support the dollar said 
yoshikazu kuroda a dealer with fuji bank 
the senate passed an emergency bill on a voice vote monday night 
that would let the government open normally tuesday morning and the 
house concurred 3623 the vote came just as dollar trading closed 
in tokyo 
the white house said president bush would sign the legislation 
and that all federal employees should report to work as scheduled 
but the dollar will remain weak despite temporary fluctuations 
according to toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new japan 
securities co 
there are no positive factors to encourage dollar buying 
now he said 
in addition to already serious worries over the us economy 
market players are heavily discouraged by the houses disapproval 
of the budget plan kanai said 
expectations that the federal reserve board will lower interest 
rates are also depressing the dollar dealers said

nasa expects a crowd of 
5000 to 10000 people will watch shuttle discovery land wednesday 
discovery is scheduled to touch down on concrete runway 22 on 
rogers dry lake at 958 am edt wednesday national aeronautics 
and space administration spokesman don haley said monday 
we expect good weather and there should be no problem from 
mild santa ana winds which usually dont speed up until later in 
the day he said 
haley said he anticipates a small crowd of between 5000 and 
10000 spectators because it will take place during a school day 
a record 500000 spectators watched columbia land at the desert 
military base on july 4 1982 haley said the smallest crowd was 
about 2200 people who watched columbia land last jan 20 
haley said discovery will land on a paved runway instead of an 
unpaved strip because nasa wants to test the shuttles brakes on 
concrete such tests are a prelude to eventual landings at the 
shuttles launch site at cape canaveral fla

the united states is resisting an arabled 
groundswell in the security council for a resolution accusing 
israel of a criminal act in the killings of 19 palestinians 
during riots in jerusalem 
arab delegates argued monday that the world should put the 
palestinian issue on a par with the persian gulf crisis which was 
pushed from the top of the councils agenda for the first time in 
two months 
we do not understand how oil in the gulf can be valued more 
highly by you than palestinian blood and moslem rights and 
shrines said palestinian observer zuhdi labib terzi speaking to 
the 15member council during debate 
israeli ambassador johanan bein accused the plo of raising the 
issue to divert attention away from iraqs takeover of kuwait 
the plo has backed iraq while most of the international 
community has denounced it and joined in imposing an embargo on 
trade with baghdad 
the security council meeting was adjourned until this morning 
and vote prospects remained uncertain 
it was not known whether the united states would veto abstain 
or support a milder resolution criticizing israel it was also 
possible that a general statement would be issued without a vote 
western diplomats said the united states objected to a phrase in 
the proposed resolution citing indiscriminate opening of fire 
against unarmed palestinian civilians 
the israeli forces moved in monday after palestinians threw 
stones at jews praying at the wailing wall in jerusalems old city 
israel already has rejected the proposed resolutions provision 
for a threeman factfinding mission from the security council to 
investigate the killings 
in mondays debate 13 speakers assailed israeli authorities for 
the use of deadly forces during the riots which also left about 
140 arabs wounded it was the worst violence in jerusalem in 23 
years 
the arab envoys demanded that israel be denounced for the 
criminal act of allowing police to open fire on palestinians 
we do not understand how the security council can ignore our 
plea for protection we appeal to the civilized world come to 
our protection before it is too late terzi the palestinian 
envoy said in his speech monday 
however israeli ambassador bein said the plo had attempted to 
ambush thousands of jewish worshipers at the wailing wall it 
was a provocation that was planned ahead and the only people who 
will try to gain from it are the palestinians and iraqi president 
saddam hussein 
saddam has suggested linking any international accord on kuwait 
with a settlement of the palestinian issue western powers have 
rejected any preconditions on an iraqi pullout but suggested that 
the palestinian question could be discussed afterward 
the new flareup in israel has put us officials in a delicate 
position washington does not wish to be accused of exercising a 
double standard toward kuwait and the palestinians especially when 
it is trying to keep arab support for the usled international 
force countering iraq 
arab diplomats hinted monday that a us veto could jeopardize 
the international and arab coalition assembled against iraq 
however the united states israels staunchest ally was 
reported unwilling to vote for any factfinding commission that 
israel would reject 
the united states already has criticized use of live fire by 
israeli police us ambassador thomas r pickering reaffirmed that 
opposition monday and told reporters the us government wants 
restraint he said extremists on both sides are trying to inflame 
the situation in jerusalem 
soviet ambassador yuli vorontsov said the soviet union sternly 
condemns these inhuman and provocative activities on the part of 
israel 
most speakers condemning israel proposed that a unsponsored 
international peace conference devise a political settlement in the 
middle east and demanded political rights or statehood for 
palestinians

jury selection in the obscenity 
trial of rap group 2 live crew was slowed by legal wrangling over 
the racial makeup of the jury pool and the states challenge of the 
judge 
group leader luther campbell and band members chris wongwon and 
mark ross face misdemeanor obscenity charges stemming from a june 
10 adultsonly performance at a nightclub in nearby hollywood 
if convicted the three could be sentenced to up to a year in 
jail and fined 1000 
pretrial hearings and jury selection were scheduled for today 
bruce rogow the attorney defending the black rappers 
challenged broward countys voterbased jury pool as 
unconstitutional in cases that depend on community standards like 
obscenity 
because it relies only on voter registration lists it leaves 
you always with a pretty middleclass semimiddleaged 
disproportionately white jury pool because those are the people who 
register to vote in the greatest numbers rogow said 
only three of 25 potential jurors questioned monday were black 
broward circuit judge june johnson said she wanted to see the whole 
70person pool before ruling on the defense motion no jurors for 
the sixmember panel were chosen monday 
the defense attorney didnt suggest an alternative way to choose 
potential jurors 
rogow also represented charles freeman a black record store 
owner convicted last week by an allwhite jury on a similar charge 
for selling the groups album as nasty as they wanna be 
freemans case woke everybody up to the fact theres something 
wrong with the jury system campbell said monday 
the album which us district judge jose gonzalez earlier ruled 
obscene has sold about 2 million copies 
freeman complained after his conviction that the jury doesnt 
represent my community 
an elections official said about 85 percent of registered 
voters in broward county are black 
johnson rejected a prosecution request monday that she 
disqualify herself from the case because she had been a law student 
of defense attorney rogow 15 years ago prosecutors are appealing 
the decision 
the judge approved a defense motion that neither freemans 
conviction nor gonzalezs ruling should be allowed as evidence at 
the groups trial 
most obscenity cases are argued on the us supreme courts 
miller v california test 
essentially it holds that material is obscene if the average 
person applying contemporary local community standards would find 
that it is designed to cause sexual arousal if it depicts sex in a 
patently offensive way and if taken as a whole it lacks serious 
literary artistic political or scientific value

hundreds of thousands of federal workers need 
not endure the discomfort today of learning the republic will go on 
without them the federal government is open for business 
the threeday shutdown of the government affected mostly 
tourists it happened over a holiday weekend and caused the closing 
of national monuments parks and museums the real pinch would have 
been today when everyone was coming back to work 
but monday nights accord between congress and the white house 
on an emergency spending bill will give government the legal 
authority to spend money until oct 19 by then congressional 
leaders hope to work out a deficitreducing budget that will carry 
things through next september 
the alternative would have been to let the governments 24 
million employees show up for work this morning and then send home 
all but those whose services are considered essential 
by some estimates that could have meant roughly 2 million of 
those people would learn that the government was prepared to do 
without their services and they would have to do without their pay 
the prospect of this made some angry 
its demoralizing said john sturdivant president of the 
700000member american federation of government employees all 
the anxiety all the wasted time on sending out furlough notices 
and memos 
essential workers included air traffic controllers law 
enforcement agents prison guards and nurses in veterans 
administration hospitals thousands of other federal employees 
ranging from meat inspectors to press secretaries to us troops in 
the middle east remained on the job after government 
authorization to pay them expired friday night 
but the government was planning to send home the bulk of the 
people who collect its taxes monitor its environment support its 
farmers and other daytoday operations 
some employees were not told in advance whether they were 
considered essential and their job status for today was left 
hanging over the weekend 
im really rather confused about what is going on vic lara 
who processes social security claims in mesa ariz said monday 
theres a chance i might not be working its hard enough to make 
it on my pay level at full time 
one official who declined to be identified by name or agency 
said the office of management and budget had set guidelines stating 
that normally only 15 percent of a civilian agency should be 
considered essential 
fifteen percent would mean 360000 people would stay on the job 
and about 2 million would be sent home however in past shutdowns 
only a few hundred thousand have gone home

bitter foes garry kasparov and anatoly karpov 
finally sat down to their longawaited world chess rematch but 
five hours after their first game began the result was the same as 
the last time they met a draw 
the two opened the 1990 world chess championship on monday at 
the hudson theater where a hushed crowd of about 700 paid up to 
100 a ticket to watch the first of 24 scheduled games 
after 30 moves apiece kasparov the champion offered a draw 
and karpov accepted the two play again wednesday 
when they last met for the championship in 1987 the competition 
ended in a draw and kasparov retained the title he won from karpov 
in 1985 
they are polar opposites when it comes to chess styles politics 
and personalities their rivalry is intense 
kasparov 27 the highestrated player in the history of chess 
has a bold attacking style karpov 39 relies on methodical 
defenseminded strategies 
the younger man is a flamboyant champion who does not hesitate 
to criticize his countrys communist leaders the older chessman is 
a communist party member who has been quoted as saying i have 
two loves communism and chess 
kasparov plays under the flag of the russian republic not the 
soviet union in protest against a government he calls tyrannical 
on monday kasparov opened with the byrne variation of the 
kings indian defense named for robert byrne the new york times 
chess columnist who popularized it 
as the two played the audience of several hundred including 
actors steve martin and rick moranis sat in rapt silence the 
crowd offered up a shhhhhhhh at one point when someone in the 
back spoke up 
the game ended when kasparov took a pawn from karpov evening 
their forces 
its an unavoidable draw said international master vitaly 
zaltzman of new york 
chess buffs in attendance said the lack of a victor didnt 
bother them 
its not very often that you get to see the two best chess 
players in the world said william mulcahy 36 he paid 100 to 
see the game and said hell be back to see another 
i wouldnt want to be on that stage right now said 
10yearold matthew blank id be killed in 15 moves but 
someday i wouldnt mind 
this years tournament is to feature 12 games in new york then 
12 in lyon france the winner will receive 17 million and the 
loser 13 million 
the match played on a board linked to a computer is aimed at 
the tv generation 
above the stage is a screen about 10 feet high bearing a 
drawing of a blue and pink chess board with black and white pieces 
when kasparov or karpov makes a move the pieces on the screen 
move too for the audiences benefit 
two video screens about 5 feet high flank the center screen 
allowing the audience to see the players up close 
karpov appeared calm during mondays match looking at times as 
if he had just woken up 
kasparov pressed his chest against the table and fidgeted 
bouncing one foot puffing out his cheeks scowling wincing 
pursing his lips he often assumed his most famous pose cheeks or 
forehead enveloped in both hands 
karpov surprised many of the grandmasters present when on his 
fifth move he pursued a line of play the two had ever used in 
their 121 previous matches 
he chose a series of moves known as the saemisch variation a 
flexible opening that allows white to attack on either side of the 
board 
observers felt kasparovs 19th move attacking karpovs rook 
with his bishop was a mistake and a turning point in the game 
karpov played rather listlessly in the opening but kasparov 
pressed too hard and nearly let the game get away said 
grandmaster joel benjamin of new york

a protest over aboriginal land rights 
turned violent today as a group of about 400 demonstrators ripped 
down the state parliaments front gate and clashed with police 
a police spokesman said 11 protesters were arrested and charged 
with offenses ranging from assaulting police to malicious damage 
the violence broke out after several protesters scaled the iron 
gates of the new south wales parliament house and members of the 
increasingly irate crowd managed to rip out two sections of the 
gate 
protesters poured toward parliaments front door and were met by 
police reinforcements scuffles broke out as police battled to 
remove the protesters 
police kept the protesters from entering the building they 
managed to force the crowd back onto the street and formed a human 
chain to cover the sixmeterwide hole in the fence 
the demonstrators took away a section of the castiron front 
gate and dumped it in the street chanting and waving signs they 
also began throwing beer cans and rocks at police 
the march was organized to protest an alleged lack of 
consultation over changes that the state government plans in the 
aboriginal land rights act the amended act is expected to be 
passed by the state parliaments upper house this week 
last month the aboriginal land council and the state government 
reached an agreement that both said would guarantee land council 
autonomy 
land council chairman david clark described it as a historic 
agreement because it was the first time aborigines australias 
indigenous people were consulted in forming policies that affect 
them 
the amendments give the land council automony at a grassroots 
level and provide for the election of a 13member statelevel 
body 
but there is dissatisfaction in some quarters because the 
amendments are shifting power away from the middle tier of the 
power structure 
state premier nick greiner expressed disappointment at the 
protest 
this is a minority group that feels its power base has been 
eroded theyre probably right about that and they are entitled to 
their view he said theyre not entitled to express it in a 
ratbag way 
land councils in new south wales were established in 1983 as a 
threetiered democratically elected system to administer 
aboriginal land 
the councils invest their allotment of a land tax in property 
and businesses some aborigines but far from all live on rural 
land that is purchased by the councils many of those who hold jobs 
work for businesses bought by the land councils

the neighborhood bar that inspired the hit 
television series cheers has decided to keep its original name 
the bull amp finch pub 
the bull amp finch has been a boston landmark for 20 years 
now owner thomas kershaw said in a statement monday our 
regulars made a compelling case to keep the bull amp finch tradition 
alive 
kershaw had planned to change the pubs name in time for a local 
celebration next month in honor of the 200th episode of cheers 
ted danson and other stars of the 8yearold show are expected 
to be in boston on nov 8 to take part in the festivities which 
will include a parade 
the bull amp finch which opened in a basement in 1969 was a 
neighborhood bar until word spread that it was the inspiration for 
cheers the tv set is a mirror image of the boston bar 
now the bar reports an estimated 500000 tourists drop by each 
year 
the bull amp finch pub is still basically a neighborhood bar 
our neighborhood has just gotten a lot bigger kershaw said

authorities have arrested two retired 
interior ministry generals and charged them with masterminding the 
1984 murder of popular prosolidarity priest jerzy popieluszko 
prosecutors on monday also announced the arrests of a former 
interior minister and six others on corruption charges 
the arrests represent the first efforts by the solidarityled 
government to prosecute former communist officials for abuses 
committed during four decades of authoritarian rule 
when prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki became the east blocs 
first noncommunist government leader last year he said there 
would be no witch hunts or settling of scores with former 
communist officials 
unlike other budding democracies in eastern europe there were 
no arrests of ousted former highranking officials 
but mazowiecki is now running for president against solidarity 
chairman lech walesa and a key issue in the race is whether he has 
been too slow to remove communists from prominent positions in the 
administration and industry 
the balloting is set for nov 25 and mazowiecki a former walesa 
adviser only announced on thursday that he would be challenging 
the solidarity chief 
polands general prosecutor aleksander herzog named the two 
men arrested in popieluszkos death as former deputy interior 
minister wladyslaw ciaston and zenon platek former head of the 
ministry department that had monitored the roman catholic church 
the two generals were presented with charges that in september 
and october 1984 they instigated their subordinates to kill the 
rev jerzy popieluszko and on oct 19 they directed the 
realization of the murder herzog said in a television interview 
four secret policemen from plateks department were convicted in 
the crime which helped rally prodemocracy forces in predominantly 
catholic poland at a time the solidarity free trade union movement 
had been forced underground 
two of those convicted have been paroled but two others remain 
in jail 
the politically charged investigation that led to their 
conviction did not find involvement by their superiors 
the prosecutors office opened a new investigation into the 
popieluszko case on july 24 three weeks after the resignation of 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak he was in charge of the 
secret and uniformed police forces at the time of popieluszko 
killing 
the civilian who replaced kiszczak as head of the interior 
ministry is systematically purging the department 
in a frontpage commentary in gazeta wyborcza today journalist 
jerzy jachowicz who has covered the security services for many 
years called the arrests that began thursday unprecedented 
he wrote a great number of former functionaries of the 
interior ministry were arrested among them a man who even in the 
1980s held the highest party and state positions at that time an 
especially repressive and ruthless fight against any manifestation 
of social independence was being carried out 
among those arrested on corruption charges was former interior 
minister gen miroslaw milewski a onetime communist party 
politburo member and a central committee secretary 
milewski 62 worked for the security service from 1944 at least 
until 1981 he was interior minister in 198081 
kiszczak replaced milewski as interior minister in july 1981 
milewski was then appointed a politburo member and central 
committee secretary in charge of internal affairs until his quiet 
dismissal in january 1985 shortly after the murder of popieluszko 
the inquiry involves the acceptance of material benefits of 
great value including many kilograms of gold and jewelry said 
herzog 
he did not name the others charged but said they included two 
other generals and two colonels 
he did not elaborate but stressed that the case was not 
connected with the murder of popieluszko 
the investigation is being carried out by the office for 
protection of the state created when the secret service was 
disbanded in may

rwandas government has stepped up efforts 
to put down an invasion of ethnic tutsi rebels by rounding up 
hundreds of suspected rebel supporters 
meanwhile in the northeast of that central african nation 
soldiers continued their battle with what the government is now 
describing as a force of 10000 rebels several times largest than 
earlier estimates 
more than 230 people have been killed in the 10dayold war the 
government announced monday 
in a briefing for foreign envoys on monday foreign minister 
casimir bizimungu of rwanda said about 500 people had been arrested 
for questioning 
news reports from france and belgian the former colonial power 
said up to 3000 people mainly members of the minority tutsi 
tribe had been picked up 
diplomats in the capital kigali could not give a precise 
figure but said hundreds were being held in jails and at a stadium 
outside the city 
bizimungu put the size of the invading force at 10000 and said 
30 army troops and 200 rebels had been killed he also claimed the 
rebels were assassinating civilians but did not elaborate 
in telephone interviews diplomats who attended the briefing 
said they understood from other sources as well that civilians had 
been killed in the fighting zone but it was unclear by whom 
one foreign envoy said travelers from the north had told him of 
seeing many corpses but had provided no specific numbers 
rebels calling themselves the rwandese patriotic front invaded 
across the northern border with uganda on sept 30 the force is 
made up of rwandan refugees mainly tutsis many are deserters from 
ugandas army 
the rebels accuse the government of president juvenal 
habyarimana of corruption human rights abuses and dictatorial 
leadership they say theirs is not an ethnic war 
however this country of 67 million has a long history of 
enmity between tutsis and hutus who dominate the government 
nearly 100000 tutsi refugees have lived in uganda since the 
late 1950s and early 1960s after fleeing massacres by the hutu 
tribe 
habyarimana a hutu has ruled rwanda since a 1973 coup 
forces from other countries have been drawn into the new 
conflict france belgium and zaire have sent nearly 1500 troops 
saying the mission is to protect their citizens and embassies in 
kigali 
the rebels have warned foreign governments not to interfere in 
the fighting 
nearly 1000 expatriates mostly women and children left rwanda 
on special flights over the weekend but the exodus appeared to 
have ended by monday 
fighting was reported around the capital friday shops began to 
reopen and people were again allowed to move freely around the city 
monday 
residents today reported hearing no shooting in the capital 
overnight they said most businesses had reopened 
bizimungu said the country was calm except for the northeastern 
mutara region where rwandese soldiers were fighting the rebels he 
claimed the invaders had sophisticated weaponry including mortars 
armored vehicles and machine guns 
in a weekend interview with a london newspaper the independent 
a rebel leader denyed those claims but maj peter bayingana did 
say that the rebels had pushed army troops out of the region and 
set up headquarters about 12 miles inside rwanda 
bayingana was also quoted as denying harming civilians the 
local people are astonished that we havent done what the 
government said wed do raping them killing them

the government has ordered four 
indian diplomats expelled for undesirable activities in the 
latest blow to deteriorating relations between the two countries 
the indian embassy said the expulsions ordered late monday 
represent a move by pakistan to whip up fears of an indian plot to 
sabotage this countrys oct 24 parliamentary elections 
the ousted diplomats were working at the indian consulate in the 
southern port city of karachi they have been ordered to leave the 
country within 10 days a pakistani foreign ministry release said 
these indian officials were involved in undesirable activities 
which were totally incompatible with their official status the 
statement said the ministry refused to elaborate 
i think its been in the cards for some time what with this 
orchestrated thing building up in the press charging indians 
are doing a lot of subversive activity said an indian embassy 
spokesman referring to almost daily reports of an indianbacked 
sabotage plot 
last week army chiefofstaff gen mirza aslam beg said an 
extremely dangerous plot to sabotage polling had been 
uncovered he hinted that a foreign hand was behind it a term 
pakistan uses when referring to india 
the government has since said 58 indiantrained agents have been 
arrested and scores more have slipped into the countrys ethnically 
troubled southern province of sindh 
shooting sprees by various groups in the past five months have 
killed at least 500 people in the southern cities of karachi and 
hyderabad 
the indian embassy spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity said india expelled two pakistani diplomats during the 
summer this is probably also titfortat he said 
relations between india and pakistan soured in january when a 
violent secessionist uprising began in indias state of 
jammukashmir 
more than 1300 people have died in the conflict since january 
when the indian army launched its military crackdown on moslem 
insurgents fighting for either independence or union with pakistan 
the two countries have twice gone to war over kashmir in 
194748 and in 1965 the wars have left kashmir divided into 
pakistani and indian sectors 
predominantly hindu india fought moslem pakistan in a third war 
in 1971 over bangladesh

african national congress leader 
nelson mandela returned to prison today but only as a visitor 
mandela returning to pollsmoor and robben island prisons for 
the first time since his release in february spoke to jailed anc 
members about government plans to free political prisoners 
it evokes all kinds of memories but im concentrating on 
the pleasant ones mandela said with a smile before boarding a 
boat for the short ride from cape town to robben island 
while waiting to get on the boat mandela recognized one of his 
former prison guards and greeted him warmly 
oh you are a sergeant now mandela said 
mandela was jailed for more than 27 years for plotting to 
overthrow the government he spent almost two decades on robben 
island and was moved to pollsmoor east of cape town in 1982 
today he first visited prisoners at pollsmoor then went to 
robben island 
the anc has said the government must free the political 
prisoners before the black opposition movement will enter 
fullscale negotiations on ending apartheid 
the government has released dozens of prisoners in recent 
months and 15 more are to be freed wednesday but the anc says 
there are about 3000 inmates they consider political prisoners 
president fw de klerk has said his government will free all 
political prisoners but he has not said how many inmates fall into 
that category 
de klerk said today that the ancs estimated 20000 exiles could 
begin applying for amnesty to clear the way for their return to 
south africa

youve seen it on television and in the papers 
now theres the board game desert shield 
armchair generals who hunker down with the 40 game due to be 
shipped to stores today will learn that iraqs brute force is no 
match for us technological superiority the games maker says 
but mark herrman a defense department consultant who designed 
the game for avalon hill game co said his game aims to teach 
another more sobering lesson driving iraq out of kuwait without 
heavy us casualties requires patience and a little luck 
there is a lot of force on the other side of the line you 
just dont go after them head on herrman said 
desert shield is actually an update of a 1983 game by herrman 
called gulf strike in which the premise is iran invading saudi 
arabia 
the game of desert shield simulates in living room safety the 
standoff in the persian gulf between iraq and the united states and 
its allies the board is a map of the gulf broken into octagonal 
sections the game pieces are cardboard rectangles representing 
troops and armaments 
players do battle moving back and forth over the octagons with 
a die and game cards to direct the outcome 
the game gives the us side a technological advantage and is 
set up so that unless the iraqi side shows a napoleonic gift for 
strategy the united states wins every time but herrman said the 
real challenge for the us player is to defeat iraq while keeping 
losses down 
herrman cautioned prospective players that his game is not a 
threeday war this can take time he said 
and even if the us player shows proper patience and tactics 
there is no guarantee against heavy battlefield losses 
war is always chance herrman said

premier li peng aaking his first public pitch in 
the debate over economic policy said today that china should 
pursue a policy of slow but steady growth 
you can ask the ordinary folk do they feel their living 
standard has fallen most think things arent going too bad prices 
are stable and goods in the markets are abundant li said 
defending a 2yearold austerity policy that critics say has slowed 
the economy too sharply 
we cannot develop blindly the premier said he said 
priority should be given to agriculture and the economic 
infrastructure instead of opening new special economic zones which 
have served to foster marketstyle reforms 
after taking the lead in market reforms among socialist 
countries for the past 10 years chinas aging top leadership is 
engaged in a heated backstage debate over the next decades course 
the government is due to approve a new five year plan to guide 
the economy from 1991 through 1995 but as the starting date for 
the plan nears the leaders appear nowhere near agreement 
li said in a toast at a national day reception sept 30 that the 
communist partys decisionmaking central committee will hold a 
plenum to discuss a draft plan but he gave no date for the 
meeting 
foreign diplomats say several drafts have been written but none 
has enough support to win central committee approval 
li 61 stepped down in july as minister of the state commission 
for restructuring the economy which under ousted party general 
secretary zhao ziyang had served as a think tank for promoting 
economic reforms 
however lis speech indicated he intends to continue playing a 
key role in economic policy 
the speech was delivered aug 2 to a conference on industrial 
production and was published today in the party newspaper the 
peoples daily the paper said it also will appear in the partys 
weekly magazine seek truth 
the official media have published few statements recently from 
leaders regarded as more reformist 
but chinese economists writing mainly in professional 
publications have made guarded pleas for a resumption of price 
reforms regarded by many as the key to a successful transition 
from rigid central planning to a market economy 
in his speech li emphasized price stability and said state 
price subsidies should be reduced gradually an estimated onethird 
of the state budget goes for price subsidies for urban residents 
who pay artificially low prices for food housing and 
transportation 
some localities and departments have started again to strive 
for projects and want to invest leaning toward speed li said 
if this continues the construction front will become too long 
things will be done on too large a scale and we will repeat the 
old error of being overeager for results 
we must earnestly learn the lessons of the past and advance 
steadily during the five year plan and coming decade he said 
zhaos slide from power began in 1988 when hardliners led by 
li accused him of encouraging chaotic and inflationary economic 
growth li helped write an austerity program that has reduced 
inflation from nearly 40 percent to less than 4 percent 
however the austerity program also forced millions of small 
rural factories out of business by cutting off credit and supplies 
and worsened the indebtedness of many large state factories reform 
initiatives have halted and some reforms have been rolled back

david h souter a mildmannered wellread 
and previously littleknown judge from new hampshire became 
historys 105th supreme court justice today after pledging to do 
equal right to the poor and to the rich 
in a brief ceremony in the crowded courtroom souter 51 was 
administered the judicial oath of office by chief justice william 
h rehnquist and almost immediately got to work hearing high court 
arguments with his eight new colleagues 
in taking the oath souter said i do solemnly swear to 
administer justice without respect to persons and do equal right 
to the poor and to the rich 
afterward souter and rehnquist posed for photographers outside 
the building on capitol hill before heading back inside for a 
reception attended by members of the senate judiciary committee 
other washington dignitaries and souters friends and wellwishers 
souter facing a group of photographers and television cameras 
outside said i got to work on time this morning im starting 
off on the right foot 
as cameras clicked and whirred souter said hurry and load 
up ive got to go to work 
he also disclosed that he has found a place to live in the 
washington dc area but declined to give any details 
a short time later souter took his seat at the end of bench 
assigned to the newest justice for the start of the courts 
regularly scheduled proceedings 
as souter pledged to uphold the constitution in a separate 
oathtaking ceremony monday at the white house president bush 
praised him as a very thoughtful and caring man 
souter said monday he hopes to pass on the constitution in as 
vigorous condition as i have received it this afternoon as it 
were from justice brennan 
souter was picked as bushs first high court nominee to replace 
william j brennan who retired in july because of failing health 
brennan had been a leading voice of liberalism on the court for 34 
years 
souter joins the court at a pivotal time in its history 
a reliably conservative majority led by appointees of former 
president reagan only recently has begun to emerge 
the future of legalized abortion and other highly controversial 
issues such as affirmative action and churchstate relations hang 
in the balance with relatively little known about how souter may 
vote 
souter who recently described himself as a moderate 
conservative revealed little about his views on major 
constitutional issues in three days of testimony before the senate 
judiciary committee the senate confirmed him 909 
senate judiciary chairman joseph biden ddel said monday it 
is hard to predict what type of justice souter will be 
once they are in there and they are no longer accountable to 
their spouse or their god anything can happen said biden 
apparently disregarding the fact that souter is a bachelor 
souter last week underscored his own potential importance as a 
swing vote he told reporters that other justices were eager for 
him to come aboard to avoid the possibility of 44 ties in 
controversial cases 
the courts 199091 term began last week with the justices 
hearing arguments in cases to be decided by july 
before being named a federal appeals court judge by bush earlier 
this year souter spent seven years as a member of the new 
hampshire supreme court he previously served as a trial judge and 
as his states attorney general 
souter lacks a permanent staff having been assigned only a 
temporary secretary and a temporary messenger each justice is 
allowed four law clerks two secretaries and a messenger 
souter said earlier he hoped to select his law clerks by next 
week 
he moved into a suite of offices formerly occupied by justice 
antonin scalia who gave them up when he moved into brennans old 
chambers 
the gold nameplate put on the door days ago says justice 
souter but court officials waited until his swearingin to 
remove adhesive paper that covered the plate

an air force review found the northrop corp 
manufacturer of the b2 stealth bomber beset with problems in 
nearly every aspect of its business a lawmaker said today 
concerned about northrops poor performance in the production of 
several weapons systems the air force conducted an indepth study 
of the company in june and july that ound problems in six major 
areas 
the service identified weaknesses in systems engineering the 
transition from research and development to production software 
management subcontract management organization and personnel and 
business systems which includes cost and schedule estimates 
the air force team found that northrop failed miserably in 
every key management area necessary to the successful development 
and production of a major weapons system said rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce committee and 
its investigations subcommittee 
the subcommittees ranking republican rep thomas j bliley of 
virginia said he found it distressing that a company that has 
been entrusted with over 36 billion since 1980 and that has been 
counted upon to manage programs critical to our national defense 
could have so many fundamental deficiencies 
the associated press obtained a draft copy of dingell and 
blileys opening statements for a subcommittee hearing today 
loye miller a spokesman for northrop in the washington dc 
area said the company had not seen dingells statement and would 
have no immediate comment on the allegations 
justice department officials told the panel in july that the 
california company should be barred from government business 
the officials described how northrop falsified reports on the 
airlaunched cruise missile and conducted improper tests on the 
harrier av8b jet northrop also manufactures the b2 bomber and is 
in competition with lockheed for the contract on the advanced 
tactical fighter 
the companys action led to its guilty plea in february on 34 
charges of fraud and a fine of 17 million the largest criminal 
fine ever imposed on a defense contractor 
at the same hearing john betti undersecretary of defense for 
acquisitions said he did not anticipate any debarment procedure 
against the company 
betti testified that pentagon officials overseeing management at 
northrop have assured me that all monitoring systems necessary to 
protect the interests of the taxpayers and national security are 
currently in place and working well at northrop 
in his statement for todays hearing dingell noted a june 5 
letter to kent kresa northrops president and chief executive 
officer in which the air force said that while some programs 
have shown improvement in the past year others including tacit 
rainbow a missile program and key classified programs continue 
to reflect poor performance 
jj welch jr the assistant secretary of the air force for 
acquisition informed kresa in the letter that the service planned 
an indepth review 
the nature of the performance problems is most serious 
welch said i encourage your direct personal involvement in 
promptly correcting them 
two months later after the air force had conducted its review 
betti testified before the panel although betti had been briefed 
three times before his appearance he had not been told of the air 
forces findings from its review according to dingell

bills

southeastern victoria state posted notices at a shopping center 
offering to sell one of their three sons benjamin 21 months 
andrew 4 and david 7 
the family could not be contacted for comment today but 
walther 31 told a television interviewer monday he would have 
to get at least 15000 for one of them to repay his debts 
victorias community services department said it was undecided 
whether the boys should be taken from their parents 
community services minister kay setches said the familys case 
was being assessed during discussions with the family 
it is a matter of concern to me where parents are driven to a 
situation where they would make this offer and what we want to do 
is ensure they know the degree of support that is available to 
them she said 
she said it was too early to consider charges against the couple 
and called the offer to sell the children a cry for help 
when you look at the degree of pressure the family is under 
when they are in economic difficulties they can be driven to make 
statements they might not want to carry out in a day or twos 
time she said 
but she added certainly its a type of child abuse to 
actually say to your children im going to sell you that 
concerns me

top opposition leader kim daejung 
backed by 200 supporters staging a sitin fasted for a second day 
today to demand that president roh taewoo disband a military 
intelligence unit 
dissidents and radical students called for nationwide protests 
this week including a major rally saturday in seoul they are 
angry over allegations that rohs government conducted military 
surveillance of more than 1300 citizens 
roh fired his defense minister and the powerful chief of 
military intelligence on monday to minimize the impact of the 
surveillance scandal the most serious since he took office in 
early 1988 
about 200 members of kims party staged a sitin to support the 
opposition leader who began the hunger strike monday at his 
office kim is demanding that the government disband the defense 
security command the intelligence unit and carry out economic 
reform 
roh appealed for a truce in the political fighting and asked the 
opposition to settle issues through dialogue 
kims party for peace and democracy rejected his overtures 
it also threatened to mount a national movement to topple roh if 
the president rejects kims calls for reform and refuses to end 
dirty political operations aimed at harassing opposition 
parties 
domestic politics have been in turmoil since august when 
opposition lawmakers resigned from parliament en masse charging 
the government with railroading bills and curtailing democratic 
reforms 
the hardened position of kim a veteran opposition leader was 
apparently propelled by mounting public criticism of rohs 
administration 
in stepping up their attack on roh dissidents said the 
allegations that the military spied on civilians showed rohs 
government is a disguised military government 
dissident leaders decided monday to hold antigovernment rallies 
with radical students this week in seoul and provincial cities roh 
pledged to keep the military out of politics and anger over the 
allegations prompted the opposition to set aside their divisions 
and join forces 
yoon sukyang a 24yearold deserter from the military 
intelligence unit alleged last week that the military was spying 
on dissidents intellectuals and opposition lawmakers yoon 
provided confidential papers computer discs and data he said were 
evidence of massive and systematic spying on civilians 
roh captured twothirds of the 299member national assembly in 
january by merging his party with two minor opposition groups 
but his popularity has fallen because of inflation social 
disturbances and disputes within the enlarged governing party

the supreme court today agreed to review a 
federal rule that lets employees of private hospitals according to 
their jobs organize into eight separate collective bargaining 
units 
the court said it will hear an appeal by the american hospital 
association seeking fewer employee categories 
the national labor relations board adopted the rule in 1989 it 
recognizes separate bargaining units for physicians registered 
nurses other professional employees medical technicians skilled 
maintenance workers clerical workers guards and other 
nonprofessional employees 
the regulation applies to employees at more than 4000 private 
hospitals nationwid 
the chicagobased 7th us circuit court of appeals upheld the 
rule last april 
the hospital industry favors recognizing no more than three 
bargaining units professional employees guards and 
nonprofessional employees 
from the employers perspective the appeals court noted the 
more units there are the more costly it will be for the employer to 
negotiate collective bargaining contracts and work stoppages will 
be likelier because there will be more separate decisionmakers 
to call a strike 
but the appeals court said the nlrb did not exceed its authority 
in fixing on eight categories 
the board could have chosen a larger number the appeals court 
said noting new york regulators had permitted 21 separate hospital 
bargaining units 
it is not for us to finetune the regulatory process by 
telling the labor board that its rule should make slightly more 
distinctions that it does or slightly fewer we therefore 
uphold its rule without pretending that we consider it utopia 
the appeals court said 
bush administration lawyers even though they defended the nlrb 
rule urged the justices to hear the hospitals appeal 
the government lawyers said a high court ruling would head off a 
host of local challenges that could disrupt labormanagement 
relations at hospitals 
the case is american hospital association vs nlrb 9097

companies are suspected of helping iraq obtain chemical weapons and 
other arms a prosecutor said today

employed by nine german companies 
of the more than 20 people suspected brand said four people 
are in investigative custody and three have been released either on 
bail or for health reasons they remain under investigation 
our suspicions have been widely confirmed said brand who 
heads an inquiry into illegal exports to iraq that began three 
years ago long before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait

violating export laws

the report 
the newsmagazine der spiegel said in its issue monday that the 
report concluded six iraqi poison gas factories were delivered by 
german companies 
brand said one suspect peter leifert a partner in the 
hamburgbased water engineering trading co has admitted 
delivering chemical equipment that can be used for military 
purposes by iraq spiegel said leifert also worked for german 
intelligence for about two years

40 german companies it said had played a major role in supplying 
iraq with equipment needed to produce chemical biological nuclear

the supreme court today left intact an 
affirmative action plan for the san francisco fire department 
the court without comment rejected a unions challenge that 
said the plan violates the rights of white men 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last december upheld the 
citys agreement to hire and promote women and minorities to 
overcome past discrimination 
the appeals court said the plan is fundamentally fair 
adequate and reasonable and narrowly tailored to avoid hurting 
white men unnecessarily 
in upholding a federal judges approval of the agreement the 
appeals court noted that the fire department first hired blacks in 
1955 and women in 1987 
the citys hiring and promotion tests for firefighters 
repeatedly were judged discriminatory from 1970 to 1987 
the consent decree the city signed to implement affirmative 
action ended 18 years of lawsuits by women and minority groups 
the reagan administration challenged the citys affirmative 
action efforts in 1984 and was joined by firefighters union local 
798 the bush administration did not join the unions appeal to the 
supreme court to throw out the plan 
in december 1987 us district judge marilyn hall patel in san 
francisco also ordered the fire department to crack down on racial 
harassment after a swastika was found in the office of two minority 
firefighters fire chief ed phipps resigned shortly afterward 
when the consent decree was approved the department had 225 
minority members and seven women on a force of 1100 
the plan set longterm goals of 40 percent minorities and 10 
percent women in the department the agreement called for filling 
55 percent of all openings with minorities and 10 percent with 
women through 1994 
the city also agreed to develop unbiased examinations for hiring 
and promotion and to promote 33 minority firefighters to the rank 
of lieutenant 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the firefighters union 
said hiring and promotion goals were based improperly on the

bush and members of congress went about their work as federal 
workers breathed a collective sigh of relief that there would be no 
forced furloughs the government had faced the prospect of a 
shutdown of nonessential services today without an agreement 
the budget crisis worsened late last week when the house 
rejected a bipartisan plan that called for 134 billion in tax 
increases and a wide array of military and program spending cuts 
increases in medicare fees were rolled back slightly and an 
alternative plan has been approved 
democrats have complained the budget plans have been unfairly 
weighted against the middle income taxpayers to the benfit of 
wealthier americans bushs remarks indicated that the final tax 
package is still in negotiation 
raising income tax rates would be contrary to bushs oftstated 
pledge during the 1988 presidential campaign not to raise taxes 
there were minimal disruptions in services during the long 
columbus day weekend tourist attractions such as the washington 
monument and smithsonian institutioin were shut for three days but 
the full brunt of a shutdown did not occur

the supreme court today turned away a 
multibillion dollar dispute over natural gas costs 
the court without comment refused to reinstate a federal 
regulation to ease a burden on pipeline companies the regulation 
dated to an over supply of gas in the early 1980s 
the pipeline companies often signed contracts in the late 1970s 
and early 80s that required them to buy quantities of gas from 
producers at a specified price the pipelines were required to pay 
for the gas even if they couldnt sell it 
the socalled takeorpay agreements were signed when the price 
of gas was higher than it is today natural gas supplies began to 
exceed demand by 1982 because of warm winters a recession and 
customers switching to alternate fuels 
as a result the pipeline companies were left with billions of 
dollars in costs for unwanted gas 
the federal energy regulatory commission adopted a plan in 1987 
to help the pipelines cope allowing the companies to charge 
customers part of the cost 
the surcharge is based on a comparison of the amount of gas 
customers bought in 1982 and the reduced amounts they purchased 
from 1983 to 1986 
the more they bought in 1982 and the less purchased from them in 
the ensuing years the greater the pipeline companies share of the 
takeorpay burden 
the us circuit court of appeals here threw out the plan in 
december saying the charges to pipeline customers amounted to a 
retroactive change in rates without advance warning 
indeed the commission now even forces past customers who no 
longer purchase any gas from the pipelines to pay their share of 
the takeorpay liability the appeals court said 
conversely the appeals court said current customers who didnt 
buy gas from a pipeline until after 1986 would not have to pay any 
part of the liability 
the appeals court which reviewed the problem in a case 
involving tennessee gas pipeline co sent the case back to the 
commission for another solution 
gas customers in mississippi louisiana tennessee kentucky and 
ohio who could face higher gas rates because of the appeals court 
ruling joined the bush administration and tennessee pipeline in 
urging the supreme court to step in 
other gas customers urged the high court not to disturb the 
appeals court ruling saying ferc exceeded its authority in 
ordering them to shoulder costs retroactively 
the cases are the berkshire gas co vs associated gas 
distributors 891988 tennessee small general service customer 
group vs agd 891989 tennessee gas pipeline co vs agd 
891990 national fuel gas supply corp vs agd 892000 federal 
energy regulatory commission vs agd 892016

the parents of an emotionally disturbed texas 
boy allegedly beaten by his school principal lost a supreme court 
appeal today 
the court over one dissenting vote let stand a ruling that the 
childs constitutional rights were not violated 
only justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case 
four votes are needed to grant such review 
tracy fee was 12 and attending a class for emotionally troubled 
youngsters at a dickinson texas school when the incident occurred 
in 1985 
his parents ronald and nancy fee said school principal joseph 
herndon brutally beat the boy when he refused to submit to being 
paddled three times for misbehaving in class 
the fees said herndon punched tracy on the jaw and held him down 
on the floor and hit him numerous times on the buttocks with a 
paddle they also accused herndon of grabbing tracy by the neck and 
throwing him back into a chair so that the childs head snapped 
back and hit the wall 
herndon and a teacher who was present said the principal paddled 
the boy three times on the buttocks but did no more school 
officials said any injuries tracy suffered were caused by his 
thrashing about on the floor of the principals office as he sought 
to avoid the paddling 
the school officials also noted mrs fee previously had 
authorized herndon to administer three paddle swats to tracy if he 
misbehaved 
the fees said their son was hospitalized for six months in a 
psychiatric ward because of the beating and said they spent 
90000 for medical care they said he has not fully recovered 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled in may that the fees 
are not entitled to sue in federal court alleging their sons 
constitutional dueprocess rights were violated 
it noted texas law forbids use of excessive force against school 
children 
we find no constitutional warrant to usurp classroom 
discipline where states like texas have taken affirmative steps 
to protect their students from overzealous disciplinarians the 
appeals court said 
the case is fee vs herndon 90249

shuttle cameras shepherd has had trouble getting it to recognize 
his voice but he finally met with success today after retraining 
the system 
at kennedy space center in florida nasa began moving the 
shuttle columbia off a launch pad and back to the assembly building 
today because of bad weather expected from tropical storm klaus 
both columbia and atlantis will remain in the assembly building 
until the storm passes nasa officials said 
mission control awakened the crew shortly before 2 am edt 
today with the songs fanfare for the common man a favorite of 
cabanas and the fight song for the university of missouri 
richards alma mater 
after the brief serenade the crew quietly went about their 
morning tasks aboard the shuttle 
their primary goal was accomplished saturday with the successful 
deployment of the ulysses sun probe the 250 million european 
probe continued to speed through space on its roundabout trip to 
the sun 
it is headed towards jupiter so it can use that giant planets 
gravity to sling it back through the solar system and into a polar 
orbit around the sun ulysses is expected to pass over the suns 
south pole in 1994 and the north pole in 1995 
before the crew went to bed monday mission controls kathy 
thornton told them ulysses still was doing great no changes 
the smooth flight has delighted nasa officials who have been 
plagued by a number of problems in recent months 
flight director ron dittemore described the mission monday as 
one of the cleanest shuttle flights ever 
the greatest pleasure comes when you work a flight and 
everything goes perfectly nominal dittemore said hopefully 
were getting better every time we go 
the astronauts spent much of monday working on experiments but 
they took time out to sing happy birthday to mission specialist 
tom akers wife kaye who turned 34 
they floated in front of a shuttle tv camera as they sang mrs 
akers and other crew members relatives saw the tape monday 
afternoon at mission control 
after viewing the tape and another one showing the astronauts 
eating dinner and relaxing at the end of their work day the

ceremony at the united nations that featured the exbeatles widow 
yoko ono marcela perez de cuellar wife of the un secretary 
general also provided a brief introduction a recorded message 
from the slain beatle was played as well 
in celebration of johns life lets use our power of 
dreaming ono said lets dream of trees growing in abundance 
birds flying in clear air fish swimming in clear water and our 
children living in joy 
lets dream of men and women feeling good together and people 
embracing each other regardless of their creed and religion she 
said lets dream of all races praising one another in the 
knowledge that the differences are what makes the human race 
the un trusteeship council chamber was about onethird full 
with a couple of hundred people for the observance and about 150 
people watched on television monitors in the visitors lobby a 
group of 10 teenagers in blue jeans and tshirts sat on the floor 
held hands and meditated 
more than 1000 radio stations and networks from 50 countries 
had signed on for the satellite broadcast by last week us armed 
forces television and radio beamed the event to 80plus countries 
mtv was to broadcast the program in 25 countries said network

and peace said ondrej konrad the editor of czechoslovakias 
leading popular music publication 
jeff pollack head of the californiabased pollack media group

recent events around the world in germany eastern europe and 
particularly the middle east show the importance of lennons 
peace message 
when this was discussed we had no knowledge of what would 
happen in iraq and kuwait you know and now it seems very 
appropriate that this be sung all over the world ono said 
i dont know the timing is incredible its beyond me 
its beautiful 
imagine is lennons musical vision of a world free of war 
and poverty lennon was born oct 9 1940 and helped lead the 
beatles to international stardom along with comembers paul 
mccartney george harrison and ringo starr

whether the rights of a hispanic man were violated when he was 
convicted of attempted murder by a jury from which hispanics had 
been excluded

in 1986 of trying to kill his girlfriend and her mother in a 
shooting outside a brooklyn restaurant two restaurant patrons also 
were wounded

or automatic challenges to bar hispanics saying there was 
uncertainty whether they could accept the interpreter as the 
final arbiter of what was said by each witness 
the new york court of appeals the states highest court said 
hernandez was not the victim of unlawful racial bias because the 
prosecutor made his decision on a nondiscriminatory basis

prosecutors may not exclude blacks from juries unless the 
prosecutors can prove they acted for reasons that are racially 
neutral

adrian kronauer in the navy chief petty officer who started the 
first live armed forces broadcasts in saudi arabia today 
its 905 am tuesday oct 9 goooood maaaaawrning saudi 
arabia bellowed disk jockey rich yanku echoing the famous 
character played by comedian robin williams in the movie about 
armed forces radio in vietnam 
we really didnt want to do a goooood maaaawrning saudi 
arabia but it probably would be anticlimactic if we didnt 
said navy lt arnie pon a bronx native who heads the unit making 
the live broadcasts from an air base in saudi arabia 
the first song on desert shield network fm 107 brought the 
troops a little closer to home the clashs rock the casbah 
about a fight over boogie sound in a traditional middle eastern 
city 
lt col david macnamee commanding officer of armed forces 
radio and television in saudi arabia said the kingdoms government 
put some restrictions on broadcast content television broadcasts 
are under negotiation 
he would not detail the restrictions but he said they were 
basically common sense guidelines about what might offend listeners 
in a traditional moslem society that bars alcohol and the mixing of 
men and women in public 
besides yanku of albany ny the disc jockeys include two air 
force staff sergeants harry lockley 25 of new castle pa and 
john haynes 27 of albany ny the fourth is army spec brooke 
perkins 35 who was previously based in west germany 
the general format is mostly rock n roll or country music from 
their 8800 compact discs interspersed with news sports and public 
service messages they range from pep talks on saudi arabian 
customs to the dangers of snake bites in the desert 
the newscast carried at the top of the hour is the ap network 
news 
the radio is on the air 24 hours a day with a feed from the 
broadcast center in sun valley calif when the team in saudi 
arabia is not working 
they named their two trailers camp schmooz because pon was 
always accusing them of schmoozing yiddish slang for standing 
around gossiping 
the armed forces has 12 transmitters set up in saudi arabia 
three have a reach of over 30 miles but the rest just reach three 
or four miles 
about 80 percent of the estimated 200000 troops deployed in 
saudi arabia should be able to hear it if they have radios 
more transmitters are due in along with 30000 radios for the 
troops several thousand radios have been distributed so far 
the radio takes requests from the troops 
the first request from a soldier came from a woman named kim 
dedicating bruce springsteens born in the usa to her fellow 
troops

people sending mail to the newly united 
germany need to use care to avoid confusion in the addresses the 
us postal service reports 
the problem arises because similar systems of postal codes were 
used in the former east and west germanys 
until a new system can be developed the codes for locations 
formerly in west germany should be preceded by the letter w for 
west and for those formerly in east germany by the letter o ost 
is the german word for east 
for example addresses might include the line w5300 bonn or 
o7010 leipzig 
in either case the country name to use is federal republic of

so i think tha need a little time to calm 
things down cool things off and lets try to go forward i think 
its my responst but also youibility to say look its not easy all 
of us 
have had to compromise now lets move the country forward to what 
really everybody wants and that is getting these deficits under 
control yeah 
q mr president getting back to the lack of support from 
republicans tomorrow youre going to be campaigning in north 
carolina for senator jesse helms who was one of your opponents on 
the budget what is your message to the voters vote blindly 
republican or vote for legislators who support your policies 
a if we had more people on fiscal policy like jesse helms and 
by that i mean control of the senate we wouldnt be in this mess 
people would have been doing it more the way i want it done so i 
cant confiport but i guess i 
learned that i cant do it exactly my way when we get down on 
something like the deficit i do think internationally the support 
is still very very strong 
so when you get into somebodys pocketbook or you get worrying 
about a tax or a spending cut that affects someone ive learned 
that its just not going to be done the way i want it especially 
if you dont control the senate or you dont control the house so 
i cant worry too much about it i just have to try to get this 
process moved forward and thats what weve done ive had to 
compromise but i think it will come it out all right yeah 
q if i might i wonder if you think though that youre paying 
the price now in asking the american people to sacrifice and 
having them rebuff it the way it happened paying the price for 
all these years in the reaganbush administration that you sold 
supplyside economics 
a no i dont think so i think that when you see democratic 
votes against the leadership were talking about something a 
little shorterterm here i think youre looking at something that 
when people have analyzed a package and dont like parts of it 
because theyre still saying hey we like we want you to vote 
for the overall package so the problem comes from some specific 
part of the package thats the way i analyze it yeah john

president bush signed emergency legislation 
today restoring business as usual for the federal government and 
said he was willing to raise income tax rates on wealthy americans 
if a final budget included his longsought cut in the capital gains 
tax 
bush said he would do everything in my power to see that 
congress follows up in the next few days with a fiveyear plan to 
cut the deficit by 500 billion 
federal workers breathed a collective sigh of relief that there 
would be no forced furloughs the government closed over the 
holiday weekend due to the budget impasse had faced the prospect 
of a shutdown of nonessential services today without an agreement 
the president met with reporters as lawmakers exhausted after a 
string of latenight sessions were returning to the work of 
deciding precisely which spending programs to cut and whose taxes 
to raise 
under mondays latenight agreement between the white house and 
congress that work must be completed by oct 19 or the 
government faces the risk of yet another shutdown in services 
the budget crisis erupted last week when the house rejected a 
bipartisan plan that called for 134 billion in tax increases and a 
wide array of military and program spending cuts increases in 
medicare fees were rolled back slightly and an alternative plan has 
been approved although it contains fewer specifics than the one 
that was rejected 
democrats have complained the budget plans have been unfairly 
weighted against the middle income taxpayers to the benfit of 
wealthier americans and bushs remarks indicated that the final 
tax package is still in negotiation one subject the bubble by 
which some taxpayers pay a 33 percent rate rather than the 28 
percent rate applied to the wealthiest taxpayers 
asked about the possibility of raising tax rates on the wealthy 
bush said thats on the table thats been talked about and if 
its proper if it can be worked in proper balance between the 
capital gains rate and income tax changes fine 
it was the first time bush has state explicitly he could go 
along with a hike in income tax rates his opposition to changing 
the rate structure had been the last remnant of another campaign 
pledge no new taxes 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he was 
heartened by bushs statement 
i have personally advocated an increased tax rate on those 
making more than 200000 a year for some time he said and 
im pleased that the president has now come around or apparently 
come around to our point of view and to recognize the fairness o 
fsuch a change 
the action is in the congress but well work with them on 
filling in the gaping blanks in the deficitcutting agreement bush 
said i will do everything in my power to encourage congress as it 
struggles to bring forth the most comprehensive and signficiant 
deficit cutting plan ever 
the president took pains to defend his top aides for their help 
in the budget confrontation with congress white house chief of 
staff john sununu and budget director richard darman have come in 
for criticism from republicans and democrats who accuse them of 
highhanded tactics 
when passions get high theres bound to be a little broken 
china bush said they did an outstanding job he said of his 
negotiators dismissing critical comments from squeaky wheels 
on capitol hill 
bush signed the emergency spending legislation shortly after 7 
am 
the house gave final congressional approval to the emergency 
funding legislation on a 3623 vote at 145 am the senate passed 
it on a voice vote the longterm deficit reduction plan was passed 
monday 250164 by the house and ratified by the senate early this 
morning on 6633 vote 
senate budget committee chairman jim sasser dtenn said today 
that our task now is to enforce the budget resolution that was 
passed 
its going to be tough and its going to be hard to vote 
for said senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
next week will be very intense said house majority leader 
richard gephardt dmo 
by his comments on taxes bush signalled a willingness to 
compromise on one of the most fiercely fought issues in the budget 
confrontation 
the president has been seeking a cut in the capital gains tax 
since before his election in 1988 democrats in congress have 
blocked his effort last year and have said that any cut must be 
accompanied by an increase in tax rates on the wealthy 
capital gains come from money made from the sale of stocks real 
estate and other assets 
democrats meantime targeted for elimination a quirk in the 
federal tax system where the marginal tax rate goes as high as 33 
percent for uppermiddleincome but then drops back to 28 percent 
at hiher incomes the pattern has become known as the bubble 
with congress and the white house looking for ways to raise 
revenue to reduce the federal deficit talk of trading the 
bubble for capital gains has increased bush said he would be 
willing to negotiate the bubble at some level sure 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said monday he expected 
such a proposal to be made as congress considers legislation 
enacting its five year 500 billion deficit reduction plan 
even if both sides agree a trade can be made there could be 
tough battles over just how much to cut the capital gains rate and 
raise the income tax rate 
bushs decision to sign the emergency spending bill marked a 
pause in several days of confrontation with congress 
the house on friday rejected a compromise package bush had 
pitched on television legislators in both parties objected to 
proposals such as a 12cent increase in gasoline taxes and higher 
medicare deductibles and fees 
the president then vetoed an attempt by congress to keep the 
government open while the plan was revised as a result sites such 
as the washington monument the statue of liberty yosemite and 
other weekend government services were stopped 
the longterm budget plan is a broad outline of taxes and 
spending restraints that are similar in scope but without the 
detail of the budget pact between bush and congressional leaders 
the house killed last week 
but the outline is a document that is supposed to provide the 
shape of legislation to follow imposing specific taxes and spending 
restraints that includes things items as alcohol taxes increased 
medicare premiums and cuts in farm subsidies that are seen as 
needed to produce the mandated savings including 40 billion in 
the current fiscal year 
the emergency spending bill also included a temporary increase 
in the national debt to 3195 trillion needed to prevent a 
default by the treasury 
the three house members voting against the legislation today 
were william dannemeyer rcalif philip crane rill and pat 
williams dmont

when ben jones left his acting career for 
politics two years ago he quickly became a darling of the 
democrats in congress 
now the folksy house freshman who played cooter on tvs dukes 
of hazzard is in a fight for his political life 
the georgia democrat is up against veteran state rep john 
linder in a race the national gop has placed on its top 10 hit 
list linder a wealthy businessman portrays his campaign as a 
fight against a liberal just a little left of michael dukakis 
jones casts himself as a mainstream congressman who votes his 
conscience he supports abortion rights environmental issues and 
gun control legislation 
his celebrity status makes him a popular attraction at the 
fundraisers of fellow democrats and he has won praise for speaking 
out on tough issues for example he was a vocal opponent of a 
proposed ban on flag burning 
house speaker thomas foley dwash calls jones probably the 
most highly regarded freshman house member 
jones takes the positions he thinks are right foley said at 
a fundraiser in august he doesnt go out and take a poll first 
if it feels right to him he takes that position come hell or 
high water 
this years campaign is a far cry from 1988 when jones ousted 
republican rep pat swindall in what was one of the dirtiest 
campaigns in the nation 
swindall who was indicted for perjury 22 days before the 
election characterized jones as an alcoholic wifebeater jones 
admitted to wild behavior and a misdemeanor assault conviction 
for shoving his wife in a bar but said his drinking problems were 
behind him 
in this years contest the two candidates have clashed mainly 
on patriotism 
jones led the controversial effort last summer to defeat an 
constitutional 
amendment that would prohibit flag burning saying it would be 
overreacting to a handful of malcontents 
linder went on the offensive announcing he supported the 
amendment and criticizing jones call for display of american flags 
in support of us troops in the middle east as hypocritical 
jones retaliated by saying that linder didnt support veterans 
in the legislature and skippe meetings of the defense and veterans 
affairs committees 
linder emphasizes the two years he served in the air force as a 
dentist and notes his brother is serving in saudi arabia and he 
says the media made more out of the flagburning issue that he did 
the one thing voters hate worse than a flag burner is someone 
who wraps themselves in the flag linder said do i question 
his patriotism thats a bunch of bull but it does come up when i 
address veterans groups 
its just one of a series of issues we think definitely place 
him a little to the left of michael dukakis said linder 
linder also is focusing on the tax issue blaming democrats for 
stalling the budget while pushing the country to the brink of 
sweeping grammrudman cuts 
he says the way to solve the budget crisis is to cut spending on 
such programs such as farm subsidies the national endowment for 
the arts and large staffs and franking for congressmen 
ive been a businessman for a long time when businesses get 
into trouble with declining revenues they cut overhead they lay 
off people give others early retirement linder said they 
dont go to their neighbors and say give us more money 
both candidates support a reduction in the capital gains tax 
linder has been busy canvassing neighborhoods in the districts 
east atlanta suburbs the district is one of the most highly 
educated and culturally sophisticated in the south but it has no 
clear political party preference 
jones has been in the district as often as four days a week 
since his election he impresses constituents by taking notes while 
they talk to him 
i married into a police family and i heard a lot about 
oldtime policing where the community knows you and you know 
them jones told a group of law enforcement officers i try to 
take that kind of oldfashioned attitude with me wherever i go 
even in the halls of congress if you know somebody you can talk 
to them

q so you say youve learned that you just cant have things the 
way you want it on the budget but earlier this year you raised 
the stakes when you said the budget crisis would be the biggest 
test domestically of your presidency so far have you failed the 
test given that fiasco of the 
a give me a couple weeks here i want to see if we cant get 
this deal through 
q well do you think 
a i thought we did pretty well when we got an agreement with 
the republican leadership and the house leadership democrat and 
republican to me thats getting something done now we couldnt 
get it through the congress yet so well try again so i think the 
jurys still out on that john 
q do you suddenly feel politically a bit more vulnerable now 
the democrats smell blood theyre looking to 92 now george bush 
has slipped what do you think 
a well without referring to the polls that i dont like to 
refer to have them take a look yeah ann 
q considering the movement to limit terms in congress that has 
been spreading around the country would you support it either 
because of your current problems with congress or because of the 
philosophy of term limitations 
a no that was in the republican platform so i may go go 
public on that im certainly not opposed to it and so it was i 
havent decided exactly but i think theres people want a change 
against the incumbents up there on the hill and i think that you 
saw what happened in oklahoma 
i dont know whats going to happen theres two of those state 
what do they call them on the ballot in yeah referendums 
on the ballot in california both of them are different slightly 
in terms of how they are put into effect but i expect they have a 
good chance and as i say we are committed on our platform to some 
limitation but whether i make that a a prime mover in the 
political campaign that lies ahead in the next few weeks i dont 
know but i will remind people thats in there 
q mr president 
a yes 
q can we clarify something that we talked about earlier many 
of the lawmakers say that the repudiation of the budget packet 
reflects the fact that people feel that economic policy in this 
country over the last 10 years was fundamentally unfair that it 
redistributed income too much to the wealthy and too little to the 
poor do you think that that is part of the reason that yor 
package was rejected 
a it might have been part of the reason but i dont think the 
entire reason because i dont think thats why republicans 
rejected it at all 
q could you also clarify your statement on the bubble you said 
that it was talked about is that one of your positions that 
you would support 
a at some level 
q the top rate 
a sure at some level 
q what rate would you 
a well as ive told you im not going to try to negotiate it 
here i want to get something done in these committees so what 
weve got to do is get with the senate leaders house leaders on 
finance and ways and means and see if we can reach a formula i 
dont think it would be helpful to draw a line in the sand on what 
percentage of the exclusion of capital gains and then what on the 
what wed give in terms of the leveling out the bubble or getting 
rid of the bubble 
yes maureen and then charles and then jim 
q mr president during the campaign when you took the 
position that you absolutely positively would not raise taxes 
under any circumstance and then a lot of your fellow republicans 
as you know were encouraged to follow suit by taking this antitax 
pledge do you think that that now is part of the reason 
a yes 
q that youre having so much trouble 
a i think that makes it more difficult for people 
q do you regret that you took that position 
a no because what i do is take a look at at the situation at 
the time see the changed economics and say ive got to got to 
you know go forward here 
q except that the deficit was very large then also

a well i know but i thought we could get into effect the 
program that i ran on i we ran up against a lot of democratic 
opposition sent a budget up that didnt gain the support we wanted 
and have done that twice so but i think you raise a good point i 
think and some have told me that when i was talking to them yeah 
charles 
q mr president a question about the process the budget now 
being back in the hands of the congressional committees where it 
was envisioned in the first place do you have second thoughts 
about all this summitry that led up to this situation 
a no i dont because what we did is to get a deal that i think 
has support from the american people overall and weve gotten out 
a lot of the underbrush weve moved out a lot of the debate and 
moved it into a package that was supported by the president by the 
republican and leader in the house and the senate and by the 
democratic leaders in the house and the senate 
so i think its i think weve made some progress even though 
obviously it didnt get through either house but now were going 
to have to keep working this week and some of the members who 
would like to do it exactly his or her way are going to see that it 
doesnt work quite that way so i dont think its been time wasted 
at all 
q well how badly does it undercut you politically in terms of 
some of the antagonism between your staff your budget director 
your chief of staff people on the hill and within the republican 
party 
a i dont i dont worry about that at all i really dont i 
have been campaigning for and will continue to campaign for people 
that might agree with me on this or might disagree with me on this 
and we have broad principles that unite us and when people get 
tired and stay up till three oclock in the morning every morning 
why theres bound to be tensions calm them calm it down and try 
to go forward thats my approach to it jim 
q mr president yesterday israeli forces used live ammunition 
to put down a demonstration in israel killing 19 palestinians 
today saddam hussein is using that incident in an attempt to rally 
arab support against israel and especially against the united 
states in the region do you think this incident could create a 
crack in the alliance against iraq and whats your reaction to the 
incident 
a well i dont think it could do that but look let me just 
express my strong feelings about this first my sorrow at this 
tragedy 
it is particularly saddening given the sanctity of the holy 
places and observances there that violence shattered all of this 
and i want to echo what jim baker said earlier that israeli 
security forces need to be better prepared for such situations 
need to act with greater restraint particularly when it comes to 
the use of deadly force and at this point what is needed most of 
all is calm on all sides 
let me i dot think i need to say this but let me just 
state that we want to see the longstanding policy of maintaining 
open access to the holy places preserved tempered only by mutual 
respect for people of other faiths and so i am very very saddened 
by this needless loss of life and i would call on all for 
restraint the action will shift to the united nations now 
to your other part of the question jim theres no relationship 
here saddam hussein is trying to from the very beginning justify 
the illegal invasion of kuwait by trying to tie it in to the 
palestine question and that is not working the arab world is 
united almost united against him and i dont think if he tries 
now to use this unfortunate incident to link the two questions i 
dont think that will be successful and certainly i will be doing 
what i can to see that it is not successful 
having said that i hope nobody questions our interest in seeing 
a solution to the palestine question to the implementation of the 
security council resolutions and thats what jim baker has been 
working so hard on for such a long time but lets separate out 
this violence and say we deplore it and it must not happen and 
regret it the loss of life for everybody

the supreme court today left intact a ruling 
that says public schools that allow civic groups and others to rent 
school space cant refuse such access to religious organizations 
the justices without comment rejected the appeal of a 
pennsylvania high school forced to rent weekend use of its 
auditorium to the campus crusade for christ 
the action was announced the day david h souter became 
historys 105th justice but he did not participate in the case 
souter was sworn in a brief courtroom ceremony before all nine 
justices took the bench to issue orders in new cases and hear 
arguments in cases to be decided by july 
in another case involving religion the court rejected an appeal 
by a small fundamentalist church in evanston ill that blamed its 
trouble finding a permanent home on a local zoning ordinance 
the court without comment refused to revive love churchs 
challenge to the city ordinance 
in a third case the court turned down the appeal of a seattle 
church that says king county should have to pay it for blocking the 
use of churchowned land it left intact a washington supreme court 
ruling that a lawsuit filed against the county by the presbytery of 
seattle was premature 
in other cases the court 
let stand a ruling that the constitutional rights of an 
emotionally disturbed texas boy allegedly beaten by his school 
principal were not violated 
ronald and nancy fee said joseph herndon brutally beat their 
12yearold son when he refused to submit to being paddled three 
times for misbehaving in class herndon and a teacher who was 
present said the boy was paddled three times on the buttocks and 
that injuries he suffered were caused by his thrashing about on the 
floor as he sought to avoid the paddling 
revived a 4 billion lawsuit by a millionaire inventor arthur 
jones who says abctvs 2020 program falsely portrayed him as 
a liar and hypocrite 
the justices told a federal appeals court to restudy the libel 
suit filed after a 1987 report on the fate of 63 baby elephants 
jones rescued from death in africa jones invented the nautilus 
exercise machines 
the justices said the case should be reconsidered in light of 
their june ruling that the constitutions guarantee of free speech 
did not create a wholesale defamation exemption for anything that 
might be labeled opinion 
agreed to decide in a florida case whether police may conduct 
random drug searches aboard buses and trains after passengers have 
consented florida officials say the searches are necessary because 
the state is a pipeline for drugs 
in the pennsylvania case involving the use of public school 
facilities by religious group the state court upheld the dismissal 
of the suit it said the church failed to exhaust its 
administrative remedies because it never even applied for a 
building permit 
in june the high court upheld the federal equal access act in 
which congress required that virtually all public high schools must 
allow student prayer groups to meet and worship if other student 
clubs are permitted at school 
the court said then the law doesnt violate the constitutionally 
required separation of church and state but the federal law 
applies only to student groups not to outside organizations 
seeking sue of school facilities 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals relied on the first 
amendment when it ruled last summer that centennial pa school 
officials violated the freespeech rights of student venture a 
subsidiary of the campus crusade for christ 
the officials refused to rent space for a william tennent high 
school program aimed at religious conversion 
by a 21 vote the appeals court said the school district had 
created an open public forum by renting space to among others 
the local rotary and kiwanis clubs an adult education program and 
two labor unions 
the appeals court said religious groups could not be excluded 
from such an open forum because of their message 
the school districts lawyers said schools nationwide let 
various community groups use school property when classes are in 
session and that the appeals court ruling means such use has 
converted most american public school facilities into open public 
forums to which even the most fractious religious and political 
speakers must be routinely allowed access 
the three cases involving religion were centennial school 
district vs gregoire 90304 love church vs evanston 90296 
and presbytery of seattle vs king county 90298

peace activist abie nathan went on trial 
tuesday on charges he met twice this year with plo leader yasser 
arafat in violation of israels antiterrorism law 
nathan was convicted last year for a 1988 meeting with arafat 
and served four months of a sixmonth prison sentence before he was 
released for good behavior 
nathan acknowledged in ramles magistrates court tuesday that he 
met the palestine liberation organization leader twice in march in 
tunisia but he pleaded innocent maintaining the law under which 
he was charged was unjust 
israel considers the plo to be a terrorist organization and a 
1986 amendment to israels antiterror law makes meetings with plo 
leaers punishable by jail terms of up to three years 
court officials said nathan faces up to seven years in jail 
three for each alleged violation and an additional year that was 
suspended in the earlier case 
nathan told reporters after the session that he was ready to 
return to jail 
i am prepared to give my whole life for peace nathan said 
i will continue to fight against this unjust law because it is a 
law you cannot accept 
nathan 64 first met arafat in 1982 when he went to lebanon 
during the israeli siege of beirut in an unsuccessful attempt to 
gain freedom for a captured israeli soldier he has met him eight 
times since 
he is best known for making a dramatic trip in a private plane 
to cairo in 1966 to try to convince egypt to make peace with 
israel his pirate radio station the voice of peace operates from 
a ship in the mediterranean sea

q also a follow please saddam hussein also indicated today 
that the iraqis have a new sort of missile that can reach into 
israel and reach the us troops and hes threatening to use that 
force 
a i noticed that and i notice hes getting a little more 
bellicose once in a while you see a conciliatory statement and 
then you hear a lot of heightened rhetoric about what he is going 
to do and what hes not going to do now im satisfied that we can 
defend our interests now and i am satisfied that that these 
threats of his are counterproductive in terms of solving any 
peaceful resolution of the question they dont help a thing they 
just polarize 
so you dont want to overreact to it i keep reading statements 
like this ever since this illegal annexation illegal aggression 
took place theres no not too good a pattern we watch it very 
carefully and its pretty hard to detect a pattern now theres a 
theme and that is trying to link the palestine question into his 
kind of giving justification for what he did against kuwait and 
yet the logic falls totally flat yes frank 
q mr president on that subject you said the action now 
shifts on this one to the united nations having just been to the 
united nations and talked about its increased relevance and role 
how far are you prepared to go as far as the united states is 
concerned in meeting some of the arab efforts to partially condemn 
israels action and pass a resolution that 
a well i think it all depends what the resolution is and so 
thats just starting up there now and were not sure exactly what 
direction it all will take so id want to stop short of saying 
exactly what i could you know what the us government could 
support or what it couldnt support 
q if i may sir on a related topic when the emir of kuwait was 
here you expressed grave concern about the dismantling of kuwait 
a yes i did 
q your advisers said that that could affect the timetable for 
permitting sanctions to work what is your feeling on that now is 
the dismantling 
a i thought general scowcroft put it very well after the emir 
left here and i am very much concerned not just about this 
physical dismantling but of the brutality that has now been 
written on by amnesty international confirming some of the tales 
told us by the emir of brutality and oh its just unbelievable 
some of the things at least he reflected i mean people on a 
dialysis machine cut off the machine sent to baghdad people in 
babies in incubators heaved out of the incubators and the 
incubators themselves sent to baghdad 
now i dont know how many of these tales can be authenticated 
but i do know that when the emir was here he was speaking from the 
heart and after that came the amnesty international who were 
debriefing many of the people at the border and its sickening 
and so i if your question was how long i cant give you an 
answer in days or months but it is a matter that its a new 
equation in the last three weeks the systematic dismantling of 
kuwait that concerns us enormously and i think the more people 
understand it the more saddam hussein will be condemned but i 
have to stop short of telling you what that where that leads me 
to in terms of recommending action by the allied forces there 
q it does sound like your patience is wearing thin on the 
sanctions 
a its wearing very thin on that account yes 
q mr president a couple of minutes ago you said that public 
opinion seemed to support your handling of foreign affairs better 
than domestic affairs why do you think that youre so much more 
comfortable with and better at foreign matters than domestic to 
some people it seems like almost two presidents 
a well ive read that sophisticated analysis and im 
troubled because i dont the i dont really know the answer to 
it perhaps it has to do with the fact that in one i think the 
vandenburg theory applies people really basically want to support 
the president on foreign affairs and partisanship does in a 
sense stop at the waters edge whereas on domestic policy here i 
am with democratic majorities in the senate and democratic 
majorities in the house having to try to persuade them to do what 
i think is best and its complicated

president saddam hussein said today iraq has developed a new 
missile with a range of several hundred miles such a weapon would 
allow iraq to strike deep into saudi arabia where tens of thousands 
of american troops are deployed 
the new missile is called the alhijara or stone apparently 
named to honor young palestinians in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip who are confronting the israelis with stones 
the killings of 19 palestinians by israeli police at the temple 
mount in jerusalem on monday brings israel closer to the abyss 
saddam said in a statement read by an announcer over staterun 
baghdad radio 
addressing israel he said the faithful palestinians faced up 
to you with stones which no power on earth can withhold from 
those who wish to use them 
it was not possible to obtain independent verification of 
saddams claim to have developed a new missile but don kerr a 
weapons analyst at londons international institute for strategic 
studies said such a claim would not be extraordinary 
iraq has had considerable success with surfacetosurface 
missiles mostly derivatives of the sovietmade scud kerr said 
by telephone 
iraqs alhussein missile has a range of 310370 miles and the 
alabbas missile a range of 500560 miles kerr said both carry 
conventional highexplosive warheads 
saddam who has linked a withdrawal from occupied kuwait with an 
israeli pillout from arab territory captured in 1967 appeared to 
seeking to exploit mondays violence in jerusalem to build support 
for his invasion of kuwait 
the palestinians along with many other arabs in jordan sudan 
yemen and algeria are among saddams staunchest supporters 
also today rock n roll music boomed out across the saudi 
desert when us armed forces radio began broadcasting live for the 
nearly 200000 us troops 
its 905 am tuesday oct 9 goooood maaaaawrning saudi 
arabia bellowed disk jockey rich yanku echoing the famous 
character played by comedian robin williams in the movie about 
armed forces radio in vietnam 
the navy meanwhile searched for eight marines whose two 
helicopters disappeared monday over the north arabian sea during a 
training exercise rescue teams have located debris from one of the 
aircraft but no bodies 
two american airmen who had volunteered for duty in the persian 
gulf crisis died in a jet crash monday in saudi arabia 
in other developments 
a study published this week said iraq should be able to survive 
the un trade embargo for at least another six months the report 
by the economist a financial magazine published in london said 
that since the west is not likely to wait that long a military 
strike against iraq seemed inevitable 
a us embassy official in baghdad said that a uschartered 
iraqi jetliner on wednesday will evacuate about 350 more americans 
and an unknown number of other foreigners from kuwait 
the killings at the temple mount set off a barrage of arab 
warnings and threats some israeli opponents said the incident 
which occurred when police fired on stonethrowers at a holy site 
demonstrated the link between the gulf crisis and the 
israelieoccupied lands 
the gulf crisis began after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 since 
then the iraqis have massed close to 500000 soldiers in kuwait 
the united states leads a multinational force that includes nearly 
200000 us soldiers deployed in saudi arabia and the region to 
deter any further aggression 
saddam described iraqs new missile in a statement monitored in 
nicosia 
alhijara became capable of reaching targets that are hundreds 
of kilometers miles from where it is launched the statement 
said 
they are the new missiles which iraq invented it said it 
is capable of reaching its targets from where it is launched and 
there are many alhijaras in iraq 
the statement did not give details on the number of missiles 
iraq possesses or what kind of warhead it can carry 
also today a spokesman for president mikhail s gorbachev said 
there was reason to be upbeat about prospects for a settlement to 
the persian gulf crisis following a visit to iraq by a soviet 
envoy 
presidential spokesman vitaly ignatenko expressed optimism for a 
settlement in the gulf crisis following fridays meeting between 
saddam and soviet envoy yevgeny primakov 
ignatenko would not give details in moscow but said gorbachev 
would inform president bush by letter of the latest soviet efforts 
i can only tell you that we are today more able to look more 
optimistically at the prospect of a political settlement in that 
region ignatenko said in moscow 
he said details would become known within one or two weeks 
saddam has suggested that if negotiations are held to solve the 
crisis that all regional conflicts including the palestinian 
uprising in israels occupied lands also be placed on the agenda 
in one of the military accidents monday an rf4c phantom 
reconnaisance jet crashed in the southern saudi arabian peninsula 
the jet belonged to a unit of the alabama air national guard on a 
training mission the guard said 
it identified the victims as maj barry k henderson 40 a 
senior pilot from tuscumbia ala and maj stephen g schramm 43 
a master navigator from birmingham ala 
both were assigned to the 106th tactical reconnaissance squadron 
of the 117th tactical reconnaissance wing and had volunteered for 
duty military officials said their unit had not been activated 
the marine helicopters vanished over the north arabian sea on 
monday while on a training mission and the search for them 
continued today

india quietly expelled four pakistani 
embassy personnel earlier this year for alleged spying a foreign 
ministry statement said tuesday 
the statement said pakistan was retaliating for the previously 
unanounced expulsion when it demanded monday that four indian 
officials be recalled from the consulate in karachi 
it said the pakistani press in obviously inspired reports 
suggested in advance that the expulsion of the indians was 
imminent and linked it to the expulsion is from 
the high commission in new delhi between march and august 
the statement confirmedof four pakistan these reports and said the 
four were 
asked to leave on account of their proven espionage activities in 
india 
india previously had not made the expulsions public 
it was done quietly one by one said a foreign ministry 
official he gave no explanation and said he did not have the 
names of the pakistani officials or whether they were diplomats 
the statement said the government categorically rejects 
allegations by pakistan that the indian consulate officials were 
engaged in security offenses 
the officials were told to leave the southern port city of 
karachi within 10 days 
pakistans action can hardly be calculated to restore 
confidence in relations between our two countries le program 
violates campaign finance laws the committee is allowed to donate 
17500 directly to senate candidates and may spend an additional 
amount on a candidates behalf the limit on the size of the latter 
contributions varies from state to state depending on population 
the common cause and dscc complaints allege the republicans are 
using the inner circle campaign to circumvent the limits by 
bundling contributions it raises from the directmail inner 
circle program and donating the money to certain gop senate 
candidates 
in its inner circle fundraising solicitation the nrsc says it 
will serve as a conduit and channel the money to republican senate 
candidates the nrsc contends these donations do apply against its 
contribution limits because the money never enters nrsc accounts 
the common cause complaint asserts that the nrsc is too loosely 
interpreting federal election laws it says the gop organization 
cannot claim to be simply a conduit because it selected or 
played a major role in selecting which campaigns would receive the 
proceeds 
common cause won an earlier lawsuit challenging a 1986 
bundling program run by the nrsc

voters in the heart of marlboro country 
will decide whether to make their state cigarette tax the highest 
in the nation to discourage smoking and fund antitobacco 
education 
both sides agree that the real goal of initiative 115 is to 
reduce even eliminate the use of tobacco in montana 
no question said dr robert m shepherd a helena physician 
who is treasurer and chief spokesman for the initiative i think 
that would do more for the health of the population here than 
anything else we could do 
jerome anderson a helena attorney and tobacco lobbyist 
complains the proposal on the nov 6 ballot would use taxes to 
establish social mores 
we feel this is not the intended use of taxation he said 
the initiative would raise montanas cigarette tax 140 percent 
from 18 cents a pack to 43 cents and double the tax on other 
tobacco products to 25 percent of the wholesale price it would 
take effect july 1 
texas currently has the highest state cigarette tax 41 cents a 
pack according to the tobacco institute in washington dc 
congress also is considering hiking cigarette taxes nationwide 
four cents in 1991 to 20 cents a pack and to 24 cents in 1993 to 
help balance the federal budget 
estimates on how much the proposed montana tax would produce 
range from 276 million to 34 million the initiative would 
assign 58 percent of that money to a new tobacco education and 
preventive healthcare fund the rest would go to longrange 
building accounts which are financed by the current tobacco tax 
backers of the initiative gathered 18351 signatures but have 
raised only about 20000 to campaign for it the american cancer 
society gave 9435 the american lung association donated 1500 
and the american heart association had kicked in 7500 in late 
september with the rest coming from small individual contributors 
the tobacco industry meanwhile has poured more than 600000 
into the state to defeat it about 2 for every likely vote that 
included contributions of 267000 from rj reynolds and 103000 
from philip morris 
the i115 sponsor the coalition for a healthy montana is 
depending mainly on news conferences and free publicservice 
announcements on radio and television to deliver its message 
the message is that smoking is the no 1 killer in the united 
states and its costing us a lot of money shepherd said 
smoking says shepherd is a major cause of cancer heart 
disease stroke emphysema bronchitis miscarriages and even house 
fires it will kill 1500 montanans this year and will cost the 
state 265 million or 330 for every montana resident he says 
anderson dismisses the health questions you can prove 
anything with statistics 
the real issue anderson argues is that a tax increase for any 
purpose is still a tax increase and he says the additional tax 
money would create a new bureaucracy with hundreds of new 
government workers a tobacco education and preventive healthcare 
fund in the state health department 
shepherd contends the higher tax would reduce consumption most 
notably among teenagers anderson says it would only drive many 
buyers to montanas seven indian reservations where cigarettes are 
exempt from state taxes

i mean i think thats part of it and well i dont want to 
get stretched out on the couch too far in terms of analysis now 
but you know when you get a problem with the complexities that 
one that the middle east has now and the gulf has now i enjoy 
trying to keep this put the coalition together and keep it 
together and work towards what i think is a proper end seeing that 
this aggression doesnt succeed 
im i cant say i just rejoice every time i go up and talk to 
danny rostenkowski my dear friend about what hes going to do on 
taxes i mean its just does that help you 
q not 
a thats about have you got a followup 
q it doesnt sound like you have as much fun as you do with the 
other 
a thats about right yeah yes ellen 
marlin fitzwater final question please 
q mr president you pulled out all the stops on this budget 
deal and it just flopped are you concerned sir that your 
leadership on other domestic issues now will be eroded since you 
didnt carry even half your own party in the house you talk about 
clean air you talk about crime are you worried that youre just 
going to the honeymoon is entirely over 
a no because i want to talk to speaker foley about this and 
leader mitchell because they pulled out all the stops and they 
didnt get the votes they needed and so i dont think they feel 
that they cant conduct their business in the house or in the 
senate and certainly i dont feel that i cant conduct my business 
here 
so i dont think there is erosion in fact you saw the house 
side come together in terms of a veto right quick like that and 
i think that thats you know theres a certain maturity there 
and we go on to the next event i mean and stay with it you 
cant cant stay there forever and mope about it so i dont no 
i dont worry about that 
q but in terms of the disdain up on the hill from both 
republicans and democrats for some members of your staff some of 
them in this room have you taken any of your staff to the 
woodshed sir 
a absolutely not i have full confidence in him and when the 
passions get high i understand that there is bound to be a little 
broken china up there but hey look if i got outraged every time 
i watched cspan and heard some outrageous democrat go after me 
and i sulked about it and i fretted about it and i called tom 
foley about it and said said why do you permit this and you 
know i i wouldnt be able to do anything so i dont worry about 
that 
and in terms of my team they did an outstanding job and i have 
had more members tell me that and so what you hear is the 
squeaking wheel you hear those that dont arent particularly 
happy maybe you didnt get it exactly their way and the news of 
course is man bites dog republican goes after republican so 
i dont i dont think weve got a problem at all weve got three 
bright people working hard to move this move my objectives forward 
and i think they happen to be the countrys objectives forward 
q who sir are these members of congress who are hailing the 
work of your team 
a plenty of them go talk to the leadership talk to bob 
michel talk to bob dole theyre the leaders theyre the key 
leaders of the congress you want to talk about a squeaking wheel 
from time to time and i want to talk about those that have a 
broader view of things yes 
q mr president 
a youve got two more one two and thats the second thats 
where we counted the votes on the deal go ahead 
q following on helens question do you think anyone on your 
staff or do you think that in general without naming names which 
i am certain you wont want to do in any case didnt the white 
house end of this handle anything wrong is it all 
a i probably made some mistakes and i thought frankly that we 
had a deal that would get support on the from a majority of the 
republicans and i tried very hard i made golly i cant remember 
how many phone calls and so i think there is you know if were 
trying to assign blame lay it right here

two diplomatic embarrassments this week both 
linked to party leaders jostling for power have strengthened the 
view that japans political fractiousness at home often prevents 
coherent policy abroad 
the incidents concerned negotiations with the soviet union and 
the two koreas highly sensitive affairs usually conducted by the 
foreign ministry 
in both cases however the talks were taken up independently by 
powerful politicians without official posts their missteps 
reinforced the criticism of japanese government as a mass of 
competing interests with no real center analysts say 
in addition the unofficial talks may have undermined the 
already weak stature of the prime ministers office the post is 
usually filled through a tenuous alliance between intraparty 
factions in the governing liberal democratic party 
its not easy to identify a sort of power center in the 
japanese system like you can in the united states said seiichiro 
takagi an international relations expert at saitama university 
perhaps the bestknown critic of this tendency of japanese 
government is dutch writer karl van wolferen whose opinions have 
stirred considerable controversy here 
the japanese prime minister has less real power than any head 
of government in the western world or in most countries of asia 
he wrote in his recent book the enigma of japanese power 
tokyo evades foreign questions concerning japans global 
political and economic intentions because there is no one with the 
authority to answer them 
in one incident this week lawmakers from the powerful party 
faction led by shintaro abe said soviet officials told them the 
soviet union might compromise on a territorial dispute that has 
kept the two nations from signing a world war ii peace treaty 
according to japanese news reports 
abe has been considered the heir apparent to prime minister 
toshiki kaifu who is a member of a weak liberal democratic party 
faction and is believed to have very shallow support within the 
party 
the foreign ministry cautiously welcomed the news monday later 
in moscow however the soviet foreign ministry denied it had made 
any such offer and denounced the report as disinformation 
it was an embarrassment both for abe and the government 
its a free country we cannot control what private 
individuals do foreign minister taizo watanabe said tuesday 
but he commented pointedly issues related to the soviet union 
should be conducted in governmenttogovernment negotiations 
in the second incident powerful liberal democrat shin kanemaru 
was forced to apologize to south korean president roh taewoo 
monday for beginning dialogue with north korea too quickly south 
korea the norths bitter rival said it was surprised by the move 
kanemaru a former deputy prime minister led a delegation of 
highlevel japanese governing and opposition party legislators who 
signed a declaration with north korea last month urging the two 
countries to start talks on normalizing relations 
kanemaru told roh the trip to the north had been organized by 
political parties not governments and he was sorry for creating 
misunderstanding and controversy 
analysts say unofficial emissaries often have been used by 
japans rigidly conservative government to test new policies if it 
works the policies can be taken up by the government if not the 
move can be repudiated as in abes case with the soviet union 
and kanemarus opening with north korea still has a good chance 
of working officials said 
its a kind of human trial balloon said robert orr 
director of the stanford japan center 
but some critics say such methods are unsuited to longterm 
foreignpolicy planning and prevent the possibility of reacting to 
events with a unified voice 
and too often they are carried out by politicians with far more 
experience in infighting than statesmanship 
japan can ill afford such mishaps as it gets pressed more and 
more into a global leadership role these critics say 
its just another indication of the weakness of the kaifu 
regime said orr 
there are people in the foreign ministry who are delighted 
with all this it undercuts the politicians and reinforces the 
reason why the bureaucracy should be in charge of foreign policy

the soviet parliament today ratified two 
ussoviet treaties from the 1970s that place tight limits on 
underground nuclear weapons testing by the superpowers 
the lawmakers voted 3470 with nine abstentions to approve the 
treaties and to appeal to world parliaments and social 
organizations to seek a global ban on nuclear testing 
in the same vote the parliament referred to its international 
and national security committees questions stemming from several 
reservations about the treaties which were also ratified last 
month by the us senate 
the treaties focus mainly on verification methods for arms 
control agreements and allow each country to maintain intrusive 
onsite monitoring equipment at three sites on each others soil 
us sen william cohen rmaine cautioned after the senate 
vote that the soviets could use their monitoring equipment for 
espionage and urged no inspections be allowed until security 
procedures were tightened 
supporters say the new verification measures are likely to 
become important precedents for more ambitious arms control 
treaties 
the treaties limit underground explosions to 150 kilotons or 
less they are a follow to the 1963 limited test ban treaty which 
barred nuclear tests in the atmosphere water and in space 
the latest treaties were not ratified at first because 
thenpresident carter wanted a more comprehensive test ban 
the reagan administration did not think that adequate means 
existed for verifying that the soviets were not cheating 
that issue was settled by the signing of a verification protocol 
in june in washington by president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev

here is a transcript of president bushs press 
conference tuesday in the white house press room 
president bush let me just go with an opening statement and 
then ill be glad to respond to questions first on the budget 
the committees of congress now take up the arduous task of 
implementing the budget resolution that they just passed weve 
been pulling and tugging at this framework agreement for nearly 
five months and its been difficult because that whole underlying 
problem is difficult 
and were trying to reduce the federal deficit by 500 billion 
over the next five years 40 billion of it in the first year and 
this would be the largest such cut in history so while its easy 
to get caught up in the maneuvers and the countermaneuvers of the 
legislative process i want to assure the american people this 
morning that i will do everything in my power to encourage congress 
as it struggles to bring forth the most comprehensive and 
significant deficitcutting plan ever 
this morning i outlined several conditions for a budget 
reconciliationbill as the committees of congress begin to fill in 
the blanks in determining how we raise the revenues and cut the 
spending we must be mindful not to let the hardwon goals of the 
budget resolution dissipate or lose direction 
the budget reconciliation bill due on october 12 must measure 
up to the savings congress has outlined without smoke and mirrors 
with growthoriented tax incentives with process reform with 
enforceability with bipartisan support and with passages of both 
houses by both houses of congress by october 19th 
these are the objectives that we fought for since the beginning 
of the long budget struggle but theyre worthy of our effort in 
any undertaking of this size there is bound to be anguish and i 
want to recognize the valiant federal work force that had to suffer 
through some uncertainty of this period on saturday morning i said 
we cannot have business as usual but the congress has finally 
acted and we are back on course and there can be no letup in our 
attention to detail and our commitment to purpose we must fulfill 
the requirements of the budget resolution now id be glad to take 
some questions 
q mr president 
a yeah terry 
q a week ago you asked americans to help get a budget passed 
and they gave you the back of the hand then despite a government 
shutdown congress still hasnt been able to produce a budget how 
can americans fail to have anything except grave questions about 
the your ability and that of congress to govern 
a well i think there probably are some questions i dont feel 
the american people gave the back of the hand to the budget 
agreement if you look at the surveys that were carried in the 
magazines and all of this they show that i think more people 
wanted the agreement than not so weve just got to do a better job 
of getting it through 
but listen i can understand the frustration i feel it myself 
at times and when you have a government with one party controlling 
the congress where the action is and where the action will remain 
now for a while and then you have a president of a different 
party nobody thought it would be easy and it isnt so i think 
there is some frustration but i notice that there was strong 
support for the package the problem was that you ask in individual 
categories of the package oh no we dont want this we dont 
want that we dont you know a lot of special interests but 
people seem to want the deal 
i think the deal though not keeping me happy in every way was 
a good one and i was proud to join with the republican and 
democratic leaders in supporting that original budget agreement 
now weve got some of the main ingredients of it broad instruction 
to these committees that were contained within the original 
agreement and lets see if the congress can get moving and come up 
with a deal that i can accept and well be working with them 
were not im not up here to assign blame yeah helen 
q mr president no matter what you say there was a lot of 
feeling in the country that the package was not fair are you 
willing to accept a higher tax rate for the wealthy perhaps in 
exchange for a capital gains cut but even so a higher tax rate

a i havent seen great sentiment for raising peoples income 
tax rates and im not for that now during the budget process 
and this was little noted there was discussion about getting 
capital gains for straightening out the bubble which means raising 
some rates we were quite openminded there was some negotiation 
so im not let me say this i thats on the table thats been 
talked about and if its proper if it can be worked in proper 
balance between the capital gains rate and income tax changes 
fine 
but i dont think its fruitful here to negotiate the details 
or try to what weve got to do is get up now with particularly 
ways and means and finance danny rostenkowski lloyd bentsen bill 
archer and bob packwood and discuss with them quietly what we 
can accept i want them to know it but i dont think i can stand 
here and kind of negotiate or mandate exactly what will happen 
q sir dont you think though the secrecy was an impediment 
it fell like a lead balloon the senior citizens in this country do 
not consider themselves a special interest theyre a quarter of 
the population 
a right 
q people who drive to work 50 miles every day or less 
certainly did consider it a hardship so had you not negotiated 
more in public more public dialogue more debate dont you think 
you would have been better off 
a well i dont know that any person who is opposed to raising 
gasoline taxes would have been more inclined to accept them if it 
had been more the negotiations between democrats and republicans 
on these committees had been done in public 
but i think now the positions are clear and what i want to do 
is see us go forward now i mean those are all out there now and 
so lets the committees know where the oppositions coming from 
but helen the basic problem is this nobody wants to do anything 
in terms of where theyre affected i mean they just dont want 
that and yet they want the deficit down and thats what makes it 
difficult and thats why i was very pleased to see the agreement 
everyone had to give a little bit but well go back now and see if 
we cant in that spirit get a deal by the 19th that i can sign 
yeah brit 
q mr president house republicans by the end of last week 
were being accused of behaving like democrats there seemed to be 
fairly deep divisions within their ranks you didnt carry you and 
the leaders did not carry a majority of house republicans on the 
budget deal what hope do you now have and what reason do you have 
for holding that hope that you can do that the next time on a 
program that will in effect be written by the democratic party 
a well i see that brit you only stated if i could i 
dont want to be argumentative but the democrats didnt have their 
troops behind them they didnt have what they needed to get it 
through so it isnt just the republicans i think the hope is that 
people see more clearly now that it isnt easy and as people go to 
go with their own alternatives now they find that they cant get 
the support 
so we may so i think what well end up doing is staying very 
close to the agreement that i reached with the republican and 
democratic leaders the last couple of few days have been like a 
catharsis theres been a clearing of the air people out 
heres what id do heres what id like to do and then they 
find well theres no votes to do exactly what theyd like to do 
so i think we just have to work the process now and hope that the 
congress will come up with a reasonable deal the action is in the 
congress i keep pointing out but well work with them yes 
q there seemed to be considerable bitter feeling among 
republicans towards some members of your team who felt they had 
been dealt with in a hamhanded or highhaned way has anything 
been done to patch this up sir and have you talked to members 
about that 
a well ive talked to the leaders our leaders dole and 
michel and others bill archer yesterday over the weekend al 
simpson and others but you know anytime you have a difficult 
road like this theres bound to be griping about it i have total 
confidence in our team i think they did a firstclass job and i 
dont think we would have ever gotten the agreement out if they 
hadnt done a firstclass job

police closed the holy temple mount today and 
fired tear gas after 200 moslem worshipers tried to break through 
the cordon jerusalems 80yearold chief moslem cleric was 
overcome by tear gas 
the temporary closure came one day after riots on the temple 
mount islams thirdholiest site in which at least 19 
palestinians were killed and about 140 were wounded by police 
gunfire 
in an arab neighborhood of jerusalem today a palestinian 
stabbed two border policemen with a screwdriver the attacker and 
another arab were shot and wounded police said 
clashes between stone throwers and police also erupted in three 
other jerusalem arab neighborhoods and widespread protests were 
reported in israeli arab towns where leaders called for a twoday 
strike over the temple mount bloodshed 
palestinian leaders in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip 
have demanded un protection and announced a protest strike 
beginning today the start of the 36th month of the antiisraeli 
uprising in the territories seized during the 1967 middle east war 
mondays violence forced the palestinian question back toward 
the top of the international agenda it was the bloodiest clash in 
jerusalem since the 1967 war and the highest singleday death toll 
in the uprising 
arab leaders denounced the use of deadly force by israel 
president hosni mubarak of egypt which joined the multinational 
force formed after iraq invaded kuwait said the violence could 
lead to grave consequences 
also condemning the temple mount violence were the japanese 
foreign ministry the european communitys executive body and the 
president of the european parliament 
president bush said today israel should have acted with more 
restraint at the temple mount but he said iraqs saddam hussein 
should not use the violence to try to link his occupation of kuwait 
with the israelipalestinian dispute 
the arab world is united almost united against him bush 
said if he tries to use this unfortunate incident to link the 
two issues i do not think it will be successful 
moslem leaders said todays closure of the temple mount marked 
the first time police had blocked entry to the 35acre site and its 
two mosques since israel captured the surrounding old city in 1967 
the keys to the gates of the wall around the temple mount were 
returned to moslem officials this afternoon and one of the mosques 
doors was opened moslem clerics said 
before control of the temple mount was returned to the moslems 
the chief moslem cleric the mufti of jerusalem led 200 moslems to 
a gate of the shrine border police blocked their way and ordered 
them to leave 
when the moslems refused police fired tear gas and the mufti 
saad aldin alalami was overcome an arab reporter said the 
mufti who has a heart condition was taken to mukassed hospital 
where he was reported in satisfactory condition 
earlier police arrested the muftis deputy on charges of 
inciting mondays rioting 
on the southern outskirts of jerusalem today three arabs 
stopped at a border police roadblock jumped out of their car one 
of them plunged a screwdriver into the side of one officer and 
stabbed a second officer in the arm 
the three then tried to speed away but police opened fire 
shooting two of the palestinians police said both the officers 
and the arabs suffered slight wounds police spokesman uzi sanduri 
said 
in nazareth today police fired tear gas to disperse dozens of 
activists who blocked roads with overturned garbage cans and 
stones an arab reporter said masked youths shouting proiraqi 
slogans broke into a department store smashing windows and beating 
shoppers 
the army extended curfews on the gaza strip and most of the 
occupied west bank restricting the more than 1 million palestinian 
residents to their homes the us state department advised 
americans to avoid travel to the occupied territories 
the curfews were imposed after three palestinians were killed 
and at least 65 were wounded monday by army gunfire during protests 
that followed the temple mount violence 
also today deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu suggested 
israel would block a proposed un factfinding mission to israel 
he urged washington to veto an inquiry into the violence at the 
temple mount 
prime minister yitzhak shamir has said mondays riots were 
engineered by proiraqi palestinian extremists to deflect attention 
from iraqi aggression 
the violence began monday after 3000 arabs hurled stones from 
the temple mount onto 14000 to 20000 jews praying at the wailing 
wall below the wall the last remnant of the jewish temple is 
judaisms holiest site 
about 25 people were injured by the stones and police stormed 
the mosque compound firing tear gas rubber bullets and live 
ammunition 
authorities said 22 civilians and five or six officers were hurt 
by stones and 120 arabs were arrested 
the arabs apparently were angered by rumors a jewish group

the minnesota supreme court has let stand 
its ruling that a landlord may refuse to rent to an unmarried 
couple because of his religious beliefs 
the court monday denied a petition to rehear the discrimination 
case in which it ruled 43 last month in favor of landlord layle 
french of marshall 
the court had ruled that frenchs rights of conscience take 
precedence over the couples rights under the states laws against 
discrimination 
state human rights commissioner stephen cooper sought the 
rehearing saying the decision contradicted the state legislatures 
intent to prevent discrimination on the basis of marital status 
cooper said the ruling opened the door to landlords imposing 
their morality on tenants 
in june 1989 an administrative law judge found that french had 
violated the law when he voided an agreement to rent a house to sue 
parsons after learning parsons would live in the house with her 
fiance french cited his religious beliefs against sex outside 
marriage 
a state appeals court panel upheld the judge last fall although 
it did not dispute the sincerity of frenchs religious beliefs 
the state supreme court reversed that decision

a smiling nelson mandela returned 
to prison tuesday this time on a visit with promising news for 
african national congress comrades still jailed for antiapartheid 
activities 
it evokes all kinds of memories but im concentrating on 
the pleasant ones said mandela who was released in february 
after 27 years in prison for trying to overthrow the whiteled 
government 
he went to pollsmoor and robben island to tell jailed anc 
members about government plans to release political prisoners 
mandela spent nearly two decades on robben island some of it 
breaking rocks in hard labor before his transfer in 1982 to 
pollsmoor 
he described tuesdays meetings as emotional 
the atmosphere was one of enthusiasm and the spirit of 
comradeship was so strong that when we meet the emotions run 
wild he said after his visits 
mandela said he spoke only to anc members but that the 
organization seeks the release of all political prisoners 
irrespective of affiliation 
we have set a date by which all political prisoners will be 
released and that is the end of april 1991 he said all that 
we are concentrating on is that political prisoners are released as 
soon as possible and we are busy with that process 
the anc has said the government must free all political 
prisoners before the black opposition movement will enter 
fullscale negotiations on ending apartheid and whiteminority 
rule 
the government has released dozens of prisoners in recent months 
and 15 more are scheduled to be freed wednesday from robben island 
another six also are to be released from other south african 
prisons the anc said it says there are some 3000 people it 
considers political prisoners 
president fw de klerk has said his government will free all 
political prisoners but has not said how many inmates fall in that 
category 
on monday de klerk said the ancs estimated 20000 exiles could 
begin applying for amnesty to clear the way for their return to 
south africa 
de klerk who legalized the anc in february cautioned that 
amnesty would not automatically be granted to everyone who applied 
the release of political prisoners and the return of exiles are 
two main obstacles to negotiations on ending apartheid 
de klerk says he wants to draw up a new constitution with 
opposition groups that would allow the 5 million whites and 30 
million blacks to share power the government and the anc have been 
holding preliminary talks since may 
mandela appeared in a jovial mood before visiting robben island 
he smiled broadly while boarding a boat to the prison the most 
noroious in south africa 
he recognized a guard on the craft and greeted him warmly 
saying oh you are a sergeant now 
later mandela recalled some aspects of prison life 
as you know we were not allowed to read newspapers he 
said and i remembered very well how successful we were in 
smuggling in newspapers

coast today after punishing the bahamas with rains and galeforce 
winds forecasters said 
top winds dropped to 35 mph as the system disintegrated and all 
storm warnings in the bahamas were dropped 
tropical storm lili also appeared ready to peter out in the 
midatlantic forecasters said no more advisories were planned for 
bot storm systems 
klaus had prompted the navy to cancel shore leave for sailors 
visiting fort lauderdale and order the fleet out to sea but that 
order was dropped when the storm weakened into a tropical 
depression late this morning 
the biggest continuing danger from the storms remnants was 
heavy rain across south florida coastal erosion and flooding said 
bob sheets director of the national hurricane center in coral 
gables 
flood warnings went up from the northern florida keys to jupiter 
inlet in palm beach county 
water managers welcomed the rain however saying it can help 
alleviate the effects of a twoyear drought 
by noon edt the depression left by klaus was centered near 240 
north latitude and 760 west longitude or about 115 miles 
southeast of nassau in the bahamas it was heading westnorthwest 
at about 15 mph and was expected to continue on that course 
klaus the 11th named storm of the 1990 atlantic hurricane

federal workers spared at least temporarily 
from layoffs by a lastminute budget deal trooped back to work on 
tuesday frustrated by the chaotic process that left them dangling 
for weeks 
other countries of the world have got to be laughing their 
heads off we try to run the world but we cant manage our own 
affairs said tom doherty an occupational safety and health 
administration inspector from allentown pa 
its been up and down every day every federal employee is 
feeling that bit of salt in the wound said dale bodinus a 
nonessential tax collector from detroit who faced being laid 
off from the internal revenue service 
the government closed over the holiday weekend due to a budget 
stalemate between congress and the white house had faced the 
prospect of a paralyzing shutdown of nonessential services on 
tuesday without an agreement 
a deal was struck late monday and widespread layoffs of 
hundreds of thousands of the nations 24 million federal workers 
were averted 
many federal employees contend congress and the bush 
administration have used them in a political tugofwar 
we feel like pawns like were very expendable except when 
it comes to who can use us for more power to get their bills 
passed or to raise taxes said gretchen kenney a social security 
claims processor in chicago 
the yearly budget fiasco threatens to make government work 
which already suffers a bad reputation even less appealing 
federal workers said 
john sturdivant president of the 700000member american 
federation of government employees said federal workers make on 
average about 22 percent less than their counterparts in the 
private sector in addition the government pays about 1100 less 
in health care premiums for each worker than the average medium or 
large corporation pays 
if you were in the top 5 percent of your class and were 
excited about doing some significant research for a cure for aids 
would you want to come to work for the federal government i think 
not sturdivant said 
federal workers have always known theyre not going to get 
rich said robert tobias president of the national treasury 
employees union 
but there was an implicit agreement that they had job 
security that agreement has been ripped apart the past few 
weeks tobias said 
the uncertainty of federal workers job status is not over if a 
final budget isnt reached by oct 19 a government shutdown could 
still occur 
the threat of forced furloughs had been hanging over workers for 
weeks they were notified more than a month ago that they might 
face up to 22 days of furloughs under the grammrudman 
deficitcutting law if congress and the bush administration did not 
strike a budget deal 
the possibility of a wholesale government shutdown which would 
have sent thousands of nonessential workers home indefinitely 
hit last friday when congress balked at passing the original 
deficitreduction plan bush pitched on television 
you have no idea the turmoil this has caused for some people 
the ones trying to support a family on one pay check said 
doherty the osha inspector from pennsylvania 
they dont know what to do i do i keep telling them your 
voice is at the ballot box come election time good bad or 
indifferent we just go in and vote for the guys opponent 
doherty said 
bodinus the tax collector from detroit said ive got 27 
years with the federal government and i take a little bit of pride 
in my job unfortunately i dont think congress is taking the same 
kind of pride in their job 
theyve become experts in taking things down to the wire 
theyve done more work in the past week than they have all year i 
pay my taxes faithfully and i dont think im getting my moneys 
worth

gov kay orr said today her life has been 
threatened and she will not campaign in a county divided by plans 
to build a lowlevel radioactive waste facility 
the threat came within the past six months and she knows who 
made it orr said at a news conference this morning but the 
governor refused to disclose the name 
the nebraska state patrol was investigating it she said 
the sparselypopulated boyd county has been in turmoil since a 
company developing a lowlevel radioactive waste warehouse for five 
states said it wanted to build the facility there 
mrs orr said she had hoped the situation in boyd county 
wouldnt deteriorate to the point where threats were made 
there are a lot of things that you consider when you step into 
a public office mrs orr said i think most of it was pretty 
well understood by bill her husband and me 
its dismaying to think that we have gotten to this point that 
people lose faith and confidence in their government she said 
state patrol spokesman jeff hanson said a letter was received in 
early august that contained some implied threats but lacked some 
elements needed before authorities could carge a person with 
making terroristic threats 
hanson declined to release any specifics about when the letter 
was received where it came from or what it said 
we are concerned and we are continuing the investigation 
hanson said 
doug parrott a spokesman for the orr campaign said the state 
continues to review us ecologys application for a permit to 
develop the site near butte near the south dakota border 
the reinforced concrete warehouse would hold waste from five 
states in the central interstate lowlevel radioactive waste 
compact commission nebraska arkansas louisiana oklahoma and 
kansas 
the news of the threat came at a conference in which she was 
releasing information on her campaign finances mrs orr released a 
report that showed she has spent 15 million in her gubernatorial 
race against democrat ben nelson 
orr the nations first republican woman elected governor said 
nelson has spent at least 500000 of his own money and 73 percent 
of his support has come from outside nebraska 
nelsons campaign manager sonny foster said this was the first 
he had heard of the threat to mrs orr and said that it had 
absolutely nothing to do with the nelson campaign 
nelson has visited boyd county and has said that he is concerned 
about the divisions in the community foster said 
you have neighbors pitted against neighbors he said 
nelson is scheduled to make one more trip to boyd county to 
attend a fundraiser in naper on sunday foster said

the supreme court said tuesday it would decide 
whether police may conduct random drug searches aboard buses and 
trains without a warrant 
the court which has never ruled on random searches aboard 
public transportation said it would review a florida court ruling 
that such searches violate passengers rights a decision is 
expected by july 
the florida supreme court ruled 43 last year that travelers in 
effect are coerced into consenting to have their luggage searched 
when police come aboard and randomly choose passengers 
the passenger has been placed in temporary police detention 
since there is no place to which a reasonable traveler might 
leave and no place to which he or she might walk away the state 
court said 
the florida court ruled in a case in which broward county 
sheriffs officers boarded a bus bound from miami to atlanta during 
a stopover in fort lauderdale 
the officers said they were looking for illegal drugs and asked 
a passenger terrance bostick to let them search his luggage they 
said he consented before a search found cocaine in one of his bags 
bostick said he was asleep lying across the back bench of the 
bus when the police boarded he also said the officers blocked the 
aisle making it difficult for him to leave 
florida courts noted that one officer carried a zipper pouch 
containing a pistol 
the officers had no courtissued search warrant and no grounds 
to suspect bostick had illegal drugs 
the state supreme court said bostick was detained unlawfully by 
the officers even if the passenger felt free to leave the state 
court said he was not about to get off the bus moments before its 
trip to atlanta was to resume 
bostick in fact was seized by the officers and any consent 
he gave to search his luggage was not free from the taint of the 
illegal detention the state court said 
florida prosecutors told the justices the state courts ruling 
severely restricts the ability of police to interdict illegal 
drug shipments i public transportation facilities 
state officials said the problem is particularly acute in 
florida because it is a pipeline for drug smugglers they said 
police in broward and palm beach counties regularly board buses and 
trains during scheduled stops to conduct such searches 
the justices in 1968 gave police the authority to stop people on 
the street and question them if they had reason to suspect them of 
a crime or frisk them if they had a reasonable suspicion they were 
carrying a weapon 
the court also has given authorities considerable latitude to 
question people in airport terminals who fit socalled drugcourier 
profiles 
recently the court bolstered police search powers even when 
they have no reason to suspect criminal conduct 
for example the justices said in june that police may try to 
curb drunken driving by setting up roadblocks and requiring 
motorists to submit to sobriety tests

statements made by the grandmother of a 
teenager prominently mentioned as a suspect in the slayings of 
five college students will not be allowed as evidence in his trial 
on charges of beating her 
edward humphrey 19 faces an aggravated battery charge in the 
beating of his grandmother elna hlavaty 79 she has said she no 
longer remembers what happened that night and does not believe her 
grandson attacked her 
todays ruling by brevard circuit judge theron a yawn not to 
allow mrs hlavatys statements was expected to lead to a mistrial 
motion since prosecutor philip williams summarized the 
nowexcluded testimony in his opening arguments 
but testimony by a doctor who examined mrs hlavaty began with 
no mistrial request by the defense 
in his earlier arguments before the judge williams said the 
state was concerned about mrs hlavatys motivations in changing 
her version of the incident and needed the statements of others who 
initially arrived on the scene 
humphrey is accused of beating mrs hlavaty shortly after he 
arrived at her indialantic home on aug 30 from gainsville 
he had gone to gainesville five days before to attend classes at 
the university of florida during the time he was there five 
students four females and a male were stabbed to death in their 
offcampus apartments 
no one has been charged in connection with those crimes but 
police say humphrey is one of several possible suspects 
yawn reminded jurors monday that humphrey was only on trial in 
his courtroom for the brevard county assault charge 
that has nothing to do with the trial we are undertaking he 
said of the gainesville slayings 
ms hlavaty who is listed as a prosecution witness recanted 
her initial allegations saying instead that she accidentally fell 
and was not attacked by her grandson 
if convicted of aggravated battery on a person over the age of 
65 humphrey faces at least three years in prison without parole 
he also faces charges in connection with a 1988 attempted rape 
and burglary in indian river county and an aug 25 assault on two 
male students at the university of florida 
most of the jurors questioned monday were aware that humphrey 
was a suspect in the five slayings but said they could render an 
impartial verdict in his assault case 
humphrey appeared to be dazed at the start of the proceedings 
but later he smiled and laughed at one point he began reading 
aloud from a small booklet and was quieted by a court official 
his mother grandmother and two brothers sat in the courtroom 
throughout much of the jury selection 
the states attorney has harassed me and my family so terribly 
they should be in a cell his grandmother said during a break in 
the selection process he sure did not hit me and he knows he did 
not hit me

the supreme court sent an unsettling message 
tuesday to public schools that refuse to rent space to outside 
religious organizations while allowing such access for 
nonreligious groups 
the justices without comment turned down the appeal of a 
centennial pa high school that had been forced to rent weekend 
use of its auditorium to the campus crusade for christ 
a federal appeals court ruled that denying such access would 
violate the groups freespeech rights 
tuesdays court action set no national precedent but allowed the 
appeals court ruling to become binding law in pennsylvania 
delaware and new jersey the appeals court ruling also could serve 
as a model for other courts 
lawyers for the centennial school district said the appeals 
court ruling if applied nationwide would convert most american 
public school facilities into open public forums to which even the 
most fractious religious and political speakers must be routinely 
allowed access 
acting in numerous cases the day david h souter became 
historys 105th supreme court justice the court also 
agreed to decide in a florida case whether police without a 
court warrant may conduct random searches aboard buses and trains 
left intact an affirmative action program plan for hiring and 
promoting more minorities and women in san franciscos fire 
department the plan had been challenged as discriminatory against 
white men 
revived a 4 billion lawsuit by a millionaire florida inventor 
who says an american broadcasting companies television program 
falsely portrayed him as a liar and hypocrite 
the justices told a federal appeals court to restudy arthur 
jones libel suit against abc over a 1987 report by the 2020 
tv program on the fate of 63 baby elephants jones rescued from 
death in africa 
the high court last june upheld the federal equal access act in 
which congress required that virtually all public high schools must 
allow student prayer groups to meet and worship if other student 
clubs are permitted at school 
the court said in its june decision that the law does not 
violate the constitutionally required separation of church and 
state 
but the federal law applies only to student groups not to 
outside organizations seeking use of school facilities 
in the pennsylvania case the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
relied instead on the constitutions first amendment when it 
ruled last summer that school officials violated the freespeech 
rights of student venture a subsidiary of the campus crusade for 
christ 
the officials refused to rent space at william tennent high 
school for a program aimed at religious conversion 
by a 21 vote the appeals court ruled that the school district 
had created an open public forum by renting space to among 
others the local rotary and kiwanis clubs an adult education 
program offering night classes and two labor unions 
the appeals court said religious groups could not be excluded 
because of the message they sought to communicate from such an 
open forum 
the 3rd circuit court relied in part on a 1981 decision in which 
the supreme court said staterun universities cannot ban student 
groups from using campus facilities for religious worship and 
study 
the 1981 ruling said such bans generally violate students 
freespeech rights because it prevents them from using an open 
public forum 
in the appeal rejected tuesday lawyers for the centennial 
school district argued that public high schools and elementary 
schools for freespeech purposes differ from college campuses 
the appeal said the 3rd circuit court ruling turns the first 
amendment into a sweeping equal access act putting school 
districts to an all or nothing choice regarding access to 
nonstudentinitiated groups

the federal trade commission moved tuesday to 
block a joint venture it said would create a virtual monopoly in 
the making and sale of a telescope commonly used by serious amateur 
astronomers 
the commission said it has authorized its staff to ask a federal 
judge in los angeles for a preliminary injunction blocking the 
proposed venture by meade instruments corp and celestron 
international the two largest producers of midsize 
schmidtcassegrain telescopes

us armed forces radio 
started live broadcasts in saudi arabia tuesday with an almost 
inevitable opening line goooood maaawrning saudi arabia 
echoing comedian robin williams intro in the movie good 
morning vietnam disc jockey rich yanku broke in at 905 am to 
bring the heart of the desert fm 107 direct from an airbase in the 
desert 
an average mobile home would dwarf the two trailers that make up 
the broadcast unit they were dubbed camp schmooz by the four disc 
jockeys after the favorite question of the units director bronx 
native lt arnie pon 
what are you guys schmoozing around for pon asks 
constantly using the yiddish slang for idle talk 
picking the first song took a lot of schmoozing much of it was 
worthy of adrian kronauer the character williams portrayed in the 
film about armed forces radio during the vietnam war 
midnight at the oasis was rejected as too sugary 
ray stevens ahab the arab was also passed over and hank 
williams dont give us a reason was dismissed for hinting at 
criticism of rather senior officials 
were probably always going to avoid playing that 
acknowledged air force staff sgt harry lockley 25 of new castle 
pa 
rock the casbah by the clash finally was first on the air 
it seemed to fit with both the middle east landscape the tune 
abounds with references to sheiks bedouins and cadillacs and the 
role of nearly 200000 us troops underwritten by saudi arabia to 
confront iraqi leader saddam hussein after he invaded neighboring 
kuwait aug 2 
one verse goes 
the king called out his jetfighters 
he said you better earn you pay 
drop your bombs between the minarets 
down the casbah way 
the radio stations format will be rock n roll with some 
country folk rap and reggae music from their collection of 8800 
compact discs there will also be a jazz hour on most nights the 
station starts the hour with the ap network news 
classical music none scheduled and polka is also doubtful 
there are a lot of young guys out here used to hearing 
hardcore rock n roll hard driving music said air force staff 
sgt john haynes 27 of phoenix ariz one of four disc jockeys 
i try to target the young guys 
the saudi government has put some limits on what the radio can 
broadcast but no one in the unit would specify what was forbidden 
its basically just common sense about what might offend 
saudi sensibilities said lt col david macnamee head of the 
armed forces radio and television services in saudi arabia a tv 
station is still under discussion 
the moslem and tribal codes that determine public behavior in 
saudi arabia include bans on alcohol and the mixing of men and 
women outside their homes 
most us soldiers out in the field have been prohibited from 
entering villages and there has been cultural friction in places 
where the troops share facilities saudi troops are shocked by 
american men walking naked to the showers 
part of the radio broadcasts include pep talks on the kingdom 
saudi arabias a land of mystery or is it said yanku 
between songs during his first 30 minutes on the air if you take 
a little time to learn about i youll make your stay more 
enjoyable 
public service messages will include warnings about scorpions in 
the desert 
theres some question about how many soldiers will hear the 
24hour broadcasts because the number of transmitters is limited 
and few troops brought radios several thousand radios have been 
distributed and another 30000 donated in the united states are 
expected to arrive soon 
requests started rolling in within minutes of the live show 
the first soldier to call was a woman named kim dedicating 
bruce springsteens born in the usa to her fellow troops 
got a request dial 96638991119 extension 7231

the jurys still out president bush says 
but in reality hes been badly bloodied by the budget turmoil 
the presidents poll ratings have slipped his leadership 
abilities are being questioned his own republicans are in revolt 
and he has thrown away his nonewtax trump card 
all this and still no budget agreement 
after five months of wrangling congress has given bush only a 
vague budget agreement along with promises to fill in the blanks 
later with tax increases and spending cuts to get even this much 
bush had to shut down the government in an embarrassing spectacle 
at a news conference tuesday bush acknowledged that americans 
might justifiably wonder about the ability of the president and 
congress to govern i can understand the frustration he said 
i feel it myself at times 
bush badly misread congressional republicans and the american 
public about whether they would support a painful prescription that 
would boost taxes on gasoline alcohol and cigarettes and raise 
healthcare costs under medicare 
the voters spurned the appeal for sacrifice instead they 
called lawmakers to demand that they vote against the president 
and thats exactly what congress did 
on the critical budget vote bush could not muster half of the 
gop members of the house even most of the republican leadership 
abandoned him 
for bush it was a crushing disappointment on an issue that he 
had described as the biggest test of his presidency in the domestic 
field bush may be enjoying stillhigh popularity ratings but 
whats it worth if it doesnt get him the results he wants 
what americans seemed to want was the old bush the feelgood 
leader who promised not to raise their taxes many gop politicians 
facing the voters in november also liked the old bush better 
the president made it easy for republicans to defect he 
promised there wouldn be any penalty for a no vote hes even 
going out campaigning for turncoats beginning with sen jesse 
helms rnc on wednesday 
despite bushs collegial attitude there are bad feelings 
between the white house and congressional republicans over the 
budget negotiations 
bushs strongwilled chief of staff john sununu and his budget 
director richard darman were accused by some lawmakers of acting 
arrogantly and treating them with disrespect in one instance 
sununu dismissed sen trent lott rmiss as insignificant when 
he said he would vote against bushs budget 
bush says he has full confidence in his staff and when the 
passions get high bush said i understand that theres bound 
to be a little broken china up there he said the complainers are 
just squeaky wheels 
the news of course is man bites dog republican goes after 
republican 
in less than a month bushs popularity rating has dropped 10 
percentage points to 65 percent according to a washington postabc 
news poll a cbs news poll measured the erosion at 14 percentage 
points and pegged his approval rating at 62 percent 
i guess i learned that you cant do it exactly my way when we 
get down on something like the deficit bush said 
so when you get into somebodys pocketbook or youre 
worrying about a tax or a spending cut that affects someone ive 
learned that its just not going to be done the way i want it 
especially if you dont control the senate or you dont control the 
house 
on the other hand a 65 percent approval rating after 20 months 
in official is unprecedented 
stephen hess a presidential scholar at the brookings 
institution said bush probably has not suffered longterm damage 
even though washington insiders will put it down in their books 
that congress can whip him 
the significant thing said hess is that bushs name wont be 
on a ballot until 1992 he has a lot of time to make it up 
besides hess said the defining feature at this moment is 
that weve got 200000 american troops sitting on the sand in saudi 
arabia this the budget has to recede in the background 
bush seems to agree is he vulnerable has he slipped are the 
democrats smelling blood 
well without referring to the polls that i dont like to 
refer to have them take a look bush said

justice david h souter took his seat on the 
supreme court tuesday in a solemn hushed ceremony that contrasted 
sharply with the loud debate over issues hell help decide on the 
divided court 
after taking an oath to do equal right to the poor and the 
rich the 105th justice in us history spoke briefly with 
reporters and then began work by sitting silently through oral 
arguments in four cases 
i got to work on time this morning im starting off on the 
right foot he said outside the court building after being sworn 
in by chief justice william h rehnquist as cameras clicked and 
whirred he said hurry and load up ive got to go to work 
rehnquist told souter 51 i wish you a long and happy career 
in our common cause 
souter whose views on most controversial topics remain largely 
unknown despite three days of senate questioning joins the court 
at a time when the future of legalized abortion affirmativeaction 
hiring laws churchstate relations and other major issues hang in 
the balance 
three appointments by president reagan pushed court to the right 
during the 1980s and early votes by president bushs first 
appointee will be closely watched for signs of whether that trend 
will continue 
in the audience for souters swearingin were neighbors and 
lawyer friends from new hampshire where he had served as a state 
supreme court justice white house counsel c boyden gray and 
members of the senate judiciary committee which recommended his 
confirmation 
also present was retired justice william j brennan whom souter 
succeeds 
attorney general richard thornburgh wearing the morning coat 
that is traditional for such ceremonies presented souter to the 
court souter wore a threepiece business suit 
rehnquist then asked the new justice if he was ready to take the 
oath 
yes i am souter replied softly 
after administering the oath the chief justice gave his new 
colleague a congratulatory handshake then as souter made his way 
to his seat at the far left of the bench he paused for a handshake 
with justice thurgood marshall 
it was marshall who said after souters nomination july 23 
that he didnt have the slightest idea why bush had nominated 
the ittle known jurist and added never heard of him at the 
time souter declined comment on marshalls remarks 
souter said outside the court that he had preparedfor his cases 
on a catch as catch can basis while also lining up a place to 
live in washington 
he said he had signed a lease and court sources said he would 
be renting an apartment in washington 
when he signed the lease the sources quoted him as saying he 
didnt know what his new salary was but was able to get by wen he 
put down the chief justice as a credit reference souter will make 
118600 a year 
he was confirmed by the senate 909 after confirmation 
hearings that focused on how he would rule if the court had 
occasion to review its decision striking down state laws against 
abortion he declined to say and many abortion rights activists 
opposed his confirmation 
his first case as a justice however focused on the less 
emotional issue of whether shareholders may sue a company over 
allegedly misleading proxy statements the three other cases argued 
tuesday dealt with pension disputes payment of expert witness fees 
and the authority of prosecutors to exclude blacks as jurors at 
trials for white defendants 
six of the nine justice interrupted the lawyers to ask questions 
from time to time but souter listened in silence often resting 
his head in his hands once he exchanged a few words that could 
not be heard with justice antonin scalia who sits next to him

the district of columbia council passed 
emergency legislation tuesday to restrict mayor marion barrys 
spending authority in his last weeks in office 
approved by voice vote were proposals to restrict barrys 
ability to lease property or award construction projects for the 
district and require the council to review any city contracts 
proposed by barry that exceed 1 million 
the temporary 90day statutes can take effect without the 
mayors signature and will expire six days after barry leaves 
office on jan 2 
the fact of the matter is we just dont want the mayor to 
spend any money said council member john ray thats the 
emergency 
what we are seeing looks like an attempt to get a lot of 
things signed sealed and delivered before jan 2 said council 
member betty ann kane who sponsored the bill intended to restrict 
the mayors leasing authority 
barry was convicted in federal court aug 10 of a misdemeanor 
charge of cocaine possession 
before his conviction he said he would not seek a fourth 
fouryear term as mayor barry is running as an independent for a 
districtwide city council seat 
in recent weeks council members have become concerned that the 
mayor might be using city funds to reward his friends with pay 
raises and contracts before he leaves office 
other members said they supported the bills to help fight the 
citys projected 100 million budget deficit 
documents obtained tuesday by the associated press show that 
more than two dozen of barrys political supporters holding city 
jobs have received pay raises since august 
the records do not indicate that barry himself requested the 
raises but did show that they were approved by two of his top 
assistants most of those getting the raises will receive a minimum 
of 55000 annually 
others employed under lucrative annual contracts were given 
fulltime positions that would make it difficult to remove them 
from office once barry leaves as mayor 
democratic mayoral nominee sharon pratt dixon has promised that 
if she is elected on nov 6 she will fire 2000 midlevel city 
managers to save an estimated 95 million 
the bills approved tuesday will require council approval of all 
city leasing or construction contracts proposed by the mayors 
office the city spends about 40 million annually on such 
agreements under authority assigned to the mayors office 
kanes aides said the restrictions were prompted partly by 
barrys announcement in june that the city will build a 20 million 
office building to house city officials during renovation of the 
city hall 
kane and others argued that the city could save money by renting 
exising office space they also questioned awarding the contract to 
a developer who had contributed to barrys past mayoral campaigns 
council chairman david clarke sponsored the bill that would 
empower the council to review all contracts for goods and services 
that exceed 1 million previously the council could only review 
proposed renewal of such contracts 
we are in a peculiar position in this city right now that the 
chief executive is not answerable to the people clarke said 
the council should take up that burden

opposition supporters shaved their 
heads and staged sitins tuesday in support of their leader kim 
daejung who was on a hunger strike to press for democratic 
reforms 
at least 23 members of the party for peace and democracy shaved 
their heads in a ritual show of support at a district political 
office in seoul hundreds of party members wearing headbands and 
shouting slogans also staged sitins at the party headquarters in 
seoul and at a dozen local offices 
kim began fasting monday with four demands dissolution of the 
defense security command early implementation of local autonomy 
economic reform and scrapping of plans to change the form of 
government from presidential to parliamentarycabinet 
president roh taewoo and ruling party leaders appealed for a 
truce in the political fight but the opposition party threatened 
to mount a national movement to topple roh if the president 
rejected kims demands 
in a meeting tuesday dissidents and opposition party leaders 
vowed to join forces for their antiroh campaign including a major 
rally saturday in seoul 
kim spent the second day of his hunger strike at his office 
reading books and chatting with visitors a 24hour nurse assistant 
periodically checked his blood pressure and temperature 
the latest political turmoil began last week after an army 
private released classified documents he said showed the government 
illegally spied on more than 1300 civilians 
roh fired his defense minister and the powerful chief of 
military intelligence monday to minimize the impact of the most 
serious scandal since he took office in early 1988 
roh asked the opposition to settle issues through dialogue 
warning that its boycott since august of the national assembly 
would amplify political and social unrest 
kim demanded that roh end dirty political operations aimed at 
harassing opposition parties he said the spy allegations showed 
rohs administration is a disguised military government 
the hardened position of kim who has survived political 
persecution for more than 20 years was apparently propelled by 
mounting public criticism of roh and the ruling party 
the scandal jolted domestic politics which have been in limbo 
since august when opposition legislators resigned from parliament 
en masse charging the government with railroading bills and 
curtailing democratic reforms 
roh has pledged broad reforms including an end to military 
intervention in politics 
he captured twothirds of the 299member national assembly in 
january by merging his party with two minor opposition groups but 
his popularity has dwindled because of inflation social 
disturbances and disputes within the enlarged governing party

americans cut the growth of their installment 
credit in half in august the government said tuesday 
the federal reserve said consumers took out a seasonally 
adjusted 21 billion more than they repaid an increase of 34 
percent at an annual rate over july and slightly more than the 
average 178 billion a month during the first seven months of 
1990 
but the growth of consumer credit slowed dramatically from a net 
increase of 473 billion or 78 percent at an annual rate during 
july the fed said consumer credit averaged 442 billion a month 
during 1988 and 1989 the fed said 
consumer confidence plummeted after iraqi tanks stormed kuwait 
on aug 2 according to various surveys the conference board a 
new yorkbased business research group said confidence in the us 
economy in august dropped to its lowest level since 1983 when the 
nation was emerging for its last recession 
the slower growth in august reflected a larger decline in auto 
loans outstanding and a smaller expansion of revolving credit than 
in july the report said 
automobile loans continued their slide down 73 percent or 
174 billion the sluggish automobile sector declined 16 percent 
or 377 million in july and 73 percent or 176 billion in 
june 
revolving or credit card debt rose 178 billion up 101 
percent from the previous month but that was less than half of the 
217 percent or 378 billion gain in july 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose 106 
percent or 184 billion after a 74 percent or 127 billion 
increase the previous month 
borrowing for mobile homes advanced 109 percent or 208 
million after a 33 percent or 63 million gain in july

much of the arab world bitterly condemned 
the killing of 19 palestinians in jerusalem by israeli forces and 
some extremists vowed tuesday to exact vengeance against israel and 
the united states 
the killings at jerusalems temple mount sacred to both islam 
and judaism could drag israel into the persian gulf dispute at a 
time when it has been trying to avoid just that 
middle east experts in jordan expressed concern that mondays 
deaths might trigger terrorist acts which could be interpreted as 
iraqisponsored and bring the usled muliinational force and iraq 
closer to war 
palestinian terrorist abul abbas threatened to retaliate unless 
the united states cuts its strategic ties with israel and 
president saddam hussein of iraq said the deaths brought israel 
closer to the abyss 
iraq called for un action while the radical moslem 
brotherhood in jordan called for a jihad or holy war to liberate 
palestinian land 
saddam also announced that a new iraqi missile with a range of 
hundreds of miles could be launched against the targets of evil 
when the day of reckoning comes 
president bush said tuesday in washington that israeli security 
forces should have acted with more restraint when they opened 
fire on the rioting palestinians 
let me just express my strong feelings about this my sorrow 
at this tragedy it is particularly saddening because of the 
sanctity of the holy places violence shattered all this bush 
said 
iraq which has been trying to rouse the arab masses against the 
usled multinational force in the gulf said the battle against 
the foreign presence in saudi arabia and israeli occupation of arab 
lands was the same struggle 
thousands of palestinians and jordanians took to the streets of 
jordans capital amman tuesday under a sign reading mohammed 
and christ came for peace bush and israel came for blood 
in beirut hundreds of palestinians burned tires around their 
refugee camps while shops closed and protesters marched through 
the shantytowns shouting stop the massacres 
israeli officials said the shooting started monday after arabs 
began stoning jewish worshipers at judaisms holiest site the 
western wall which is below the temple mount 
it was the bloodiest incident in jerusalem since the middle east 
war in 1967 
palestinian blood will not be cheap we will wait and see what 
the united states reaction will be but our retaliation will be 
severe against israel and the united states said abbas leader 
of the palestine liberation front and suspected mastermind of the 
achille lauro cruise ship hijacking in 1985 
abbas at a news conference in baghdad set several conditions 
he said washington must meet to avoid retaliation against us 
targets 
among them were resuming its suspended dialogue with the 
palestine liberation organization suspending its alliance with 
israel and not vetoing un security council resolutions expected 
against israel because of the killings 
the 18month usplo dialogue was broken off by bush last may 
after plo leader yasser arafat refused us demands that abbas be 
punished for an abortive raid on israel by the palestine liberation 
front 
saddam said tuesday that we the arabs will not be satisfied 
and it will not heal the hearts which have grieved over their 
dearest in palestine with anything except action 
his speech was monitored in nicosia 
baghdads staterun alqadissiyah daily called on all arabs to 
consider the battle against foreign intervention and that against 
the zionist occupation as one 
more than 200000 troops were deployed in the persian gulf area 
after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 the multinational force which 
is led by the united states includes western and arab troops 
george habash leader of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestine said the international community that condemned the 
iraqi invasion must also force implementation of un resolution 
242 calling for an israeli withdrawal from the occupied gaza strip 
and west bank 
also condemning the temple mount killings were egypt jordan and 
the plos executive committee 
saudi arabia meanwhile accused israel of trying to erase the 
palestinian identity 
jordanian newspapers said the temple mount killings demonstrated 
the link between the gulf crisis and israels hold on the occupied 
territories several newspapers urged an international blockade of 
israel 
jordanian police dispersed thousands of protesters who tried to 
march on the us embassy in amman the demonstrators denounced 
president hosni mubarak of egypt president hafez assad of syria 
and king fahd of saudi arabia the three arab leaders who have 
backed the usled military intervention in the gulf 
several arab governments including syria have made no official 
comment on the killings

us officials are satisfied with german 
efforts to prevent illegal shipments of war materials to iraq a 
state department official told congress on tuesday 
assistant secretary of state raymond seitz said germany has 
overhauled and tightened up its laws covering exports that 
might be used for the production of chemical biological or nuclear 
weapons 
seitz told the house foreign affairs committee that there are 
german footprints all over equipment that has gone to iraq in 
recent years 
seitz said companies in other countries also have assisted iraq 
in its production of chemical weapons and other armaments he 
declined to identify those ocuntries 
this is not exclusively a german problem he said 
more than 20 people working for nine german companies are 
suspected of helping iraq obtain chemical weapons and other arms in 
the years before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait a german 
government prosecutor said tuesday four are in custody for 
investigation and three have been released on bail or for health 
reasons the official said 
the magazine der spiegel has named nearly 40 german companies it 
says supplied iraq with equipment needed to produce chemical 
biological nuclear and conventional weapons in recent years 
there is no question in my mind that the intent of the german 
government to get hold of this problem is very serious seitz 
said 
rep lee hamilton dind who conducted the hearing said the 
germans appear to have an extraordinarily distressing record

stonethrowing crowds were teargassed 
by police tuesday as they waited to see ousted prime minister 
benazir bhutto when she appeared before a judge on corruption 
charges witnesses said 30 people were injured in the melee 
a week earlier supporters stormed the courtroom and injured 
dozens of people so security was tight tuesday around punjab high 
court where ms bhutto went to answer charges of misconduct and 
abuse of power 
president ghulam ishaq khan on aug 6 dismissed ms bhuttos 
20monthold government the fifth popularly elected administration 
to be sacked in pakistans 43year history 
ishaq khan whose disagreements with ms bhutto were often 
highly publicized cited a litany of charges including corruption 
nepotism ineptitude and abuse of power 
ms bhutto says the charges are a smear campaign 
all this is done to eliminate benazir bhutto who cannot be 
eliminated politically she said tuesday during a break in the 
hearing 
ms bhutto is standing trial before the lahore tribunal on 
charges of illegally selling federal land to a londonbased company 
owned by her cousin and giving lucrative contracts for distribution 
of liquified gas to friends and relatives she said suffered during 
a decade of martial law 
she faces two similar charges before a special tribunal in her 
hometown of karachi 
the threehour hearing was adjourned tuesday by the judgh until 
oct 16 to give ms bhuttos lawyers more time to prepare their 
defense 
ms bhutto 37 sat quietly throughout the proceedings at times 
scribbling notes or toying with her orange prayer beads 
occasionally she read the koran moslems holy book 
about 2000 supporters pressed against street barricades to see 
ms bhutto and witnesses said police tried to force them to leave 
some angry supporters started throwing stones and bricks and 
police tried to drive them away with tear gas the witnesses said 
at least 30 were hurt the witnesses said 
some police officers blamed 30 to 40 of ms bhuttos supporters 
for the trouble but said they were chased away and that no one was 
hurt 
witnesses said police beat some supporters with cane batons and 
arrested others police refused to answer questions 
most pakistanis including some of ms bhuttos opponents have 
criticized the socalled accountability process used by the 
caretaker government as a blatant attempt to force the former prime 
minister out of politics 
most observers say the tribunals have strengthened her campaign 
and galvanized her party which two months ago was showing signs of 
major divisions between the leadership and the rank and file

in the citys jewish quarter where a forced 
gaiety seemed to prevail tuesday a bearded israeli in a religious 
skullcap asked his young daughter are you having a good time do 
you want a popsicle 
in the neighboring moslem quarter black flags flew in sympathy 
for the 19 palestinians killed in a clash with police atop the 
temple mount 
the violence monday was the worst in jerusalem since israel 
captured the arab part of the city 23 years ago and it only 
appeared to deepen the chasm between jews and arabs 
even longtime mayor teddy kollek who has struggled for decades 
to unite the city acknowledged that his goal of jewisharab 
coexistence is a long way off 
i still believe it will be all right someday but it will take 
generations he said 
in the jewish quarter of the walled old city jews continued 
marking the eightday holiday of sukkot 
the arab quarters were virtually empty shut by a general strike 
marking the killings and the start of the 35th month in the 
palestinian uprising 
palestinians on the streets were bitter 
this is worse than in 67 worse than any other time said 
one who gave his name as adan there will never be peace now with 
jews 
mondays rioting began when palestinians atop the temple mount 
hurled rocks at jews praying at the western wall just below about 
25 people were injured by the stones and police stormed the mosque 
compound firing tear gas rubber bullets and live ammunition 
the temple mount is sacred to both jews and moslems because of 
that both sides see themselves as under attack 
israelis are fuming at the violation of the western wall the 
last remnant of king herods second temple and judaisms most 
revered site it is also known as the wailing wall 
palestinians feel they were protecting islam following rumors 
that jewish zealots who want to rebuild the ancient temple where 
the dome of the rock and al aqsa mosques now stand would march on 
the mount 
the mount known to moslems as haram essharif is islams 
thirdholiest site after mecca and medina in saudi arabia 
the seam that divides the city runs on top of the western 
wall the israeli daily yedioth ahronoth concluded 
michael ben ari a museum curator said coexistence has been a 
oneway affair 
an arab can walk about freely in jewish neighborhoods but a 
jew cannot walk about any east jerusalem neighborhood without 
endangering his life he said 
thousands of israelis flocked to the western wall on tuesday 
ultraorthodox jews many in festive silk garb and fur hats for the 
holiday shopped in the jewish quarter 
some israelis had pistols dangling from their hips many seemed 
oblivious to the increased patrols by riot squad police wearing 
flak vests and carrying submachine guns 
in the arab quarters isolated groups of tourists shuffled down 
the quiet stone streets james and carol collier of new york city 
said they had originally planned to come in september but had 
postponed the trip because of the persian gulf crisis 
we just decided you dont know which crisis youre going to 
step into so you just go with one collier said 
across the street palestinian mazen aslan carried a stereo to 
the hostel where he works 
israeli soldiers you know are like children he said 
they want to be like rambo but we are human beings and we are 
not broken yet 
immanuel mizrachi an antiquities dealer in the jewish quarter 
said mondays violence just added another layer ot the hatred 
between jews and arabs and it will take something very special to 
make them come together

ethnic hungarian parliamentarians 
walked out of romanias senate on tuesday following the passage of 
legislation they considered discriminatory 
the state news agency rompres reported the disagreement resulted 
from a clause in a new law about the formation of private companies 
that said the executive or executive secretary and at least half 
of the leadership of commercial societies will be romanian 
the 12man faction of the democratic union of hungarians in 
romania charged this could be interpreted as not including romanian 
citizens who are not ethnic romanians but their proposal to 
explicitly extend the law to include romanians of other 
nationalities was rejected 
when the article was passed in its original form the 12 walked 
out in protest rompres later carried a government statement saying 
the article should say all romanian citizens irrespective of 
nationality could head companies but it was not clear whether 
the government was suggesting reworking the legislation and then 
voting on it anew 
sen zoltan hoszu of the democratic union said it is 
outrageous to have a romanian in charge of a company that is 
mostly hungarians 
the incident followed several days of tension between ethnic 
hungarians and romanians on sunday state television reported that 
several hungarians attempted to destroy a romanian flag on a statue 
and were arrested in tirgu mures site of bloody ethnic rioting in 
march that claimed six lives 
in the capital hungarians and romanians have been demonstrating 
this week before a school that was once exclusively hungarian with 
both sides charging discrimination 
there are 25 million hungarians in romania a nation of 23 
million residents most of them are in transylvania the 
northwestern part of romania that was controlled by hungary for 
centuries

former fbi agent richard miller was convicted 
of espionage tuesday for a second time by a judge who rejected 
millers claim that he romanced a soviet agent in the interest of 
the united states 
us district judge robert takasugi said he concluded that 
miller once intended to use his relationship with the soviet woman 
svetlana ogorodnikov to enhance his position with the fbi by 
becoming a double agent 
but the judge said that after mrs ogorodnikov enticed miller 
with money and sex the agent yielded to her demands for classified 
information 
in the battle of wills mr miller finally succumbed 
begrudgingly perhaps takasugi said he became entangled with 
svetlana and compromised his position in the fbi 
takasugi who presided over millers retrial without a jury 
said the most convincing evidence was a tape recording of miller 
and mrs ogorodnikov in a private conversation that was recorded by 
the fbi 
he said the tape clearly demonstrated her domination over the 
agent 
the court does find mr miller guilty of counts one through 
six the judge said of the six charges that alleged espionage 
conspiracy and communication of classified material for the benefit 
of a foreign power 
miller leaned forward on the defense table stared straight 
ahead and looked surprised 
sentencing was scheduled for jan 1 
the trial was millers third the jury in his first trial 
deadlocked and the guilty verdict in his second trial was 
overturned by an appeals court on grounds that lie detector 
evidence was improperly admitted 
as in both other trials the defense argued that the obese 
inept miller was not the classic picture of an fbi agent and that 
his failings led him to try to save his career by infiltrating the 
soviet kgb 
the prosecutor assistant us attorney adam schiff argued that 
miller was merely a victim of his own weaknesses and that he was 
ultimately led to espionage by his love affair with mrs 
ogorodnikov 
he was fascinated with svetlana ogorodnikov schiff argued 
she was exotic to him he went out and slept with her

the us armys 1st cavalry 
divison whose combat history stretches from last centurys 
frontier indian wars to vietnam has begun arriving in saudi 
arabia 
it is the latest addition to the mass us military buildup that 
began after iraq seized kuwait on aug 2 
advance units of the division based in fort hood texas have 
been in the country for three weeks and the main body of 17000 
troops is now arriving on the airlift from the united states 
the divisions m1 tanks bradley fighting vehicles helicopters 
and other heavy equipment will arrive by ship over the next week 
us military sources said 
the 1st cav as it is known is the last major army unit known 
to be marked for assignment to operation desert shield and will 
boost the us commitment close to if not beyond the 200000man 
mark the sources said 
the armys chief of staff gen carl e vuono told reporters 
during a visit to army units monday that the 1st cav was flowing 
in but he refused to discuss its deployment 
the division is the fourth elite us army unit deployed in 
operation desert shield and it brings with it part of a fifth 
the 82nd airborne 101st airborne and 24th mechanized infantry 
division sent earlier all have storied pasts so does the 2nd 
armored division whose tiger brigade of 3000 troops will 
round out the 1st cav as a fullsized division 
the 1st cav has served outside the united states for nearly 30 
years since the end of world war ii possibly an army record 
it was first organized as a division in 1921 at fort bliss 
texas drawing together some units that had already earned a niche 
in history and remain part of the 1st cav today 
among these are battalions of the 5th cavalry regiment which 
fought the american indians in the 1850s and the 7th cavalry a 
noted civil war regiment it later gained notoriety under gen 
george a custer at the battle of the lttle big horn in 1876 when 
the sioux and other indian tribes wiped out much of his command 
the 1st cav patrolled the mexican border in the 1920s and 30s 
during world war ii it retired its cavalry mounts to become 
infantry and joined the 1944 campaign to recapture the philippines 
from the japanese the division was the first unit to enter manila 
a claim it would repeat in tokyo and again during the korean war 
when its troops were first to reach the north korean capital of 
pyongyang 
after years of postwar occupation duty in japan the 1st cav 
returned to the united states to be called on again when 
hostilities escalated in vietnam in 1965 
by then it had become the armys first airmobile division 
applying a thenuntested concept of using helicopters instead of 
armored vehicles on a massive scale 
the 1st cav participated in many events that symbolized both the 
battlefield courage and the political controversy that marked the 
american role in indochina 
it relieved the siege of marines at khe sanh battled communist 
infiltrators along the cambodian border and was the main force in 
the 1970 incursion into cambodia to destroy north vietnamese 
sanctuaries 
in 1971 the 1st cav became the last full american combat unit 
to withdraw from vietnam

and one was decapitated authorities said 
in the assault case prosecutor philip williams saying mrs 
hlavaty was trying to protect her grandson sought to introduce her 
statements to brevard county sheriffs deputy douglas c hammack 
the deputy had answered an emergency 911 call from her home 
but brevard circuit judge theron a yawn rejected the testimony 
saying the hearsay account of her statements shouldnt be used 
since mrs hlavaty was available as a witness 
before the ruling hammack told the judge out of the jurys 
hearing that when he found mrs hlavaty her hair was matted with 
blood she was holding a bowl of ice on her face and her right eye 
was swollen shut

for soviet sports fans the fall classic has 
begun 
in a nation where chess is a national pastime the confrontation 
between soviet rivals garry kasparov and anatoly karpov is far 
bigger than anything on the american sports scene more colossal 
than dave stewart vs roger clemens or cincinnatis nasty boys 
against pittsburghs killer bs 
in world seriesstyle hype in the soviet press nearly every 
newspapers sports section tuesday was splashed with pregame 
photos and expectations of the matchup in new york 
duel of the giants begins the newspaper lenins banner said 
in a bold headline 
who will be smiling at the end of the match moskovsky 
komsomolets another paper asked the chessmad nation it showed 
the grinning visages of the bitter antagonists already likened by 
kasparov himself to an american sports feud on the order of 
baseballs yankees and red sox 
karpov kasparov who then wondered the vechernaya moskva 
newspaper with the large question mark inverted and wearing a 
crown 
the outcome of mondays first game a draw came too late for 
tuesday morning newspapers but soviet television carried full 
details 
a floating chessboard appeared on the nations tv screens 
following tuesdays midday newscast the pieces moving by 
themselves footage of kasparov and karpov appeared above it then 
dissolved into the words the world chess championship 
international grandmaster yevgeny vasyukov stood on a sparse set 
in a sweater vest and tie and spoke in soft tones 
the attention of world chess lovers is centered on new york 
where two outstanding soviet chess players world champion garry 
kasparovand former champion anatoly karpov are playing each other 
in their fifth meeting vasyukov said beginning his blowbyblow 
account of game 1 
it was a highly dramatic match and abounded in many 
interesting moments vasyukov said 
then he walked in front of a large board and played the game 
by moving the magnetic pieces as kasparov and karpov had done 
noting that karpov failed to develop a slight advantage due to 
several wasted chances 
the government newspaper izvestia was caught up in the glitz of 
the festivities before the first of 24 scheduled games between 
kasparov 27 and karpov 39 
smiling broadly like great actors they both energetically 
made their way up the stage of the famous hotel waldorf astoria 
black tail coats black bow ties on snowwhite shirts wrote 
correspondent alexander roshal 
according to the strict request of the organizers most famous 
american and foreign guest celebrities present were dressed 
likewise he wrote 
and ladies glittered in rich evening dresses in the light 
of a thousand candles 
small details of the tournament did not escape izvestias 
notice such as 13 being kasparovs lucky number and how since the 
age of 13 he has had that many members in his entourage karpov 
decided to counter by having the same number in his party it 
added 
the military newspaper krasnaya zvezda even carried the latest 
on a scandal in which one of kasparovs coaches supposedly was 
offered a 100000 bribe to disclose the champions strategies 
when kasparov coach zurab azmaiparashvili refused his apartment in 
tbilisi the capital of soviet georgia was burned 
but tbilisi police maj p lachkepyani said an investigation of 
the apartment showed only an empty liquor bottle scraps of the 
newspaper literaturnaya rossiya and a slightly burned front door 
the evidence does not give cause for legal procedures 
lachkepyani said calling the arson job amateurish 
his conclusion 
it was most probably a hooligan indifferent to chess but 
obviously eager to get some press the newspaper quoted him as 
saying 
equals 
editors note brian friedman is an ap correspondent in moscow 
he plans to be in his hometown of cincinnati later this week for 
the conclusion of the national league playoffs

blacks armed with knives went on a 
rampage tuesday and stabbed eight whites raising the specter of 
new racial violence authorities said 
about 20 young blacks stole knives from a store and began 
stabbing people along a street near the beach police said 
they were in a berserk state and were lashing out with knives 
at anyone who was near them witness robert trulock told the 
independent south african press association 
two suspects were shot and wounded by police and seven were 
arrested police said 
the attack may have been racially motivated said police lt 
nina barkhuizen police were investigating the possibility that 
some participants wore badges of the pan africanist congress a 
militant black opposition group she said 
despite deep racial divisions and widespread violence in south 
africa there have been few cases of blacks randomly attacking 
whites 
law and order minister adriaan vlok condemned the violence and 
called for private citizens to refrain from seeking revenge 
it might be somebody trying to provoke a reaction from the 
white population said thabo mbeki a spokesman for the african 
national congress 
the black youths took the knives from a store specializing in 
weapons from the far east barkhuizen said 
they then ran down a street next to the beachfront and stabbed 
whites witnesses said 
bleeding victims staggered into the lobby of the lonsdale hotel 
and collapsed in front of horrified guests 
eight people ranging in age from 15 to 85 were hospitalized 
with stab wounds barkhuizen said a hospital official said three 
of the white victims were in serious condition 
patrick lekota an anc official in durban called the attack a 
desperate attempt to discredit the liberation movement as a 
whole 
about 5000 blacks have been killed in factional fighting since 
1986 in natal province which includes durban but the violence has 
been almost exclusively in black areas pitting zulu supporters of 
the conservative inkatha movement against xhosas and other blacks

discoverys astronauts flush with 
success from a near perfect mission packed up their gear tuesday 
for their return to earth while the satellite they released 
streaked deeper into space 
the ulysses satellite which will study the sun was 17 million 
miles from earth three days into its fiveyear journey and hurtling 
through the solar system at more than 24000 mph 
discovery was scheduled to land at 957 am edt wednesday at 
edwards air force base calif to conclude nasas first shuttle 
flight in almost half a year good weather was expected 
this flight is probably as close to perfect as we can get 
said flight director ron dittemore 
the biggest problemoccurred tuesday when a heater on one of 
discoverys three auxiliary power units failed mission control in 
houston said a backup heater was activated and working fine the 
heaters could be operated manually if necessary 
discoverys commander richard n richards and pilot robert 
cabana completed a series of tests tuesday to make sure the 
shuttles systems were ready for the fiery descent into the earths 
atmosphere 
the astronauts later retracted discoverys 50footlong robot 
arm which was extended sunday as part of an experiment to measure 
the deteriorating effects of space on an intelsat satellite stuck 
in a useless low orbit attached to the boom is material identical 
to that used on the satellites solar panels 
intelsat an organization of countries that owns the 
communications satellite will study the amount of decay and decide 
whether it is worth sending astronauts on a rescue mission in 1992 
scientific data to date indicates the spacecraft would be 
salvageable 
the 157 million satellite is orbiting about 345 miles above 
earth 22000 miles lower than intended an unmanned rocket failed 
in march to boost the spacecraft to its proper altitude 
before stowing cabin gear astronauts bill shepherd and bruce 
melnick ran a third and final test of an experimental voice command 
system the system would allow astronauts to move shuttle tv 
cameras by spoken commands freeing their hands for other tasks 
shepherd had trouble getting the system to recognize his voice 
on his previous attempts he reported complete success tuesday 
after recording his voice again and speaking louder and more 
directly into a microphone 
the crew also wrapped up an experiment involving ozone 
measurements in low earth orbit the data will be used to calibrate 
ozonemeasuring instruments aboard weather satellites 
the highlight of the fourday mission came shortly after liftoff 
saturday when the astronauts started ulysses on its 186 
billionmile journey the satellite was accelerated out of earth 
orbit at 34130 mph the fastest speed ever for a manmade object 
the 250 million european spacecraft is expected to reach 
jupiter in february 1992 ulysses will use the planets strong 
gravity to sling it back through the solar system and into an 
unprecedented orbit over the suns poles 
it is expected to pass over the suns south pole in 1994 and the 
north pole in 1995 
the national aeronautics and space administration already 
preparing for its next shuttle flight had to move the columbia off 
the launch pad and back to the assembly building tuesday because of 
bad weather expected from tropical storm klaus columbia will 
remain inside until monday while atlantis will be rolled out to 
one of the two pads on thursday 
atlantis is due to fly next carrying a secret military cargo 
into orbit in early november the mission originally was scheduled 
for july but was delayed by the shuttles hydrogen leaks 
still to be performed are repairs to atlantis engine 
compartment damaged slightly by a metal beam that was left there 
by workers the 9footlong beam left about 25 dents and dings when 
it rattled around while the shuttle was being hoisted upright

israel sealed the temple mount for a day and 
imposed curfews in the occupied territories tuesday to contain arab 
fury over the killing of 19 palestinians at the hallowed site 
mondays bloodbath threatened to rekindle the palestinian 
uprising and thrust israel back into the spotlight at a time when 
the persian gulf crisis had given it a respite from international 
criticism of its policies 
prime minister yitzhak shamir rebuffed suggestions for a un 
security council investigation we wont accept it he told 
reporters 
while large parts of the occupied west bank and gaza strip were 
under curfews and village closures rioting erupted in three arab 
districts of jerusalem and in nazareth a mainly arab city inside 
israel 
in umm tuba on jerusalems southern outskirts two border 
policemen were stabbed with a screwdriver by arabs they stopped at 
a checkpoint as the car drove away the police fired hitting two 
occupants police said no one was seriously hurt police spokesman 
uzi sanduri said 
police fired tear gas to disperse dozens of activists who 
blocked roads in nazareth with rocks and garbage cans an arab 
reporter said 
masked youths shouting proiraqi slogans smashed a department 
stores windows and beat shoppers 
police seized the keys to the gates of the temple mount islams 
third holiest site and known to moslems as haram essharif and 
fired tear gas at moslems who tried to break through their cordon 
an arab reporter at the scene said 
jerusalems chief moslem cleric 80yearold saad aldin 
alalami was overcome by tear gas and carried away on a stretcher 
and hospitalized 
moslem leaders said the keys were returned after dark to allow 
evening prayers they said it was the first time israel has sealed 
the temple mount a compound containing the citys two main 
mosques 
it abuts the western wall also known as the wailing wall and 
is revered by jews as the site of their biblical temple moslems 
believe the prophet mohammed ascended to heaven from the site 
mondays incident was the worst in jerusalem since israel 
captured the citys arab sector from jordan in 1967 and was 
swiftly condemned by arab leaders throughout the world 
japan the european communitys executive body and the president 
of the european parliament also condemned the violence president 
bush said israel should have acted with more restraint 
amnesty international the international human rights 
organization based in london proposed a public judicial inquiry 
the vatican newspaper losservatore romano condemned 
indiscriminate killing in jerusalem and said the world is 
counting on new efforts to resolve the palestinian question 
the flareup came after a relative lull in the 34monthold 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule it began when moslems on 
the temple mount tossed a barrage of stones onto jews celebrating 
the sukkot festival at the western wall below 
the attack was provoked by rumors that jewish zealots planned to 
march on the mount and reclaim it for judaism 
police assurances to the contrary were ignored 
riot squads charged into the temple mount compound and 
according to israeli officials opened fire when they found 
themselves up against a mob of thousands 
police said about 140 arabs were wounded along with a 
halfdozen policemen and 28 jewish civilians hit by rocks 
thirtyseven arabs and five jews remained hospitalized tuesday 
according to hospital officials and police 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek accused the arabs of a planned 
and organized provocation but he also chastized jewish zealots 
who lay claim to the mount saying they exacerbated the arabs 
deepest fears and angers 
arab activists called a weeklong protest strike in the occupied 
territories and a twoday shutdown in israels arab towns 
israeli public reaction consisted of 
outrage at what was seen as a planned attack by moslem zealots 
on jews praying peacefully at their holiest shrine 
allegations that police failed to foresee the attack and take 
precautions that would have avoided fatalities 
fears that the incident would distract world attention from the 
gulf crisis and play into the hands of iraqs saddam hussein and 
his palestine liberation organization supporters 
shamir visiting a jewish settlement in the west bank said 
saddam was trying to turn this confrontation between iraq and the 
whole world into a confrontation between iraq and israel 
we have no interest in this and we will not help him to do 
this 
but leftwing legislator yair tzaban argued that those making 
that claim should also explain why they allowed such an 
escalation on both sides 
shamir said the rioters paid a heavy price in human life 
but this is exactly what their leaders and activists want they 
place no value on human life whether arab or jew 
he said israel would strengthen its hold in the occupied lands 
we will remain here establish and fortify our presence in all 
parts of the country no matter how angry it makes them this is 
our country our land 
police began an investigation into their conduct at the temple 
mount police commissioner yaacov terner rejected the allegations 
already leveled against his officers as simply not true 
he said he would not let the force become a punching bag for 
all sorts of things where we are guilty where we are 
responsible well take the blame 
jerusalem city councilor shmuel meir said whoever throws 
stones and rocks at policemen should know that hell get whats 
coming to him and he wont get home in one piece

the northrop corp maker of the b2 stealth 
bomber is plagued by widespread problems in its operation that 
federal investigators have not addressed in their inquiry an air 
force official said tuesday 
dismayed by what it considers northrops poor performance in 
production of several weapons the services assistant secretary for 
acquisition john welch jr ordered an indepth review of the 
company 
brig gen robert w drewes who led the eightman team that 
conducted the review told a house panel the californiabased 
company was beset by problems in nearly every aspect of its 
business 
drewes identified weaknesses in systems engineering the 
transition from research and development to production software 
management subcontract management organization and personnel and 
business systems which includes cost and schedule estimates 
name one northrop program that is in good shape based on what 
the air force or taxpayers tolerate rep ron wyden dore 
asked drewes 
all the programs i looked at there were some problems the 
air force official said 
a northrop spokesman who requested anonymity said the company 
is taking steps to correct problems 
we still have things to do but the recognition by the air 
force that changes have been made and are being made is a favorable 
indication of the direction the company is moving the spokesman 
said 
at the pentagon spokesman pete williams told reporters that 
northrop remains an important supplier to the united states and 
we will obviously look very closely at any problem we have with any 
contractor 
the air force review examined major northrop programs including 
the b2 the alq135 radar system for the f15 jet fighter and 
several classified programs 
drewes said however that his eightman team did not delve into 
problems associated with federal investigations of northrop 
justice department officials told the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on oversight and investigations in july that the 
california company should be barred from government business 
the officials described how northrop falsified reports on the 
airlaunched cruise missile and conducted improper tests on the 
harrier av8b jet the companys action led to its guilty plea in 
february on 34 charges of fraud and a fine of 17 million the 
largest criminal fine ever imposed on a defense contractor 
drewes told the panel he was not aware of the 34 charges against 
northrop prompting an angry response from several lawmakers 
do you all operate over there in a vacuum asked rep james 
slattery dkan 
drewes said he avoided areas that were the subject of ongoing or 
completed federal investigations to avoid complicating the 
inquiries

a twopenny tax on home heating oil and a 
delay in unemployment benefits two deficitcutting proposals that 
drew widespread objections are likely to be dropped from the plan 
about to be crafted in congress 
the impact on medicare recipients will almost certainly be 
cushioned but taxes on gasoline tobacco and alcohol almost 
certainly will rise by the time congress fills in the blanks on its 
500 billion deficit reduction package 
and a debate about which taxes to raise and whether to cut the 
capital gains tax will move to the front 
each proposed spending cut and tax increase will be debated 
intensely over the next 10 days as congress struggles to complete 
the deficit accord by an oct 19 deadline lawmakers involved in 
the effort predicted on tuesday 
its going to be the equal of the struggle weve had so far 
said rep bill frenzel rminn who has been in the middle of this 
years budget negotiations 
the plan will be crafted in more than a dozen congressional 
committees and in a congress where nerves have been frayed by 
months of grappling with the deficit the conservative and moderate 
wings of the house gop have clashed bitterly in recent weeks and 
many republicans feel wounded by what they considered rough 
lobbying by white house aides during last weeks fight over the 
first budget pact 
im nervous that its made republicans in the house less 
effective frenzel said 
whatever the difficulties there is no choice but to go ahead 
agreement between president bush and congress on the bare bones 
deficit agreement ended a budget impasse early tuesday and led to 
legislation restoring the federal governments ability to operate 
normally another shutdown is threatened for oct 19 if there is no 
agreement on the fine points of the 500 billion plan to cut 
domestic spending trim the military and raise taxes over five 
years 
some of the toughest bargaining is expected to be over taxes 
bush said for the first time tuesday that he could accept higher 
tax rates on the wealthy in exchange for a cut in the capital gains 
tax he has long campaigned for 
democrats have long resisted the cut in the capital gains tax 
rate unless it was blended with higher taxes on the wealthy 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said bush had 
apparently come around to our point of view and aides to sen 
lloyd bentsen chairman of the taxwriting senate finance 
committee said he was endorsing the changes as part of a 
deficitreduction plan on which the committee was to begin working 
wednesday 
in past years bentsen had endorsed taxing capital gains which 
are profits from the sale of investments at lower rates than 
apply to wages but he has opposed such a change recently because 
most of the benefit would go to those with incomes over 100000 a 
year 
republicans also will push for renewal of expiring tax 
provisions that help companies that perform research and 
experimentation and for housing credits for lowincome people 
democrats are serving notice they will seek deeper cuts in 
defense spending than the earlier plan envisioned is the 
military going to help with the burden sharing or not asked 
liberal rep george miller dcalif 
for their part republicans are expected to fight elsewhere for 
the deepest spending cuts possible and the most modest tax 
increases 
congressional negotiators will be building on the remains of a 
deficitreduction plan that was rejected last week in the house 
obviously were trying to get to where we dont hit the 
averageincome people so much said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
chairman of the taxwriting senate finance committee 
two items that prompted objections from house members last week 
are expected t be excluded from the final package according to 
lawmakers and aides who spoke on condition of anonymity 
one would have placed a 2centpergallon tax on homeheating 
oil and was vociferously opposed by lawmakers from northern 
states the other would have required states to delay unemployment 
benefits for two weeks an idea that drew cries from legislators 
from states where the economy is soft 
there is a general agreement that medicare which provides 
health care for the elderly and handicapped will end up taking a 
major hit 
the pact that bush and congressional leaders had agreed to would 
have slated medicare for 60 billion in savings half of it coming 
from reduced benefits and higher costs for participants lawmakers 
say the new package will probably reduce those cuts to the 40 
billion to 45 billion range with most of the savings coming from 
reduced payments to doctors and hospitals 
likely to remain in the plan are higher taxes on gasoline 
alcohol and tobacco although the amounts are up for grabs the 
reason for them remaining they were merely minor irritants when 
the house rejected the measure 
on the floor they werent much of a problem said rep rod 
chandler rwash a member of the house ways and means committee 
why do something for an area that wasnt much of a problem 
the rejected pact would have boosted the 9centpergallon 
gasoline tax by 12 cents and raised the 3centperbottle tax on 
wine to about 25 cents it would have added 8 cents to the 16 cent 
tax on a pack of cigarettes and brought the 16cent tax on beer 
sixpacks to 36 cents 
the new plan contains other broad categories of cuts that 
lawmakers will have to assign to specific programs agriculture 
stands to lose 13 billion over the next five years federal 
retirees are due an 8 billion reduction and the guarantee student 
loan programs is bracing for a 2 billion cut 
defense is another question the budget pact seemed to call for 
about 10 billion in military reductions next year bringing 
defense spending to about 296 billion but liberals say they would 
like to chop more out of pentagon spending

the swedish academy depleted by the 
resignation of three members and under fire for some of its past 
selections will announce the nobel prize in literature thursday 
the academy has refused to accept last years resignations of 
lars gyllensten kerstin ekman and werner aspenstrom saying 
members are named for life and academy prestige would be shattered 
if anyone were allowed to resign 
none of the three took part in this years deliberations and it 
is unclear whether their presence would have changed the decision 
gyllensten 69 who had been with the 18member academy for 23 
years and ms ekman at 57 its youngest member quit to protest 
the organizations reaction to iranian death threats against 
british author salman rushdie 
they said the academys general statement condemning censorship 
without referring specifically to rushdie was weak and politically 
motivated 
with them the 204yearold institution lost one of its most 
knowledgeable members and one of only two women 
author aspenstrom 71 said his reasons for resigning were 
different but indicated support for a stronger statement on the 
rushdie case 
the rushdiecase was the last drop but the crevice in trust 
had been deepening for some years gyllensten said as the academy 
made its final decision on who will win the 4 million kronor 
704000 prize 
ms ekman said that if the more conservative majority continued 
to regard expression of new opinions as a challenge to its power 
the old institution would become sterile 
gyllensten has said the academy should become more active in the 
issues being debated in modern literary circles 
the academy has been pressured for years to award the prize to a 
woman six female laureates have been chosen since the prize was 
first awarded in 1901 under an endowment from alfred nobel the 
swedish inventor of dynamite 
swedishgerman writer nelly sachs was the last woman winner in 
1966 
nobel specified in his 1896 will that the prizes should be 
awarded with no regard to nationality the most frequent criticism 
of the academy however has been that it focused on the 
accomplishments of western european and north american writers 
the academy took steps in the last two decades to draw attention 
to authors who write for a limited language group but drew fire 
for that too 
it selected an arablanguage writer naguib mahfouz for the 
first time in 1988 critics then noted that no chinese writer has 
ever been chosen despite chinas 3000yearold literary 
tradition 
the academy says it never considers politics its citations for 
mahfouz and for last years winner spaniard camilo jose cela draw 
attention however to works their governments had banned 
british author anthony burgess has complained that the prize is 
awarded on the strength of a single book although the academy says 
it is for the authors body of work 
it is inevitably one novel that sticks in the jurys 
collective brain burgess wrote in a magazine article this month 
the wrong novel has consistently been chosen 
king gustav iii founded the academy in 1786 to protect and 
promote swedish language and literature it has maintained a 
tradition of grandeur and secrecy behind the 18thcentury walls of 
the stock exchange building in stockholms old town 
caj lundgren culture editor at the svenska dagbladet daily 
said the academy has always been the target of criticism simply 
because its an ancient type of institution 
it has been criticized for being oldfashioned and 
stifflegged and some may take the rift as a kind of proof 
for this others see it as a sign of life that members actually 
protest and ask to leave

sexual harassment of female students at the 
naval academy is widespread and some victims dont complain openly 
for fear of reprisal according to an internal academy report 
released tuesday 
in such a climate it is not surprising that some midshipmen 
have lost the ability to distinguish a blatant incident of sexual 
harassment from routine pranks it said 
the report by a sevenmember panel of academy faculty military 
staff and midshipmen said immediate action is needed to correct the 
conditions allowing mistreatment of women 
most midshipmen readily acknowledge women midshipmen are not 
accepted as equals in the academy said the report by the 
academys women midshipmen study group this lack of acceptance 
has created an environment in which steady lowlevel sexual 
harassment passes as normal operating procedure in company areas 
and classrooms alike 
the report was one of several special inquiries prompted by a 
hazing incident at the academy last december in which a female 
student was handcuffed by male midshipmen to a urinal as other men 
jeered and took photographs the woman gwen m dreyer a 
secondyear student resigned from the academy last may citing her 
humiliation and anger at the way the academy responded to it 
the navy on tuesday released copies of the internal report as 
well as other studies that were reviewed by a special committee 
appointed by the academys board of visitors the committee was 
comprised of board chairman james m cannon sen barbara mikulski 
dmd rep helen d bentley rmd and other outsiders 
mrs mikulski issued a statement urging swift action to correct 
conditions at the annapolis institution 
there is a real and continuing problem at the us naval 
academy she said women are neither accepted as equals nor 
treated with respect the annapolis administration from the top 
down must act swiftly and decisively to end this harassment 
mrs mikulski said she was troubled by the investigators 
finding that a vocal minority of midshipmen officers staff and 
graduates believe women should not be midshipmen 
this attitude is antiquated unrealistic and unacceptable 
she said 
at the pentagon navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii said 
prompt action will be forthcoming to address the concerns 
raised by the inquiry reports 
i am confident that as the result of these exhaustive studies 
necessary corrective actions will enable the naval academy to build 
on its impressive 145year history with a renewed sense of purpose

a woman accused of counterespionage for 
the former east german government had access to toplevel 
intelligence reports and could represent the most serious 
infiltration by a foreign agent a magazine reported tuesday 
the hamburgbased stern magazine identified the woman only as 
gabriele g 47 and said she had worked since 1973 in the 
former west german intelligence services headquarters in pullach 
near munich where secret reports were regularly prepared they 
included weekly intelligence summaries for chancellor helmut kohl 
the woman was arrested sept 30 following a tip from the former 
east german secret police the magazine reported 
the report quoted security experts as saying the womans 
activities were far more serious than the 1974 case of spy guenter 
guillaume who worked as a top aide for former chancellor willy 
brandt 
revelations that guillaume was an east german agent forced 
brandts resignation 
also tuesday german television reported there was another 
serious espionage case in the federal office for the defense of the 
constitution but did not provide details 
stern said the woman apparently began working for the east 
german secret police in 1968 when she completed her political 
science doctorate and paid a visit to east germany 
the magazine said the suspect routinely made copies of the 
secret reports and gave them to the stasi the name of the east 
german intelligence service 
for the investigators the only question that remains open is 
whether former east german state security chief erich mielke 
received the west german intelligence service report to read before 
or after helmut kohl stern said 
excerpts from the report which will appear in sterns thursday 
editions were provided early to some news media 
a spokesman for the chief federal prosecutors office in 
karlsruhe confirmed a stern report that the office had sought the 
arrest of gabriele g on suspicion of high treason which 
carries a maximum sentence of life in prison 
however the investigating judge issuing the arrest warrant 
reduced that to secret agent activities spokesman 
hansjuergen foerster said 
foerster said the investigation against the suspect is 
continuing and that it is still not clear what level of charges 
would be filed 
but we do see it as a very grave case the spokesman said 
retired us army sgt clyde lee conrad has been the only spy 
sentenced to life in prison by a west german court since world war 
ii 
conrad was convicted in june of passing military secrets to 
hungary and czechoslovakia from 1975 to 1985 in return for 12 
million 
foerster declined to comment on the other case reported by the 
ard television network on its evening news program but said that 
his office was likely to make a statement on wednesday

on the spot where lenin once spoke the focus 
tuesday was on lennon 
official newspapers which once denounced the beatles as harmful 
pests from the decadent west joined a worldwide celebration and 
ran stories of tribute about the late john lennon who would have 
turned 50 on tuesday state radio broadcast his music and 
interviews about him 
two concerts devoted to the songwriter guitarist and singer 
who was shot to death in 1980 were held in moscow 
even the staid state television program vremya got into act 
an anchorman more accustomed to reading official government news 
reported on the worldwide lennon birthday bash and called his song 
imagine an anthem of peace the broadcast ended with an 
instrumental version of yesterday playing as temperatures from 
around the nation rolled across the screen 
the celebration was a dramatic turnabout from soviet 
authorities repression of beatles fans and supression of their 
music in earlier times their music was banned and the soviet press 
condemned them a 1964 article for instance commented these 
bugs can swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions 
about 1000 soviets mostly second generation beatles fans 
flocked to the moscow electrical lamp factorys cultural hall in 
northeastern part of the city to rejoice in lennons music a 
plaque outside the hall reminded beatles fans that lennons near 
namesake vladimir lenin the founder of the soviet state had 
spoken at the spot in 1917 and 1919 
inside fans listened to recordings of lennons music attended 
a concert of about a dozen soviet rock bands bought his albums and 
posters and reflected on his life 
hes like a hero a symbol for every person a symbol of 
honesty talent devotion to his ideals notion of love equality 
between people and goodness said irina dykomkina the 
21yearold secretary of the sgt peppers club a soviet beatles 
fan club formed two years ago 
lennons music she said crosses borders easily 
his music is so sincere its so understandable even to 
people who dont know english they feel the music 
andrei trushkin a correspondent for komsomolskaya pravda the 
communist party youth newspaper that devoted a full page tuesday to 
lennon said he appeals to soviet youth in part because he was a 
rebel like many of them and was a difficult teenager 
the cops would have locked him up many times said trushkin 
who helped organize the concert 
tuesdays concert opened in the spirit of a birthday party 
balloons floated down from the balconies as a tape of lennons 
song starting over played the stage was adorned with a 
painting of lennon and lifesize cardboard cutouts of the fab four 
in front of the british flag 
oorah oorah shouted the audience which included a few 
soldiers in uniform onstage the groups sprint quiet hour and 
optimal variant played in beatles style but were joined by a group 
that didnt quite fit in the genre an americanstyle country 
ensemble that wore plaid vests and performed night train to 
memphis

the state department is looking into setting 
up consulates in soviet republics where strong independence 
movements have emerged and expects to have an office in kiev within 
a few weeks an official said tuesday 
each office would likely mean a new soviet consulate in an 
american city outside washington because the soviet foreign affairs 
ministry would insist on reciprocity said assistant secretary of 
state raymond seitz 
a soviet consulate is to be opened in new york when the kiev 
office is approved he said 
consuls are officials who represent their government on all 
kinds of affairs not connected with the diplomatic 
governmenttogovernment dialogue for example issuing travel 
visas replacing lost passports or finding lawyers for those 
arrested they are generally supervised by the embassy in the 
capital 
this is an idea whose time has come seitz told the house 
foreign affairs committee 
were considering recognizing that there are now centers that 
are taking on their own characteristics in the soviet union and 
that a presence there would be helpful and interesting from our 
point of view seitz said 
seitz said that no formal talks are under way to establish other 
consulates but the idea has been raised in a very informal 
manner 
the soviets currently have an embassy in washington a mission 
to the united nations in new york and a consulate in san francisco 
the united states has a moscow embassy and a consulate in 
leningrad 
the kiev office would be in the heart of the ukraine which 
recently has declared its residents immune from conscription into 
the soviet military 
seitz said six months ago the ukraine was one of the last 
regions analysts expected to show a breakaway spirit he said us 
officials have been trying to set up a consular office there for 
more than 10 years 
my guess is that if all of these trends continue for the next 
three or four years we will see a soviet union almost 
unrecognizable from the one that we have become familiar with 
seitz said 
he said conditions vary for each of the unions constituent 
republics but now each of them has declared a degree of a kind of 
sovereignty 
us officials have regular contact with leaders of the 15 
soviet republics whenever they can have access to them he said 
seitz said if consulates are set up in leading regional cities 
they would likely be only small offices of two or three people 
without any classified operations 
he said consulates could be established in the baltic states 
among others the united states has never formally recognized the 
1940 soviet annexations of independent latvia lithuania and 
estonia and still accredits diplomats representing the last 
independent governments at legations and consulates in the united 
states 
seitz said conditions in lithuania after the republics leaders 
declared independence from the central government earlier this year 
seems to have passed the crisis point a trade embargo by 
moscow has been lifted and dialogue has begun seitz noted 
asked about reports that soviet president mikhail gorbachev is 
losing control seitz noted that the soviet leader has acquired new 
decreemaking powers and added it becomes a regular event to 
speculate about mr gorbachevs future before each grand challenges 
that he faces and after each grand challenge he emerges with his 
political authority intact

gov kay orr said tuesday she wont campaign 
for reelection in a county bitterly divided over a proposed 
radioactive waste warehouse because her life has been threatened 
boyd county a sparsely populated ranching area on the states 
northern edge has been in turmoil since officials began 
considering it as a possible home for lowlevel radioactive waste 
from five states a rancher who opposes the plan is on a hunger 
strike 
the nebraska state patrol said a letter was received in early 
august that contained some implied threats patrol spokesman 
jeff hanson declined to release any further details saying the 
matter was under investigation 
hanson said the letter lacked some elements needed before 
authorities could charge anyone with making terroristic threats 
orr spokesman doug parrott said he understands that the threat 
is related to the nuclear waste dispute 
mrs orr said she knows who made the threat but wouldnt 
disclose the name she said she had hoped the situation in boyd 
county wouldnt deteriorate to the point of threats 
there are a lot of things that you consider when you step into 
a public office mrs orr said i think most of it was pretty 
well understood by bill her husband and me 
its dismaying to think that we have gotten to this point that 
people lose faith and confidence in their government 
the proposed waste site lies about two miles outside butte a 
village of about 500 people supporters have welcomed the money the 
dump may bring opponents have said they fear accidents and 
longterm effects of the radioactive waste 
us ecology a waste site developer chosen by the central 
interstate lowlevel radioactive waste compact commission has 
applied to the state for permits to build the waste warehouse 
the reinforced concrete warehouse near the south dakota border 
would hold waste from the five states that make up the commission 
nebraska arkansas louisiana oklahoma and kansas 
democratic gubernatorial candidate ben nelsons campaign 
manager sonny foster said it was the first he had heard of any 
threat against mrs orr he said it had absolutely nothing to 
do with the nelson campaign 
i think that i can say on the behalf of ben nelson that we 
dont feel that threatening people is part of the political process 
and theres no way that ben nelson would ever condone that kind of 
activity foster said 
nelson has visited boyd county and has said that he is concerned 
about the diisions in the community foster said 
one rancher who opposes the waste site has been on a hunger 
strike for more than three weeks 
lowell fisher of spencer who said tuesday he had lost 29 pounds 
since his fast began on sept 17 said he didnt believe the threat 
against mrs orr was a serious one 
i think its stupid but if you have enough people who are 
emotionally upset they say something fisher said 
fisher said he intends to continue his wateronly diet until the 
governor tells the waste compact commission that the community 
objects to the waste site or holds a special election to see if 
there is 
an aide to the governor has said mrs orr lacks the power to 
call such an election and noted that the village board has 
supported the waste site plans

michelangelos creation of adam painted on 
the ceiling of the vaticans sistine chapel contains an image 
misunderstood for 478 years a huge brain that symbolizes god 
bestowing intellect on man a doctor says 
the fresco completed in 1512 for pope julius ii shows adam and 
god reaching toward one another arms outstretched fingers almost 
touching many scholars have interpreted the painting to mean god 
bestowed life on man 
but frank lynn meshberger a doctor at st johns medical center 
in anderson ind says adams eyes are already open suggesting 
hes alive he contends michelangelo intended the painting to 
portray god giving man the gift of intellect 
look at the image that surrounds god and the angels 
meshberger wrote in wednesdays journal of the american medical 
association this image is the shape of a brain 
one art historian was skeptical 
holy mackerel i never heard tell of such a thing said olan 
rand a professor of art at northwestern university in evanston 
i always thought it was a cloak rand said tuesday id 
better go look at it again 
meshberger said his conclusion is obvious particularly if you 
studied a picture of the fresco following classes on dissecting a 
human brain he had just finished dissecting and drawing a brain in 
a medical school class in 1969 when he happened across a threepage 
foldout photo of the painting in a magazine 
meshberger said he waited 20 years to publish an article on it 
because he was busy establishing himself as a doctor and had little 
time to do research on michelangelos background 
as a medical student i was quite busy and at the time 
thought it was an interesting observation but didnt have time to 
look into it he said 
meshberger said that when he began researching the question 
years later he learned that michelangelo had deep religious 
beliefs and used to dissect cadavers to study the human form for 
his art 
other art lovers might have reached the same conclusion before 
this century except they didnt have the benefit of the clear 
images seen in modern photography meshberger said he also said 
artists who would have had access to the painting generally werent 
skilled in anatomy 
he plans to give a lecture on his theory at a twoday science 
reporters conference in boston this week and expects doctors 
attending to debate his interpretation

tropical storm klaus ended with a whimper off 
floridas atlantic coast tuesday causing no damage but bringing 
welcome rain to the droughtparched state 
klaus ran into a low pressure area over cuba and tore apart 
pulling its top wind speed down to no more than 35 mph said bob 
sheets director of the national hurricane center 
at the same time tropical storm lili in the mid atlantic 
weakened and lost its center and rotation although it still had 
high wind it was reclassified a nontropical storm front the 
hurricane center said 
klaus left six dead and more than 500 homeless on the island of 
martinique during its trek through the caribbean and briefly was 
classified as a minimal hurricane 
but other than coastal erosion and blustery weather that left 
beaches treacherous the systems effect on the united states was 
expected to be positive 
the good news is its going to bring a lot of rain over 
florida said sheets 
the state has suffered two years of drought and while rain has 
returned to normal in some parts of florida the water supply is 
still so low that even klaus remnants are not expected to end the 
shortage said ann overton spokeswoman for the south florida water 
management district 
by the last hurricane center advisory at noon edt tuesday the 
depression left by klaus was centered near 240 north latitude and 
760 west longitude or about 115 miles southeast of nassau in the 
bahamas it was heading westnorthwest at about 15 mph and was 
expected to continue on that course

the supreme court refused tuesday to hear an 
appeal of a lower court ruling that a federal plan for natural gas 
pipeline companies to recover lost revenues is illegal 
federal regulators must now devise a new plan for pipeline 
companies to recover millions of dollars in losses dating back 
nearly a decade 
retail natural gas prices in some areas may increase while 
elsewhere they could be unaffected or decline slightly depending on 
the federal energy regulatory commissions new cost recovery plan 
industry experts said 
the issue involves attempts by natural gas pipeline companies to 
charge customers often utilities for costs incurred in the late 
1970s and early 80s when gas supplies fluctuated dramatically and 
pipelines were tied into binding contracts that required them to 
buy gas they no longer needed 
the pipeline companies are trying to regain more than 35 
billion by imposing surcharges under a complex recovery plan 
approved by the ferc 
that plan however was found to be illegal by a federal appeals 
court 
a spokeswoman for ferc said the agency would have no comment on 
the court decision except to say that staff members were trying to 
work out a new cost recovery plan as directed by the appeals court 
we are disappointed by the supreme courts denial of the 
petition said jerald halvorsen president of the interstate 
natural gas association which represents natural gas pipeline 
companies many of the pipeline companies had welcomed the ferc 
recovery plan as a way to assure at least partial recovery of the 
costs they incurred during the early 1980s 
the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
had said in a case involving the tennessee gas pipeline co that 
the companys surcharge under the ferc plan amounted to a 
retroactive rate increase and was illegal 
the case involved only tennessee gas but is expected to serve 
as a precedent in other cases involving pipelines industry experts 
said tennessee gas has sought the recovery of about 300 million 
attorneys familiar with the case said 
the surcharges imposed by tennessee gas had been challenged by a 
number of utilities and another pipeline the columbia gas 
transmission corp which buys gas from tennessee gas and sells it 
to utilities they argued that they were required under the ferc 
formula to assume too much of the costrecovery burden while other 
utilities were paying no surcharge 
columbia gas serves utilities across much of the midatlantic 
states into new england and as far west as ohio and kentucky

gov rudy perpich who bristles at news 
stories about his own family says his opponents dispute over 
childsupport payments is fair political game because his rival 
lacks a record in public office 
the democratic governor said tuesday he has no intention of 
backing off from his strategy republican challenger jon grunseth 
says it amounts to character assassination 
i have a public record and he doesnt said perpich who has 
held office for 30 of the last 34 years including a record 10year 
stint as governor 
what he does as a private citizen reflects on what hell do i 
think as governor perpich said of his campaign references to 
grunseths court battles with his former wife over child support 
so im saying he wasnt meeting his family obligations his 
first family it took four court orders 
grunseth said much of his dispute with his first wife stems from 
his decision to withhold 50 a month from his 1700 monthly 
maintenance payments to protest her refusal to remove their 
daughter from the minneapolis childrens theatre school where a 
sex abuse scandal had surfaced 
the governor said grunseth invited the close scrutiny by saying 
during a debate in august with his primary opponents that my life 
is an open book 
perpich said he is not trying to make a campaign issue out of 
grunseth being divorced theres a lot of people who are 
divorced even my own brother he said 
in 1974 the last time he ran for office grunseth made a bid 
for a us house seat but came up short with 45 percent of the 
vote 
grunseth a 44yearold businessman said he deeply resents 
perpichs attempts to publicize his court dispute with his first 
wife grunseth was divorced in 1983 and remarried in 1984 
i think that hes engaging in willful and deliberate character 
assassination grunseth said 
perpich supporters also have claimed grunseth was late on 
several property tax payments over a 16year period but grunseth 
aides say he wasnt responsible fr most of the delinquencies 
charles backstrom a political science professor at the 
university of minnesota for 30 years said he cant recall a 
gubernatorial campaign where so much attention has been devoted to 
a candidates personal life 
the governor has objected strongly in the past to news stories 
focusing on his family late last year angered by a newspaper 
article that suggested they family lived in too grand a style 
perpich and his wife lola proposed selling the governors mansion 
and giving the proceeds to the homeless 
next perpich turned in his leased lincoln town car after a 
television reporter called it a limousine then after a newspaper 
reported that the state patrol had given his daughter rides to 
concerts stores and her office he canceled his bodyguard 
in the current campaign perpich also has called for grunseth to

a former cabinet minister who 
resigned after likening the european community to hitler said 
tuesday that member nations neglected their responsibilities in 
persian gulf crisis because they are obsessed with closer 
political union 
some member states did not want to get involved in the 
international force many were tardy in their response to it 
said former trade and industry secretary nicholas ridley at the 
annual conference of the governing conservative party 
it shows that many on the continent remain obsessed by 
political union neglecting their responsibilities toward the rest 
of the world he said 
earlier party chairman kenneth baker opened the fourday 
conference by saying britain had proved itself americas most loyal 
ally in the gulf 
we are not a nation that shirks its duty that forsakes its 
friends baker told the 5000 delegates who gathered in a 
seafront convention center under tight security prompted by fears 
of an irish republican army attack 
in our long history weve had to take up burdens which others 
have found too heavy added baker and when an old ally and 
friend the united states of america calls for our help they do 
not call in vain 
britain the first western us ally to send units to the gulf 
after iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 projects its force in the gulf 
could reach 15000 troops 
ridley a member of parliament and close associate of prime 
minister margaret thatcher reiterated the antigerman overtones of 
his remarks in july when he accused germany of pushing ec monetary 
union as a means of dominating europe and said giving up britains 
sovereignty would be like surrendering to the nazis 
he said tuesday that a single currency for the european 
community would be a disaster 
the history of western europe cannot be belied said ridley 
germany has always striven first to unite germanspeaking people 
and then to build up its strength which tends to dominate the 
western half of the continent 
baker and other cabinet ministers defended the governments 
decision last week to link the pound to the communitys other major 
currencies the move fulfilled britains obligation to the first 
stage of a plan for economic and monetary union 
european commission president jacques delors has expressed fears 
that britain will still attempt to block the proposed final stages 
including a single currency and one central banking system 
in addition to britain ec members include belgium denmark 
france germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the 
netherlands spain and portugal 
as the conservative party meetings began sharpshooters were 
posted on the roof of the convention center and truckloads of 
police reinforcements rolled through bournemouth about 100 miles 
southwest of london 
fears of an ira assassination attempt on mrs thatcher have 
grown since the group killed a close thatcher political associate 
in a july car bombing and attempted to kill a government minister 
by planting a bomb at london conference last month 
the ira which is fighting to end british rule in northern 
ireland exploded a bomb in the hotel where mrs thatcher was 
staying during the 1984 conservative conference killing five 
people 
the conservative government which has trailed labor in opinion 
poll ratings for more than a year seeks to lower interest rates 
and inflation now 106 percent before the next election 
on monday the government lowered interest rates one point to 14 
percent mrs thatcher must call an election by mid1992 but she 
may do so next year if inflation and interest rates fall

muscovites might one day visit a soviet version 
of the hotel president bush officially calls home 
a sovietborn entrepreneur who lives in houston says he has 
reached agreement with moscow city officials to develop a 300room 
houstonian hotel with health center about two miles from the 
kremlin 
the project would be named the houstonian because soviets tend 
to associate quality with anything from the united states alex 
genin said monday many soviet citizens are familiar with houston 
because of nasas johnson space center he said 
president bush lists the texas houstonian not the white house 
as his official address 
and genin managing director of eastern credit limited said 
soviet tourism officials recently visited houstons houstonian 
hotel and liked it 
the land and buildings would be owned by the government and 
leased to the hotel operators for 50 years genin said the 
business would be a joint venture between the soviet government and 
eastern credit

greenpeace complained tuesday that soviet 
officials were ignoring their requests about the fate of 34 
activists and a ship seized by the kgb near a soviet nuclear 
weapons test site 
those seized monday included four activists who were last seen 
heading toward the test site at novaya zemlya in the barents sea 
said rebecca johnson spokeswoman for the world environmentalist 
organization in london 
greenpeace identified the four as ted wood of hollywood calif 
jorn haye of germany jeane ni ghormain of ireland and bjoern 
okern of norway 
we are being stonewalled by the soviet authorities ms 
johnson said their refusal to answer to the status of our ship 
parallels their refusal to talk about nuclear testing 
the ship with 28 western activists and six soviets aboard had 
permission to tour the soviet arctic greenpeace said 
soviet officials have not commented since monday when the 
official tass news agency said a coast guard icebreaker under 
command of the kgb intelligence service fired across the bow of 
the motor vessel greenpeace off novaya zemlya and seized the craft 
tass said the ship would be taken to the kola gulf for an 
inquiry but gave no details about the crew 
they were seized just after the four were dispatched to the 
island to trek several miles to the test site which greenpeace 
asserts is being used despite soviet assures of a unilateral 
moratorium on weapons tests the four carried radios and radiation 
detection equipment to try to document the tests and protest 
against them ms johnson said 
she said greenpeace representatives met tuesday in moscow with 
soviet officials including a kgb press officer but got no 
answers 
on monday foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said the 
vessel was detained for deliberate violation of the state border 
of the ussr failure to obey border authorities landing people 
at unpermitted places and an attempt to enter an area closed to 
navigation 
before communications with the ship were lost greenpeace 
activist steve shallhorn said from oslo norway that about 15 
border guards had boarded the 190foot dutchregistered vessel he 
said the icebreaker threatened to fire on the greenpeace ship 
which was about four miles from the twoisland group 
ms johnson who is international test ban coordinator for 
greenpeace in london said we informed the soviets early on that 
we were sending people ashore 
our expectation is that everyone is in fact safe but we want 
communication back with the ship so we can verify that she said 
she said greenpeace planned to ask the us british dutch and 
german governments for help 
the soviets had told greenpeace to steer clear of novaya zemlya 
which is about 370 miles from norway and was a primary soviet 
nuclear test site from 1958 to 1963 environmental groups claim it 
was last used in 1988 
on tuesday a member of the parliament of the russian 
federation the largest soviet republic demanded that authorities 
investigate plans to test nuclear devices at novaya zemlya the 
independent news agency interfax reported

president bush appeared to open the door 
tuesday to higher income taxes on the wealthy as part of a budget 
compromise but later abandoned that strategy under pressure from 
republican senators senators and officials said 
the quick turnabout came after bush met with gop senators and 
was told not to try to trade lower capital gains taxes which he 
wants for higher income taxes on the wealthiest americans which 
democrats want 
bush initially voiced a new readiness to bargain with 
congressional democrats on the longdivisive tax issue after 
signing a temporary spending bill that ended a threeday government 
shutdown the agreement gives congress until oct 19 to come up 
with a new 500 billion fiveyear deficitreduction package 
at a morning news conference bush had said for the first time 
he could accept higher income taxes on affluent taxpayers at 
some level ifit were coupled with a reduction in capitalgains 
taxes however republican leaders warned bush away from that idea 
after a lateafternoon meeting between bush and gop lawmakers 
sen bob packwood rore said we all put up our hands and 
said no deal on tax rates at all he bush just acquiesced in 
it 
capital gains which are profits from the sale of assets such as 
houses or corporate stock currently are taxed at the same rate as 
ordinary income the administration has argued that a lower tax 
rate would stimulate the economy democrats have countered that 
most of the benefits would go to the wealthy 
although he declined to discuss details at the news conference 
bush had clearly indicated he could support a compromise coupling 
higher taxes on the wealthiest americans in exchange for the cut in 
capitalgains tax rates that he has long sought 
thats on the table thats been talked about and if its 
proper if it can be worked in proper balance between the capital 
gains rate and income tax changes fine bush said 
but later republican leaders said they cautioned bush against 
pursuing such a trade suggesting democrats would never agree to 
drop capitalgains taxe rates low enough to make the bargain 
worthwhile 
the president agreed our uniform position was that we will 
not go up on the income tax rates no matter what said 
packwood the senior republican on the senate finance committee 
he said bush asked the senate gop leaders at the meeting if they 
would hold fast to such a position and to the man in the room 
every single person said we will support that packwood said 
stop trying to buy us off with capital gains were not going 
to change that summit agreement said sen ted stevens ralaska 
at a remark directed at democrats 
a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said that bush told the gop leaders that he did not want 
to raise the marginal tax rate that is the tax rate on the last 
extra dollar of income sometimes called the tax bracket if 
he couldnt get a capital gains rate cut at an acceptable 
level 
the marginal rate for the wealthiest americans is 28 percent 
these guys said youre not going to get it and he bush 
said fine we dont need either one of them theres nothing 
in it for us the official said 
basically what they told him was youre not going to get the 
kind of capital gains cut you want the president said he didnt 
want to raise the rates and the conclusion was to forget all of it 
capital gains and the change in the top rate 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine earlier hailed 
bushs seeming turnabout 
i have personally advocated an increased tax rate on those 
making more than 200000 a year for some time and im pleased 
that the president has now come around or apparently come around 
to our point of view and to recognize fairness of such a change 
mitchell said 
and aides to sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the 
taxwriting senate finance committee said he would ask the panel 
to accept the idea 
bush promised to do everything in my power to make sure 
congress comes up with a fiveyear deficit reduction package that 
matches the 500 billion goal of an earlier package supported by 
the president and congressional leaders but rejected in the house 
bush also apologized to the valiant federal work force and 
others inconvenienced by a threeday government shutdown and 
continuing budget uncertainty 
after vetoing an earlier stopgap spending bill on saturday bush 
gave his early morning signature to a new temporary spending bill 
that keeps the government operating until oct 19 while congress 
tries to come up with the budget accord 
the presidents signature just hours before the bulk of the 
governments 24 million work force was to return from a threeday 
holiday weekend averted a widespread disruption in government 
services 
the governments authority to spend money expired at 1201 am 
saturday however the impact of the shutdown was largely confined 
to museums monuments and other federal institutions open on 
weekends 
bush said he signed the new measure while vetoing the first one 
because both chambers subsequently had passed a framework budget 
agreement 
however congress now must fill in gaping blanks in the 
agreement 
on saturday morning i said we cannot have business as usual 
but the congress has finally acted and we are back on course 
bush told a news conference at the white house 
he told the news conference he was open minded about 
coupling a lower capitalgains tax with ending the current taxcode 
anomaly under which some americans pay a 33 percent marginal income 
tax rate while even wealthier ones pay only a 28 percent rate 
in the past the administration has never publicly supported 
proposals to end this socalled tax bubble by raising the top 
rate to 33 percent 
a proposal to trade off capital gains and the top tax rate is 
currently being advanced by some democratic leaders including 
house ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski dill and senate 
finance chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
the nowrepudiated budget agreement backed by bush would have 
raised excise taxes on gasoline cigarettes and liquor and certain 
luxury items but would not have affected income tax rates

youths late tuesday torched a tobacco shop 
and a store in the shopping center of a lowincome suburb in the 
fourth straight night of unrest but police said the situation was 
under control 
a group of youths made a protective chain around firemen putting 
out the blazes in the shopping complex at vaulxenvelin a heavily 
immigrant community east of lyon the police said 
the situation was far from that of the previous three nights 
when hundreds of stonethrowing rioting youths set fire to 20 
buildings and burned two dozen cars police used tear gas to keep 
them at bay 
the youths protecting firemen told reporters they were seeking 
an end to the violence and wanted outside troublemakers out 
about 700 police were deployed in the community outside lyon 
after rioting started saturday night centered in the lowincome 
complex known as mas du taureau 
the rioting was triggered by the death earlier saturday of 
thomas claudio 21 a passenger on a motorcycle that collided with 
a police patrol car 
police claim the motorcycles driver panicked and lost control 
of the vehicle when he saw the patrol car but the driver laurent 
assebille said police caused the accident by stopping their car 
suddenly in his path 
local officials along with the youths blamed police for the 
unrest claiming they routinely harrassed youthful residents with 
humiliating identity checks 
social affairs minister claude evin visiting vaulxenvelin on 
tuesday met with local officials and called for a dialogue between 
youth and police 
premier michel rocard said the problem stemmed partly from a 
lack of communication between different social sectors in france 
hubert prevot the government official in charge of immigration 
said the susceptibility of the youth was understandable 
even if it was not reasonable 
in 1981 lyons heavily immigrant bluecollar suburbs were the 
scene of the worst riots in france in recent times 
most of lyons immigrants are from southern europe and north 
africa

the hippest fashion accessory for kids the 
slap wrap bracelet has been banned at two public elementary 
schools on the grounds that their sharp edges could cause injury 
when slapped against the wrist the lowbudget bracelet grabs on 
and wraps around to become an instant wristband its a flat 
9inch long steel spring resembling a ruler wrapped in eyegrabbing 
neon fabric 
principal joseph longobardi said tuesday he was prohibiting his 
pupils at colonial and siwanoy schools from wearing them during 
school hours because if the fabric wears away a sharp edge can be 
exposed and lacerate hands and arms 
but gene murtha president of main street toy of simsbury 
conn which makes the original slap wrap and sells it for 
249 said his product hasnt caused any injuries he blamed cheap 
imitations made in taiwan and illegally sold in the united states 
for reported injuries 
the metal is inferior lowgrade caliber steel with poor 
quality fabric he said the sealing is also inferior the 
steel can either break through or snap through and cause injury 
murtha said his bracelets are made of highgrade steel with 
rounded rather than sharp edges and a doubleknit fabric that is 
tightly sealed 
he claimed the cheap products were pirated and legal action is 
difficult but ceaseanddesist letters against the illegal 
products have been issued nationwide and seizures of them by us 
customs have also begun 
longobardi who is principal of two of the four elementary 
schools in the pelham school district sent a letter to parents 
last week advising them of the possible dangers and asked them to 
keep the pop toy at home 
i have four kids of my own longobardi said i know how 
popular these things are but the possibility of injury does 
exist because of that sharp cutting edge 
longobardi said he decided to ban the toy after hearing of 
injuries in the west orchard elementary school in nearby chappaqua 
officials there said a pupil who had removed the material 
covering required three stitches in her hand after she was cut with 
an exposed bracelet edge 
west orchards principal dr frederick wilhelm ordered his 
teachers to confiscate any slap bracelets missing the fabric cover 
but did not impose a broad ban 
main street toy has shipped out nearly 1 million of its 
bracelets since the fad started this summer

prosecutors in the obscenity trial 
of bawdy rap group 2 live crew failed tuesday to have the judge 
dismissed because a defense lawyer was her law professor 15 years 
ago 
luther campbell chris wongwon and mark ross face misdemeanor 
charges stemming from a june 11 adultsonly performance at a 
nightclub in nearby hollywood if convicted the miamibased 
rappers could be sentenced to up to a year in jail and fined 
1000 
the first two days of the trial have been devoted largely to 
motions and and challenges over jury selection 
defense attorney bruce rogow challenged broward countys 
voterbased jury pool as unconstitutional in cases that depend on 
community standards like obscenity but broward county judge june 
johnson said she wanted to see the whole 70person pool before 
ruling on the defense motion 
prosecutors on monday asked the judge to step down noting that 
rogow taught her law at nearby nova university in the mid1970s 
johnson refused saying she lost touch with rogow after the class 
prosecutors appealed the decision before circuit judge george 
brescher but he denied the challenge tuesday saying the motion 
lacked a required document and was filed too late 
i think what the state has done is try to interfere with this 
case getting to trial rogow said this was utterly frivolous 
and i think in bad taste 
rogow also represented charles freeman a black record store 
owner convicted of obscenity last week by an allwhite jury for 
selling the groups album as nasty as they wanna be 
a sixmember panel is to be chosen from 70 prospects requested 
by the judge no jurors had been selected by the end of tuesdays 
session although about 25 had been questioned 
jury selection is expected to take several days 
only three of 25 potential jurors questioned monday were black 
and potential jurors interviewed by early tuesday afternoon 
included three blacks music by the black group is aimed 
principally at a young black audience 
jury composition is particularly sensitive because obscenity 
cases are decided on the basis of how the panel defines community 
standards 
the album which us district judge jose gonzalez earlier ruled 
obscene has sold about 2 million copies 
most obscenity cases are argued on the us supreme courts 
miller v california test essentially it holds that material is 
obscene if the average person applying contemporary local 
community standards would find that it is designed to cause sexual 
arousal if it depicts sex in a patently offensive way and if 
taken as a whole it lacks serious literary artistic political or 
scientific value 
campbell the leader of 2 live crew told reporters he was 
unhappy with the way jury selection was going i need young 
people and black people he said

charges that two former police generals 
ordered the murder of a solidarity priest are the first major 
prosecution of polands old guard and officially reopen a case most 
poles never considered closed 
the arrests in the case of the rev jerzy popieluszko come six 
years after the crime that shocked the nation and at the outset of 
a presidential race in which prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis 
careful treatment of former communists is being challenged by lech 
walesa 
on monday authorities also disclosed that a former interior 
minister and six other officials have been accused of taking bribes 
of gold and jewelry dating to 1971 
in cases of clear crimes party people will be punished if 
proven these people will be condemned aleksander smolar a 
senior adviser to mazowiecki told an american society of newspaper 
editors delegation tuesday 
at a walesa campaign rally in warsaw on tuesday a spectator 
challenged the timing of the arrests right now before the 
elections scheduled for nov 25 
but smolar said there was absolutely no political 
calculation in the arrests which he said were ordered by 
independent courts 
he said there would be no departure from the governments basic 
policy that our evolution to democracy should be as peaceful as 
possible trying to reconcile the two parts of poland rather 
than waging a cold civil war against former communists 
smolar said he recognized that the prosecutions of former police 
officials would prove popular because of the feeling of 
bitterness and injustice after 45 years of communism 
there is a need of a clear moral condemnation everybody needs 
it for a sort of catharsis smolar said however he added most 
poles understand the wisdom of avoiding purges 
those interior ministry records that survived destruction the 
mazowiecki government did not take steps to prevent the burning of 
documents will not be opened to show who cooperated with the 
secret police smolar said 
it is extremely dangerous and destroys the nation to judge 
people for their weaknesses in very harsh times when only 
heroes were able to survive with dignity he said 
the 1984 kidnapping and murder of the 37yearold popieluszko 
whose body was pulled from a river gave a martyr to the 
thenunderground solidarity movement the communists were trying to 
crush many polish households still display photographs of the 
priest that were put up during the 1980s as a sign of protest 
four secret policemen from the interior ministrys fourth 
department the unit responsible for spying on the roman catholic 
church and clergy were tried and convicted in popieluszkos death 
two have been paroled 
but no involvement was found on the part of higher authorities 
a conclusion that satisfied few and came to symbolize ruthless 
communism 
something unprecedented has happened jerzy jachowicz an 
expert on the security services wrote of the arrests tuesday in a 
frontpage gazeta wyborcza commentary 
the two generals former deputy interior minister wladyslaw 
ciaston and zenon platek former head of the fourth department 
were charged with plotting the priests slaying during september 
and october 1984 and directing the oct 19 1984 killing officials 
said 
prosecutors said the corruption charges were unrelated to the 
killing but among those arrested was onetime interior minister 
miroslaw milewski a former communist party politburo member who 
was central committee secretary in charge of internal affairs when 
popieluszko was murdered 
after the slaying milewski was quietly dismissed 
milewski was given the party posts after being replaced as 
interior minister by gen czeslaw kiszczak in 1981 during 
solidaritys first legal period 
kiszczak a communist holdover in the solidarity government 
until he resigned last summer told polish television in september 
that he believed the priests killers could not have acted 
without the inspiration of someone standing higher then them 
he suggested the crime was committed by those aiming to 
destabilize the reformoriented communist government of 
thenparty leader gen wojciech jaruzelski now the outgoing 
president 
on polish television tuesday kiszczak said he believes ciaston 
and platek who worked for him are innocent he said the 
corruption charges against milewski were investigated in may 1984 
and a thorough report was given to superiors but he did not 
elaborate 
the popieluszko case was reopened july 24 three weeks after 
kiszczaks resignation by the office for the protection of the 
state the smaller and tightly controlled agency that replaced the 
disbanded secret police 
the arrests made since thursday open a new chapter in the 
case the government daily rzeczpospolita said 
the direct perpetrators of a crime were already judged 
however unanswered questions still remain the newspaper said 
the corruption inquiry which also targets two unidentified 
other generals and two colonels involves acceptance of bribes of 
great value including many kilograms of gold and jewelry 
prosecutor general aleksander herzog said 
the alleged crimes span the period from 1971 when milewski was 
a deputy interior minister to 1981 herzog said

the supreme court on tuesday revived a 4 
billion libel suit in which a millionaire inventor says an abc 
television program falsely portrayed him as a liar and hypocrite 
the justices told a federal appeals court to restudy arthur 
jones suit against american broadcasting companies over a 1987 
report by the 2020 tv program about the fate of 63 baby 
elephants jones rescued from death in africa 
the justices said the case should be reconsidered in light of 
their ruling last june that the constitutions guarantee of free 
speech did not create a wholesale defamation exemption for 
anything that might be labeled opinion 
the june decision however did not strip away constitutional 
immunity for pure expressions of opinion that cannot be proved true 
or false 
jones the inventor of nautilus exercise machines was the 
subject of the 2020 broadcast in 1984 the year he airlifted 
the 63 elephants from zimbabwe to the ocala fla farm he calls 
jumbolair 
the elephants had been marked for death as part of a culling or 
herd thinning operation 
the elephants lived on jones ocala estate until the summer of 
1986 when the herd began to be dispersed 
the 1987 report aired by 2020 looked back at the 1984 
broadcast and was preceded by a comment by host barbara walters 
that it would discuss the fate o some baby elephants to whom a 
promise was not kept 
according to jones suit that comment and others contained in 
the report falsely cast him as a liar and a hypocrite and 
accused him of animal cruelty 
lower courts dismissed the suit ruling that the suedover 
comment were not defamatory or were expressions of opinion not 
fact

the latest in a series of violent land 
disputes has left at least one peasant dead and several others 
injured officials said tuesday 
frank cesar spokesman for the interior ministry said caroos 
eurarios died monday in a shootout when police tried to dislodge 
peasants from a private farm they had seized near yasica sur 75 
miles north of the capital 
police capt mario medina deputy chief of national police in

shootout although cesar said the death had not yet been confirmed 
the officials said about 12 police tried to evict 30 peasant 
families led by former contra guerrillas from a private farm 
cesar said at least four other people were wounded but 
information up to this moment is confused and we are 
investigating further 
about 20000 contra rebels were demobilized in june after the 
sandinista government they had opposed was defeated at the polls 
but the end of the civil war has led to a series of local conflicts 
involving former rebels of the usbacked group demanding land 
at least four peasants died and eight were wounded last week 
when prosandinista peasants battled with exrebels over land in 
the northern province of matagalpa 
in a similar incident monday a group of peasants destroyed a 
car owned by farmer eduardo callejas when he tried to recover land 
confiscated in 1980 by the sandinistas who turned it into a 
cooperative for 50 families 
former rebel chief israel galeano said tuesday over state radio 
nicaragua that the government should form regional commissions to 
solve the problem 
he said members of the ruling united national opposition and the 
sandinistas are acting irresponsibly to incite peasants from both 
sides to take lands

discussions of higher taxes on the wealthy in 
exchange for lower taxes on capital gains have focused on an oddity 
in the federal tax code the socalled bubble that finds rates 
in the top tax bracket lower than in the bracket immediately before 
it 
the marginal tax rate the tax rate paid on each extra dollar 
of income is different in each tax bracket 
currently single taxpayers face a marginal rate of 15 percent 
on adjusted gross income income after deductions and exemptions 
from zero up to 18500 
for incomes between 18500 and 44900 the marginal tax rate 
is 28 percent and it is 33 percent between 44900 and 93130

a muchcoveted trophy for the fastest crossing of 
the atlantic by a passenger vessel arrived tuesday from the united 
states after an american company decided to drop its challenge to 
the record 
three months ago a seacat catamaran built and owned by the 
british company hoverspeed ltd set a record of 3 days 7 hours 
and 54 minutes for the 2740mile crossing from cape cod mass to 
bishops rock 
the crossing by the hoverspeed great britain beat the previous 
record by 2 hours 
the previous record holders us lines inc questioned the new 
record and objected to the revolutionary design of the british 
craft for a while it seemed the dispute would be taken to court 
we got the best legal advice and the conditions of the trust 
are quite clear said commander michael ranker secretary of the 
trustees for the blue riband award 
in the end i think the americans decided they did not have a 
leg to stand on and could not afford protracted litigation he 
said 
the us company released the trophy on thursday and it arrived 
at heathrow airport early tuesday 
the award represented by the hales trophy since 1935 has not 
been held by the british for 38 years it will be presented by the 
blue riband trustees to the seacat owners in a few weeks 
the hales trophy was last won by the ss united states of the 
us lines inc in 1952 it had recently been on exhibit in a long 
island ny museum 
the onyx and silver trophy presented in 1935 by harold hales a 
member of parliament stands near 4 feet high and is worth about

a psychiatrist testified tuesday that 
the motherly bond should be paramount in a custody battle over an 
infant that a surrogate mother agreed to carry for a childless 
couple for 10000 
a judge was to continue hearing testimony wednesday about who 
should get custody of the threeweekold boy 
mark and crispina calvert who hired anna johnson to bear their 
baby and supplied the sperm and egg have temporary custody ms 
johnson claims they neglected her and the couple contends she 
wanted more money 
attorneys in the case say it is unique because the surrogate has 
no genetic link to the baby she wants to keep in the 
muchpublicized baby m case in new jersey the surrogate mother was 
also the babys genetic mother 
one witness called by ms johnsons lawyers was david 
chamberlain a california psychologist and vice president of the 
prenatal and perinatal psychology association of america he wrote 
babies remember birth 
chamberlain testified about his hypnosis experiments that show 
children can remember their birth and have memories of experiences 
in the womb 
the relationship between a birth mother and a child is extremely 
close chamberlain said nothing could be closer than a baby in 
utero and a birth mother chamberlain said 
psychiatrist michelle harrison a teacher at the university of 
pittsburgh and a consultant to the national coalition against 
surrogacy said she counseled johnson by telephone five or six 
times during her pregnancy 
the natural mother is the woman who gives birth to the child 
and that includes whether or not the child is of her genetic 
origins she testified in orange county superior court 
she said ms johnson feared losing the baby but seemed to cling 
to the idea that society would recognize the child as hers 
ms johnson has been granted twiceweekly visits with the baby 
the psychiatrist said ms johnson believes the child recognizes her 
by smell feels safe with her and attempts to nurse 
however she also said she has never seen the baby with either 
the surrogate mother or the calverts and couldnt judge either 
sides attachment to the child 
christian van deusen the calverts attorney asked ms harrison 
about a letter ms johnson wrote to the couple during her 
pregnancy 
the letter read in part i am asking you for help in paying 
off the final 5000 once this baby is born my hands are free of 
this deal but see this situation can go two ways one you can 
pay me the whole sum early so i dont have to live in the streets 
or two you can forget about helping me out calling it a breach of 
contract and not get the baby 
ms harrison said the letter didnt affect her opinion of ms 
johnsons concern for the baby she said pregnant women under 
stress say and do a lot of things to keep the baby 
harold laflamme the babys courtappointed attorney questioned 
the psychiatrist about the propriety of counseling by phone she 
said she believed it was appropriate because of the unusual 
circumstances 
ms johnson who worked with mrs calvert at a hospital in this 
southern california city was hired by the couple to bear their 
child because a hysterectomy prevents mrs calvert from carrying a 
baby

saddam hussein announced tuesday that iraq had added another 
missile to its arsenal and he said it could be launched against 
the targets of evil when the day of reckoning comes 
the iraqi leader made it clear he was referring to israel and 
the usled forces massed in saudi arabia to deter further iraqi 
aggression following the invasion of kuwait 
iraq has other missiles that can travel hundreds of miles and it 
was not clear what the significance of a new one would be 
saddam appeared to use the occasion to try to exploit the deaths 
monday of 19 palestinians in jerusalem to whip up support for his 
seizure of kuwait 
us armed forces radio took to the airwaves tuesday with live 
broadcasts and rock n roll blared across the saudi desert 
the first song on desert shield network fm 107 brought the 
troops a little closer to home the clashs rock the casbah 
about a fight over boogie sound in a traditional middle eastern 
city 
the pentagon said the navy continued to search for eight marines 
whose two helicopters disappeared monday over the north arabian sea 
during a training exercise rescue teams located debris from one of 
the aircraft on monday but no bodies 
the marines released the names of the missing servicemen 
tuesday but marines spokeswoman maj nancy lalunta in washington 
declined to say whether the men are presumed dead 
the missing men were identified as capt gary s dillon capt 
william d cronin jr capt kevin r dolvin capt william j 
hurley sgt kenneth t keller sgt john r kilkus cpl timothy

based at camp pendleton calif

a us embassy official in baghdad said that a uschartered 
iraqi jetliner will evacuate about 350 more americans wednesday 
most passengers will be transported from kuwait to the airport

estimated 400 americans and foreignborn family members will be on

tumbled 7822 points or 31 percent to close at 244554 it was 
the dow averages 11th worst point drop after the fall of 8661

japans governing party was to present a proposal to a special 
session of parliament friday that would allow military forces to 
help with un peacekeeping efforts in the persian gulf and to be 
armed in case they were attacked a party source said 
the proposal would allow japanese forces to be sent overseas for 
the first time since world war ii force overseas is barred by the 
countrys constitution and japan has been criticized for not doing 
enough in the current crisis 
a spokesman for soviet president mikhail gorbachev expressed 
optimism over a settlement to the gulf crisis following a meeting 
friday between saddam and a soviet envoy 
vitaly ignatenko would not give details but said gorbachev would 
nform president bush by letter of the latest soviet diplomacy 
the gulf crisis began when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 since 
then saddam has linked withdrawal from kuwait with an israeli 
pullout from arab territories captured in 1967 
saddam made his announcement about the new iraqi missile in a 
statement read by an announcer on baghdad radio 
the new missile is called the alhijara or stone apparently in 
honor of palestinians in the israelioccupied territories who throw 
stones at soldiers palestinians are among sadddams staunchest 
supporters 
mondays bloodshed in jerusalem occurred when police opened fire 
on palestinians who hurled stones at jews worshiping at the western 
wall the wall is just below the temple mount which is sacred to 
both jews and moslems and there had been rumors that jewush 
zealots were planning to march on the mount 
addressing israel saddam said the faithful palestinians 
faced up to you with stones which no power on earth can 
withhold from those who wish to use them 
they are the stones of the new missile which the iraqis have 
invented with the help of almighty god and which can be launched 
from somewhere in the land of iraq to reach the targets of evil 
when the day of reckoning comes saddam said 
he again demanded that israel withdraw from the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip and that the united states remove its troops 
from the region 
there is no way out for you except to leave the land of 
palestine and the sanctities of the arabs just as there is no way 
out for the armies of america and its allies except to leave the 
holy land of the arabs and moslems saddam said 
there is room only for this otherwise you will get what you 
will get 
the statement gave no details on how many of the reported 
missiles iraq has whether they have been deployed or what kind of 
warhead they can carry 
it was not possible to obtain independent verification of 
saddams claim 
but don kerr a weapons analyst at londons international 
institute for strategic studies said the claim would not be 
outlandish 
iraq has had considerable success with surfacetosurface 
missiles mostly derivatives of the sovietmade scud kerr said 
in a telephone interview 
iraqs alhussein missile has a range of 310 to 370 miles and 
the alabbas missile a range of 500 to 560 miles he said 
last december iraq testfired its tammuz missile a threestage 
rocket ostensibly designed to lift satellites into lower orbit 
kerr noted 
the thing to remember about a firework that will put a 
satellite into orbit is that will send a warhead much farther than 
a few hundred miles on the flat he said 
but iraqs missile guidance systems are questionable kerr said 
and those used have not been too impressive

a kuwaiti lawyer who fled to bahrain said 
tuesday that a few of the 15 proiranian terrorists whose release 
was a key demand of lebanese hostagetakers now are hunted men 
inside kuwait 
the lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity because of 
family in kuwait said some of the 11 iaqis three lebanese and 
one kuwaiti escaped to iran and lebanon but others remained in 
kuwait 
all 15 were shiite moslems and most belonged to iraqs aldawa 
group seeking to topple saddam hussein they were convicted in the 
1983 bombings of the us and french embassies in kuwait 
the islamic jihad organization in lebanon repeatedly demanded 
release of their fellow shiites from prison in kuwait as a 
condition for freeing western hostages 
they are no different from the americans now the lawyer 
said of the former prisoners still in kuwait they are hiding 
from the iraqis if they catch them they will consider them prize 
hostages to trade with the americans 
i saw two or three in kuwait met them in mosques or at 
various houses 
he said those with iranian or lebanese connections fled as 
soon as they could after the aug 2 invasion of kuwait by iraq 
shortly after the invasion kuwaiti prison guards fled and the 
iraqis opened the doors to the jails wanting chaos the lawyer 
said 
he said the escapees were not gloating about what happened 
to kuwait 
they entered jail because of saddam hussein he went on 
they repeatedly say they have nothing against kuwait that their 
bombing raids were meant to alert kuwait that it was wrong to 
support him wrong to make enemies with iran against iraq and 
history has proved us right 
seventeen men were jailed in the bombings two were released 
last year after completing fiveyear sentences 
the lawyer was among the latest group of kuwaitis to make it 
through the saudi border at khafji that reopened over the weekend 
he estimated about 100000 kuwaitis remained in what iraq now 
calls its 19th province that was far lower than other estimates of 
300000 
some want to die there there is no food no medicine 
no antibiotics any more 
he said there were iraqi soldiers at all intersections 
checking cars and identity he said there was haphazard 
searching of houses they search for arms used by the resistance 
pictures of the emir and the americans and westerners that 
kuwaitis hide 
its getting worse and worse please help he said 
kuwait contained about 19 million people before the invasion 
about 60 percent of them nonkuwaitis many foreigners fled 
the lawyer said kuwaiti resistance fighters were trying to 
expand operations to outlying areas and to iraq itself but a 
bullet from a house means the whole area is burned down by the 
iraqis 
he said one kuwaiti officer used as a bodyguard for visiting 
dignitaries was suspected of resistance and was killed after being 
tortured his mutilated body thrown in front of his house

a university of florida freshman listed 
as a suspect in the slayings of five students confessed to 
battering his grandmother and asked repeatedly why did i do 
it an ambulance driver testified tuesday 
edward lewis humphrey jailed on a 1 million bond is charged 
with aggravated battery in the aug 30 assault on elna hlavaty at 
her indialantic home 
the alleged assault occurred the weekend after four women 
students and one male student were stabbed to death in their 
offcampus apartments in gainesville three of the women were 
mutilated and one was decapitated authorities said 
no one has been charged in the killings and humphrey has been 
listed as one of several suspects 
in the assault case prosecutors suffered a setback when the 
judge refused to allow them to introduce as evidence police 
accounts of statements the grandmother allegedly made the night she 
was battered at her home 
mrs hlavaty has said she cant remember what happened and 
doesnt believe her grandson attacked her 
prosecutor philip williams saying mrs hlavaty was trying to 
protect her grandson sought to introduce her statements but 
brevard circuit judge theron a yawn rejected the testimony saying 
the hearsay account of her statements shouldnt be used since mrs 
hlavaty was available as a witness 
ambulance driver cliff cooper who took mrs hlavaty to the 
hospital testified that he heard humphrey repeatedly say why 
did i do it 
brevard county deputy sheriff doug hammack who also answered an 
emergency 911 call to her home testified that he heard humphrey 
say i hit her and im sorry im going to kill myself 
the prosecution rested its case tuesday the defense planned to 
call more witnesses wednesday 
public defender jr russo said the state had failed to link 
humphrey to the actual injuries inflicted on his grandmother and 
failed to prove she suffered a permanent injury or that there was 
great bodily harm 
without a doubt none of those factors have been proved by the 
state russo said adding that they are required for conviction 
on aggravated battery charges 
before the ruling hammack told the judge with the jury outside 
the courtroom that when he found mrs hlavaty her hair was matted 
with blood she was holding a bowl of ice on her face and her right 
eye was swollen shut 
he hit me i cant believe he did this to me the officer 
quoted her as saying when asked who did it she replied 
edward 
dr jeri fitts the first witness in the trial said he examined 
mrs hlavaty in the hospital he said she suffered a broken facial 
bone under her eye and a possible broken jaw along with numerous 
contusions 
he denied the injuries could have been caused by a fall as she 
later said testifying it would have taken three or four blows to 
cause that much damage 
later in defense testimony two ophthalmologists who examined 
mrs hlavaty and a radiologist who looked at two sets of xrays 
said they found no evidence of the fracture below her eyeball 
if convicted of aggravated battery on a person over the age of 
65 humphrey would be sentenced to at least three years in prison 
without parole he also faces unrelated charges of attempted rape 
in indian river county and assault in alachua county

called out and curfews clamped on several towns to control rioting 
students joined sometimes by housewives and government employees 
two members of singhs governing party have resigned from 
parliament and some colleagues demanded his ouster because of the 
quotas singh has refused to abandon the policy saying it is an 
affirmative action program that would give social justice to the 
lower castes 
critics say he fears alienating the lower castes which form a 
majority of the eligible votes among indias 880 million people

them of government jobs for which they believe themselves to be 
better qualified 
the plan reserves 27 percent of federal jobs for lowcaste

the government of malawi is suppressing dissent by 
detaining torturing and murdering political opponents a human 
rights organization said wednesday 
africa watch urged the west to cut aid to presidentforlife 
kamuzu bandas government which it likened to regimes such as 
the late nicolae ceausescus in romania and kim ilsungs in north 
korea 
the us government has criticized the detention of malawian 
poet jack mapanje but also has substantially increased military 
assistance to the southern african country the past two years 
africa watch said 
britain has a stated policy of linking aid to africa with human 
rights but it has apparently not made such a connection in the 
case of malawi the group said 
malawi a former british protectorate gained independence in 
1964 banda took office in july 1966 and became life president five 
years later 
in a 116page report to be published wednesday africa watch 
said there is a totalitarian suppression of all independent 
expression with a high degree of personal despotism by the 
lifepresident and his official hostess cecilia tamanda 
kadzamira 
the report says malawian police in march fatally shot more than 
20 protesters in kawale a suburb of the capital city of lilongwe 
other political murders included the death of journalist and 
human rights monitor mkwapatira mhango who died in a firebomb 
attack in lusaka zambia in october 1989 along with his family 
africa watch reported 
only weeks earlier he had been publicly denounced by banda 
the report said 
africa watch said it gathered testimony showing that three 
cabinet ministers and a legislator who died mysteriously in 1983 
were murdered while in official custody 
the four favored electoral and decisionmaking reform africa 
watch said the government said they died in a car accident 
the report said detention without trial is also an important 
weapon against dissent 
presidential detention powers are arbitrary with no 
possibility of administrative or judicial review the report 
said 
africa watch also accused the government of discriminating 
against people living in the northern region of the nation of about 
71 million residents banda and his associates are from the 
central region 
africa watch said political prisoners are reported to have been 
severely beaten 
but the worst treatment is reserved for persistent criminal 
offenders it said 
according to testimony these prisoners are stripped 
naked chained to the floor of their cells and either denied food 
or given onequarter rations many are reported to have died 
africa watch has been denied access to the prisons 
africa watch is part of human rights watch an nonprofit 
organization with regional divisions monitoring asia the americas 
and africa

the soviet legislature on tuesday followed the 
lead of the us senate by unanimously adopting limits on nuclear 
weapons testing embodied in two treaties from the 1970s 
the supreme soviet went beyond the senate appealing to 
parliaments around the world to ban nuclear testing and repeating 
the kremlin proposal for global nuclear disarmament 
the significance of the treaties has waned since the 1970s 
today the superpowers are preparing to seal one pact to cut their 
nuclear arsenals and another to scale back conventional forces in 
europe 
additionally environmental protests might force the soviets to 
unilaterally suspend nuclear testing on monday kgb border guards 
boarded a greenpeace vessel in the arctic after it dispatched 
environmentalists to go ashore to a nuclear test site 
earlier this year public pressure forced the soviet government 
to suspend testing at its main site semipalatinsk in kazakhstan 
maj gen anatoly koltunov a member of the parliament of the 
russian federation the largest of the 15 soviet republics 
demanded tuesday that authorities investigate plans to test nuclear 
devices at novaya zemlya the independent news agency interfax 
reported 
in the kremlin on tuesday soviet lawmakers voted 3470 with 
nine abstentions to approve the 1974 threshold test ban treaty 
which limits weapons tests to 150 kilotons and the 1976 peaceful 
nuclear explosions treaty which places the same limits on 
explosions for engineering purposes 
adoption of the treaties was slowed because former president 
carter wanted a more sweeping ban on testing and his successor 
former president reagan did not believe the technology existed to 
verify compliance 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev cleared 
the way for ratification at their last summit by agreeing to a new 
set of verification rules 
supporters say the new verification measures are likely to set 
important precedents for further reducing or banning nuclear tests 
in approving the treaties the soviet parliament asked its 
international and national security committees to review questions 
stemming from four reservations that the senate attached to the 
pacts 
a us senate aide contacted in washington said none of the 
reservations was serious enough for the soviets to really care 
about 
one of the reservations authorized the us joint chiefs of 
staff to make plans to test above the 150kiloton limit if the 
soviets break the treaty said the senate aide who spoke on 
condition he not be further identified 
the second urges the united states to begin negotiations 
immediately to lower the ceiling the third commits the 
administration not to change its interpretation of the treaties 
and the fourth requires the government to notify the senate if the 
means of verification change 
the treaties focus mainly on verification methods and allow 
each country to maintain onsite monitoring equipment at three 
sites on each others soil

a cambodian guerrilla leader has asked 
france and indonesia to intervene to help reopen peace talks 
between the guerrillas and the vietnameseinstalled government in 
phnom penh 
a guerrilla radio broadcast said son sann suggested france and 
indonesia help break the stalemate over cambodias supreme national 
council a national reconciliation body by participating in its 
next meeting 
he said the cambodians could resolve their dispute by asking the 
two nations which cochaired the international conference on 
cambodia in august 1989 to interpret the documents of the five 
permanent members of the un security council and of the 
cambodians in talks in indonesia 
a transcript of the sunday broadcast was seen tuesday in 
bangkok 
son sann heads the khmer peoples national liberation front 
which is allied in a resistance coalition with the khmer rouge and 
the forces of prince norodom sihanouk in fighting the government 
vietnam installed after a late 1978 invasion 
the supreme national council is supposed to send a joint 
delegation to the united nations arrange the first truce in the 
war and eventually guide the nation to democracy through new 
elections 
but its first meeting in bangkok on sept 17 collapsed in 
squabbling over opposition demands that sihanouk a former head of 
state and the coalition leader join the council as its chairman 
the guerrillas have rejected the governments demand that if 
sihanouk became chairman the government side should have the vice 
chairmanship 
a security council plan adopted in august said that should 
prince norodom sihanouk be elected by the snc as its president the 
five would welcome this decision 
the five permanent members of the security council are britain 
china france the soviet union and the united states 
the joint communique in indonesia where the supreme national 
council was formed on sept 10 with six government members and six 
guerrilla members said that if the 12 members of the snc so 
desire they could elect a chairman who would be the 13th member 
the problem was largely due to sihanouks failure to attend the 
indonesia talks he stayed at his beijing home saying he was ill

report detailing arbitrary arrests and torture of hundreds of 
people in and around oinam village in northeast manipur state in

bargain hunters by the thousands 
descended on an anchorage industrial lot tuesday to pick through 
acres of gear unloaded by exxon after two summers of oilspill 
cleanup 
you really realize the size of the spill by all the garbage 
that came out of it said anchorage aviation mechanic rod meeks 
who bought two outboard boat motors at the auction 
many failed to find the deals they had hoped for however and 
blamed it on the crowd 
we were looking for anything but theres too many people 
bidding high said doug parr a construction consultant who flew 
to anchorage from seattle for the threeday sale he hoped prices 
would come down after the first day 
it looked like the day before christmas at the worlds biggest 
bargain basement 
parked cars lined the roads for miles in all directions ritchie 
bros auctioneers international which bought the merchandise last 
month from exxon corp for a price ritchie officials would only 
describe as millions ran shuttle buses into the site 
there an auctioneer was driven through the throngs in a booth 
atop a truck stopping here to sell dozens of allterrain vehicles 
there for pallet after pallet of brandnew fishing nets somewhere 
else for containers filled with flotsam from life jackets to 
tables and chairs 
half the yard seemed filled with boats aluminum skiffs 
inflatable power boats 
inside a hangar pallets reached to the ceiling containing more 
stuff outdoor thermometers clothing even kitty litter 
and the site was just one of three filled with surplus 
merchandise from the exxon valdez oilspill cleanup effort 
the tanker ran aground in alaskas prince william sound in march 
1989 and spewed nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil in the 
nations biggest oil spill exxon crews worked that summer and this 
one to clean shorelines and plan to return next spring for a 
shoreline survey 
exxon officials said they didnt sell any equipment that could 
be used for additional cleanup 
ritchie bros wouldnt say how much it expects the merchandise 
to bring nearly 8000 potential bidders had signed up by midday 
tuesday and by the end of the day company officials said 
everything on the first lot had been sold for a total of 38 
million 
a 1966 turboprop float plane with an old esso tiger painted on 
its tail sold for 435000 to an undisclosed bidder new the plane 
would cost about 700000 several airtaxi company officials in 
the crowd said 
four used television sets sold for 2000 a price some 
frustrated buyers said was too high 
a welding machine went for five or six thousand dollars i 
can buy a new one for seven and it has a warranty said steve 
pittillo of anchorage a drilling contractor who looked 
unsuccessfully for equipment 
butch johnson from the prince william sound fishing community 
of cordova hoped to buy some nets but feared they would be too 
expensive its a feeding frenzy he said 
its the biggest thing happening in alaska said a kodiak 
fisherman who wouldnt give his name prices are way out of line 
the people we know the fishermen arent buying anything 
theyre just shaking their heads 
dan league pastor of the hillcrest church of the nazarene in 
anchorage planned to bid on tables and stack chairs for their 
sunday school classes 
melissa stevison coowner of alpine aviation in valdez flew in 
to buy one of 38 valdez mobile homes on sale so the company can 
have more office space 
others were there to see what effect the auction would have on 
their livelihoods 
phil lian owner of a net supply store in cordova angrily 
pulled out a notebook listing dozens of his customers whom he 
spotted at the auction 
he said he hasnt received orders in a few months ever since 
the auction was advertised 
it impacts the fishing community when you put this much 
material on the market said lian who attended the auction to 
see who buys the net and whether it will glut his market 
this is depressing we were impacted big time during the spill 
and now again its probably cost us half a million dollars this 
year 
anchorage businessman brian watson looking for equipment for 
his water purification business was in awe of the skyhigh piles 
of merchandise 
people from all over the world are here looking for deals 
its a great windfall he said the magnitude of this and all 
because one ship blew it big thats amazing to me

chinas national airline said tuesday it was 
shaking up airline and airport management following a hijacking and 
crash a week ago that killed 128 people 
in the first disclosure of the details of the hijacking 
officials said a lone hijacker who claimed to have explosives 
attacked the pilot as he was making an emergency landing in canton 
they said the pilot did not have enough fuel to fly to taiwan 
where the hijacker wanted to go or hong kong 
for the first time since the oct 2 crash the civil aviation 
administration of china expressed regret for the worst reported air 
disaster in chinese history 
we are deeply grieved over this we profoundly mourn the 
passengers killed and offer our sympathy said an 
unidentified caac spokesman his remarks were carried by the 
official xinhua news agency 
this serious incident has revealed the existing problems of 
the airport and airline company in their management the 
spokesman said without giving details 
it has been decided that a shakeup of the airport and the 
company will be made he said no details were given in the 
xinhua dispatch and caac officials contacted by phone in beijing 
had no information 
the boeing 737 from the coastal city of xiamen was hijacked 
early oct 2 en route to the southern city of canton the hijacker 
forced his way into the cockpit and ordered all crew members but 
the pilot to leave said a report on the crash investigation 
the hijacker demanded to be flown to taiwan but the pilot said 
he did not have enough fuel and offered to fly first to hong kong 
which actually is farther away taiwan is 150 miles from xiamen 
and hong kong 300 miles 
the report said the hijacker threatened to blow up the plane if 
it landed in hong kong and the pilot finally made an emergency 
landing at cantons baiyun international airport as fuel was 
running out 
the official account conflicted with that of survivors who said 
the plane circled over the canton airport for 40 minutes before 
landing 
the hijacker attacked the pilot as the plane taxied down the 
runway sending it out of control it plowed into two parked jets 
one full of passengers and ready to take off for shanghai the 
report said 
the hijacked plane and the shanghai plane both were engulfed in 
flames at least 128 people including residents of hong kong and 
taiwan and an american were killed fortysix were seriously 
injured 
no trace of explosives has been found said the report by the 
canton aviation administration and the canton public security 
bureau investigation report 
it identified the hijacker as jiang xiaofeng of the hunan 
capital of changsha a purchasing agent for the linli county goods 
and materials bureau development corp 
the report said jiang was being sought by local police for 
absconding with 3591 in company money he previously had been 
charged with robbery 
in earlier hijacking attempts china has said the hijackers had 
criminal records and were motivated by criminal rather than 
political reasons 
china has faced intense criticism for its handling of the latest 
such incident 
aviation experts have questioned chinese authorities decision 
not to evacuate the canton airport while the hijacked jet circled 
overhead 
the flight crew apparently decided to fight the hijacking 
attempt without considering the possible consequences chinese 
flight crews during previous hijacking attempts also have been more 
interested in thwarting hijackers than ensuring safety the experts 
said

charges that two former police generals 
ordered the murder of a solidarity priest are the first major 
prosecution of polands old guard and officially reopen a case most 
poles never considered closed 
the arrests in the case of the rev jerzy popieluszko come six 
years after the crime that shocked the nation and at the outset of 
a presidential race in which prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis 
careful treatment of former communists is being challenged by lech 
walesa 
on monday authorities also disclosed that a former interior 
minister and six other officials have been accused of taking bribes 
of gold and jewelry dating to 1971 
in cases of clear crimes party people will be punished if 
proven these people will be condemned aleksander smolar a 
senior adviser to mazowiecki told an american society of newspaper 
editors delegation tuesday 
at a walesa campaign rally in warsaw on tuesday a spectator 
challenged the timing of the arrests right now before the 
elections scheduled for nov 25 
but smolar said there was absolutely no political 
calculation in the arrests which he said were ordered by 
independent courts 
he said there would be no departure from the governments basic 
policy that our evolution to democracy should be as peaceful as 
possible trying to reconcile the two parts of poland rather 
than waging a cold civil war against former communists 
smolar said he recognized that the prosecutions of former police 
officials would prove popular because of the feeling of 
bitterness and injustice after 45 years of communism 
there is a need of a clear moral condemnation everybody needs 
it for a sort of catharsis smolar said however he added most 
poles understand the wisdom of avoiding purges 
those interior ministry records that survived destruction the 
mazowiecki government did not take steps to prevent the burning of 
documents will not be opened to show who cooperated with the 
secret police smolar said 
it is extremely dangerous and destroys the nation to judge 
people for their weaknesses in very harsh times when only 
heroes were able to survive with dignity he said 
the 1984 kidnapping and murder of the 37yearold popieluszko 
whose body was pulled from a river gave a martyr to the 
thenunderground solidarity movement the communists were trying to 
crush many polish households still display photographs of the 
priest that were put up during the 1980s as a sign of protest 
four secret policemen from the interior ministrys fourth 
department the unit responsible for spying on the roman catholic 
church and clergy were tried and convicted in popieluszkos death 
two have been paroled 
but no involvement was found on the part of higher authorities 
a conclusion that satisfied few and came to symbolize ruthless 
communism 
something unprecedented has happened jerzy jachowicz an 
expert on the security services wrote of the arrests tuesday in a 
frontpage gazeta wyborcza commentary 
the two generals former deputy interior minister wladyslaw 
ciaston and zenon platek former head of the fourth department 
were charged with plotting the priests slaying during september 
and october 1984 and directing the oct 19 1984 killing officials 
said 
prosecutors said the corruption charges were unrelated to the 
killing but among those arrested was onetime interior minister 
miroslaw milewski a former communist party politburo member who 
was central committee secretary in charge of internal affairs when 
popieluszko was murdered 
after the slaying milewski was quietly dismissed 
milewski was given the party posts after being replaced as 
interior minister by gen czeslaw kiszczak in 1981 during 
solidaritys first legal period 
kiszczak a communist holdover in the solidarity government 
until he resigned last summer told polish television in september 
that he believed the priests killers could not have acted 
without the inspiration of someone standing higher then them 
he suggested the crime was committed by those aiming to 
destabilize the reformoriented communist government of 
thenparty leader gen wojciech jaruzelski now the outgoing 
president 
on polish television tuesday kiszczak said he believes ciaston 
and platek who worked for him are innocent he said the 
corruption charges against milewski were investigated in may 1984 
and a thorough report was given to superiors but he did not 
elaborate 
the popieluszko case was reopened july 24 three weeks after 
kiszczaks resignation by the office for the protection of the 
state the smaller and tightly controlled agency that replaced the 
disbanded secret police

the united states decided tuesday to vote 
against israel and back a un resolution that condemns the killing 
of 19 palestinians in jerusalem and asks a un investigation us 
officials said 
but the palestine liberation organization and nonaligned 
nations opposed the us draft resolution as too weak they said 
they would press their own stronger resolution possibly forcing 
the united states to use its veto power and infuriate arab states 
that backed the usled coalition against iraq 
the security council had been expected to convene tuesday night 
to consider the two drafts but by late tuesday the council 
president had sent most council members home except for those 
holding consultations 
diplomats reported scant progress in their search for a 
compromise 
the bush administrations decision followed daylong negotiations 
at the united nations to avert a threatened us veto of a 
resolution that already had the support of the four other permanent 
members of the security council 
officials in washington said the us draft condemns mondays 
violence and particularly the excessive israeli response it 
welcomes the decision by un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to send a delegation to jerusalem to investigate 
israel already has rejected any security council mission saying 
it would infringe on israeli sovereignty but it has accepted 
personal emissaries of the secretarygeneral in the past 
the plo and other states say the council itself must take a 
strong stand and that findings of a council delegation would have 
to be acted on by the council the findings of a mission by the 
secretarygenerals personal representative would not carry the 
same weight or convey the same urgency 
the united states was considered likely to veto a resolution 
that contained a call for a tough security council probe 
america was ready to veto an earlier draft finally deciding to 
draft its own resolution because a veto would only benefit the plo 
and iraqi president saddam hussein diplomats said 
a us vote against israel would be the first since jan 5 
1988 when the united states supported a security council 
resolution opposing deportations of palestinians in the uprising 
against israel occupation america usually sides with israel 
shielding it from harsh criticism with a veto occasionally the 
united states abstains 
the council has been debating the killings on temple mount a 
site holy to both jews and moslems police fired on monday on 
palestinians who stoned jewish worshipers at the western wall or 
wailing wall just below the mount 
the mob had heard rumors that jewish zealots planned to march on 
the mount 
israel claims the attack was planned by the plo to deflect 
attention from iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the united states has claimed when it vetoed antiisrael 
resolutions in the past that they were not balanced or did not 
accurately reflect the violence and provocation of the 
palestinians 
but the current debate has been heavily linked to the persian 
gulf crisis many arab nations and others claim israel should not 
be spared from un action after sanctions were imposed on iraq 
the plo and some arab states also said a us veto would erode 
support for the usled international force opposing iraq 
bush told a news conference israeli security forces should have 
acted with more restraint 
the five permanent council members the united states britain 
china france and the soviet union met privately tuesday to 
discuss a possible common strategy 
in the un debate more than 30 speakers condemned israels 
treatment of palestinians demanded israeli withdrawal from 
territories captured in the 1967 middle east war and called for 
un protection for palestinians 
on tuesday iraq accused the united states and its allies of 
hypocrisy for shielding israel over the years and failing to 
condemn and punish israel for violence against palestinians 
kuwaits deputy prime minister and foreign minister sheik sabah 
alahmad aljaber alsabah spoke in sympathy with palestinians 
egypt saudi arabia tunisia and other nations joined him in urging 
firm council action against israeli occupation just as it acted 
against iraqi occupation of kuwait

paramilitary game rangers have killed 
six poachers believed to be stalking endangered black rhinos 
officials said tuesday 
the action brought to 10 the total number of poachers killed in 
one operation to pursue two gangs that entered zimbabwe in the 
middle of the year 
a national parks spokesman said four poachers of the sixmember 
gang were killed oct 1 in a gun battle in a nature reserve 485 
miles southwest of harare 
two poachers escaped but were shot to death last saturday in a 
shootout with antipoaching patrols 
the poachers were believed to have crossed into zimbabwe from 
neighboring zambia the spokesman said he said zimbabwe rangers 
found two rhino horns and automatic assault rifles used by the 
illegal hunters 
the black rhinocerous has one large horn on its snout with a 
smaller one behind it 
the horns made of matted hair and cartilage are carved into 
ornamental dagger handles or crushed into powder as an ingredient 
in traditional medicines in the middle east and asia 
on sept 10 paramilitary rangers captured another gang of six 
poachers who had killed 15 rhino the largest number of these 
endangered animals slaughtered by one group in this southern 
african nation the spokesman said 
so far this year antipoaching patrols have killed 34 mainly 
zambian poachers and captured 14 others

a major bond rating agency said tuesday it is 
reviewing the status of new york citys ability to repay debt 
following a tentative agreement to give teachers a 55 percent pay 
raise 
after reviewing its aminus rating of new york citys 13 
billion in outstanding general obligation bonds standard amp poors 
corp could decide to lower the rating 
im confident we are going to satisfy them that we are in 
control mayor david dinkins said at a city hall press 
conference we have a plan we are going to meet that gap 
the mayor has projected a 14 billion deficit next year in the 
citys approximately 28 billion budget 
the city has been hurt by the slump in the northeast economy 
particularly by the declining fortunes of wall street firms 
sampp said it was reevaluating the citys payroll burden in light 
of a weakening economy that leads to lower tax revenues 
state comptroller edward regan said sampps move appeared to be 
based on a perception of economic crisis rather than reality 
the city is not on the verge of an economic disaster regan 
said its a cyclical downturn with an erosion of revenue but 
that can be handled the problem is that this years budget was too 
large to begin with 
an a rating from sampp means the agency believes the city has a 
strong ability to pay interest and principal on the bonds although 
that ability is more susceptible to economic downswings a plus or 
minus sign on a rating shows its relative standing within the 
catagory 
the next step down is a bbb rating which signifies that adverse 
conditions make it more likely the city would have trouble paying 
interest and principal 
lower ratings make it more expensive to borrow money in the bond 
market since investors usually demand higher yields for the riskier 
debt 
city council president andrew stein said it was inconceivable 
that the administration could give teachers a 55 percent pay raise 
on monday and then announce on thursday that it was planning for 
15000 layoffs this is not fiscal leadership it is fiscal 
folly 
the mayor has said he is considering laying off 15000 city 
workers to save money 
dinkins said the city has made it through past financial 
difficulties and that i can assure standard and poors 
taxpayers noteholders and the citizens of this city that my 
administration will continue this tradition of responding fully and 
quickly to the difficulties a deteriorating economy and rising 
costs pose for our budget

as a hatchet man to call paul simon names 
meanwhile the illinois league of women voters postponed a 
debate between the candidates that was set for thursday after 
democrat simon said his senate schedule would prevent him from 
returning to chicago 
ailes said simon has slandered martin by running tv ads that 
say the former teacher is an enemy of senior citizens and schools 
he acknowledged that martin voted against increasing medicare 
spending and against lowering the rate of outofpocket costs 
but these were not votes to cut medicare 
simon is just being simon which is unfortunately being 
slimy ailes said 
during the news conference ailes also called simon a 
weenie a comment that later led to an apology from martin

in the movie reversal of fortune based on 
claus von bulows legal morass after his fabulously wealthy wife 
slipped into a coma his lawyer declares the danish socialite to be 
a very strange man 
von bulow played with jawclenched control by jeremy irons 
peers out from behind a heavy shadow and responds you have no 
idea 
offcamera irons painstakingly maintains the von bulow 
mystique indeed he massages it with ice cold hands and that jaw 
rarely relaxes 
dont ask him whether he thinks von bulow is guilty or innocent 
of attempting to kill his wife sunny by injecting her with 
insulin and causing her to slip into an irreversible coma irons 
despite his extensive research into the role wont say 
work it out work it out he implores 
the court found him innocent he flatly offers 
then suddenly things turn philosphical irons gets pensive 
is there a heaven or a hell the sad thing is we dont know 
he says 
its a great weakness of our society we like to have 
everything black and white wed like to know that if we think 
saddam hussein is a mad dog were happy were wrong because he 
aint hes a leader of a huge nation thats what he is so i 
always question this desire to say hes guilty or hes 
innocent life aint like that 
life for von bulow turned ugly in 1980 when sunny went 
unconscious one morning sequestered in her only sanctuary her 
bathroom their marriage was foundering and her children believed 
their stepfather engineered her tragedy by pumping her full of 
insulin they hired private detectives and damaging evidence was 
found 
after von bulow was convicted of attempted murder he hired 
highprofile harvard university law professor alan dershowitz to 
appeal which is where reversal of fortune picks up 
director barbet schroeder has crafted a twisted tale rendered 
somewhat implausible because of its narrator sunny glenn close 
who of course is in a persistent vegetative state how you ask 
yourself over and over are we to beieve this story told in the 
voice of a person we already know has been left forever mute 
but reversal of fortune based on dershowitzs book of the 
same title aptly depicts the couples guilded sordid excess they 
keep a pharmacy of drugs next to their bed they guzzle booze 
sleep with others and then coldly detail their philanderings at 
cocktail parties 
and ron silver weighs in with his usual steely verve in his 
portrayal of dershowitz giving the fast talking lawyer a wonderful 
emphatic brilliance 
von bulows 1982 conviction in rhode island on two counts of 
assaut with intent to kill his wife was overturned by the appeal 
and second trial in 1985 
in 1987 he agreed to a divorce from his wife and renounced all 
claims to her fortune including the 120000ayear trust fund 
created for him before she lapsed into the coma his share of her 
estate was estimated at 25 million 
von bulow now 63 lives in london and will receive no 
remuneration from the movie martha sunny von bulow remains in 
a coma at columbiapresbyterian hospital in new york city 
irons recently spent an entire day pussyfooting around over von 
bulows culpability during a tightly scheduled 24hour media stop 
in new york wedging reporters in back to back between photo 
shoots and television filming 
im very to the point he declares at the start of the 
interview at his hotel suite 
while chatting the sepiatanned irons reclines his lanky frame 
sideways into a deep chair swinging his legs and stocking feet 
over one side so that his body forms a lazy u he nibbles 
grapes when he isnt puffing down silk cutbrand cigarettes 
meanwhile soup from a nearby deli grows cold 
hes prone to one or twoword answers followed by long piercing 
stares when describing von bulows predicament he purses his lips 
together and crisply pronounces it tricky stuff tricky stuff 
to prepare for the role irons studied taped interviews von 
bulow had with barbara walters and phil donahue he also said he 
read all of the trial transcripts and he spent hours interviewing 
those who knew the socialite although he never approached von 
bulow directly 
still irons is mum 
i wouldnt describe claus von bulow because ive never met 
him he says my reading of him is what i show on the screen 
irons doesnt believe his portrayal of von bulow gives him 
license to discuss him 
i dont want to comment on him because its not my job not my 
position to talk about claus von bulow and i wouldnt think if i 
was in his situation id enjoy reading what some actor thought 
about him 
in fact irons prefers that the issue of guilt or innocence 
remain an idelible question mark 
i wanted to keep him an enigma irons says 
tricky stuff tricky stuff and very strange indeed

maniac mansion is what twin peaks would 
be if it were a situation comedy that was inspired by a nintendo 
computer game 
where abcs twin peaks brings horror violence and intrigue 
to primetime soap opera maniac mansion brings horror family 
values and a crazy sweetness to domestic comedy 
maniac mansion has joe flaherty playing the mildly eccentric 
scientist fred edison a man who looks like hes just realized his 
pants are on fire deborah theaker plays his sweet nurturing wife 
casey 
the kids are tina ike and turner ike and tina avi phillips 
and kathleen robinson are fine but turner george buza 
well turners been a 6foot4 250pound 4yearold ever since he 
walked into an experiment that went awry 
then theres uncle harry john hemphill whos half human half 
housefly with tiny human head and a cute squeaky voice who was 
transformed by the same experiment that turned turner into a 
credible hulk 
harry doesnt seem to mind being a fly although his diet never 
comes up in conversation he might even enjoy the life since it 
gets him away from his sometimes aggravating wife idella played 
by mary charlotte wilcox 
the series airing early friday nights on cable tvs family 
channel is suffused with a wonderful note of suppressed hysteria 
its as easy to watch with grandchildren as with grandparents and 
it raises important questions 
how would you handle the hurt feelings of a typical 4yearold 
whos built like an allpro linebacker 
this is the first foray into tv programming for lucasfilm ltd 
which brought us the star wars and indiana jones trilogies as 
well as the maniac mansion computer game for nintendo machines 
the game and the show have little in common other than a 
scientist named fred and a mansion with a strange meteorite beneath 
it that pulses eerie radiation 
the tv show gets its edge from alumni of the torontobased 
second city troupe and others who brought us the emmy awardwinning 
second city tv in the late 70s and early 80s 
flaherty and eugene levy a writer and executive producer of 
maniac mansion were mainstays of an sctv cast that 
included john candy andrea martin bob thomas catherine ohara 
and martin short 
wilcox and hemphill are former sctv writers hemphill who 
also played the fragile boozetremored barfly who anchored his 
sctv kiddie show from a tavern is a staff writer as well as 
housefly for maniac mansion 
is this just another formulaic threecamera sitcom uhuh its 
shot on film and ray brounsteins agile photography gives the show 
a rich distinctive look there is no laugh track 
shows like moonlighting and twin peaks won critical 
acclaim for violating the conventions of series tv breaking the 
fourth wall with asides to the audience or defying viewers 
expectations of a linear plot 
maniac mansion flings those conventions down and tramples on 
them 
in the pilot episode the camera tracked past fred and thumped 
him a glancing blow on the head ow 
the show titled the 10th anniversary special began as the 
edisons went to celebrate their decade on tv with dinner at a 
chinese restaurant uncle harry the fly chirps his anticipation 
ive been regurgitating all day 
suddenly the authorities announce theyre spraying for medflies 
the family especially harry cant leave home fred realizes 
that this leaves an incredible hole in the first act how will they 
recap the past decades shows 
idellas home movies dont help film of her 1963 vacation trip 
to dallas includes a downtown picnic on a grassy knoll where 
bystanders see something horrible happen offcamera and duck to the 
ground in fear 
there behind oblivious idella and her picnic companions men in 
raincoats and sunglasses carry away a rifle you say no one has 
ever seen this casey asks frowning no idella says why oh 
nothing never mind 
in a later episode uncle harry falls for a cute girl fly whos 
had a hard life born in a garbage can she grew up in chinatown 
and got hooked on msg ah but when she flashes those babyblack 
compound eyes 
eventually idellas suspicions are aroused and she begins to 
believe shes being made a fool of by some cheap little fly 
despite harrys denials idella determines to eliminate her rival 
by murder killing a fly 
is there a happy ending thats probably the nicest thing about 
maniac mansion underneath all that weirdness the edisons are 
a fine likable family coping with absurd situations with dignity 
and grace 
and youll never feel the same way about 4yearolds or flies

the smallbusiness community is becoming 
distressdd 
a survey conducted in september by the national federation of 
independent business showed confidence collapsing to the lowest 
level in a decade lower even than in the deep recession of 1982 
the decline in confidence was across the board encompassing 
nine of the 10 components that make up the federations optimism 
index capital spending plans dropped hiring plans weakened and 
inventory investment plans were cut 
the survey was conducted before budget negotiators reached 
agreement to raise taxes but it hardly could have helped taxes 
were named by respondents as the biggest problem facing small 
businesses 
it was a runaway respondents named taxes nearly five times as 
often as they mentioned inflation and four times as often as 
financing difficulties which have been widely reported as being of 
creditcrunch magnitude 
the federation has conducted surveys since 1974 under the 
direction of economist william dunkelberg now dean of temple 
universitys school of business and management and has published 
the results quarterly 
rarely are monthly findings published but the federation 
departed from its usual practice because of the unusual 
findings of the september survey 
after studying 766 responses dunkelberg said the economy 
appears poised to enter an nber recession a reference to the 
national bureau of economic researchs definition of a recession as 
two straight negative quarters 
while the latest decline was unusually sharp dunkelberg 
observed that the nations economy has been weakening for many 
months provoking the question of whether the process of undoing 
the recession will be gradual as well 
the smallbusiness optimism index is devised from answers to 10 
questions including expected business conditions expected credit 
conditions current job openings plans to hire and capital outlay 
plans 
the september drop of 32 points brought the index to 921 from 
an august reading of 953 points based on the 1978 economy 
equaling 100 the lowest in the 19811982 recession was 925 
points 
since 1983 the reading has rarely fallen below 100 it reached 
an alltime high of 1088 points in the second quarter of 1983 and 
stood at 1045 as recently as early 1988 
while the federations figures are gathered from companies too 
small to make their way onto lists of the 1000 largest companies 
some in fact are tiny proprietorships it claims the results are 
an accurate barometer 
dunkelberg observes that while the largest companies obtain the 
greatest publicity the smaller businesses represented in the 
survey employ onehalf the private nonfarm work force and produce 
half the nations private product 
historically the survey has an accurate record of forecasting 
the economys direction a record sometimes ascribed to the ability 
of smaller companies to sense grassroots consumer responses and 
changes of attitude 
based on septembers results dunkelberg believes the current 
quarter may be the first one of negative growth in the current 
downturn negative growth occurs when gross national product 
actually shrinks rather than expands 
among other things that report will reflect attitudinal changes 
resulting from the budget negotiating now under way in washington 
including reactions to any tax actions

rushed here if something happened while they were in new york 
because of its quality care city cops hurt in the line of duty 
prefer 264yearold bellevue the nations oldest continuously 
operating public hospital 
it also sees the worst wounds of the city crack addicts bullet 
holes from drugrelated assault guns aids patients the homeless 
who have no place else to go for care teenagers run over by 
subway cars who need their severed limbs reattached inmates from 
city prisons whose manacled ankles protrude from stretchers 
at bellevue battlefield images fit like bandages on a wound 
were kind of a field hospital this is war zone medicine we 
see all the casualties hessler said we see everything here 
we are the window to the world you will never go anywhere else in 
the world and see something we havent already seen at bellevue 
drugs are found in two out of three patients who are shot 
stabbed or hit by a car doctors say onefourth of the trauma 
cases involve people who have mixed two or more intoxicants 
usually alcohol and cocaine 
the homeless seek treatment for such ills as frostbite and 
rotted feet similar to soldiers who suffered trench foot a disease 
caused by prolonged exposure to wet cold and inactivity 
its like a third world situation hessler said and when 
its cold we see body temperatures of 66 degrees thats almost 
the equivalent of hibernation their whole body is cold not just 
their feet and hands 
the river of patients creates stress and frustration 
a patient doesnt have things people come to expect in a 
hospital a bed a room certainly not a tv if you have to go to 
the bathroom you get a bedpan hessler said 
the clamor is a long way from the quiet calm of hesslers 
hometown of billings mont he spent seven years at the university 
of miami medical school before doing his residency at new york 
university one of the countrys top medical schools 
hessler specialized in internal medicine but opted for 
emergency doctoring it allows him to do a little bit of everything 
that interests him internal medicine pediatrics 
obstetricsgynecology and surgery 
i like to work with critically ill patients they make you 
think and work the hardest you possibly can youre keeping people 
alive hessler said 
you have to do the right thing in the first few hours for 
whatever they have it puts such a stress on some people that one 
of the major problems is physician burnout some doctors arent 
able to function with that pressure 
or the daily dose of death for every rush of adrenalin that 
comes with saving a life there are terrible pendulum swings of 
seeing people die 
were not god not everybody can be saved hessler said 
but if you die in spite of everything i could possibly have done 
at least i feel we delivered the best possible care and did 
everything we could have 
he stays even though there are betterpaying jobs with less 
heartache 
people asked me why anybody from the nyu training program 
would want to do emergency medicine hessler said were a 
setting of last resort delivering care to people who dont have 
any insurance dont have any money and dont have any place else 
to go were here because we want to help people 
on call 24 hours a day hessler escapes the bedlam of bellevue 
at his suburban home in river vale nj he eases the tension by 
clipping his rhododendrons junipers and yews 
after a day of wild and chaotic work i can go home hessler 
said i can trim the bushes look at my lawn water the plants 
watch the birds flying around im used to a more calm lifestyle 
in addition to sewing up accident victims or treating kids who 
swallow rat poison doctors care for societal ills a polaroid 
camera is kept to document suspected child abuse a standard 
evidence kit can store specimens from rape victims 
in one sweep through the room hessler bandages a smashed nose 
takes vital signs on a heart patient scalpels the bureaucratic red 
tape so a patient can get xrays and tries to find out why a 
patient is waiting for attention 
youre doing three four or five things at the same time 
hessler said youre working so hard you dont have time to think 
about what youd rather be doing youre too busy patching peoples 
lives back together 
splotches of dried blood bandage wrappings discarded surgical 
gloves bedpans surgical tape syringe cases and other medical 
flotsam litter the floor 
patients stack their shoes coats and other possessions on the 
bottom of their gurneys as they wait to be released or admitted 
their medicine is not sugarcoated 
if you come to the emergency room i cant give you peace and 
quiet and comfort hessler said and for people who arent 
critically ill i can guarantee you a very long wait

a crush of patients has put city emergency rooms 
in critical condition the average wait is six to eight hours and 
one new york patient languished eight days before being admitted 
surveys show 
the backlog imperils the quality of care in 41 states and the 
district of columbia according to a survey last year by the 
american college of emergency physicians the northeast and west 
coast have particularly acute congestion 
its a cruel illusion to dismiss this as a new york problem 
this is emphatically a nationwide problem said dr arthur 
kellermann a member of the acep study group on overcrowding 
the only states not reporting backlogs were idaho minnesota 
nebraska new hampshire new mexico north dakota oregon utah and 
wyoming 
the nations 5700 emergency rooms had 90 million visitors last 
year an increase of 30 percent in 10 years according to the 
american hospital association there were 80 million visits five 
years ago 
the overcrowding crisis stems from a number of reasons the 
surge in drug overdoses and drugrelated violence the aids 
epidemic the fact that emergency rooms are a place of last resort 
for the homeless and an estimated 37 million americans who have no 
health insurance a nursing shortage cutbacks in the number of 
hospital rooms and formulas for federal money that discourage 
emergency admissions 
we are on the verge of a major crisis said dr stephan 
lynn chairman of the acep study group and director of emergency 
medicine at st lukesroosevelt hospital in new york city 
the lights never go out the noise never turns off lynn 
said some of my patients have no means to pay their bill and 
some could buy the hospital but all of my patients wait when 
there is no bed available it doesnt really matter how rich you 
are 
a 1989 survey by the new york state health department showed 
that of 2000 emergency room patients being treated one day 210 
waited eight to 24 hours for care and 108 waited longer than 24 
hours 
the average wait in an emergency room is six to eight hours 
according to a survey of 300 hospitals in 43 states by the national 
association of public hospitals 
at harborucla medical center in los angeles patients wait 
eight to 10 hours four times longer than they did 10 years ago 
the emergency room is so busy that it turns away arriving 
ambulances 20 percent of the time 
that results in ambulances wandering around the city trying to 
find emergency departments that are open said dr robert 
hockberger chairman of emergency medicine at harborucla

ok video kids fill in the blank 
heres the story 
of a man named 
if you answered brady get in line for the unlikeliest hit 
on chicagos theater scene the real live brady bunch 
the show is a live wordforword reenactment of different 
episodes from the early 1970s television series the brady 
bunch the alladult cast plays it straight from the dopey 
singalong theme song to little cindys irritating lisp 
the show has become so popular since beginning its tuesday night 
run in early june that the 110seat annoyance theater added a 
second weekly performance in midaugust the cramped theater in a 
funky north side neighborhood charges 7 a ticket 
if the real live bradys is art and not even the actors 
agree on that point it may be the first case of art imitating tv 
sitcom life a kind of life so far removed from the real thing that 
its well laughable 
a concept this loopy could only have been hatched by people with 
genuine affection for the bradys sisters faith and jill soloway 
who jointly produce and direct the shows for the metraform theater 
company 
we pay tribute to the bradys we dont disrespect them jill 
said 
like the young professionals who fill the theater the soloways 
are in their mid20s and grew up watching the brady bunch which 
stayed on television from 196974 and ran as an hourlong series 
in 1977 before hitting the rerun trail 
we were all really jealous of the bradys jill said a 
sentiment also expressed by several spectators at a recent 
performance 
brady envy its not hard to understand 
in their suburban digs the bradys resided in a universe far 
removed from the social and political turmoil of their times 
teenager greg brady never worried he might be drafted and sent to 
vietnam no brady ever wondered if nixon was a crook 
nor were the brady children ever stressed by the dynamics of 
their mixandmatch family a widower and his new wife her three 
daughters his three sons and alice their oldmaid housekeeper 
brady family crises involved such mundane aggravations as dads 
misplaced architectural plans and middle daughter jan sneaking a 
peek at eldest daughter marcias diary 
and as selfstyled brady historian max merlin a northwestern 
university film student observed their problems always worked 
out in 23 minutes 
actress eve plumb who played jan in the series experienced the 
brady revival firsthand when the soloway sisters flew her in from 
los angeles to guest star in one of their shows during the summer 
she played a bit part choosing not to reprise her role as 
pubescent jan at age 32 
it was a totally bizarre experience plumb said in a 
telephone interview from los angeles where she is a rotating cast 
member of the groundlings an improvisational troupe 
she said she doesnt understand the bradys enduring appeal but 
thinks the chicago show is sort of a hoot 
brady bunch creator sherwood schwartz who also gave us 
gilligans island suggested the lure of the bradys is mostly 
nostalgia 
its something people have as a reference point in their 
youth and they hold fond memories of those shows he said in a 
telephone interview from los angeles 
but chicago actress jane lynch who plays mother carol in the 
real live bradys holds that nostalgia is only part of the shows 
draw 
she said the other half the element that transforms the real 
live bradys from camp into art is the realization by audience 
members that the bradys uncomplicated lives were nothing like what 
life turned out to be 
a teacher once told me the purpose of art is to enlighten and 
inform lynch said this informs us as to what we bought into 
as children and enlightens us that it was crap

when simi valley adventist hospital 
gave a 25000 loan to a young obstetrician it wanted something 
more valuable than money his pregnant patients 
you will attempt to bring 100 percent of your deliveries to 
this hospital the loan agreement read you will attempt to 
bring the vast majority of your elective gyn cases to this 
hospital 
in return for supporting the hospital with your patients no 
money need be paid back after five years the doctor would owe 
nothing the agreement concluded with a plea he keep the deal 
secret for various reasons 
at least one reason was obvious it was illegal according to a 
later grand jury finding state and federal laws bar doctors from 
accepting financial rewards for sending patients to hospitals 
the doctor vihe azizian an iranian immigrant said he didnt 
know the arrangement broke the law but he had no doubt why the 
hospital gave him money 
they werent in love with my pretty eyes azizian said it 
wasnt a loan it was a gift to put my patients in their 
hospital 
azizians gift was everyday business it appears during the 
1980s at simi valley adventist a 215bed hospital affiliated with 
the seventh day adventist church 
interviews along with logs internal memos and insurance 
records obtained by the associated press show the hospital 
showered doctors with hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans 
subsidized rent equipment and discounted hospital services 
one complicated deal even made it possible for doctors to get a 
cut when they referred patients for xrays the hospital kept these 
patients records in a school composition book rather than its 
computer 
there were things done that seemed obviously illegal and 
unethical said dr paul ironside a surgeon the administrator 
told me some doctors would actually pound on the desk and say they 
would take their patients away unless they got a check 
offers of interestfree loans income guarantees and other 
subsidies have become commonplace across the country as hospitals 
compete to win physicians allegiances but some of the simi valley 
deals bluntly stated what most others only imply the money was 
payment for patients 
many worry that kickbacks whether spelled out or implied are 
more than technical violations of law they can harm patients the 
doctor has a financial enticement to send sick people to the 
hospital that gives him the best deal not the one that gives 
patients the best care 
physicians are complaining that they made requests for new 
equipment at the hospital and were told that money was tight 
said dr martin wareham simi valleys chief of staff at the 
same time the hospital was loaning out all this money 
the dealmaking at simi valley adventist grew out of economic 
changes that have made patients a coveted commodity government 
programs and private insurers push hospitals to send patients home 
sooner or treat them as outpatients the result has been empty beds 
and hefty competition for patients 
in simi valley the competitors were two modest community 
hospitals adventist is a low spartan facility built 25 years ago 
against the dry brown hills on the edge of town its competitor 
mountain view medical center was an even smaller privately owned 
hospital on the other side of the narrow valley 
as the onetime farming town was overtaken by the housing 
projects and condominiums creeping northwest from los angeles both 
hospitals tried to persuade doctors and patients not to take their 
business over the hill to facilities in adjoining valleys 
they were struggling and we were struggling recalled dr 
elvin gaines a longtime adventist family practitioner it became 
a competition for physicians and their loyalties 
once the deals began gaines said many doctors wanted in 
gaines himself was a recipient he got a 1 million construction 
loan from the adventist system to build an office building across 
the street from the hospital 
it mushroomed he said of the deals they said you 
treated him good why dont you treat me good 
the hospitals current administrator alan rice declined to 
talk about specific deals that took place before he came to simi 
valley as far as this administration is concerned we are taking 
an extremely conservative position on how we would behave as it 
relates to marketing practices he said 
most of the deals were struck by darwin remboldt administrator 
from 1984 until 1989 he declined to be interviewed but records 
and interviews show remboldt established a wide range of 
arrangements with doctors 
hundreds of thousands of dollars were loaned to several 
doctors among the largest series of loans went to drs george 
dichter and geoffrey graham to set up the sterling group a 
multispecialty group gaines a former member of the hospital 
board of directors said the two received as much as 600000 
a recently concluded county grand jury investigation found 
dichter and graham would not be required to pay back the loans if 
among other things they admitted patients to simi valley adventist 
for five years 
christopher caldwell the attorney representing the doctors 
declined comment on the grand jurys findings other that to say 
there was nothing illegal or improper about the doctors 
arrangements with the hospital 
the hospital gave special discounts on xrays to some doctors 
who in turn were free to charge patients the full fee physicians 
said a dual price list and a crude handwritten record of patients 
xrays were kept at a hospital reception desk ethical and legal 
rules prohibit doctors from marking up patients bills 
the hospital established an askanurse hot line through which 
callers were referred to doctors who were expected to return the 
favor by putting patients in adventist a hospital memo stated the 
program would exclude doctors who placed their askanurse 
referrals at a facility other than simi valley adventist 
hospital 
the hospital helped a doctor build a chain of walkin clinics 
the hospital thought it would be a good referral source said 
dr walter thomas adding that he repaid hospital loans with 
interest 
those who questioned the deals risked retaliation gaines said 
he said he was kicked off the hospitals board of directors 
following a disagreement with remboldt 
the deals began unraveling in 1987 after the adventists bought 
the competing hospital a doctor who lost a contract for staffing 
mountain views emergency room filed a lawsuit bringing some of 
them to light 
federal investigators looked into the case and a county grand 
jury called remboldt and a number of doctors to testify many 
declined citing fifth amendment rights against selfincrimination 
remboldt later spoke to the panel after he was granted immunity 
from prosecution 
the grand jury issued a report in june stating the deals with 
azizian dichter and graham violated california law the question 
was moot however because the threeyear statute of limitations 
had run out 
administrator rice said the grand jury findings showed his 
administration has met the letter of the law but he complained the 
panels findings that earlier deals were illegal applied present 
interpretations of the law to three years ago when circumstances 
were very different

azizian who cooperated with the grand jury denied the loans 
affected his practice of medicine my admission situation did not 
change at all he said i sent people where they wanted to 
go 
the grand jury made no mention of the other specific deals such 
as the xray arrangements and its records are now sealed the 
panel was highly critical however of hospital deals 
such incentives to physicians increase costs to public and 
private insurance programs and ultimately to patients by causing 
physicians to overuse hospital facilities the panels report 
said perhaps more importantly these incentives can hurt 
patients by inducing physicians to favor one hospital even though 
other hospitals may offer better care for a particular patient 
need 
in simi valley doctors remain suspicious of the hospital and 
each other 
i think a lot of it was the physicians fault said gaines 
a lot of physicians who went to the trough didnt have to they 
were making good money and didnt need it it was wrong

when some patients went to simi 
valley adventist hospital for xrays a clerk entered their records 
in a blackcovered school composition book instead of the 
hospitals computer 
a special cutrate price list also was reserved for these 
peoples xrays part of an unusual deal offered to a handful of 
doctors who referred patients to the hospital 
confidential interviews internal memos and secret records show 
it appeared to work this way 
a chest xray usually cost 56 and the hospital billed the 
patient directly under the special arrangement the hospital sent 
the bill to the doctor and charged him 16 the doctor in turn 
charged the patient whatever he pleased 
ethical and legal rules prohibit doctors from marking up 
patients bills 
one variation on the arrangement was available to a few doctors 
who sent patients to the hospital for breast xrays known as 
mammograms a crude handwritten record of their xrays was kept in 
the composition book stored in the radiology department reception 
desk those doctors not the patients were charged a discounted 
90 for the xray and 25 for a radiologists interpretation 
according to billing and insurance records obtained by the 
associated press the doctors then charged their patients 150 the 
full fee 
i questioned why i would pay the doctor separately for the 
mammogram recalled one patient patricia gillesby 
her physician said the difference between the hospital charge 
and what his office collected went to compensate him for extra 
work 
there are many many times when i review a mammogram myself 
he said 
another doctor who participated in the arrangement defended the 
markup saying he brought patients back for a second free visit to 
tell them their results 
the difference was justified in our examination and discussion 
with the patient he said 
when staff radiologists complained they were threatened 
minutes from a 1986 meeting of the mid valley radiology medical 
group noted that administrator darwin remboldt told one of the 
radiologists that he would terminate our contract if we do not 
allow it 
the radiologists viewed the agreements as bad medicine 
there will be considerable confusion to patients radiology 
staff and referring physicians when sometimes xrays taken in the 
hospital are not the property of the hospital and no records or 
reports of the examinations are made the radiologists wrote in a 
letter to remboldt 
another complaint some of the xrays were being interpreted by 
general practitioners not radiologists 
they would read their own films and bring them down to us and 
say whats that and point to something insignificant when there 
was something that was significant that they missed said a 
radiologist who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution 
alan rice the hospitals current administrator said he knew 
nothing about the xray arrangement remboldt declined to discuss 
it

when darwin remboldt head of simi 
valley adventist hospital gave a loan to dr vahe azizian he 
spelled out the terms in a letter 
here is the text of the letter written july 17 1985 on 
hospital stationery amortized means written off 
this letter will confirm that simi valley adventist hospital 
will loan you 25000 under the following conditions acceptance of 
these conditions will be shown by your signature at the bottom of 
this letter 
a the loan will be amortized over 5 years at 500000 a 
year should you leave the simi valley area or change your 
admitting practices the balance will immediately become due and 
payable 
b you will continue to work towards becoming an active staff 
member at simi valley adventist hospital attend the obgyn 
department meetings and be active in medical staff activities 
c you will attempt to bring 100 of your deliveries to this 
hospital 
d you will attempt to bring the vast majority of your 
elective gyn cases to this hospital 
we both realize that much of what you have agreed to is being 
supportive of the hospital and giving your time on medical staff 
activities and supporting the hospital with your patients there is 
no other way for me to know exactly where your patients are going 
other than your word and your desire to establish a good 
relationship with this hospital 
i hope that we have a long and beneficial relationship between 
yourself and simi valley adventist hospital i trust that this 
arrangement will be kept confidential for various reasons 
the hospital may have had second thoughts about the deal after 
investigators began looking into the way it did business 
azizian in a sworn affidavit connected to another physicians 
lawsuit said remboldt later asked him to sign a document stating 
the 25000 azizian received was for his emergency room services 
i refused to sign the document at the time because the 
statements in the document were not true he said 
remboldt declined to be interviewed about the letter

when six people were hurt in a car wreck a 
few years ago the surgeon on duty at nearby parkland medical 
center knew his small emergency room would be overwhelmed by all 
the cuts and broken bones 
so dr paul harper made a quick decision ambulances should 
carry the victims to three other hospitals besides parkland 
spreading the carnage around meant the injured would get help more 
quickly the doctor felt it was best for patients 
but in this case what was best for patients was not necessarily 
best for the hospital parkland lost business 
i caught it for that harper recalled the patients were 
supposed to come to parkland even though they couldnt handle 
them the head nurse told me the administration was mad and i 
shouldnt do that again 
such vignettes are common hospitals need patients doctors who 
send them away for any reason even for better care risk rebuke a 
gentle scolding perhaps a quiet lecture about hospital economics 
or worse 
in harpers case what came next was much worse his career is 
in ruins once he performed 350 operations a year the hospitals 
busiest surgeon now he performs a dozen 
harper has filed a lawsuit claiming the hospital engineered a 
slander campaign that destroyed his reputation and made doctors 
afraid to send him patients richard v wiebusch the hospitals 
attorney counters that harper is in trouble because he is an 
incompetent doctor not because he is a financial liability 
such open warfare between doctors and hospitals still is 
unusual but the rules of conduct are changing many fear that 
blunt coercion is becoming more customary as more hospitals press 
doctors to practice a style of medicine that puts the health of the 
institution first 
usually hospitals try to keep doctors in line through more 
subtle means nurses who lose their jobs when hospital beds stand 
empty cajole doctors to admit more patients many hospitals post 
names of those who fail to discharge elderly lowpaying medicare 
patients quickly enough physicians who dont get the message may 
suddenly stop receiving referrals from the emergency room an 
important source of new patients 
but gentle persuasion can turn harsh some doctors complain they 
have been dogged by crudely planted rumors of incompetence that 
hospital administrators have ordered other doctors to stop sending 
them patients or that their tiniest medical misjudgments are 
scrutinized by hospital review committees 
the worst of these abuses do happen said dr howard l lang of 
kentfield calif chairman of the american medical associations 
hospital medical staff section 
its not a daily occurrence he said but it is occurring 
enough that it is not rare we are not talking about a few whining 
malcontents there are real problems out there 
in general hospitals want their doctors to bring in lots of 
patients they want them to order plenty of xrays and tests when 
the sick are covered by generous private insurance plans and they 
want them to do just the opposite when medicare picks up the tab 
hospitals lose money when the elderly ill linger too long 
medicare categorizes virtually all old people into drgs or 
diagnosisrelated groups the drg classification for a particular 
illness pays a single flat fee for the patient no matter how sick 
he is or how long he stays in the hospital 
drgs encourage the hospitals to keep their costs down and yet 
the physician controls what the hospital bill will be said dr 
e haavi morreim of the university of tennessee the hospitals 
have had to do something to bring the physicians under the same 
incentive many hospital administrators have felt the necessity for 
some sort of system of carrots and sticks either formal or 
informal 
perhaps the most feared and effective of these sticks is peer 
review this process is the main way doctors watch over the 
competence of their hospital colleagues 
critics complain the system is sometimes perverted into a way of 
punishing those who are economic threats to the hospital or to 
other doctors at its most extreme doctors lose the right to admit 
patients or to perform specific tests procedures and operations 
there is overwhelming economic motive to eliminate doctors who 
cost the hospital money said dr verner s waite of downey 
calif doctors who complain about unethical billing practices 
unnecessary tests using items the hospital can charge for that are 
not necessary are all at great risk of a peer review 
waite has formed an organization to fight abuses of peer review 
he and many others believe that instead of weeding out bad doctors 
the system sometimes may protect dangerous hacks who are 
financially and politically powerful because they admit lots of 
patients 
when they want to get you they get you good they blackball 
you said dr david m freedman they will take away privileges 
for nothing when another doctor can murder someone and because 
hes in good standing they dont bother him 
freedman works with harper at parkland medical center an 86bed 
community hospital owned by hospital corporation of america the 
nations largest forprofit hospital chain 
freedman believes his own practice has suffered because he 
refused an order from a hospital administrator to stop referring 
patients to harper for surgery harper claims many other doctors in 
this distant suburb of boston also were warned not to send him 
patients in large part because he went against the hospitals 
financial interests 
sometimes a hospital can get rid of someone its considers a 
financial nuisance simply by giving another physician the sole 
right to perform that doctors medical specialty 
ohio cardiologist dr efraim montesinos contended he was forced 
to move his busy heart surgery practice from toledo hospital 
because his patients often ran up bigger bills than were covered by 
medicares flatfee drg system which began in 1984 
said dr peter overstreet one of montesinos supporters 
before drgs he was a hero since drgs he is a villain its the 
same guy 
montesinos said he cared for a large number of very sick 
patients they often took longer than usual to get better so the 
hospital lost money 
i am in the service of my patients he said i am not in 
the service of the hospital or the insurance company as long as i 
am a physician i will do what i think is proper for the patient 
last year the hospital decided to give an exclusive contract to 
a single heart surgery group montesinos who could have bid for 
the job believes the exclusive contract was a ploy to get me out 
of the hospital he moved his practice to the nearby medical 
college of ohio

dr john gibbs the hospitals director of medical affairs 
acknowledged finances played a role in the decision to change 
surgeons most of his montesinos patients werent covered 
under the drgs he said the resource utilization was high 
the amount of blood pump time a lot of xrays and the resources 
of the hospital 
hospitals now must go to considerable lengths to get rid of 
financially rebellious doctors but some fear it soon will become 
much easier 
some medical consultants and attorneys suggest rewriting 
hospital bylaws to permit financial credentialing this would 
allow review committees to consider doctors economic profiles 
including the profitability of their patients when deciding 
whether to allow them to admit patients 
others worry doctors will shortchange their patients if they are 
forced to put the hospitals interests first said the amas lang 
when you base medical staff privileges on economic criteria 
unrelated to quality you are setting up a situation where the 
patient can be harmed

once dr paul harper was the busiest surgeon 
in town now his career is in shambles and he blames his fall on a 
hospital slander campaign he said was intended to scare away 
patients and other doctors 
even harper concedes his sometimes abrasive sharptongued 
approach did nothing to endear him to administrators of parkland 
medical center and worsened the situation 
but he contends his troubles stem in large part from disloyalty 
he sent patients outside the hospitals for lab tests and xrays on 
uptodate equipment when accident victims needed more 
sophisticated care than parkland could offer he transferred them 
to bigger hospitals rather than send them out for a specific test 
if thats his contention its the first time weve heard it 
and we certainly deny it said richard v wiebusch the 
hospitals attorney who declined to discuss specifics of 
parklands allegations against harper 
at a court hearing he said harper is a dangerous incompetent 
surgeon and should not be allowed to practice general surgery 
in the past 12 years harper said he has faced five malpractice 
suits an unusually high number for rural new hampshire surgeons 
however often face greater risks of malpractice suits 
harper once performed 350 operations a year he now does a 
dozen he has sued the hospital claiming it put together a slander 
attack to discredit and get rid of him 
he said that hospital officials 
told other doctors not to send him patients who needed surgery 
spread word among patients and the hospital staff that harper 
was sloppy he had too many complications and a high infection 
rate 
took his name off the list of doctors who received referrals 
from the hospital 
asked another surgeon to review all harpers cases to look for 
reasons to get him off the staff 
through peer review harper eventually lost some but not all 
of his rights to perform surgery at parkland he said the list was 
crafted to rob him of the most lucrative procedures 
i can take out a gallbladder but i cant touch the stomach 
he said i can take out an appendix but i cant touch the 
intestines i can fix a groin hernia but i cant fix a belly 
hernia 
some derry doctors on the advice of their lawyers declined to 
talk about harper but others were willing to defend him 
when i started at that hospital 12 years ago he was the 
unquestioned authority on surgical abdominal problems recalled 
dr william willetts of manchester he was a very credible 
surgeon he is not credible anymore at that hospital but i think 
he is still a good doctor 
a former emergency room doctor at parkland who asked not to be 
identified said harper is no heart transplant surgeon but 
instances of alleged incompetence were really sought after and 
milked for all they were worth

when hospitals want to expel a financially wayward doctor they 
usually try to build a case of medical incompetence but that may 
change 
some experts contend hospitals have a right to begin economic 
credentialing basing doctors right to practice in the facility 
on their financial prowess as well as their medical skills 
its a very controversial notion said john blum of loyola 
law school in chicago physicians are not used to being judged on 
their economic performance rather than on their clinical 
performance 
blum recently surveyed 30 hospital administrators while none is 
using economic credentialing he found many eager to have it 
written into the medical staff bylaws 
writing in a health journal john j eller and sanford v 
teplitzky of the baltimore law firm of ober kaler grimes amp 
shriver made the case for using economic yardsticks to select new 
physicians and get rid of those on staff 
hospitals can and should consciously appoint the right mix of 
physicians who will be economic assets to the hospital instead of 
liabilities they wrote 
among factors that could be taken into account they said are 
how long doctors keep people in the hospital whether they use lots 
of hospital services for privately insured patients how close 
their offices are to the hospital and even how old they are since 
older doctors tend to cut back their use of the hospital as they 
near retirement

the boxy brickred towers of 
mexicos first nuclear power plant jut into the moist tropical air 
from a sandy beach flanked by palmfringed lagoons 
not everyone is thrilled about laguna verde a 654megawatt 
plant in southeastern mexico that started normal operations in 
august 22 years after the project began and 14 years behind 
schedule 
the federal energy commission says laguna verde based on a 
general electric boilingwater reactor will help power mexico when 
its petroleum begins to run out current consumption rates and 
proven reserves indicate oil and gas production will continue at 
least 53 years 
energy commission spokesman mario santoscoy said officials hope 
to begin two more nuclear plants by the year 2000 
spindly transmission towers march through the lush foliage into 
the hills from laguna verde in veracruz state 190 miles east of 
mexico city only three miles from where hernan cortez landed to 
conquer mexico 
many opponents are beginning to feel the campaign against the 
plant is futile protests began in 1986 after the chernobyl 
nuclear accident in the soviet union 
there is no possibility whatever to stop it because the 
government proceeds without listening to anybody said novelist 
homero aridjis president of the environmentalist group of 100 
protests peaked in 1988 when tens of thousands of demonstrators 
repeatedly jammed the streets of jalapa capital of veracruz the 
navy was called in to end a nineday blockade of the highway 
outside laguna verde which means green lagoon 
a military post is still opposite the plants main gate but 
antinuclear fervor has faded with time and frustration 
demonstrations now are fewer and smaller 
most of the plants foes seem to oppose nuclear power in 
general but many claim laguna verde is a badly built example of an 
obsolete us design that is poisoning the veracruz coastline with 
radiation 
nearly every claim by either side is disputed and bickering is 
more common than discussion 
there are constant emissions of radioactive gases 
environmentalist roberto helier said quoting sources at the plant 
vinicio serment cabrero plant information director asserted 
we havent had discharges of radioactive materials either liquid 
or gas 
critics pass out copies of official lab tests showing high 
levels of strontium 90 in shrimp caught nearby the plant safety 
director sergio zorrilla has other documents citing later tests 
with low strontium 90 levels 
opponents claim the plant was stopped 41 times during its test 
run including several emergencies officials admit to 30 or so 
but insist none was an emergency 
a recent official study by nine foreign experts found the plant 
had released only minute amounts of radiation critics accuse the 
experts of bias helier cited studies showing even small amounts of 
radiation can increase risks of cancer 
spent fuel from laguna verde will remain radioactive for 
thousands of years 
critics also claim the lengthy test period four times longer 
than scheduled indicates problems 
john ahearn a member of the us nuclear regulatory commission 
from 1978 to 1983 said a long test can either indicate a lot of 
problems or it can indicate prudent caution 
former plant manager augustin perez ruiz insisted it was the 
latter we did everything with the rigor of a novice we didnt 
want anything to happen 
ahearn said a long test period might help train workers 
the most critical element in nuclear power plants are the 
people he said if youre in a country that has never built a 
plant before its going to take them a longer time 
according to critics the plant workers are not welltrained 
theres always a factor of risk said aridjis the novelist 
and the most unpredictable of all is a human error 
up the road from laguna verde many people in the town of palma 
sola have come to terms with the plant a butcher shop has taken 
the name carniceria nuclear 
hundreds of residents work at the plant which helps replace 
income lost when tourists began to abandon local beaches and market 
vendors went elsewhere to buy fish 
i was in the marches against the plant said 30yearold 
agueda grajales who sat behind the cash register in a hardware 
store now i would not go 
at the beginning we were afraid because they didnt tell us 
anything but now the plant is working and nothing is 
happening she said

record numbers of argentines are unemployed 
brazils economy has shrunk almost 10 percent in a year and 
millions of peruvians go hungry 
a deep recession is spreading through many of the countries that 
stretch south from the caribbean to tierra del fuego 
the freemarket economic shock programs adopted in the past 
several years have conquered hyperinflation but at the brutal cost 
of making most latin americans desperately poor 
as standards of living fall the specter of last years bloody 
food riots in venezuela haunts the regions leaders 
every person has limits and we are now approaching ours 
javier silva ruete former economy minister of peru said recently 
the people are going to explode 
anger in the dominican republic turned to violence in august at 
least 11 people were killed and 50 injured in clashes with police 
after the government doubled the prices of basic goods 
days later in peru three people were killed in looting when new 
president alberto fujimori eliminated subsidies quadrupled food 
prices and raised the cost of gasoline 30fold 
venezuelan students went into the streets in july to protest 
higher fuel prices in august the vice president of argentina 
predicted government austerity would lead to social 
convulsions 
brazilian auto workers rioted in july burning 50 cars union 
leader vicente paulo da silva called it a sign of the violence 
that could erupt as a result of the workers despair 
violence probably will continue because governments have little 
money and sometimes little political desire to ease the human 
costs of the austerity programs they impose 
few deny that changes were needed 
inflation devastated most economies in recent years perus 
annual inflation rate of 3000 percent devoured government revenues 
and made it impossible for businessmen to plan the poor suffered 
as prices outstripped wges 
massive foreign debt choked many latin american countries and 
most virtually stopped payments leading companies and bankers to 
invest elsewhere local investors lost confidence and moved 
billions of dollars abroad 
bureaucratic bloat and inefficient government services hampered 
the ability of businesses to produce high tariffs artificially 
protected domestic industry 
the crisis peaked first in bolivia in 1985 with inflation so 
bad it took a pound of paper currency to buy a pound of bread 
president victor paz estenssoro imposed drastic measures within 
days of taking office 
he slashed subsidies and raised prices which cut consumption 
and narrowed the deficit gap he fired tens of thousands of 
government workers and allowed many small businesses to fail 
bolivians protested but inflation was brought under control and 
economists declared the reforms a success 
the bolivian shock became a model for other latin american 
nations venezuela became the model of what to avoid 
venezuelans accustomed to large subsidies from the oil boom of 
the 1970s were rudely surprised when president carlos andres perez 
ended price controls and raised bus fares in february 1989 
hundreds of thousands filled the streets of caracas erecting 
barricades burning cars and looting hundreds of stores for three 
days the city of 5 million was out of government control 
when soldiers finally moved in to restore order at least 300 
people were killed the government says human rights groups put 
the total nearer 1000 
months after the caracas uprising food riots in rosario 
argentina cost 16 lives so the risks were known to governments 
that applied shocks this year in brazil the dominican republic and 
peru 
president fernando collor of brazil understood the lesson by 
raising the minimum wage while temporarily freezing prices he 
gained important shortterm support for the austerity measures he 
introduced march 16 
economic chaos allowed fujimori no such liberties in peru 
when he took office july 28 the government was bankrupt and 
only one of five workers had a steady job there were severe 
shortages of gasoline and bread and the worst drought in memory had 
destroyed many vital crops 
fujimoris hastily prepared measures sent prices soaring 397 
percent in august alone the shock left the economy nearly 
paralyzed many factories closed and sales declined 75 percent 
hunger became widespread emergency food aid has taken weeks to 
reach the poor and some areas have yet to receive even one bag of 
rice many people survive on a bowl of watery soup a day 
juan jose vega of the unicef office in lima said the shock has 
tremendously and permanently affected the mental and physical 
health of an entire generation of peruvian children 
economic shock programs in other countries have been less 
severe but the recessions they provoked also have fallen most 
heavily on the poor and the middle class 
president carlos menem of argentina managed to halve annual 
inflation which was running at more than 3600 percent when he 
took office last year but shantytowns are spreading hospitals run 
short of drugs and crime is soaring in a nation that once had the 
regions largest middle class 
inflation in brazil is down from about 80 percent a month to 
near 10 percent but more than 1 million workers have lost their 
jobs since march 
there is little promise of economic growth soon the example of 
bolivia is sobering five years after the shock was applied 
inflation remains low but the economy is stagnant 
even deeper recession may lie ahead most latin american 
countries import oil which has become dramatically more expensive 
because of the persian gulf crisis 
no one is sure how long the poor will wait on a continent where 
guerrilla movements have been a part of life for generations 
more than 20000 peruvians have been killed in political 
violence since the shining path a maoist group began fighting a 
decade ago 
we are a nation already at war said sen javier diez 
canseco a peruvian leftist

diplomats from eastern europe used to 
have a hard time getting inside the heavily guarded nato complex 
now they are given uptotheminute briefings on the persian gulf 
crisis 
a year ago just walking around nato headquarters would 
have been either illegal or certainly incredible said tibor 
kiss the hungarian charge daffaires in brussels 
he is among diplomats from eastern european countries that 
accepted an invitation from north atlantic treaty organization 
leaders to a regular diplomatic liaison with the western 
alliance 
at their july summit in london president bush and the other 
nato leaders said the west wanted to share our thinking and 
deliberations in this historic period of change 
they made the offer to the soviet union czechoslovakia 
hungary poland bulgaria and romania all members of the warsaw 
pact the crumbling eastern military alliance the seventh warsaw 
pact member was east germany now part of united germany which 
belongs to nato 
the soviet union and hungary were the first to accept telling 
nato their ambassadors to belgium would represent them and the 
others followed diplomats from the six countries have had about 
half a dozen briefings at nato mostly on the gulf crisis 
a senior nato official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the briefings illustrated the new postcold war era that 
were in we are no longer adversaries 
henning wegener assistant secretarygeneral of nato for 
political affairs gave the diplomats information on two meetings 
in august and september of foreign ministers of the western 
alliances 16 member nations 
separate sessions have been held with american officials 
including the us ambassador to iraq april glaspie and 
condolezza rice a soviet specialist at the national security 
council in washington 
no nato secrets were divulged said those attending the 
discussions 
i would not say these briefings are more informative than the 
press conferences one diplomat said on condition of anonymity 
others described them as helpful especially the ones given soon 
after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
kiss said hungary certainly took into account whatever was 
said by the west in determi ning its position on the invasion 
nato is wrestling with the question of how far it should go in 
contacts with the ambassadors known in natospeak as 
interlocutors 
william h taft iv us representative to the alliance would 
like to see the links expanded 
i would hope that we would at the least go well beyond 
the idea of simply keeping these new friends advised of major 
developments when they occur he said in a recent speech 
the point of liaison is surely something more indeed to 
keep in touch before major steps are taken and to benefit from 
consultation before decisions are taken 
some european countries notably france are more cautious 
one nato diplomat who would not let his name be used said the 
invitation was a symbolic gesture intended to end the kind of 
distrust the six countries had concerning nato it was important to 
tell them our door was open 
making the contacts more formal by opening a new nato office 
for the purpose or granting the diplomats observer status at 
meetings would change the real objective of this measure he 
said 
we have to have first a real debate in the organization about 
what we want to do the nato diplomat said in an interview 
andrei keline first secretary at the soviet embassy doubts he 
ever will observe highlevel nato meetings 
this is an alliance he said we are not part of it 
still keline said moscow feels the links offer potential for 
military scientific and economic cooperation 
nato is an important organization he said what we want 
is contacts that are businesslike they should be deep and they 
should give as much as possible for both sides 
hungary which plans to leave the warsaw pacts military arm 
next year wants to deal with nato on its own not in a group with 
the other pact members could the initial contacts eventually lead 
to one or more of the warsaw pact countries applying for membership 
in the western alliance 
nato isnt seized with that question because nobody has 
asked the senior nato official said 
keline commented i wouldnt bury the warsaw pact right 
now

imagine free rent and equipment for your 
business a guaranteed income and interestfree loans these are 
some of the enticements hospitals give doctors to win their 
patients the deals are good for hospitals but they can violate 
the law contribute to bad care and drive up medical costs in the 
first of a threepart series doctors for sale national writer 
fred bayles and science writer daniel q haney examine the hazards 
of this practice for the nation and one louisiana community

across the united states hospitals without 
enough sick people to fill their beds are plying doctors with 
money cheap loans free offices and other gifts in return for 
patients 
a physician willing to move his practice across country or 
even across town can pick up tens of thousands of dollars in 
income guarantees equipment and plain cold cash 
when the nations largest forprofit chain went looking for 
doctors for its new north monroe hospital here for example it 
agreed to pay eight specialists 1 million over three years to ease 
their move from the longestablished downtown medical center 
in return for such generosity hospitals typically expect one 
thing above all the doctors patients or what they 
euphemistically call loyalty 
while the deals make doctors richer and hospitals healthier 
they may skirt the law and sometimes break it federal rules 
prohibit doctors from taking kickbacks for putting medicare or 
medicaid patients in hospitals most states have similar laws 
the american medical associations ethical policy states 
payments to or by a physician for the referral of patients are 
improper and the american college of physicians ethics manual 
says collusion with any healthcare provider for personal gain 
is morally reprehensible 
tying the doctors financial fortunes to those of a hospital 
injects a new conflict of interest into medical care these deals 
can influence and possibly degrade the kind of treatment 
patients receive yet the sick are almost never aware of this 
hidden partnership 
if now it turns out that the doctor is in bed with the 
hospital and they are both interested in the bottom line the 
patient becomes the victim said dr arnold relman editor of the 
new england journal of medicine 
medicare and other insurers have changed the rules of medicine 
by shortening and often eliminating patients stays in the 
hospital as a result many hospitals are halfempty and eager to 
woo doctors their most important source of business 
a doctor who gets money from a hospital might feel obliged to 
send patients there when better care is available elsewhere 
patients can even wind up in a hospital when a cheaper safer 
option would do 
the deals also increase medical spending by tacitly sometimes 
directly pressuring doctors to do more tests and procedures 
medical decisions on whether you take action or not are 
difficult enough when all you have to consider is the patients 
welfare said dr henry jones a monroe family practitioner at 
the very least youre going to think more about putting someone in 
the hospital when it holds your mortgage or is giving you help that 
makes up a healthy part of your income 
jones has sued hospital corporation of america the owner of 
north monroe hospital alleging unfair business practices he 
contends his practice was ruined after he complained about such 
policies and resigned as the hospitals first chief of staff after 
the facility opened in 1984 
documents and depositions in his suit open a rare window on the 
usually hushhush deals between hospitals and doctors they show 
hospital offers of discounted real estate and loans as well as 
outright cash 
such largess did not come without strings some recipients got 
notes from the hospitals administrator prodding them to admit 
patients one doctor said he was told loan payments could be 
deferred if enough patients were admitted others spoke of 
unnecessary and potentially risky tests ordered by doctors 
hca officials deny rewarding doctors for patients but declined 
to discuss the deals as did arlen reynolds the north monroe 
administrator at the time but in a deposition reynolds explained 
the philosophy behind the arrangements 
we assist them in relocating so that we can increase the 
breadth of our medical staff and one of the side results of 
that is that you do get additional admissions he said 
however dr lee roy joyner a founder of the group practice 
that received 1 million goes further they wanted the 
gynecologists who did the most hysterectomies not the ones who 
were the best doctors they would make us aware of which admissions 
and procedures were where they made their money 
the monroe case may represent an extreme but such deals are far 
from unique hospitals of all types from profitmaking chains to 
facilities with religious affiliations offer incentives to bring 
in doctors and with them their patients 
you give me any major metropolitan area and i can guarantee 
you there is dirt going on said steve hirschtick a los angeles 
lawyer who represents doctors around the country in contractual 
dealings with hospitals anybody who looks at these deals is 
going to conclude they are illegal arrangements 
from attending conferences and listening to lawyers it is 
something that is a growing trend said harvey yamplosky former 
chief lawyer of the us department of health and human services 
inspector generals office everybody seems to agree that if the 
government doesnt do something more it is going to take over the 
way people do business 
among the most common deals 
doctors receive cutrate or free space in hospitalowned office 
buildings or have their rent paid 
when doctors join the staff the hospital guarantees them a 
minimum income for a few years 
many get signing bonuses of 20000 50000 or more 
hospitals outfit doctors offices with equipment ranging from 
photocopying to xray machines 
hospitals pay doctors thousands for sham administrative 
positions that require no work 
doctors are given loans with little or no interest payments 
sometimes the loans are written off if the doctor remains a loyal 
admitter 
a 1987 survey of 114 hospitals by the atlanta recruiting firm of 
jackson and coker found 95 percent used income guarantees to lure 
doctors eightyeight percent said they gave physicians unspecified 
assistance to start a practice 52 percent provided free office 
space and 36 percent gave interestfree loans 
hospitals have to be aggressive to maintain the level of 
admissions and doctors are important to that said jackson and 
coker president bill dismuke 
hospitals long have recruited doctors to ensure their 
communities good medical care but the stakes have escalated 
instead of seeking doctors from across the country many hospitals 
are recruiting from across town 
setting them up in practice is an awfully good way to win 
loyalty said sue cejka a st louis recruiter its a way for 
the hospital to engage doctors to admit to only the one hospital 
physician loyalty is important in large part because tightfisted 
insurers require hospitals to send patients home sooner or treat 
them as outpatients 
in 1983 us hospitals were 72 percent full according to the 
american hospital association by last year occupancy had fallen 
to 65 percent even though 250 hospitals closed during the seven 
years 
all this has left many of the nations 5537 hospitals 
scrambling for patients and the best source is doctors steve renn 
of health care investment analysts in baltimore notes that three 
out of four people pick a hospital on their doctors 
recommendation 
one of the top two or three ways of getting patients into your 
hospital is to get the strong allegiance of the doctor he said 
to do that some hospitals tie the physicians fortunes into the 
fortunes of the hospital

hospitals try to build financial ties with doctors even when 
they are the only facility in town but the quest for doctors 
loyalty can intensify when hospitals vie for a shrinking pool of 
patients or in monroes case a new hospital opens in town 
before hca built its sleek 158bed community hospital in the 
comfortable suburbs on monroes north side the city of 60000 was 
served by st francis a 480bed regional medical center in the 
citys decaying downtown and two smaller hospitals 
to break into the market hca asked several doctors to open 
offices next door while hca could not match services provided at 
st francis it tried to win over doctors with money 
to get the citys largest group of specialists to move the 
hospital assumed the 15000 monthly mortgage payments on their 
downtown building sold them hospital land at a bargain price 
loaned them 24 million to build and equip new offices and paid a 
60000 cash bonus similar deals were given to other doctors 
shortly after the deal was signed the doctors received a note 
from the hospital administrator urging them to admit patients 
when the specialty group lost patients after the move the 
hospital agreed to pay its eight doctors 108 million over three 
years 
hca deferred payments on the groups loan for at least a year 
joyner said an hca official indicated future payments could be 
suspended if the hospital was at least 80 percent full 
joyner resigned from the group after a falling out with his 
partners who voted to remove him as president he also was dropped 
from the hospital board 
some doctors complain the hospital never called them when their 
patients came in for emergencies instead they were referred to 
doctors who had special relationships with the hospital 
what was unusual was the referral pattern from the emergency 
room physicians said dr sid bailey an orthopedic surgeon if 
a patient requests a doctor the doctor should be called its our 
feeling that they were calling someone else 
dr robin lake a member of joyners former group denied 
financial arrangements affected doctors medical judgment 
arlen reynolds would give some pep talks like we really 
need your support but nobody had anything to say to me about how 
i practice medicine he said 
lake also denied hca deferred payments based on the hospitals 
occupancy instead he said after a oneyear suspension the group 
made loan payments until recently when the clinic was dissolved 
and the property returned to the hospital in forgiveness for the 
loan 
hca officials declined to be interviewed about the deals citing 
pending litigation a company statement said the chain helps 
doctors to best serve the health care needs of the community in 
no instance are physicians rewarded for admitting or otherwise 
treating patients in hca hospitals 
hca said all benefits given to doctors met state and federal 
guidelines 
violations are tough to prove the federal 1977 medicare 
medicaid antikickback act makes it a felony for a doctor to 
knowingly and willfully receive any financial gain for 
referring patients such activity can cost louisiana doctors their 
licenses 
most agreements between doctors and hospitals are carefully 
worded to avoid a connection between financial benefits and patient 
referral 
the gray area is is the economic benefit for the doctor in 
exchange for the referral of patients or for the betterment of 
medical care said attorney sanford teplitzky who helped write 
the antikickback laws 
many doctors and administrators believe they can keep those two 
issues apart 
rather than bluntly asking a doctor for patients david glover 
the current administrator at hcas monroe hospital said its 
kind of done in a joking fashion you might see a doctor in the 
hallway and say hey doc weve got one empty icu bed its all 
yours 
but some dont see the humor 
it calls into question who the doctor is working for said 
arthur caplan a medical ethicist at the university of minnesota 
traditionally you are supposed to have allegiance to your 
patient first and foremost doctors shouldnt worry about losing 
their cheap rent if the hospital gets angry at them

attorney steve hirschtick sometimes finds it 
hard to persuade his doctor clients that they are breaking the law 
one time i was in a room of about 20 doctors and a couple of 
hospital administrators trying to convince them the low rents the 
hospital was charging doctors were illegal he recalled 
hirschtick feared the deal violated federal kickback laws that 
bar doctors from receiving financial favors in return for referring 
patients although the rental agreement didnt mention referrals 
hirschtick worried it still could land them in court or worse 
they kept saying tell us who has ever been prosecuted for 
this he said i was considered satan for telling them to pay 
higher rents 
under the 1977 medicare medicaid antikickback act it is a 
felony for a doctor to knowingly and willfully receive cash or 
kind in return for referring a patient 
most states have similar laws 
but knowingly and willfully has been a stumbling block for 
doctors their lawyers and prosecutors investigating allegations of 
kickbacks 
proving the intent of the parties is sometimes very 
complicated said thomas crane an attorney in the us 
department of health and human services inspector generals 
office there are wellpaid lawyers who help hide the intent of 
the parties 
prosecutors like crane have been stymied for years by the need 
to prove that a hospitals gift to doctors of free rent equipment 
and services was in exchange for their patients 
congress gave the hhs a new weapon in 1987 with the medicare and 
medicaid patient and program protection act the law grants the 
department the authority to bring civil cases against doctors and 
hospitals before administrative law judges rather than relying on 
busy us attorneys to prosecute charges in crowded criminal 
courts 
by bringing civil cases the government does not have to prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt the intent of the agreement it can win a 
conviction by showing the relationship between the hospitals offer 
and the doctors referrals 
doctors and hospitals found guilty under the new regulation can 
be excluded from the medicare and medicaid programs while nobody 
goes to jail exclusion can be financially devastating 
the government now is testing the new law in a california case 
involving blood labs accused of making kickbacks to doctors who 
both invested in the labs and referred patients there hearings 
were held before an administrative law judge in august a ruling 
isnt expected until early next year 
meanwhile hhs officials are considering new criteria known as 
safe harbors that outline what deals between doctors and hospitals 
would be considered legal 
under these criteria which have yet to be published hospitals 
could extend financial help to doctors relocating from another part 
of the country such benefits could be offered only for three years 
and could not be related in any way to a doctors referrals 
but even if adopted these guidelines arent expected to stop 
hospitals and doctors from making questionable deals 
our concern is lawyers will try to make seriously illegal 
conduct look like a safe harbor crane said

an unpleasant diagnostic test known as 
broncoscopy grew so popular for a time among doctors at north 
monroe hospital that some of them made up a ditty about it 
he bronchs them once he bronchs them twice he bronchs them 
once again the doctors crooned 
dr henry jones mentioned the popularity of this procedure and 
the song when he gave a deposition in a lawsuit against the 
hospital and its owners hospital corporation of america 
other doctors also worried about the apparent zeal with which 
this and other tests and procedures were done at the hospital dr 
george ellis in another sworn deposition said some doctors who 
had received hospital favors overused bronchoscopy a potentially 
risky procedure in which a tube is threaded into the lungs to look 
for disease 
i think they performed bronchoscopy when it was unnecessary 
and i think they did it too often on patients said the 
radiologist he complained to hospital staff and said he soon saw 
his own referrals disappear 
dr david raines told of one of his patients who went to the 
north monroe emergency room with chest pains the man was admitted 
and referred to a cardiologist the cardiologist sent him to a 
pulmonary specialist then an ear nose and throat doctor then a 
rheumetologist each specialist performed a series of hospital 
tests 
he was aggressively investigated which was obviously a 
financial thing said raines 
hospital officials declined comment citing pending litigation

motorola inc said monday it has settled 
a patent infringement lawsuit which twice had threatened to cut 
off supplies of key parts to american computer manufacturers 
terms of the settlement with hitachi ltd were not disclosed 
but motorola executive james a norling said he was pleased 
our unwavering goals in this legal action were to protect 
motorolas intellectual property and to assure our customers an 
uninterrupted supply of motorolas leadership microprocessors 
said norling president and general manager of the companys 
semiconductor products sector 
motorola sued hitachi nearly two years ago in us district 
court in austin texas accusing the japanese company of using 
certain microprocessor designs patented by motorola 
hitachi countered by accusing motorola of patent infringement 
when the chicagoarea company developed its widely used 68030 chip 
a federal judge in texas twice ordered the companies to stop 
selling their chips in the united states and to try to work out a 
settlement the orders were stayed in both cases 
the lawsuits involved hitachis h8 and h16 microcontrollers 
and motorolas 68030 and 88000 microprocessors

analysts said monday a proposed employee buyout 
of united airlines parent company is less likely with the 
unraveling of 2 billion in hopedfor bank financing 
rising oil prices and tight credit caused by the persian gulf 
crisis prompted banks to balk at committing the necessary loans to 
underwrite a bid in time to meet an oct 9 deadline said gerald 
greenwald head of the united employee acquisition corp which has 
been trying to engineer the buyout 
the final chapter in this drama has not been written yet but 
were getting close said samuel buttrick of kidder peabody amp co 
in new york its almost dead 
at this point i think coming up with a viable deal 
especially by the deadline which is tomorrow is a pretty long 
shot said robert decker of duff amp phelps in chicago the more 
likely alternative is theyre going to try to ask for some more 
time from the board or time to put together another deal 
but greenwald said monday by telephone from new york we dont 
have a plan of that type right now 
he said he did not know what the group would do if the board 
rejected its restructured offer which will depend on financing 
from other sources 
greenwalds group announced sunday it had failed for the second 
time in two months to assemble bank backing for its bid for ual 
corp 
the group said it would instead depend on financing consisting 
of loans from suppliers revenue from saleleaseback arrangements 
in which the company sells equipment such as airplanes and leases 
them back employee investments and cash on hand 
were trying to come to the board withan equally attractive 
package greenwald said sunday we are trying to make up the 
shortfall in cash with some other features 
the group said it would present a new offer at a ual board 
meeting tuesday 
the group declined to estimate the value of its restructured 
bid saying only it would be substantially higher than the current 
price of ual stock which closed down 1075 per share at 92 
monday on the new york stock exchange 
the employees last week had been trying to put together a deal 
believed to value the chicagobased company at 165 to 175 a 
share or 36 billion to 38 billion 
the new york times quoted an unidentified source in its tuesday 
editions as saying the buyout group has put together an offer of 
160 a share or 35 billion 
that was considerably less than the 201ashare offer they had 
been working to assemble when the board granted them an extension 
to try to solidify bank financing two months ago 
analyst stephen dexter of kemper financial services inc in 
chicago said the company should be worth more than rival american 
airlines whose stock two months ago indicated the airline was 
worth 38 billion 
dexter said sunday he believed united suppliers such as 
seattlebased boeing co and pratt amp whitney aircraft in hartford 
conn would be unlikely to want to support the employee bid 
the vendors are really hesitant he said its logical 
why if boeing finances united they risk upsetting everyone else 
theyre trying to sell airplanes to delta japan airlines it

why does a golfer wear two pairs of 
socks 
in case he gets a hole in one 
telling jokes like that michael pasternak and allen sullivan 
have expanded an enterprise that began as a sample sock sale out of 
a pickup truck into socks galore an 18 millionayear chain of 
62 stores in 34 states 
pasternak a former education professor at vanderbilt 
university and sullivan his onetime graduate student call 
themselves the sock docs 
food and clothing giant sara lee corp bought their chain for an 
undisclosed price in 1989 shortly after buying adams millis one 
of the nations largest hosiery mills 
pasternak and sullivans freewheeling business tactics range 
from attending sales meetings in clown suits and other disguises to 
performing skits they sell their socks with the instructions 
tgif or toe goes in first 
the deal with sara lee included longterm management contracts 
under which pasternak and sullivan will continue running the chain 
with the same unorthodox methods 
their management style and their personalities were certainly 
an attractive part of the acquisition company spokeswoman ann 
mccarthy said 
socks galore made its retail debut as a kiosk in a nashville 
shopping mall with one employee it opened in time for the 
christmas rush of 1981 
we sold 34000 pairs of socks thats when we knew we really 
were on to something pasternak said 
in 1982 they opened the first permanent store in murfreesboro 
tenn at the outlets ltd mall 
id run the murfreesboro store in the daytime and allen would 
teach all day and run the store at night pasternak said 
pasternak and sullivan operate with a set of principles they say 
they developed from lessons learned over the past decade 
they were taught the first when buyers flocked to the sale at 
the pickup truck pasternak said 
we learned on the side of the road about variety he said 
why else would we have 60000 pairs of socks in a store 
they also learned about sock quality along the way they sell 
only americanmade socks believing the quality is superior to that 
of koreanmade socks even though they cost up to twice as much 
yet another lesson was to shun professional salespeople 
theyre too greedy sullivan said 
so socks galore hires nonprofessionals and trains them at the 
sock doc college in franklin tenn 
socks galore made about 18 million in sales last year a small 
percentage of sara lees 117 illion annual revenues 
the parent refused to give projections for 1990 but pasternak 
and sullivan said they dont expect their business to suffer during 
the current economic slowdown after all they founded the company 
during a recession on 1500 in cash and a 5000 loan at 18 
percent interest 
in that recession women would buy clothes but men wouldnt 
buy suits pasternak said theyd buy socks or ties but they 
wouldnt buy suits 
they said they expect that pattern to continue 
fashion trends they see for socks include lots of colors for 
women and children mens socks will continue to be dark but 
subtle designs should become more popular they said

sobered by two snowscarce seasons european winter resorts hope 
to lure skiers back to the slopes this year with massive 
investments in snowmaking machines 
theyll also rely on an array of substitute activities ranging 
from winter golf and horseback riding to sled dog runs and cooking 
classes just in case the flakes are short again this year 
europes oldest resort italys sestrieres reeled out the lure 
as soon as the summer ended its offering a 636 halfprice early 
purchase season ticket for more than 100 lifts over 250 miles along 
the francoitalian border 
west germanys resorts are offering threehour lift tickets 
while garmisch partenkirchen has invested in snow cannons to 
avoid calling off world cup ski races for the fourth season in a 
row 
such precautions are not surprising after europes last two mild 
winters which triggered a crisis in the western alps some resorts 
closed early or drastically curtailed their season 
conditions were better on the eastern side of europes central 
range where damage was held to a 3 percent attendance drop 
faring much better were highaltitude resorts some of which 
offer yearround skiing at elevations over 11000 feet frances 
glaciers at les deux alpes and alpe dhuez attracted thousands of 
italians over the border while hinterdux and sulden in austria 
became hot places to ski 
but european manufacturers were hurt frances rossignol and 
yugoslavias elan ski factories posted record losses and salomon 
bindings reduced its sponsorship to 30 world cup skiers 
this year the resorts have come up with a number of incentives 
to boost their business 
the season ticket for sestrieres in italy includes free access 
to health clubs medical insurance and helicopter evacuation in 
case of accident free ski lessons for children under 7 free 
tickets for a race in the world ski championship on dec 11 
discounts on mountain bike purchases and free access to a winter 
golf driving range 
more incentives are found at italys frenchspeaking val daosta 
area at the foot of mont blanc the resorts of courmayeur and pila 
have poured 10 million into new snowmaking equipment in 12 
valleys and started regular helicopter ski runs with mountain 
guides 
crosscountry skiers are a being wooed by low 5 rental fees 
while canine fans can try their rein with siberian and alaskan 
huskies and alaskan malamutes at the mont blanc sled dog school 
italys dolomite range with its superski dolomiti skipass 
allowing access to 12 resorts and 450 lifts has started a new 
vacation on the move formula skiers may glide off every 48 
hours to a new town while their suitcases are sent by bus to the 
next hotel on their itinerary 
our main problem has been to get the correct information on 
the weather to skiers abroad says franz peradoner director of 
the dolomiti formula while skiers might have been sobbing in one 
mountain valley others could have been kicking up powder in 
another place where the snowfall hit 
swiss resorts seem to have suffered the least from scarce 
snowflakes zermatt recorded a 129 percent increase in foreign 
visitors thanks to its glacier skiing st moritz where fewer 
than half of its visitors seek downhill activities has diversified 
into crosscountry winter cricket polo games in the snow 
greyhound racing and horse jumping 
there are some positive signs for the european resorts 
austrias saalbach is hosting the world ski championships in 
february and many resorts are already booked for the christmas and 
traditional carnival vacations 
sweden and other scandinavian countries are enjoying a 
miniboom reinforced by a snow guarantee triggering a 
reimbursement in case the flakes do not fall 
and in switzerland some resorts like wengen and muerren are so 
popular that hotel owners accept reservations from their regular 
clients only on alternate years the french speaking valais area 
has launched a lift card for use in the entire province while 
sunny resorts like crans montana are offering golf in the snow 
hiking and outdoor tennis

representatives of four former soviet bloc 
countries are meeting with officials of the oldest us stock 
exchange to find ways of easing their transition to free market 
economies 
the exchange is marking its 200th anniversary with a threeday 
gathering ending today to discuss the dangers and opportunities in 
eastern europe now that communism is retreating 
and officials from czechoslovakia hungary poland and romania 
are here to win friends and interest investors 
this is not just the anniversary of the philadelphia stock 
exchange said nicholas giordano president of the exchange 
this is the anniversary of free markets 
as an exchange we wish to be a force in this economic 
revolution and we are excited about the opening of these markets 
said joseph rizzello president of the philadelphia board of trade 
an exchange subsidiary 
at a closed session sunday the east europeans met with 
giordano rizzello securities and exchange commission chairman 
richard breeden and others to discuss areas of potential 
cooperation including 
developing a program for east european officials to receive 
onthejob training at philadelphia and other exchanges 
bringing companies listed on the philadelphia exchange 
together with their opposite numbers in east europe for possible 
joint ventures and 
supplying technical assistance in developing investment funds 
to support privatization of stateowned enterprises 
the gathering the first meeting of the exchanges committee for 
exploring capital formation in eastern europe comes as officials 
of the much larger new york stock exchange visit moscow discussing 
opening an exchange in the soviet union 
the philadelphia exchange although smaller has been an 
aggressive leader in developing innovative financial products like 
foreign currency options 
giordano still thinks his exchange has a lot to offer the 
embryonic markets of eastern europe grappling with basic issues 
like private property rights and what to do with ailing 
moneylosing stateowned industries 
we think the experience of the smaller exchanges could be more 
practical for us to start with said former soviet economist 
stanislav menshikov who attended the conference 
topics discussed included the need for a central banking system 
how quickly the eastern europeans can move from stateownership to 
privitization and the effect of problems in other countries 
jaromir ovotny economic advisor to the mayor of prague said 
iraq owes his country 14 billion that was going to be repaid in 
oil until the worldwide embargo was imposed after iraqs invasion 
of kuwait 
he noted the nowdefunct east german government owed 
czechoslavakia more than 1 billion but despite that and other 
economic woes czechoslavakia is still alive and still 
functioning 
marton tardos a member of the hungarian parliament said the 
problem would be getting people to accept inevitable shortterm 
hardship for long term economic gains 
without shock without pain you cannot go forward he said 
adding introducing a new system is a painful process 
breeden who attended the reopening of the budapest stock 
exchange in june has formed his own advisory committee to suggest 
ways wall street can help the fledgling economies 
we very much wanted to mobilize the resources of the american 
private sector said breeden who has met previously with 
financial officials from the soviet union poland hungary and what 
used to be east germany

united parcel service is betting 888 
tiny black hexagons will ease the organized chaos of delivering 12 
million packages a day 
the hexagons printed on a small square label hold 100 letters 
or numbers that a computer can read thats five times the 
information provided by traditional bar codes which the upscode 
hexagons are intended to replace 
it is the key to a 14 billion program to develop a package 
delivery system that uses people for little more than the driver 
handing the parcel to its recipient ups officials said 
bar codes in my opinion are 80s technology not 90s 
technology said wesley e hughes who led the team that 
developed the new system 
ups uses bar codes to keep track of the 700000 packages it 
delivers by air every day but no such computerized system is in 
place to follow the groundtransported packages which make up the 
bulk of upss business said alan caminiti a ups spokesman 
an employee must be involved in sorting and distributing 
packages through every step of the delivery process 
thousands of package handlers line up along conveyor belts at 
upss 150 us sorting hubs they must pick up each package read 
its address and send it down the appropriate chute either to be 
piled into upss familiar brown delivery truck for its final 
destination or sent to another hub for further sorting 
if a ground delivery package is lost clerks must dig through 
files to determine where it entered the ups system and whether it 
got out a tedious process at best and a lengthy one at worst 
airdelivered packages are a little easier to trace as the bar 
code labels allow workers to scan a tracking number into a computer 
that can perform an electronic search 
but both systems require people and ups faces a shrinking pool 
of young and educated workers who can swiftly read and sort 
packages more than 45 percent of the companys 244000 employees 
are parttime package loaders and sorters many of them college 
students caminiti said 
ups delivered 28 billion packages last year and expects that 
number to grow steadily in the coming decade the only way the 
company can keep up with that pace hughes said is to develop 
automatic sorters robotics and computerized tracking systems 
without some type of automation we literally are concerned 
that wed run out of people to process our packages in the 
time frame that we need to get them processed hughes said 
ups researchers developed and patented upscode after they found 
bar codes couldnt pack enough information to meet their needs 
upscodes hexagon pattern can be translated into names addresses 
tracking numbers and any other information 
as a upscodeimprinted package rolls along a conveyor belts at 
slightly more than 5 mph a specially made camera finds reads and 
interprets the code in less than a second without the label 
packages crawl past human sorters at a tenth of the speed so the 
workers can read the labels 
with upscode and a fully automated sorting system the conveyor 
belts can be revved up to allow 5000 packages an hour to get 
through rather than the current 2000 to 3000 hughes said 
upscode will first be used for airdelivered packages next 
spring caminiti said widespread use isnt likely to start until 
1992 when upscode will be used to help ups track every package in 
its system hughes said 
bar coding will soon be used by the us postal service to sort 
distribute and trace its daily deluge of 23 million packages said 
peter a jacobson assistant postmaster for engineering 
he said the postal service wouldnt be interested in using a 
densecode system like upscode because its scanners and readers 
would be too costly 
the more exotic the code the more investment you need to 
make jacobson said 
upscode could be used in other industries besides packge 
delivery if the company decides to sell it commercially hughes 
said 
warehouses which need to keep tight inventory control could 
use a system like upscode he said

the wealthy are getting a dose of what many 
americans already know rougher economic times 
forbes reported monday that the nations 400 richest individuals 
suffered a decline in net worth this year for the first time since 
the magazine began compiling the list eight years ago 
fiftythree of the forbes 400 list lost anywhere from 100 
million to 880 million the magazine said in its oct 22 edition 
the minimum net worth required to join the elite ranking which had 
risen steadily from 1982 to 1989 dropped from 275 million last 
year to 260 million this year 
some names such as casino monger donald j trump were evicted 
another symbolic boot to the 1980s era of living on borrowed money 
forbes said trumps fortune estimated at 17 billion in 1989 was 
possibly within hailing distance of zero because of looming 
loans and a slow economy 
trump who previously has denounced forbes for downgrading his 
ranking on the list did not return a telephone call for comment 
its not just the year donald trumps and some other 
overleveraged fortunes hit the wall the magazine said this 
year the entire forbes 400 list seemed to stop going up and on 
balance start going down 
this year all kinds of things went down real estate media 
banks public stocks private companies you name it forbes 
said 
it said the declines reflected a general scaling down of 
capital values brought about in good part by a worldwide shrinkage 
of credit and sinking stock markets 
thats not to say the wealthiest are hurting unbearably the 
estimated worth of the forbes 400 totals 2725 billion thats 
actually up 35 billion over last years total but the magazine 
said the reason was its discovery of previously hidden sources of 
wealth among some members of the list 
fortythree names were added to the list this year meaning 43 
old names came off six died including the magazines own namesake 
malcolm forbes the fortunes of 35 fell too far to be included 
in addition alfred dreyfus goldman oklahoma city with a 1989 
real estate fortune estimated at 400 million was removed from the 
list because of an inheritance dispute with his brother william 
barron hilton was dropped because part of his 1989 total of 125 
billion actually belongs to a foundation 
as in 1989 the richest person on the list was john werner 
kluge 76 thricemarried entertainment entrepreneur who made his 
56 billion fortune by building up metromedia co a wideranging 
telecommunications company 
no 2 is omaha investor warren buffett 60 who bought his first 
stock at age 11 and parlayed a savvy for picking stocks into a 33 
billion fortune 
third is debtfinanced takeover specialist ronald o perelman 
47 a wharton business school alumnus who borrowed money to build 
an empire that ranges from the revlon cosmetics company to coleman 
camping products to savings amp loans forbes pegged his worth at 
287 billion 
more notable however were the people whose net worth tumbled 
the biggest victim was sumner murray redstone owner of the 
entertainment giant viacom international inc whose fortune 
dropped from 288 billion to 2 billion 
others in the bigloser category included 
publishingentertainment baron rupert murdoch whose fortune fell 
by 600 million to 11 billion cable tv mogul ted turner whose 
worth fell 460 million to 13 billion and convicted drexel 
burnham lambert inc junkbond pioneer milken whose worth plunged 
by 570 million to 700 million largely because of 600 million in 
criminal penalties and losses from drexels collapse early this 
year 
among new names on the list the wealthiest was fred a lennon 
a highly secretive ohio industrialist who made his 600 million 
fortune selling valves and pipe fittings 
the magazine said it based the figures on intensive research 
into inheritances stock ownership and what it called conservative 
commonsense estimates 
forbes has sought to make the 400 ranking its trademark much 
like archrival fortune magazine has done with its annual ranking 
of the 500 biggest us industrial companies

the us dollar fell slightly against the japanese 
yen today while prices on the tokyo stock exchange erased early 
gains and fell 
the dollar closed at 12995 yen down 010 yen from monday for 
its lowest finish since march 15 1989 the dollar has fallen 720 
yen since oct 1 
the dollar fell sharply in early trading but bounced back up 
before midday following calls from the bank of japan to major 
banks said toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new japan 
securities co the central bank uses such calls to dissuade banks 
from too much buying or selling of dollars 
the dollar also was supported later by reports of final us 
senate approval for a 500 billion deficitreduction plan said 
yoshikazu kuroda a dealer with fuji bank 
kuroda said however the positive effect of the deficit plans 
passage could last only temporarily with prospects of the us 
economy getting so bad even the positive news is not influential 
enough to reverse the dollars downtrend he said 
expectations that the federal reserve board would lower interest 
rates to stimulate the us economy also are depressing the dollar 
dealers said 
on the stock market the 225issue nikkei index lost 13489 
points or 057 percent closing at 2349511 
the index was off about 550 points from the days high before 
recovering traders said investors were discouraged by the slowdown 
in the yens surge against the dollar and a subsequent slip in bond 
prices 
some traders contend the market is slowly recovering from a 
series of big losses accelerated by the aug 2 iraqi invasion of 
kuwait the index fell almost to 20000 points last week bringing 
its decline since the beginning of this year to about 50 percent 
in bond dealings the price of the benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds closed at 8348 points down from 
mondays 8354 their yield rose to 8035 percent from 8020 
japanese financial markets will be closed wednesday for a 
national holiday

the us dollar declined in moderate trading early 
today amid conflicting interpretations of the budgetary debate in 
the united states 
gold prices climbed slightly 
steve barrow a currency analyst at chemical bank in london 
said the us budget package cobbled together overnight would not 
be considered credible because it failed to specify cuts in some 
areas 
in frankfurt dealers said the budget package was interpreted as 
a sign that the us administration was not committed to deficit 
reduction 
barrow said the expectations of lower us interest rates will 
remain and probably push the dollar lower in the short term 
despite suggestions during tokyo trading that the bank of japan 
might be prepared to intervene to slow the dollars slide dealers 
said they doubted major central banks would be prepared to 
coordinate dollar purchases 
some speculate that the us government would like a lower 
dollar to help ease monetary pressure on the economy and reduce the 
countrys trade gap 
in tokyo the dollar fell 010 yen to a closing 12995 yen 
later in london it was quoted at the same rate 
in london the british pound was quoted at 19765 compared 
with 19745 late monday 
other dollar rates at midmorning in europe compared with late 
mondays rates included 15250 german marks down from 15355 
12765 swiss francs down from 12840 51062 french francs down 
from 51400 17200 dutch guilders down from 17315 114300 
italian lire down from 115075 and 11500 canadian dollars down 
from 11515 
londons major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of 
39545 per ounce at midmorning up from 39245 bid per ounce late 
monday in zurich the bid price was 39525 up from 39180 
earlier in hong kong gold rose 568 to close at a bid 
39437 
silver traded in london at a bid price of 469 a troy ounce up 
from mondays 467

congress has voted to raise the governments 
debt ceiling yet again this time to 3195000000000 but it 
wont be the last time 
the 72 billion increase is only enough to carry the government 
through oct 20 
by that date congress and president bush are expected to have 
agreed on a way to reduce the budget deficit then the 
administration will ask that the debt ceiling be raised once again 
to 3444 trillion or enough to last through next sept 30 
that will mark the 23rd increase of the reaganbush era 
the house approved the 3195trillion figure monday as part of 
a bill renewing federal spending authority while deficitreduction 
efforts continue the senate did the same later in the day as part 
of an emergency spending bill 
without the additional borrowing authority the treasury 
department could not sell the securities necessary to obtain cash 
to pay for goods and services already purchased on credit and the 
government could not pay its bills 
the debt limit was 935 billion when president reagan took 
office in january 1981 one of the first pieces of legislation he 
signed raised the ceiling by 50 billion seven months later the 
ceiling rose by an additional 80 billion 
by the time president bush took office in 1989 the figure had 
soared to 28 trillion

thousands of prospective buyers have 
signed up to bid for exxon corps massive store of surplus oil 
spill cleanup gear at a threeday auction beginning today 
on the block the first day are a seaplane 38 mobile homes near 
valdez brandnew fishing nets and assorted tools boats and 
motors among other items said rob mackay spokesman for ritchie 
bros auctioneers international 
the company put together more than 4800 lots of excess gear it 
bought from exxon last month for an undisclosed amount 
the amount of interest has been enormous its the largest 
number of people weve ever had at an auction sale said mackay 
the vancouver british columbia auction company conducts more than 
70 large auctions annually 
ritchie bros earlier had predicted that about 5000 people 
would register as potential bidders and that the auction would 
bring in more than 10 million 
seven thousand people had signed up by today and mackay said he 
couldnt estimate how much more money the auction might with the 
higher number of bidders 
the merchandise is part of 33000 tons of material moved to 
anchorge last fall for storage after the summer oilspill cleanup 
effort said exxon spokesman karsten rodvik 
the exxon valdez tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude oil into alaskas prince william sound in march 1989 in the 
nations biggest oil spill exxon crews worked to mop up shorelines 
that summer and this one and plan to return for a shoreline survey 
next spring 
rodvik said the company is keeping enough equipment to conduct 
whatever additional cleanup is necessary specialized oilspill 
equipment like skimmers and booms arent being sold 
the auction has drawn potential bidders from as far away as 
florida and hawaii said mackay more bidders can sign up over the 
next three days 
its everybody from the guy that lives next door to you to 
dealers to contractors to fishermen he said 
among the items for sale are 20000 rubber gloves 50 portable 
toilets hundreds of washers dryers refrigerators mattresses and 
desks 10 cars dozens of television sets thousands of sheets and 
blankets hundreds of hard hats dozens of bottles of animal 
shampoo scuba gear two shipping vans full of thongs and deck 
shoes eight fork lifts and a bathtub 
thousands of interested buyers have cruised past the three 
auction sites in recent days to inspect the merchandise the 
auction will move to a different site each day 
one anchorage auctioneer said alaska bidders probably will lose 
many lots to professional bidders who flew in from other states 
able to spend millions of dollars 
there will be too many bigbuck bidders said ron alleva of 
grubstake realty and auction co anyone from around here will 
just be wasting his time 
and dudley bennish president of alaska mining and diving supply 
inc said he is concerned the auction may depress the market for 
awhile he accused exxon of breaking a promise not to dump the 
goods on the market in alaska 
but bennish said he and other dealers profited when exxon bought 
the equipment in the first place

the dutch electronics giant 
philips nv said tuesday it will lay off 4900 people in its 
computer division as part of a major restructuring aimed at fending 
off its japanese competitors 
separately philips said it is developing a new cassette player 
capable of recording digital sound on ordinary tape which should 
give a boost its consumer electronics division 
the 4900 jobs being lost in philips information systems 
division are part of a restructuring program unveiled this summer 
by philips new chairman jan timmer in which up to 10000 layoffs 
ultimately are expected 
timmer told shareholders in july that philips might face a 1 
billion loss which media here blamed largely on disappointing 
computer sales 
the company said in a statement that compulsory redundancies 
will unavoidable mainly in europe as the computer division is 
cut to about two thirds its current size of 15000 people 
philips is concentrating on the highly competitive personal 
computer market and pulling out of manufacturing and selling more 
complex mainframe and microcomputer systems the announcement said 
under the reorganization many computer division tasks will be 
taken over by philips consumer electronics unit which was 
successfully pulled out of the red by timmer before he took over as 
company chairman last may 
that division also is responsible for developing philips latest 
product the digital compact cassette dcc recorder which will be 
available for 500 worldwide in 1992 according to company 
spokesman jan geel 
unlike the digital audio tape recorders introduced in the 
mid1980s by philips japanese competitors the dcc system wont 
need special tape to make highquality recordings from digital 
audio sources like the compact disk geel said 
sales of the current digital audio tape system have been slow 
because the recorders include a device that stops owners from 
copying compact disk recordings without paying royalties to the 
artists 
geel said the dcc recorders would also include some kind of 
protection to preserve the rights of the artist but it is not yet 
known what form it will take 
he said dcc recorders might be fitted with an electronic device 
to stop largescale bootlegging by allowing users to copy compact 
disks but not other tape recordings 
the polygram recording firm in london said it was trying to 
secure an appropriate levy on dcc sales to compensate for the 
loss of royalties 
geel refused to disclose development costs for the dcc project

zapata corp helped make a future president 
wealthy 
but the company founded by george bush now is struggling to stay 
afloat 
saddled by about 560 million in debt compounded by 
overexpansion zapata announced in june a realignment that includes 
restructuring some debt and shedding the oil drilling business that 
was its foundation 
the company will maintain its more profitable oil field service 
boats and continue in natural gas production and commercial fishing 
divisions that began after bush left the company 24 years ago 
the restructuring must be approved by debtholders and chairman 
r c lassiter has warned that rejection could spell bankruptcy 
the root of our problem is the fact that we built drilling 
rigs in the 70s and 80s with the assumption of bringing in 
50000 a day said company spokesman barney white 
in reality the rigs brought in only about 10000 to 15000 a 
day and debts mounted he said 
the modern zapata offshore co subsidiary had drilling 
operations in texas as well as california singapore indonesia 
abu dhabi the netherlands nova scotia newfoundland and england 
bush started zapata in odessa texas in 1953 five years after 
he moved to texas to take a job in the oil patch the company 
became public in 1955 when the bushes and their five children 
later moved to houston they took zapata with them 
bush sold his 6 percent stake in zapata for 11 million after 
he was elected to congress in 1966 but his ties to the company 
continued through the summer of 1989 when bush turned 65 and his 
pension annuity from the company was paid out white declined to 
reveal the full amount of the annuity 
george made a comfortable amount of money out of it said 
former founding partner and retired pennzoil corp chairman j hugh 
liedtke it was a substantial sum but hes not what in texas is 
called big rich 
a white house spokesman said bush would have no comment on the 
latest troubles at zapata 
stockholders are expected to vote on zapatas restructuring plan 
this month 
the planned rig fleet sale should be completed by oct 31 but 
if there is not sufficient bondholder acceptance of zapatas 
tender offer the company will have little alternative but to seek 
protection under the bankruptcy laws lassiter said last month in 
the companys latest quarterly report 
zapata announced sept 5 that it would sell an offshore drilling 
rig fleet for 298 million to arethusa offshore ltd a 
bermudabased consortium of european investors formed for the deal 
under the terms of the sale zapata will reinvest 175 million 
in arethusa and continue to manage the fleet 
of the remaining 77 million would go for commissions on the 
sale 536 million would pay off debts specific to the rig fleet 
160 million would be paid to the banks and about 142 million are 
in taxes and fees related to the restructuring about 45 million 
would be used as the companys working capital 
as part of the restructuring zapata also will offer to retire 
about 78 million in bond debt white said 
zapata lost 20 million or 63 cents per share in the three 
months ended june 30 on revenue of 391 million during the same 
period last year the company lost 261 million or 82 cents per 
share and had 517 million in revenue 
asked if the latest rise in oil prices caused by iraqs invasion 
of kuwait might help turn things around white said it would be 
a mistake to jump to the conclusion that the market is going to 
turn around 
during the boom of the early 1980s everyone bought a 
drilling rig to get rich and saturated the markets now they like 
us cant make the payments he said 
were getting out of drilling business permanently white 
said we cant count on iraq to turn it around in six months 
this will all go away and well still have too many rigs

parts to american computer manufacturers 
although terms of the settlement were not disclosed motorola 
executive james a norling said he was pleased 
our unwavering goals in this legal action were to protect 
motorolas intellectual property and to assure our customers an 
uninterrupted supply of motorolas leadership microprocessors 
said norling president and general manager of the companys 
semiconductor products sector 
motorola sued hitachi nearly two years ago in us district 
court in austin texas accusing the japanese company of using 
certain microprocessor designs patented by motorola 
hitachi countered by accusing motorola of patent infringement 
when the chicagoarea company developed its widely used 68030 chip 
a federal judge in texas twice ordered the companies to stop 
selling their chips in the united states and to try to work out a 
settlement the orders were stayed in both cases 
the lawsuits involved hitachis h8 and h16 microcontrollers 
and motorolas 68030 and 88000 microprocessors 
motorola said the companies will ask the courts to dismiss the 
lawsuits

the supreme court today agreed to decide wat 
deadlines investors face when trying to sue over alleged securities 
fraud 
the justices said they will use an oregon dispute to decide 
whether state or federal law should determine the relevant statute 
of limitations for such lawsuits 
the oregon case began when various investors purchased from 1979 
to 1981 units in limited partnerships for the buying and leasing of 
computer equipment and computer software 
each limited partnership was aimed at generated profits for the 
investors who were limited partners and to offer them attractive 
tax benefits the deals were put together by a west orange nj 
law firm lampf pleva lipkind prupis amp petigrow 
all the limited partnerships were economic failures but 
investors did not investigate the reasons for the poor performance 
until 1986 when the internal revenue service began disallowing 
their tax benefits 
the investors then sued the law firm charging federal 
securities fraud violations 
at issue is whether an absolute threeyear deadline imposed by 
the federal securities exchange act of 1934 should apply the new 
jersey law firm said it should but the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals ruled that the deadline should be determined by oregon 
because the suit was filed there 
under the federal deadline the clock would start ticking at the 
time of investment 
the appeals court said oregons twoyear deadline should apply 
from the time the investors were aware or should have been aware 
that fraud was a possibility 
the 9th circuit court in its ruling earlier this year told 
us district judge james a redden in portland to reconsider what 
date should be used for measuring the start of the statelaw time 
limit 
lawyers for the new jersey law firm then sought supreme court 
review arguing that the federal deadlne not a state law one 
should apply 
the case is lampf pleva vs gilbertson 90333

ual corps board of directors today rejected an 
employee buyout bid and said it will proceed with plans to place a 
large aircraft order it had postponed at the labor groups request 
the parent of united airlines also said it would seek to quickly 
reach new contracts with its pilots machinists and flight 
attendants unions which led the buyout effort 
the decision represented the fourth failed takeover bid in three 
years at ual 
ual made the announcement late this morning after a meeting at 
which the board said the employee group failed to arrange financing 
for a 201pershare 438 billion acquisition offer that the 
board had accepted in principle in april 
the board sad in a statement that it rejected a new employee 
offer that was at an uncertain but substantially lower value than 
the april 9 agreement was not accompanied by definitive financing 
arrangements and was subject to other significant contingencies 
ual stock was trading at 9350 a share on the new york stock 
exchange up 150 following the early afternoon announcement 
gerald greenwald chief executive officer of the united 
employees acquisition corp had said sunday that the employees 
failed to get bank financing for the 201ashare bid but had hoped 
to make up the shortfall with other features 
there was no official word on the specifics but some reports 
put the revised bid at 165 to 170 a share with about 150 of 
that in cash and the rest in securities 
the new york times quoting an unidentified source put it at 
about 160 a share or 35 billion in this version only about 
70 a share would be in cash the rest would mostly be in notes 
secured by aircraft 
the buyout group said the cash portion of its revised bid would 
come from loans from suppliers revenue from saleleaseback 
arrangements in which the company sells equipment such as 
airplanes and leases them back employee investments and cash on 
hand 
greenwald said monday he did not know what the group would do if 
the board rejected its restructured offer he was not immediately 
available today 
all three of the labor groups are working with expired 
contracts the pilots who have been trying to gain control of the 
company for 3 years had vowed to confront uals management with 
everything including a strike if the acquisition attempt failed 
the directors also could face a movement to oust them by angry 
stockholders led by coniston partners a new york investment group 
which owns 118 percent of ual shares 
the employee group asked the board in july to postpone the 
aircraft purchase while the future ownership of the corporation was 
in the air ual had said previously that it expected the order to 
be the largest ever placed for widebody jetliners

soviet citizens probably wont be interested in 
buying stocks while grocery stores are empty finance ministry 
officials cautioned tuesday during a wall street seminar on 
reviving a soviet stock exchange 
worse yet they may not even have the option the soviet central 
bank said there were no facilities in this shortageplagued country 
to print share certificates 
many people cant understand how we can sell securities when 
we cant sell them other products such as bread and cigarettes 
deputy finance minister vladimir rayevsky said in an interview 
our soviet people our public opinion doesnt know the essence 
of a stock exchange he said during the seminar organized by the 
new york stock exchange 
trading in shares has been illegal in the soviet union for many 
years the practice was prohibited after the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution and although it was revived briefly during the 1920s 
trading was banned again in 1928 by josef stalin 
officials from the new york stock exchange are trying to give 
wouldbe marketeers a boost with the threeday seminar a 
crashcourse on organizing running and regulating a stock market 
but rayevsky and government spokesman stanislav assekritov said 
a national public education campaign will be needed to convince 
soviets a stock exchange is needed in a market economy 
what we need to do is change the mindsets of the public 
said assekritov deputy chairman of a government economic reform 
committee 
first we shall have to explain to the public that a market of 
securities a stock exchange will make our shops more plentiful 
because the transfer of capital will enable us to change the 
structure of our economy 
assekritov said unless that happens even if we set up a stock 
exchange in moscow by a decree of the city council people would 
ask this question why start trading in securities if shelves are 
empty 
the soviet economy has been in shambles this year consumers 
endured shortages of cigarettes matches and even ice cream this 
summer and bread shelves were empty for the first time since the 
1960s a bleak winter looms ahead as much of a bumper potato crop 
rotted in the fields 
dmitri tulin managing director of the gosbank central banks 
new securities department said one of the biggest concerns in 
reviving a stock exchange is the lack of facilities for printing 
share certificates that could not be forged he said there was only 
one such plant in the country but its working at full capacity 
printing rubles and passports 
we either have to build a new plant facility for producing 
paper or just leap over this stage and develop a paperless market 
from the very beginning he said 
but few soviets would accept that either he said 
in central asia i could hardly imagine anyone buying 
something that they cant put under their mattress tulin said 
the myriad of economic rescue plans being considered by the 
soviet government calls for the creation of a stock market some as 
soon as the end of this year 
assekritov said the end of 1991 would be more realistic 
we cannot just decree a stock exchange into existence he 
told the seminar this is not a museum as some people think 
where exhibits are put on display 
nicholas rey managing director of the new yorkbased brokerage 
firm bear stearns amp co inc said the soviets need to privatize 
state industries gradually before a stock exchange can flourish 
the government now owns 80 percent to 90 percent of the property 
in this vast country and is only slowing moving away from the ban 
on private ownership one of the most sacred precepts of communism 
i would start very simply with privatizing the most 
profitable enterprises such as the oil industry said rey a 
director of the polishamerican committee advising warsaw on its 
privatization program

united auto workers union leaders today 
overwhelmingly recommended ratification of a new threeyear 
contract with ford motor co

agreement uaw president owen bieber said after the vote by the 
unions bargaining council 
union vice president ernie lofton in charge of the unions ford 
department said he expects ratification to be completed by oct 
21

which allows the automakers more flexibility but gives workers a 
greater degree of job security 
gm workers ratified the pact by a margin of 4to1 about 
300000 gm employees are covered by the uaw contract 
after the pact is ratified by ford workers uaw negotiations 
with chrysler corp will accelerate that bargaining is expected to 
be much more difficult than it was at ford or gm because of 
chryslers deteriorating financial shape

china is sending more than 300 government and 
business emissaries to the united states on a largescale shopping 
trip to smooth strained trade and political ties officials said 
tuesday 
leaders of the delegation which sets out friday for a 
threeweek visit said members will be looking to place orders for 
products ranging from hightech equipment to timber and grain 
this is not only a gesture public relations we are doing 
the actual thing sun zhenyu of the ministry of foreign economic 
relations and trade told a news conference sun is deputy director 
of the ministrys department for trade with the united states and 
oceania and will take part in the buying mission 
the delegation includes representatives from most of chinas 
major foreign trade companies and other leading state corporations 
sun said some purchase orders to be signed on the trip would 
have been made anyway but that the group is genuinely seeking to 
find new american sources for products to redress a longstanding 
trade imbalance 
the us commerce department says the united states imported 
1199 billion worth of chinese goods in 1989 and sold 581 
billion worth to china the figures include chinese products 
shipped through hong kong 
china which does not count the products that go through hong 
kong says it sold just 44 billion worth of goods to the united 
states and bought about 8 billion in return 
we are trying to sort it out with the us government and find 
out why there are different statistics sun said but he 
acknowledged chinas imports from the united states have 
dropped thats a fact and the chinese government attaches great 
importance to that we must do something to correct that state of 
affairs 
american products could be ordered through regular trade 
channels he said but sending the large delegation will 
demonstrate how eager we are and show our wish to restore 
relations in all aspects 
uschinese relations have been strained since june 1989 when 
chinas ruling communists ordered the army to attack prodemocracy 
demonstrators in beijing the united states condemned the attack 
and halted military sales to china blocked development loans by 
international agencies and stopped most highlevel exchanges 
some us legislators have proposed canceling chinas 
mostfavored nation trade status as a further sanction the status 
subjects chinese products to the lowest us tariffs 
wang rensheng a former deputy trade minister who will head the 
delegation said members will seek to meet with congressmen to 
press for continued mfn treamment proposals to cancel it this year 
appear to have lost support but a bill has been submitted in the 
house to link next years renewal to chinas human rights record 
us imports from china appear largely unaffected by the 
political tension they rose nearly 15 percent in the first eight 
months of the year over the same period last year chinese 
statistics show 
chinese imports from the united states dropped about 15 percent 
in the same period however due partly to a chinese currency 
devaluation and a domestic austerity program 
the buying trip coincides with a separate 34member chinese 
delegation that will be promoting chinese products in the united 
states and canada

the supreme court turned away a multibilliondollar dispute over 
natural gas costs but plans to decide what deadlines investors face 
when trying to sue over alleged securities fraud 
without comment the court on tuesday refused to reinstate a 
federal regulation to ease a burden on pipeline companies that 
signed contracts to buy gas in the 1970s and 80s at a specified 
price the pipelines were required to pay for the gas even if they 
couldnt sell it 
the socalled takeorpay agreements were signed when the price 
of gas was higher than it is today but natural gas supplies began 
to exceed demand by 1982 because of warm winters a recession and 
customers switching to alternate fuels as a result the pipeline 
companies were left with billions of dollars in costs for unwanted 
gas 
the federal energy regulatory commission adopted a plan in 1987 
allowing the pipelines to charge customers part of the cost but an 
appeals court threw out the plan in december saying the charges to 
pipeline customers amounted to a retroactive change in rates 
without advance warning 
the appeals court said current customers who didnt buy gas from 
a pipeline until after 1986 would not have to pay any part of the 
liability the court which reviewed the problem in a case 
involving tennessee gas pipeline co sent the case back to the 
commission for another solution 
gas customers in mississippi louisiana tennessee kentucky and 
ohio who could face higher gas rates joined the bush administration 
and tennessee pipeline in urging the supreme court to step in 
in a separate case the justices said they will use an oregon 
dispute to decide whether state or federal law should determine the 
relevant statute of limitations for securities fraud suits 
the oregon case began when investors purchased from 1979 to 1981 
limited partnerships put together by the west orange nj law 
firm lampf pleva lipkind prupis amp petigrow and designed to 
generate profits and tax benefits 
though each was an economic failure investors did not 
investigate the reasons for the poor performance until 1986 when 
the internal revenue service began disallowing their tax benefits 
the investors then sued the law firm charging federal securities 
fraud violations 
at issue is whether an absolute threeyear deadline imposed by 
the federal securities exchange act of 1934 should apply 
under the federal deadline the clock would start ticking at the 
time of investment but an appeals court said oregons twoyear 
deadline should apply from the time the investors were aware or 
should have been aware that fraud was a possibility 
the court also revived a 4 billion libel suit in which 
millionaire inventor arthur jones charged abcs 2020 program 
falsely portrayed him as a liar and hypocrite in a 1987 piece about 
the fate of 63 baby elephants he rescued from death in africa

tons of grain in this years harvest and plans to produce at least 
38 percent more next season to beat united nations sanctions on 
trade the government newspaper aljumhouriya said tuesday

expected to increase to 4783 million hectares about 118 million 
acres for next season the ministry said

agriculture ministries have exhorted farmers to increase 
cultivation of cereals in recent weeks

commercial health insurance companies spend 14 
times as much as the federal medicare program does on 
administration overhead and marketing a private group said 
tuesday 
and the private insurance sector spent 11 times as much per 
dollar of claims paid as the canadian national health care system 
according to a report by the group citizen action 
if the private health insurance industry were as efficient as 
medicare about 13 billion could be saved and used to provide 
insurance to 11 million uninsured people the groups study found 
competition in the insurance market is wasteful and 
expensive said robert brandon vice president of citizen action 
in health care a free market cannot work what we need is a 
singlepayer system where the government is the sole insurer 
the health insurance association of america said citizen 
actions study was misleading because it did not include blue cross 
and blue shield plans or plans sponsored by large selfinsured 
companies when these are factored in the 1988 administrative 
costs in the commercial sector drop to 13 cents for each dollar of 
benefits paid the association said in a statement 
the association also said that private insurers are spending an 
increasing amount of money to make sure doctors and hospitals 
bills are appropriate this effort saves billions of dollars 
annually the association said 
the association also said citizen action was misguided in its 
call for a governmentrun health insurance program noting the 
budget disagreement that shut down the federal government over the 
weekend the insurers said that most logical observers would 
not be inspired with confidence by the efficiency of governmentrun 
programs 
medicare helps pay doctors and hospital bills for the nations 
33 million elderly and disabled citizens medicaid is a 
federalstate program that provides medical services to the poor 
an estimated 37 million americans have no health insurance public 
or private 
citizen actions report showed that in 1988 commercial health 
insurance companies spent 335 cents on administration marketing 
commissions and other overhead expenses for every dollar in claims 
paid out 
by comparison medicares administrative costs were 23 cents 
per dollar in claims paid out in the canadian health care system 
administrative costs amounted to about 3 cents per dollar in claims 
paid the group said 
private insurance companies in their efforts to compete for 
more business spend money on things that are not necessary when 
coverage is provided by a single public program the group said 
one of these functions is the internal review required to deny 
claims 
incredibly the commercial insurance way of paying for health 
care leaves americans spending more to deny people coverage than it 
would cost to provide everyone with coverage the report said 
citizen action is a nonprofit consumers rights group with 
affiliates in 30 states

a familyowned supermarket chain is 
offering its customers a way to save without the ageold bother of 
coupon clipping 
in a word plastic 
big y foods inc began its express savings club on monday 
customers will receive a plastic membership card which will be 
scanned at the checkout counter for discounts and specials being 
offered that day 
we dont have to print as many coupons people dont have to 
bring them in and we dont have to count them said claire 
damour vice president of marketing for big y foods inc there 
is a lot of savings in the whole system because paperwork is 
diminished 
the cards which anyone can apply for and receive immediately at 
any big y store will have to be presented to the cashier before a 
shopper checks out when passed over the stores scanning 
equipment the bar code on the back of the card will identify the 
customer by number and automatically discount items the customer 
has selected on which big y and its vendors are offering savings 
people who bring in paper coupons will get double the value of 
the discount but by using the card shoppers can get a discount on 
up to five of the featured items instead of the regular one 
coupon one item rule 
costcutting is essential to the supermarket industry which 
operates on extremely tight margins net profit industry wide is 
less than a penny on every 1 according to the food marketing 
institute 
the cards give the store a better way to know their customers 
damour said 
once a customer is identified by number and you have data on 
them there is a lot ofmarketing potential she said 
we ultimately hope to be better smarter retailers this kind 
of electronic marketing is for the 90s she said 
they all fall under the term of frequent shopper program to 
track what an individual is purchasing and give them a reward for 
volume and loyalty it is something the industry is looking at 
carefully and will become more common

the dollar finished mostly lower on world 
markets tuesday but selloffs in other currencies prevented its 
decline from deepening 
gold prices tumbled after rising overseas on the new york 
commodity exchange gold bullion for current delivery fell 520 to 
settle at 38970 a troy ounce republic national bank in new york 
quoted a late bid for gold at 39075 down 425 an ounce from 
late monday 
the dollar fell sharply in asian dealings hitting new lows 
against the german mark and 18month lows against japanese yen 
before consolidating and recovering slightly when trading shifted 
to europe and the united states said marc chandler an analyst 
with the consulting firm idea 
traders cashed in on the weekend runup in the british pound and 
the yen and their profittaking prevented the dollar from 
relinquishing further ground 
given the extended moves in sterling and the yen there 
was more crossrelated trading today said ronald holzer chief 
dealer at harris trust and savings bank in chicago 
dealers expressed disappointment about lawmakers extended 
haggling over a deficitreduction package and complained about a 
seeming lack of commitment to resolve the budget problem president 
bush signed a temporary spending bill that keeps the government 
operating until oct 19 while congress tries to come up with a 
budget accord 
its still not a sure thing chandler said 
any accord raises the possibility that the federal reserve would 
ease interest rates higher interest rates make dollardenominated 
securities more attractive to investors thereby increasing their 
need to hold the us currency 
traders said the outlook for the dollar remains bearish given 
the problems with the budget as well as the economics weve seen 
with a recession scenario building here holzer said 
in tokyo the dollar fell 010 yen to a closing 12995 yen 
later in london it was quoted higher at 13030 yen in new york

winnebago industries inc on tuesday 
offered a years rebate on gasoline to buyers of recreational 
vehicles in an attempt to break out of a sale slump aggravated by 
soaring prices at the pump 
the forest city iowa motor home manufacturer is in the midst 
of a factory shutdown thats idled 1500 employees and has had 
four straight quarterly losses 
the promotional program is aimed at holding down fuel costs to 
under 1 a gallon for motor homes sold through the end of the year 
at participating dealers 
we are in effect rolling back gasoline prices to 999 cents 
per gallon the price of gasoline prior to the current mideast 
crisis said winnebagos sales director j ronald hanna 
our potential customers are concerned about rising gasoline 
prices due to the mideast turmoil and economic uncertainty hanna 
said by guaranteeing the price of gasoline we will help relieve 
those concerns 
securities analyst frank rolfes who follows winnebago for dain 
bosworth inc in minneapolis said the sales incentive is worth a 
try 
they cant just sit there and not sell anything rolfes 
said 
i know their sales have been very very weak he said the 
last time i talked to them things were pretty grim 
winnebago reported a net loss of 14 million for the nine months 
ended may 26 compared with net income of 66 million in the same 
period a year earlier fourthquarter and yearly results are 
expected sometime this month 
inventories of unsold winnebago and itasca models are so high 
that the winnebago factory was shut down oct 1 and is not 
scheduled to reopen until monday said spokeswoman shiela davis 
winnebago said it will issue a gasoline rebate coupon book when 
a customer purchases a new winnebago or itasca motor home the 
rebates will be based in part on mileage allowances set by 
winnebago of either 8 miles per gallon for large models and 15 
miles per gallon for smaller motor homes 
the price used in determining the rebate will be the average 
national price for selfservice regular unleaded gasoline published 
the first week of each month by the oil and gas journal magazine a 
petroleum industry trade publication 
the rebates will be good for 12 months or 12000 miles 
whichever comes first 
under the offer the motor home owner brings in his vehicle to a 
dealership every three months or 4000 miles to have the mileage 
verified and the rebate coupon notarized 
ms davis said the company has no estimate on how much the 
rebates will cost because there is no way of knowing what will 
happen to gas prices or how successful the incentives will be

with the focus of auto union talks 
shifting to chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca plans to argue 
that his company cant afford to be as generous with its workers as 
ford and gm 
but united auto workers union officials said tuesday his 
pleadings will fall on deaf ears 
anytime he iacocca makes as much as he has in the last five 
years its pretty hard for him to plead poverty said uaw vice 
president stan marshall said iacocca earned more than 64 million 
since 1985 in salary and bonuses stock options have added millions 
more 
but chrysler spokesman lee sechler said he iacocca is going 
to explain we have specific needs and we want to talk to the union 
about it 
in another deelopment canadian auto workers union officials 
said there has been progress in talks with general motors of 
canada ltd but said talks would likely go right down to the 
wire to meet a strike deadline set for midnight wednesday 
the uaw reached a tentative agreement with ford on sunday 
voting will be completed oct 21 gm workers ratified their 
agreement last month by a 41 margin 
the threeyear pacts with ford and general motors provide among 
other things income guarantees for workers laid off due to sales 
reductions penalties of up to 5 an hour for scheduling excessive 
overtime and a 3 percent raise in base wages during the first year 
coupled with 3 percent lumpsum payments in the second and third 
years of the contract 
perhaps most onerous to chrysler is whats absent from the 
pattern agreements with ford and gm changes in healthcare 
provisions 
from the first day of bargaining in midjuly chrysler officials 
have said they need relief from soaring medical care costs which 
reached about 684 million in 1989 
the company proposed a multiemployer health care program to cut 
costs but the uaws marshall said that suggestion is all but dead 
the company could be in much better shape if those chrysler 
executives would stop running around with all that money said 
marshall who heads the unions chrysler bargaining team 
uaw president owen bieber said he would not be at a scheduled 
meeting thursday with iacocca but im sure all the union people 
there will reply appropriately 
bieber said he would enter the chrysler talks expecting a 
settlement rather than a strike im not packing a sixgun when i 
get there he said 
at the end of august the latest figure available from the 
union the uaw had 770 million in its strike fund 
chrysler executives have said the gm and ford contracts which 
are nearly identical would be extremely expensive for chrysler 
that doesnt faze marshall or other members of the uaws chrysler 
negotiating team 
theres no doubt about it said tony de francesco a shop 
committeeman from uaw local 624 in syracuse ny and a member of 
the team they will follow pattern

pratt amp whitney and ge aircraft engines 
sometimes fierce competitors in the jet engine industry will join 
together to study the possibility of developing a new propulsion 
system for supersonic commercial aircraft the companies announced 
tuesday 
depending on the results of the initial study the companies 
will then decide how to divide responsibilities in developing the 
system 
the companies said the uncommon alliance is a matter of 
necessity if either is to participate in developing a futuristic 
system capable of propelling a civilian aircraft at speeds up to 3 
times the speed of sound 
we recognize neither company could realistically embark on 
this project alone arthur e wegner president of pratt amp 
whitney said in a statement 
by working together we will greatly increase the prospects of 
resolving the enormous technical issues while also evaluating 
methods to address the significant business issues associated with 
developing a supersonic transport engine wegner said 
the companies plan to form a joint strategy board with 
pratt and ge assigning senior officers to serve as program managers 
leading each companys activities the statement said 
ge aircraft based in evendale ohio is a division of the 
general electric co east hartfordbased pratt and whitney is a 
unit of united technologies corp 
tuesdays announcement comes less than six months after ge sued 
pratt amp whitney for 115 billion after a german aerospace company 
motoren und turbinen union withdrew from participation in ges 
development of a new turbofan engine to compete with pratts 
pw4000 
the suit was dropped after mtu agreed to continue consulting

to sell the state phone company entel following a snag that 
delayed the 55 billion deal last week 
the empresa nacional de telecomunicaciones is now due to be 
privatized nov 8 the privatization was to take place on monday

linked to the cost of living after privatization 
the us group of manufacturers hanover and bell atlantic 
corp dropped out last thursday when it could not meet the 
deadline to sign the contracts because it lacked 23 billion worth 
of debt papers 
the government is offering to sell 60 percent of entel for 214 
million cash 5 billion in debt papers and 380 million in 
deferred payments 
the government is selling entel because it loses money and

sen lloyd bentsen chairman of the senate 
finance committee will ask the panel to accept president bushs 
capital gains tax cut and increase income tax rates on wealthier 
americans aides said tuesday 
bentsen a texas democrat endorsed those tax changes as part of 
a deficitreduction plan the committee will begin working on 
wednesday 
disclosure of bentsens position on capital gains he had been 
opposing a cut came a few hours after bush said he would accept 
higher tax rates on the rich in exchange for the capital gains 
reduction 
rep dan rostenkowski dill who leads the house ways and 
means committee has not disclosed whether he will support the 
capital gains cut 
bentsens package follows in considerable detail the plan worked 
out over five months by the white house and congressional leaders 
but it eliminates some provisions that had been especially 
distasteful to many lawmakers 
his proposal which envisions tax increases of up to 150 
billion over five years would 
avoid increasing medicare premiums 
drop a proposed 2 centagallon tax on refined petroleum 
products including homeheating oil and gasoline 
cut from 10 cents to 9 cents the increase in the 9 cent 
gasoline tax 
drop 12 billion worth of tax incentives for small 
corporations wich had been attacked as a new system of tax 
shelters for the rich 
bentsens plan retains a 10 percent tax on part of the price of 
expensive cars furs jewelry and boats an 8 cent boost in the tax 
on cigarettes and similar increases on other tobaccco products 
doubling of the beer tax to 32 cents a sixpack raising of the 
wine tax from 3 cents per fifth to 25 cents for table wine for 
example and raising the liquor tax by 150 a gallon to 14 
bentsen also proposed to raise from 51300 to about 85000 the 
maximum annual wage to which the 145 percent medicare tax applies 
that tax is withheld from paychecks as part of the social security 
tax 
senate aides said preliminary estimates indicate bentsens 
proposal would be considerably fairer to low and middleincome 
taxpayers than the bipartisan plan written by congressional leaders 
and the white house 
complaints that the bipartisan plan was overly generous to 
upperincome people were a major factor in its defeat by the house 
last weekend 
in past years bentsen had endorsed taxing capital gains which 
are profits from the sale of investments at lower rates than 
apply to wages but he has opposed such a change recently because 
most of the benefit would go to those who make more than 100000 a 
year 
the fight between democrats and republicans over capital gains 
has been a major impediment to a deficitreduction plan this year 
bentsens plan would exclude from taxation 30 percent of the 
profit from the sale of an asset held three years or longer a 20 
percent exclusion would be given to twoyear property and a 10 
percent exclusion to oneyear property 
the plan also would eliminate a quirk in tax law that allows the 
600000 wealthiest americans to pay a maximum tax rate of 28 
percent even though people making slightly less pay a top rate of 
33 percent under the proposal those in the wealthiest category 
would pay the higher rate 
the combination of the capital gains exclusion and the 33 
percent rate would result in a top effective capital gains rate of 
231 percent 
in addition the plan would raise the individual alternative 
minimum tax rate now 21 percent to 25 percent this tax is paid 
by about 150000 people with incomes who by using legal 
deductions are able to reduce their tax liability to near zero 
they are required to give back some of their deductions and pay the 
minimum tax if it is higher than their regular income tax

james gamble of amherst mass greatgreat grandson of the 
companys cofounder and shareholder patricia close of seattle had 
cosponsored the resolution 
pampgs board of directors had recommended shareholders reject the 
proposal the maker of folgers coffee refuses to say how much 
salvadoran coffee it buys annually but says the amount is less 
than 2 percent pampg buys coffee from 30 countries

stock from 180 to 2 they approved a 50 cent dividend payable on 
nov 15 
pampg stock fell 125 a share to 7875 on the new york stock

americanbacked salvadoran government the board also said pampg 
should not be drawn into a dispute between washington and critics 
of the bush administrations foreign policy 
edwin l artzt pampgs chairman and chief executive read letters 
tuesday from president bushs chief of staff john sununu and 
roman catholic bishop romeo tovar astorga president of the 
catholic conference of bishops of el salvador supporting continued 
purchases of salvadoran coffee 
artzt said pampg agrees with astorgas contention that a boycott 
of salvadoran coffee would hurt peasant farmers and laborers on 
coffee plantations 
artzt called the resolution and its supporters misguided 
these people are obviously sincere in their thinking artzt 
said you can be sincere and misguided at the same time 
gamble and his supporters said purchases of salvadoran coffee 
provide money for wealthy plantationowning families who back el 
salvadors war and may condone murder and torture of political 
opponents 
gamble and the rev benjamin urmston a jesuit priest told the 
shareholders tuesday that pampgs purchases of salvadoran coffee 
could have indirectly helped arm the assassins who murdered six 
jesuit priests in el salvador last year 
by buying salvadoran coffee procter amp gamble helped buy the 
rifles to murder those priests gamble said 
gamble 27 owner of 24806 shares of pampg common stock said his 
resolution had the support of his brother robert gamble 30 and 
their father walter 
james gamble said he was disappointed the resolution failed to 
muster the minimum 3 percent of shares voted that would have 
allowed him to bring it up again for a vote at the next shareholder 
meeting 
we respect the results of the vote james gamble said 
shareholders also rejected on recommendation of the company a 
proposal that urged pampg to end remaining economic relationships 
with south africa in protest of that countrys apartheid system of 
racial separation 
pampg said it has had no operations or employees in south africa 
since selling a richardsonvicks subsidiary there in 1986 
but pampg said it collects royalty payments of 500000 annually 
for use of its trademarks in south africa artzt said that 
abandoning those trademarks would hurt shareholders without 
improving the plight of south africas black residents 
seven animalrights activists were arrested tuesday six outside 
the shareholders meeting and one for interrupting the meeting the 
activists and several shareholders urged pampg to end its use of 
animals in product safety testing 
artzt said pampg is reducing its use of animals in testing but 
will not end the practice until alternatives are available to 
ensure consumer safety for all pampg products 
procter amp gamble had 241 billion in worldwide sales during the

gold prices declined sharply tuesday on new 
yorks commodity exchange amid soaring energy prices and fears of a 
massive soviet gold selloff analysts said 
on other commodity markets grains and soybeans were mixed meat 
and livestock futures were slightly higher and energy futures rose 
sharply 
gold settled 480 to 530 lower with the contract for delivery 
in october at 38970 a troy ounce silver settled 77 cents to 85 
cents lower with october at 4593 an ounce 
precious metals futures prices which usually follow the energy 
futures market plummeted after traders began selling off on rumors 
that the cashstrapped soviet union is expected to sell off a good 
quantity of its gold supply to finance recent purchases of grains 
and other goods 
a large selloff would flood the market and cause a drop in 
prices 
all those russian purchases put a lot of pressure on the 
market said stephen platt an analyst with dean witter reynolds 
inc in chicago buying started to dry up then there was a lot 
of local selling and dealer selling 
prices also fell amid a perceived inability to keep up with 
energy futures prices platt said 
crude oil and gasoline futures rose sharply on the new york 
mercantile exchange reflecting fears on a report from iraqs 
saddam hussein that the country had developed a new missile capable 
of striking deep within saudi arabia where us troops are 
positioned 
light sweet crude settled 14 cents to 145 higher with november 
at 4040 a barrel heating oil was 130 cents to 319 cents higher 
with november at 10615 a gallon unleaded gasoline was 205 cents 
to 451 cents higher with november at 9826 cents a gallon 
grains and soybeans all were mixed at the close of a slow day on 
the chicago board of trade 
soybean futures prices remained in the same range following a 
sharp rally monday that was spurred by harvest delays in the 
rainsoaked midwest corn and wheat futures prices advanced

american airlines has sent layoff 
notices to about 40 employees as part of a plan to eliminate 1000 
jobs and reduce costs the company said tuesday 
the fort worthbased airline which employs more than 90400 
workers took the action because of rising jet fuel prices and a 
weakening us economy spokesman al becker said the first notices 
were sent to about 40 people systemwide 
the move is an effort to reduce costs becker said the 
costcutting plan isnt completed yet and wont be for several 
more weeks 
trans world airlines and usair have also announced layoffs 
recently 
becker said this was the first time in several years that 
american has been forced to eliminate jobs because of rising fuel 
prices 
officials had said this past summer that the company planned to 
reduce costs sharply and an unexpected rise in the price of jet 
fuel last winter contributed to a firstquarter loss of 193 
million 
an unexpected decline in domestic air travel helped reduce 
secondquarter profits to 1292 million 274 percent less than 
the comparable period in 1989 
jet fuel prices have soared again recently because of iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
american officials had planned to reduce costs by implementing a 
freeze in management and clerical ranks the company said it 
planned to eliminate about 1000 jobs primarily through attrition 
but did not rule out layoffs if necessary

bond prices plunged tuesday as oil prices 
climbed past 40 a barrel and investors grew increasingly 
pessimistic about interest rates and the ability of congress to 
pass a meaningful budget agreement 
there was also concern about an oversupply of government bonds 
with two auctions planned this week and the treasurys quarterly 
refunding sale coming up next month 
it would be difficult to conjure up a worse confluence of 
factors than those hitting the credit markets tuesday said ward 
mccarthy a managing director of stone amp mccarthy research 
associates inc 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond dropped 1 2532 points or 
about 1781 per 1000 in face amount its yield which rises when 
the bonds price falls soared to 896 percent from 881 percent 
late monday 
growing fears of war in the persian gulf unsettled the bond 
market and also sent oil prices rising the higher energy costs 
underscored worries about inflation which erodes the value of 
bonds 
the november contract for light sweet crude oil swept past 40 
on the new york mercantile exchange closing at 4040 a barrel up 
145 
a surge in inflation carries another threat for bonds it gives 
the federal reserve less room to ease its monetary policy and allow 
interest rates to drop 
bond traders have been waiting anxiously for the fed to relax 
credit but they think higher oil prices and more importantly the 
lack of a budget agreement in washington will prevent the fed from 
acting 
mccarthy said bond traders were filled with utter disgust with 
the budget process 
president bush signed emergency legislation tuesday that allows 
the government to operate while congress continues to haggle over 
an agreement that would cut the federal budget deficit by 500 
billion over five years 
the credit markets having seen a budget agreement collapse last 
week are losing faith in the lawmakers ability to reach a 
meaningful agreement 
what seems to motivate congress in the budget is 
selfpreservation and the desire to get reelected mccarthy 
said national interest plays a secondary if not tertiary role 
the credit markets were also concerned that with several bond 
sales planned there will be so many issues on the market that 
prices will drop to spark demand 
the government is selling 85 billion in sevenyear bonds this 
week along with 5 billion in 30year bonds to help fund the 
savings and loan bailout the treasury is also preparing for its 
quarterly refunding sale next month 
bond traders are also concerned that with the dollar at 
depressed levels foreign investors will have little interest in 
us securities at these auctions 
prices of shortterm treasury issues ranged from 316 point to 
1532 lower intermediate maturities fell between 1932 point and 1 
116 point and longterm issues lost between 1 1732 point and 1 
2532 point according to telerate inc a financial information 
service 
the shearson lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer skidded 842 to 114689 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 738 percent as the 
discount jumped 13 basis points to 716 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills advanced to 754 percent as the discount gained 11 
basis points to 718 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 759 
percent as the discount jumped 9 basis points to 710 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest banks charge one another on 
overnight loans was quoted at 8 116 percent up from 7 1516 
percent late friday 
the fed funds rate from monday was not available because of the 
columbus day holiday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds fell point to 88 732 the average yield 
to maturity rose to 782 percent from 777 percent late monday

the international monetary fund announced on 
tuesday that it is downgrading the dollar pound and french franc 
and upgrading the german mark and japanese yen in setting the value 
of its own currency unit 
the imf currency special drawing rights or sdr is set as a 
basket of the five currencies with each of them weighted by 
its importance in world trade 
currently 42 percent of the value is the value of the dollar 
19 percent he value of the mark 15 percent for the yen and 12 
percent each for the franc and the pound this proportion was set 
in 1986 
it is revised every five years beginning jan 1 the 
proportions will be 40 percent for the dollar 21 percent for the 
mark 17 percent for the yen and 11 percent each for the pound and 
the franc 
the sdr is not printed in notes or stamped as coin and is not 
used in private trade it exists only as a bookkeeping entry 
the fund issued sdrs to give member countries a reserve currency 
that they could use in addition to gold and dollars the object was 
to make the member countries less dependent on the united states 
which controls the number of dollars in the world and on the 
soviet union and south africa the major sources of gold some 
advocates of the sdr hoped that it would eventually replace gold 
and dollars in the worlds resevres thus making the fund into a 
worldwide central bank 
the fund now has 154 member countries 
sdrs are distributed in proportion to a countrys contribution 
to the fund that means that the united states and other major 
industrial countries get the biggest share governments of poorer 
countries have repeatedly asked for new issues to be made on the 
basis of need but the united states has turned the idea down

a major bond rating agency said tuesday it is 
reviewing the status of new york citys ability to repay debt 
following a tentative agreement to give teachers a 55 percent pay 
raise 
after reviewing its aminus rating of new york citys 13 
billion in outstanding general obligation bonds standard amp poors 
corp could decide to lower the rating 
im confident we are going to satisfy them that we are in 
control mayor david dinkins said at a city hall press 
conference we have a plan we are going to meet that gap 
the mayor has projected a 14 billion budget deficit for next 
year 
sampp said it was reevaluating the citys payroll burden in light 
of a weakening economy that leads to lower tax revenues 
state comptroller edward regan said sampps move appeared to be 
based on a perception of economic crisis rather than reality 
the city is not on the verge of an economic disaster regan 
said its a cyclical downturn with an erosion of revenue but 
that can be handled the problem is that this years budget was too 
large to begin with 
an arating from sampp means the agency believes the city has a 
strong ability to pay interest and principal on the bonds although 
that ability is more susceptible to economic downswings a plus or 
minus sign on a rating shows its relative standing within the 
catagory 
the next step lower is a bbbrating which signifies that 
adverse conditions make it more likely the city will have trouble 
paying interest and principal 
lower ratings make it more expensive to borrow money in the bond 
market since investors usually demand higher yields for the riskier 
debt 
city council president andrew stein said it was inconceivable 
that the administration could give teachers a 55 percent pay raise 
on monday and then announce on thursday that it was planning for 
15000 layoffs this is not fiscal leadership it is fiscal 
folly 
dinkins said the city has met past financial difficulties and 
that i can assure standard and poors taxpayers noteholders 
and the citizens of this city that my administration will continue 
this tradition of responding fully and quickly to the difficulties 
a deteriorating economy and rising costs pose for our budget
