north dakota south dakota and oklahoma 
were left out of rand mcnallys newly published world atlas and 
oklahoma gov henry bellmon is not the least amused 
bellmons spokesman sam armstrong issued a memo the governor 
planned to send to rand mcnally from 33 million citizens of the 
great state of oklahoma 
we are mystified bellmon says in the memo did you intend 
an insult or are you trying to say that oklahoma is so wellknown 
that travelers need no map to get here the latter seems more 
likely 
we do not need your incomplete atlas bellmon said you 
wont get our business 
rand mcnally officials said the three states were omitted from 
the new atlas regional maps and photographs because of space 
limitations 
it was an editorial decision said con erickson a public 
relations representative in rand mcnallys skokie ill office 
the 3495 rand mcnally photographic world atlas hits newstands 
and bookstores this month 
north dakotas tourism director said hes not especially 
troubled by the omission 
it sounds to me like this is an upscale book for the world 
traveler who frankly may or may not be interested in the great 
plains region tourism director james fuglie said thursday 
its a coffee table book its not like we missed the road 
atlas 
the atlas which features brilliantly colored photographs of 
various regions of the world breaks the united states down into 
seven regions northeast great lakes southeast mississippi 
valley southern rocky mountains northwest and california and 
nevada 
photos from those seven regions are included and accompanying 
maps show at least a portion of 47 states 
bonnie ryan a rand mcnally public relations representative 
said the omission was not intended as an affront to the three 
states 
they did include several regions of the united states and 
their portfolios just kind of touching upon various places she 
said now that this has come up they realize this was not a good 
idea and they really should include the entire us 
in any case i have been told that when they go back to print 
next year theyre planning changes which include adding more maps 
to the us ryan said 
fuglie said rand mcnallys concern is selling books and it is 
natural that the company would want to concentrate on areas of the 
united states that are particularly attractive to world travelers 
such as the east and west coasts and the south 
but he added if this was a book designed to reach the 
markets that we seek tourists from i would be very concerned

one university of mississippi student was 
expelled and four others suspended friday for their involvement in 
a fraternity prank that turned into an embarrassing racial incident 
for the school 
we regret that this action had to be taken but it should be 
clear that the university of mississippi can not tolerate this kind 
of behavior said ole miss chancellor gerald turner who accepted 
the recommendation of a disciplinary committee that had held 
hearings for each of the students 
on sept 18 a beta theta pi member and a pledge were stripped 
blindfolded and driven from ole miss to rust college a small 
private mostly black school about 25 miles to the north in holly 
springs 
rust security officers picked up the ole miss students whose 
hands and feet had been bound with duct tape and their naked bodies 
painted with kkk and we hate niggers the students were all 
white 
those involved were not identified nor did the university 
specify their roles in the incident 
turner expelled one fraternity member suspended four and placed 
nine others on probation charges aganst one student were dropped 
last wednesday the chancellor banned beta theta pi from the 
school for three years and ordered the fraternity to close its 
house on fraternity row by oct 29 
beta theta pi members have said the incident was a traditional 
fraternity prank that got out of hand fraternity members said 
pledges usually kidnapped an active member and left him 
stranded in a remote area but never had the prank been taken so 
far 
turner said last week that the incident had opened an old wound 
at ole miss the scene of violence in 1962 when james meredith 
enrolled as the first black student 
we are committed to developing an environment on campus that 
is supportive of the goals and aspirations of all members of the 
university community the chancellor said friday we must now 
reinvigorate our efforts in this direction

a nursing home fire blamed on careless 
smoking filled the fourstory building with thick smoke that killed 
nine elderly residents and sent nearly 100 to hospitals officials 
said friday 
the fire gutted the secondfloor room where it began but did 
little damage to the rest of the brick building the home does not 
have a sprinkler system none was required when it was built in 
1969 
even though we lost nine people the potential was there to 
lose significantly more than that said fire chief thomas e 
gardner 
the thursday night blaze at the fourstory hillhaven 
rehabilitation and convalescent center began when a resident major 
leary 78 accidentally tossed a match on his bed while smoking 
against regulations in his second floorroom said capt herbert 
redfield chief of fire investigations 
leary died in the blaze but his roommate roy miller escaped 
without serious injury said fire chief thomas e gardner 
residents of the 172bed nursing home some in bedclothes and 
some naked were helped down halls and down ladders as firefighters 
tackled the fire the blaze broke out at 1020 pm as residents 
were going to bed 
gardner said many residents stayed in their rooms with the doors 
closed while firefighters used a pressurized ventilation system 
called a smoke blaster to clear smoke from the building 
resident katie gwaltney 88 said she was told to stay in her 
fourthfloor room after she heard a fire alarm 
they came and told us that everything was ok she said from 
a wheelchair outside the home i couldnt get out i just lay so 
still 
ninetyeight of the nursing homes 163 residents were taken to 
hospitals for treatment of smoke inhalation said don haupt 
administrator of the citys paramedial rescue service 
seven remained hospitalized friday six in critical condition 
said rhonda s hoover a spokeswoman for sentara norfolk general 
hospital 
the fire chief said the fire would have been less severe if the 
20yearold building had a sprinkler system if it were 
sprinkled then probably some of them would not have died he 
said 
state codes in 1969 did not require sprinklers in nursing homes 
howard h summers jr the states chief fire marshal said any 
multistory nursing home constructed today would have to include a 
sprinkler system but a singlestory building could be built without 
one if it included fireresistant construction materials 
gardner said he would urge state lawmakers to require that 
buildings such as the nursing homes be retrofitted with sprinklers 
hillhaven will consider installing sprinklers but they are 
difficult to place in existing buildings said jeffrey m mckain a 
regional vice president for the hillhaven corp a tacoma 
washbased chain that owns the home 
mckain said smoking is prohibited in bedrooms the home has 
smoke and heat detectors and fire resistant doors and it appeared 
most of those systems all functioned as they should he said 
one of the injured residents elijah williams 85 said he heard 
no fire alarm in his secondfloor room but knew something was wrong 
when he heard noise on the first floor 
i went to the window and i saw that smoke he said 
williams said he was rescued by a firefighter who brought him 
down a ladder and left him outside the buiding 
i didnt know what to do williams said from sentara norfolk 
general hospital i didnt have nothing on nothing but my 
nightclothes 
there were about 200 people in the building when the fire broke 
out mckain said he said damage was so minimal on the third and 
fourth floors that residents might return there in a few days he 
had no damage estimate 
at least two residents went home with their families and the 
others were placed in hospitals and nursing homes mckain said 
haupt said 141 people were transported to hospitals or nursing 
homes 
the nursing home passed two inspections this years said charles 
ford a virginia department of health spokesman in february the 
fire marshals office conducted an inspection for the health 
department as a followup to an inspection last nov 18 that found 
three minor violations of fire safety regulations ford said all 
three problems had been corrected by the time of the february 
recheck he said

armed only with a cucumber which he pretended was 
a shotgun a 36yearold man stole 19868 in 16 holdups over two 
months to finance a drug habit a prosecutor said 
pointing the cucumber wrapped in a plastic bag at terrified 
cashiers and screaming give me the money or ill blow your head 
off the man raided 15 financial institutions and a post office 
prosecutor michael warren told londons old bailey central criminal 
court 
ernest coveley pleaded guilty to 10 counts of robbery and six 
counts of attempted robbery 
he had initially faced 16 charges of using fake weapons in the 
raids but his plea of innocent to these was accepted by the court 
on grounds that cucumbers cannot be classed as imitation firearms 
judge edwin jowitt postponed sentencing until he reviews social 
and psychiatric reports on coveley 
coveleys attorney peter feinberg told the judge that a 
cucumber is not the choice of a man who is perhaps more 
professionally geared for robbery 
security cameras filmed the man as he held up a savings and loan 
office in east london warren said police later arrested him at 
his apartment 
warren said coveley undertook the raids to finance his addiction 
to cocaine and heroin he said coveley used a fresh cucumber for 
each raid

kansas citys two jointly owned daily 
newspapers will merge into one morning edition newspaper 
executives announced thursday 
employees were told thursday of changes planned for the kansas 
city star published afternoons monday through friday and sunday 
mornings and the kansas city times published mornings monday 
through saturday 
the new paper will be called the kansas city star the date of 
the merger has not been decided 
officials had announced recently that they were studying a 
possible merger mcguff who discussed the plans at a news 
conference with 
publisher james h hale said he expects the merger to occur in 
the first half of next year or sooner 
the kansas city star co which publishes both newspapers is 
owned by capital citiesabc inc which bought it from company 
employees in 1977 hale said the merger decision was made locally 
on wednesday 
he said no layoffs are planned 
hale said declining circulation of the star was a factor in the 
decision the star started in 1880 by william rockhill nelson and 
samuel e morss purchased the 33yearold times in 1901 and ran it 
as the stars morning edition 
when employees bought the newspapers from the nelson estate in 
1926 the stars circulation was 392000 the times 249000 by 
1965 the morning paper had moved ahead and the stars circulation 
like many other afternoon papers continued to erode in september 
unaudited circulation of the times was 270719 and the weekday 
stars was 165866 the sunday circulation last month was 416673 
the decision to drop afternoon publication follows a trend among 
metropolitan newspapers around the country on monday officials of 
the news and observor publishing co in north carolina announced 
that the raleigh times an afternoon newspaper would cease 
publication nov 30 the company will continue publishing the news 
and observer a morning paper 
editor joe mcguff said the merger is a response to a marketplace 
where people have less leisure time and more to do 
mcguff said he was saddened that some employees will face 
changes from day to night shifts and that some longtime and loyal 
readers will no longer have their afternoon papers 
but once you get past those two elements then i feel very 
excited about what we are going to do in the future he said i 
think all of us look forward once we get through this period of 
transition to an exciting prospect of putting out a bigger better 
and more complete newspaper 
he and hale said the change will enable the company to expand 
news coverage and create new beats for reporters

some chant some meditate some 
dance some sit in the lotus position and hum 
every year hundreds of devotees of the occult trek to giza 
plateau near cairo to absorb mystical vibes said to be trapped 
inside the pyramids of the pharaohs cheops chephren and mycerinus 
pyramid power is said to cure a host of ills give glimpses into 
the future provide a better nights sleep even halt aging all 
for the price of admission three egyptian pounds 120 
until now 
under new rules pyramid groupies are going to have to pay more 
a lot more 
zahi hawass giza plateaus director general said groups of up 
to 15 now are allowed to meditate or seek extrasensory powers 
in the pyramids for 1000 egyptian pounds 400 and only outside 
normal tourist hours each extra participant pays 50 pounds 20 
hawass said seven to eight groups ask permission each month to 
conduct seances inside the pyramids most want either to spend the 
night inside or to enter at the first rays of dawn 
in the us and elsewhere you have a lot of people with 
problems and these people are seeking solutions they look to the 
supernatural and they think of the pyramids hawass said 
but we cant let these groups interfere with tourists wanting 
to look at the pyramids from a historical or architectural 
standpoint 
hawass said the most active pyramidvisiting mystical groups in 
the united states are several from santa barbara calif and from 
the edgar cayce foundation of virginia beach va named after the 
american psychic who died in 1945 cayce taught that the secrets of 
atlantis and knowledge of the future are buried under the right 
front paw of the sphinx at the foot of giza plateau 
in addition to americanstheme cruises are organized in europe 
and growing numbers of japanese tours come to giza especially to 
tap pyramid power hawass said 
this pyramid power stuff is really big he said people 
want to believe in magic and big structures give an air of magic 
im sure if i called myself the pyramid prophet i could have a 
following larger than the most famous indian guru 
built about 4600 years ago the pyramids remain enigmas to 
scientists as well as to seekers of the unknown 
the first person to enter the great pyramid of cheops in 
postpharaonic times was the caliph of baghdad abdullah almamun 
in 820 ad he forced his way in by heating rocks then breaking 
them by pouring on vinegar 
as generations of scientists and tourists eccentrics and 
treasure hunters followed him pyramid mystique grew over the ages 
perhaps the most famous personality to enter in search of the 
occult was napoleon bonaparte who spent the night of aug 12 
1799 inside cheops pyramid and emerged ashen and shaken 
he went to his grave in 1821 without telling what he experienced 
no whats the use napoleon was said to have told a friend 
you wouldnt believe me anyway 
hawass said many people especially in the united states have 
ideas and theories about the giza pyramids particularly cheops 
great pyramid 
they read that cheops is made of 23 million blocks each one 
weighing 2 tons to 15 tons each side at an angle of 51 degrees 
50 minutes and 35 seconds he said 
they think nobody on earth could have built this that the 
pyramids were built by people from outer space or survivors from 
the lost continent of atlantis 
they never look at whats attached to the pyramids the 
structures the organization necessary to build them the cult of 
the king 
he said more than 200 books about pyramid power have been 
published in the united states but fewer than half a dozen 
contain any science of value 
hawass who has a doctorate in egyptology from the university of 
pennsylvania and has lectured throughout north america about the 
pyramids said hed never heard of pyramid power until he went 
there in 1977 
i was speaking to an audience in hartford conn and as i 
began to talk everyone in the front row held a pyramid above his 
head i asked what are you doing and they explained about 
power trapped inside the shape of a pyramid 
ok i try to be openminded when i returned i tried some 
experiments 
the first was to test the theory that pyramids can preserve 
bodies 
i bought some meat and put part of it in my office part 
inside cheops the meat inside my office lasted longer than inside 
the pyramid that was one myth down 
if the ancient egyptians knew that flesh could be preserved by 
placing a corpse under a pyramid then why did they invent 
mummification

free speech including the right to wear 
offensive tshirts has returned to the campus of tufts university 
after president jean mayer decided a ban on verbal attacks wouldnt 
wash in court 
i have decided we are better off erring in the tradition of 
free speech tufts president jean mayer said thursday in an 
interview we decided we would decide each case on its merits 
student body president billy jacobson 20 of roslyn ny said 
he was sorry to see the abolition of a policy supported by most of 
the 7000 students at the private school about six miles north of 
boston 
it was wellintended jacobson said the university has a 
responsibility to protect students it cant insulate students but 
this is their home and students shouldnt have to worry about going 
into their dorms and their dining halls and seeing something 
offensive to them 
the policy published in the student handbook barred verbal 
attacks whether spoken or written against an individuals race 
ethnic group religion or sexual orientation 
the policy was prompted by an outcry last spring when an 
enterprising student marketed a tshirt stating 15 reasons why 
beer is better than women at tufts all 15 reasons disparaged 
women and one printable reason was hangovers go away 
the tshirt dealer was placed on probation and ordered to do 50 
hours of community service but mayer suspended that sentence when 
lawyers advised him it was unconstitutional 
the student life committee a panel comprising faculty and 
students stepped into the breach and imposed the free speech 
restriction last june 
when it made its way into this years student handbook and 
protests were raised mayer decided the policy had to go he 
announced it to students wednesday through the campus media 
mayer said he abolished the restrictive policy in part because 
legal opinions vary widely on the matter 
some experts say the first amendment only means to bar the 
government from restricting speech and doesnt apply to private 
universities mayer said others say it outlaws muzzling anyone who 
says or writes anything short of inciting a riot 
additionally a court ruling found a similar policy at the 
university of michigan at ann arbor was unconstitutional and vague 
mayer said 
bruce reitman tufts associate dean of students said the issue 
of resurgent bigotry on campuses around the country comes up 
whenever administrators gather but he couldnt offer a theory why 
campuses are more reactionary than they were in the 60s 
theres a new right wing reitman said we have had our share 
of it similar to other campuses around the country theres more 
tension about these issues than there used to be

a churchaffiliated university that 
requires students to attend chapel daily says it doesnt want its 
mtv because some students were watching nothing but the music video 
channel 
a minority of students were monopolizing it david england 
spokesman for david lipscomb university said thursday they were 
turning it up and keeping others from using the tv as intended 
this was eliminating the other students right of choice 
they were playing it so loudly that other students and 
professors couldnt carry on conversations 
complaints about the content of some mtv videos also led the 
school to block the cable channel from sets in dormitory lounges 
and the student center last month england said 
there is a morality issue and we wont back off what we 
perceive to be immoral kinds of things he said we have a lot 
of students who dont like what they see on it weve had far more 
complaints about it being on than it being off 
the school has an enrollment of 2500 and is affiliated with the 
churches of christ a nondenominational group that preaches basic 
bible teachings 
barry kluger mtv vice president for corporate communications 
said by telephone from new york city that he regretted the decision 
we feel the programming after going through our stringent 
standards is appropriate for tv viewers he said

a federal grand jury thursday indicted the 
sheriff of georgias largest county on 27 counts of extortion 
involving payments allegedly received from the company providing 
food services to the county jail 
us attorney robert l barr said the indictment charged fulton 
county sheriff richard lankford with taking more than 20 payments 
totaling more than 20000 from lampg catering services between the 
fall of 1985 and august 1988 
it also charged lankford with attempting to extort additional 
payments of 2000 and 5000 from lampg catering as recently as may 
of this year he said 
the indictment said the payments were made by lampgs managing 
owner jack lecroy at various locations including the fulton 
county sheriffs office most of the payments allegedly occurred at 
area restaurants 
barr said the payments were induced by exploiting the 
corporations fear of losing its valuable contract and by 
exploiting lankfords official position 
the grand jury also charged lankford who has been sheriff since 
1985 with filing false federal income tax returns for 1984 through 
1987 by omitting the alleged payments 
lankfords said he was at crawford long hospital being treated 
for kidney stones 
barr said lankford if convicted could be sentenced to 20 years 
in prison and fined 250000 on each extortion count the income 
tax charges could carry penalties of three years in prison and 
another 250000 fine 
the investigation leading up to the indictments was conducted by 
the fbi and the internal revenue service barr said 
lankford was charged under the hobbs act a federal statute that 
prohibits elected officials from using their offices for personal 
gain

huge red banners proclaiming the triumphs of four 
decades of socialism flap in the breeze outside the austere 
communist party headquarters in east berlin 
but as east germany today begins an extravagant twoday 
celebration of its 40th anniversary it is in turmoil 
a generation reared on socialist verities is deserting the 
country by the tens of thousands saying their homeland is 
unbearable and dissidents have dug in for a long struggle for 
democratic reforms in one of eastern europes most tightly 
controlled societies 
the desperation of many east germans was underlined this week in 
dresden where thousands of people shouting we want out swarmed 
the train station hoping to jump on freedom trains rolling to the 
west they were refuffed by police and some of the wouldbe 
refugees were bloodied in the riot 
east germanys aging leaders have rejected the need for 
democratic and economic reforms and while the economy remains the 
envy of their east bloc neighbors frustration is boiling over 
because virtually every facet of life is controlled from above 
i had to join the communist youth league and other 
organizations or i never would have been allowed to study to get a 
degree or get a good job said a 30yearold chemist 
were treated like children and patronized by petty officials 
who do everything but tell us when to go to the bathroom 
the mass flight west is the no 1 topic for those left behind 
the place is falling apart and for good reason said a 
39yearold truck driver from east berlin 
for years they told us to work hard that things would get 
better but it was a terrible lie after awhile you ask yourself 
what this is all for because its getting worse not better 
many are outraged at the way east germanys state media have 
portrayed daily life in the country and the resulting flight of 
refugees west 
the gap between reality and what is officially said has grown 
too great said a 25yearold east berlin engineering student 
it used to be just a joke now its an outrage that people are 
finding more and more difficult to tolerate 
he called the 40th anniversary celebrations an empty farce 
the exodus of thousands of east germans over hungarys 
newlyopen border and the desperate flight of thousands more to 
west germanys embassies in czechoslovakia and poland has deeply 
embarrassed the hardline government 
those who have fled say they can no longer endure the nations 
tough policy on travel to the west its intolerance toward dissent 
and pluralism and an economy that is still fraught with shortages 
and distribution problems 
many of their compatriots left behind agreed in conversations 
thursday in east berlin they declined to be identified because 
they feared reprisals 
although east germans enjoy the highest standard of living in 
the warsaw pact there are signs that the economy is slowing down 
east germans still wait for up to 15 years for a new car and 10 
years for a new apartment 
human rights activists and environmental groups are regularly 
harassed and their members detained the government recently 
rejected a petition by an opposition group to legally meet on the 
grounds that it harbored antistate ideas 
most of east germanys prominent authors can only publish in 
west germany 
life is tougher outside the capital east berlin where 
communist authorities have poured millions to help it compete with 
the glitter of capitalist west berlin 
residents in dresden and leipzig and other provincial cities 
trudge through dreary neighborhoods where once elegant 
turnofthecentury buildings have crumbled almost beyond repair 
while rents and public transport are cheap a tram ride still 
costs about the same as it did 40 years ago the government 
subsidies needed to offset the revenue mean there is less money for 
renovation 
for most east germans their brutal isolation from the rest of 
the world wounds and frustrates them the most 
east germany built the berlin wall in 1961 to halt the flow of 
skilled workers trekking west in record numbers 
travel to the west is still strictly limited and the recent 
refugee exodus from czechoslovakia hungary and poland has brought 
unprecedented new travel restrictions to these soviet bloc allies 
theyre drawing the noose tighter and tighter said a 
38yearold secretary who works in an east berlin government office 
people are already furious about whats going on here 
somethings got to change soon or its going to explode

pope john paul ii embarks on a politically sensitive 
10day asian pilgrimage amid calls he speak out on human rights 
during stops in south korea and indonesia 
john paul is scheduled to begin the 44th foreign trip of his 
11year papacy later today with a flight to the south korean 
capital of seoul where he will address a religious meeting 
he then goes on to overwhelmingly moslem indonesia and a stop in 
east timor that has provoked protests from portugal the islands 
former colonial ruler indonesia invaded east timor in 1975 and 
annexed the heavily catholic island the following year 
john paul will also make a twoday stop in the indian ocean 
island nation of mauritius before returning to rome oct 16 
the popes route to asia carries political significance the 
italian airline alitalia received permission to fly the leader of 
the worlds 850 million roman catholics over hungary and the soviet 
union a sign of vastly improved vaticansoviet relations during 
the past year 
earlier china had barred a papal overflight leading alitalia 
to seek a different route china broke relations with the vatican 
in 1957 
before departing asia watch an independent human rights 
monitoring organization urged john paul to speak out on human 
rights issues during the trip 
we believe that because of your special role and the worldwide 
attention that your visit will attract in south korea and 
indonesia your strong expression of concern on human rights would 
have an immeasurable impact in furthering respect for human rights 
in those countries the group said in a letter to the pope it 
released to the news media 
south korean police and intelligence agencies were placed on 
alert for the popes weekend visit his second trip to the country 
following a tour in 1984 national police headquarters in seoul 
said a special watch was being maintained for members of the gray 
wolves identified as an ultrarightist turkish underground group 
the pope was coming to address the closing of the 44th 
international eucharistic congress which has included discussions 
about an eventual reunification of north and south korea 
the seoul government is extremely wary about efforts to reunite 
the two koreas which are technically at war since no peace treaty 
was signed at the end of the korean war in 1953 on thursday a 
dissident presbyterian minister who made a secret trip to north 
korea for reunification talks was sentenced to 10 years in prison 
for aiding an enemy power 
after seoul the pope will spend five days touring indonesia 
the worlds largest moslem country while the scope of the visit is 
to meet with the some of the 5 million catholics among indonesias 
175 million people john paul is expected to stress the need for 
good relations between moslems and christians 
the indonesian stop however has been clouded by a fury over 
east timor 
earlier this week portuguese president mario soares called 
indonesia dictatorial and accused the government of president 
suharto of persecuting east timors catholic population 
i hope that his holiness will carry the message hes always 
carrying in defense of the oppressed and the victims of 
persecution soares said 
the vatican has not recognized the territorys annexation

former hud secretary samuel pierce in a move 
that appears to contradict his sworn congressional testimony urged 
an aide to arrange funding for a new york project backed by another 
federal official agency records show 
pierces actions detailed in department of housing and urban 
development files released thursday suggest that at least on this 
occasion pierce took a more active role than he has acknowledged 
in helping those who sought his aid 
in a handwritten instruction to top aide deborah gore dean 
pierce asked her to check into this and try to get it through 
the documents also show that thendefense secretary caspar 
weinberger wrote pierce to back a development seeking hud 
financing on another occasion records show that carla hills 
herself a former hud secretary and now the bush administrations 
top trade official got pierce to overrule deputies in favor of her 
clients 
hud released more than 20000 pages from the files of dean also 
a key figure in investigations of fraud mismanagement and 
influencepeddling at the agency during the reagan administration 
pierce dean and her predecessor as his top aide lance wilson 
all have invoked their fifth amendment rights and refused to 
testify before a house subcommittee investigating the agency 
the records released under the freedom of information act 
provide fresh evidence of the considerable power dean wielded at 
hud and of the persistent lobbying she faced from developers 
consultants members of congress and local elected officials 
the documents concerning the new york project appear to 
contradict pierces may testimony in which he said he often was 
lobbied by friends and political associates but never assisted them 
beyond asking staffers to give the projects careful 
consideration 
the new york project was mentioned in a 1985 handwritten note to 
pierce from the commerce departments assistant secretary for 
productivity technology and innovation urging hud to back a 
proposed project in manhattan near columbia university 
the note to pierce was signed bruce on stationery of the 
assistant secretary of commerce d bruce merrifield who held that 
position at the time could not be reached in calls to his home or 
the company where he is a consultant 
the 99unit seniorcitizen housing project was granted 12 
million in rental subsidies according to francine kellman 
spokeswoman for the hud new york regional office 
pierces attorney paul l perito said he had not seen the 
letter to pierce and was not familiar with the project but he said 
there was nothing incriminatory in that situation and that 
pierce has never asked anyone to deviate from responsible 
professional government standards 
on another occasion documents showed that after a private 
research company wrote pierce to complain that several of its bids 
for hud work had been rejected the secretary wrote to dean 
lets try to help this fellow i think he and his company have 
been unfairly treated 
it could not be immediately determined whether that firm later 
got hud work 
weinbergers name surfaced on two september 1983 notes by pierce 
aides discussing a project cap had recommended to pierce one 
aide noted the project was denied funding through normal channels 
but will be a good candidate for the secretarys discretionary 
fund it could not be immediately determined whether the project 
was ultimately given hud money 
mrs hills appealed to pierce in 1985 after a california client 
trying to sell a hudmortgaged development was told it would have 
to pay 13 million into reserve accounts before the deal could be 
approved mrs hills asked pierce to reduce the amount to 855000 
and after dean endorsed the idea approved the reduction 
some of the documents in deans files show 
she once rewrote a draft of a reagan speech the white house had 
prepared for the presidents appearance with pierce at an 
elementary school please excuse our crassness she said in a 
note to the white house accompanying her revised version 
in a handwritten note to pierce ms dean said the departments 
office of general counsel can find no document that says you have 
ever delegated authority over mod rehab to anyone 
the section 8 moderate rehabilitation program was found by the 
departments inspector general to have been to be riddled with 
political influence pierce has said he delegated the power to 
award the lucrative subsidies to a threemember committee that 
included dean 
dean was the guest at numerous receptions held by people and 
organizations that dealt with hud and was guest of honor at a 
february 1985 gathering hosted by a hasidic group called the 
opportunity development association three weeks later the group 
was awarded 150 federally subsidized housing units in brooklyn

the agriculture department says spending on 
soil and water conservation is at a record level because of 1985 
legislation that established a longterm retirement program for 
fragile cropland 
under the massive conservation reserve program or crp a goal 
of up to 45 million acres of highly erodible cropland could be 
taken from production by the end of next year 
by midyear more than 30 million acres had been contracted and 
more are on the way 
according to analysts in the departments economic research 
service total spending by usda and state agencies for conservation 
this year could exceed 32 billion up from 25 billion in 1988 
and 12 billion in 1987 
estimates show that total usda spending this year on soil and 
water conservation could reach 28 billion up from 21 billion 
in 1988 and 17 billion in 1987 
costs of the longrange crp are expected to account for nearly 
175 billion or roughly 62 percent of the 28 billion total 
says economist merritt padgitt 
other big usda cost items are 176 million for carrying out 
costsharing practices under the traditional agricultural 
conservation program which dates back to the 1930s and 366 
million for technical assistance and extension services a number 
of other lesser programs make up the remainder 
yes conservation expenditures are at an alltime high 
basically because of the crp otherwise they have been trending 
down padgitt said thursday the crp is what has pushed them up 
in the past three years 
under the crp farmers whose contract offers are accepted can 
idle land for 10 years and get annual rental payments from the 
government those average around 50 per acre per year 
in return they must plant grass or trees to protect the land 
from erosion federal payments also are made to help with the cost 
of the initial plantings 
for 1989 crp spending is expected to include about 12 billion 
for rental payments on retired land 
besides the total 1989 spending of more than 32 billion by 
federal state and local governments on soil and water 
conservation spending by farmers could be approximately 323 
million 
however padgitt said that was a tentative figure based on 
survey information and could be revised

the agriculture department is giving spain 
more than 600 plants native to north america to help celebrate the 
500th anniversary of the landing of columbus in the new world 
horticulturist sylvester march of the national arboretum said 
thursday that the plants will join similar contributions from south 
and central america as part of the 1992 worlds fair in seville 
the plants will be used in the landscaping and park areas around 
the expositions grounds on la cartuja island near seville 
march said the 600 specimens are representative of many parts of 
north america and were shipped this year to give them time to reach 
full development by the expositions opening in 1992 
the arboretums selection ranged from the agave a hardy 
succulent to the palmetto he said all of the plants are suited 
to sevilles mediterranean climate 
overall at least 50000 trees of more than 200 different 
varieties and more than 150000 bushes and shrubs have been 
received for the gardens according to spanish officials 
the island was said to be a particularly appropriate site 
for the new world garden because of its historic relationship to 
columbus who often visited the carthusian monastery on la cartuja 
to consult its extensive library the chapel of santa ana at the 
monastery was built to house his remains

the debate over the failed coup in panama 
centers on whether the bush administration showed sensible 
restraint little is being said about the legal and moral 
principles involved 
no objections were raised on capitol hill this week when 
secretary of state james a baker iii reserved the option of using 
force to bring down gen manuel noriega sometime in the future 
according to our own timetable 
the conditions cited by baker were threats to americans in 
panama or to operations of the panama canal he criticized those 
armchair generals in congress who faulted president bush for 
not supporting the failed insurgency this time around 
the secretary of state left no doubt the united states could 
jump in under more favorable conditions 
the authors of right v might international law and the use 
of force which the council on foreign relations happened to 
publish simultaneously with the rebellion in panama would argue 
the situation differently 
david j scheffer at a news conference held thursday with 
panama on everyones minds stated the proposition this way 
should us military force be used to promote democracy in 
panama 
that debate inevitably centers on the united nations charter 
specifically article 24 which provides all members shall 
refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of 
force against the territorial integrity or political independence 
of any state or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes 
of the united nations 
elsewhere in the charter the exception of selfdefense is cited 
but louis henkin a columbia university international law 
professor questioned the notion that one can decide which 
country is illegitimate 
and william d rogers a lawyer who was assistant secretary of 
state in the ford administration registered amazement that in the 
current debate there has been no reference to the clear simple 
unqualified prohibition of the use of force established in the 
un charter 
for nearly two years the reagan and bush administrations have 
waged an unrelenting propaganda war against noriega accusing him 
of drug trafficking and dictatorial rule against the wishes of the 
panamanian people 
almost daily us spokesmen declared noriega must go give up 
his powers in panama and preferably depart the country there 
were reports even that the reagan administration considered 
kidnapping him to face drug charges by two florida grand juries 
the case for us intervention is built on his authoritarian 
rule no one has suggested seriously that the united states is 
compelled in selfdefense to use force against him although baker 
raised the strategic panama canal issue 
rogers looking down the road speculated that at the end of the 
century when the canal goes over to panama under a 1977 treaty 
the united states would have a clear right to ensure the neutrality 
of the waterway 
we can use force to defend the integrity of the panama canal 
but not to interfere in the political process in panama the 
veteran lawyer said 
or as rogers wrote in the book the central premise of 
article 24 is that states should stay out of each others way 
thus strictly interpreted the charter rule inhibits the right 
of one nation to support those seeking to change the way another 
nation is governed 
in the heyday of imperialism the use of us force as an 
instrument of american foreign policy was hardly ever questioned 
except by its targets 
for a while the vietnam wars made us military intervention 
unpopular 
but the reagan doctrine rejected the idea that american power is 
dangerous to the world as jeane kirkpatrick and allan gerson write 
in right v might 
it is above all concerned with the moral legitimacy of us 
support including military support for insurgencies under 
certain circumstances where there are indigenous opponents to a 
government that is maintained by force rather than popular 
consent 
a decade earlier the brezhnev doctrine established soviet 
justification for intervening in east european countries if their 
communist governments were threatened 
the reagan doctrine responded by justifying the use of us 
force to assist insurgents against governments that suppress 
democracy and are themselves maintained by force 
it was all part of a campaign to roll back marxism 
the soviets are not a factor in panama but virtually the same 
rationale is being invoked by the bush administration and even 
more forcefully by its critics who want noriega out of the way 
right now

two bombs exploded late thursday in 
bogota injuring two people and damaging a supermarket and a bank 
police said the attacks were believed to be the latest in a series 
by drug traffickers 
also thursday president virgilio barco named new ministers of 
justice interior and communications his government also announced 
plans for referendum to let voters decide whether suspected drug 
traffickers wanted in the united states should be extradited 
a us official in bogota said that despite the goverments 
unprecedented crackdown on drugs hundreds of tons of cocaine 
continue to be smuggled into the united states 
police said citizens captured one man fleeing from the bombings 
and turned him over to the authorites the blasts damaged a 
supermarket and bank about 1200 feet apart wounding two people 
police said 
since aug 23 when cocaine chieftains responded to the 
governments crackdown by declaring a total war against it 
traffickers have been blamed for 148 bombings that have killed 10 
people and wounded 165 
the traffickers are trying to get the government to reverse its 
stand on extradition 
the government revived colombias extradition treaty with the 
united states as part of the emergency measures imposed in a 
crackdown on drug lords seven weeks ago 
barcos plan for a referendum was announced in a communique 
issued by the minister of government orlando vasquez as one of 
his last acts before resigning vasquez appeared to be a casualty 
of political fighting in barcos liberal party 
the vote on whether suspected traffickers should be sent to the 
united states for trial could come as early as january 
one suspect has been extradited so far proceedings are under 
way against another and two more are being held pending the 
arrival of us documents asking for their extradition 
barco named carlos lemos simmonds minister of interior who is 
in charge of the nations police he replaces orlando vasquez 
velasquez who held the office since july 16 simmonds was 
communications minister and acting minister of justice since monica 
de greiff resigned last month after death threats by drug 
traffickers 
barco chose as his new justice minister roberto salazar 
manrique a former treasury official and deputy director of the 
national bank 
the new minister of communications is enrique danies rincones 
exgovernor of guajira 
the cabinet announcements came in a statement by the 
presidential press secretary 
colombia with help from the us drug enforcement 
administration has tried destroying plantations of coca bushes 
that are the source for cocaine and destroying laboratories and 
chemicals 
the dea is now helping colombian authorities set up a program 
aimed at preventing chemicals from reaching traffickers a us 
official said thursday 
the program will try to identify companies set up solely for 
buying chemicals for cocaine labs the official said at a briefing 
for us reporters he spoke on condition he not be identified 
colombias cocaine cartels are sending an estimated 3300 to 
4400 tons of cocaine to the united states each year the official 
said 
chemicals used by the drug traffickers are coming mainly from 
the united sates china west germany and the netherlands he said 
adding that the dea will assure that chemicals from the united 
states are headed for legitimate companies 
the official said colombian companies that import chemicals 
often end up unknowingly selling the chemicals to fake companies 
set up by cocaine lords

charles haynes of americans united research foundation estimated 
there are at least 2000 christian denominations and another 1000 
or so nonchristian groups 
school districts are urged to follow several steps to respect 
religious liberty and advance education including developing 
policies about the treatment of religious holidays in the curricula 
and informing parents of those policies 
while the booklet reviews court rulings on the issue oliver 
said he and several other coalition members disagree with a recent 
ruling that christmas trees arent a religious symbol he said the 
coalition would encourage the same type of sensitivity on the 
part of schools in regard to christmas trees as with any other 
religious symbols 
the season to be jolly is a difficult one for jews and other 
nonchristians said stephen kurzman of the american jewish 
committee 
in our public schools young children and their teachers must 
frequently make the difficult choice between participating in 
activities that are alien to their family beliefs or separating 
themselves from friends and festivities 
the booklet says that while many people consider halloween and 
valentines day secular holidays others view them as having 
religious overtones 
it says schools often excuse students who object to 
participating in specific events but that such a policy cannot be 
used as a rationale for school sponsorship of religious celebration 
or worship for the remaining students 
elliott wright of the national conference of christians and jews 
inc applauded the idea of treating various religious holidays as 
occasions for historical and cultural instruction 
gary marx said the american association of school administrators 
stands firmly behind the separation of church and state but 
added that the discussions have been healthy 
the bottom line must always be that the public schools will 
in no way use these holidays to promote one religious belief over 
another said marx the associations associate executive 
director 
other participating organizations are the american academy of 
religion american federation of teachers american jewish congress 
and the association for supervision and curriculum development 
christian legal society and national association of evangelicals 
also the national council of churches of christ in the usa 
national council on religion and public education national council 
for the social studies national education association and the 
national school boards association 
officials said the catholic conference participated in drafting 
the document but didnt want to be included as an official sponsor 
they said the islamic society of north america has asked to be 
included as a sponsor

religious broadcasters reaped a bitter harvest 
of lost credibility contributions and congregation sown by the 
lapses of jim bakker and other bigtime apostles of the airwaves 
but even as judgment day fell thursday for a fallen bakker 
electronic evangelism beamed resiliency amid the spatter of scandal 
tv evangelism is not dead its damaged and its changed 
permanently said religious historian david harrell of the 
university of alabama at birmingham but there clearly is an 
audience buying the product these people are selling which is 
ministering to lonely alienated people 
because some of these great men had warts its not going to 
cause the faithful to lose their faith 
jimmy swaggart lost 69 percent of his viewership and 72 percent 
of the enrollment at his bible college after revelations in 1988 
that he paid a prostitute to pose naked and talk dirty 
faith healer oral roberts burdened with a 25 million debt is 
closing his city of faith hospital and medical school in tulsa 
okla two years ago before scandals raised skepticism roberts 
told his flock that a 900foottall jesus had appeared in a vision 
and god would call me home if believers didnt send in 8 
million he got the money 
jerry falwell raised more money than ever this year thanks to 
brisk sales of cassette tapes for home bible study but the moral 
majority founder who dismantled that conservative political arm in 
august has dropped from the top 10 televangelists in tv ratings 
because of a 52 percent slip in viewership 
pat robertson the failed republican presidential candidate 
returned to the 700 club last year after revenues fell by 
onethird he has recovered his losses and contributions are near 
their 1986 peak of 139 million according to spokesmen at his 
christian broadcasting network 
the fallout has affected everyone in religious broadcasting to 
some degree but god is still on the throne said robert cook 
executive director of the 1300member national religious 
broadcasters an umbrella group for the 2billionayear industry 
earlier this year the internal revenue service began auditing 
23 tv ministries and said tax exemptions for some could be in 
jeopardy 
even before the irs action the nrb expelled swaggart and 
tightened its rules insisting each member make public yearly 
audits of donations and spending 
the nrb says that at the local level the electronic church is 
flourishing with the number of christian tv stations growing more 
than 50 percent to 336 in three years and the number of radio 
stations increasing 8 percent to 1485 
but overall credibility suffered because of bakkers and 
swaggarts misdeeds 
shortly after the scandals only 23 percent of americans said tv 
evangelists could be trusted with money a gallup poll showed in a 
new york timescbs news poll 75 percent of regular viewers of tv 
evangelists thought they were too concerned with money and 
onethird of the contributors had an unfavorable opinion of tv 
ministries 
people dont want to write blank checks anymore said 
richard yao of fundamentalists anonymous a new york watchdog group 
founded in 1985 by people who had quit evangelical churches 
in 1987 the group inducted swaggart into its hall of infamy as 
a a oneman horror show derided roberts for spiritual 
extortion described falwell as an overexposed and fading 
star and called robertson the reverend who would be king 
the newest inductee will be bakker whom yao called one of the 
biggest con men of the century 
bakker 49 was convicted thursday of wire fraud mail fraud and 
conspiracy for diverting more than 37 million in ptl money to 
support a lavish lifestyle 
his downfall began with his 1987 confession to having had a 
sexual tryst with new york church secretary jessica hahn he 
allegedly tried to buy her silence with 265000 she later bared 
her soul and her body for 1 million in playboy magazine 
penthouse featured prostitute debra murphree recreating the 
poses she said swaggart paid her to do in motels 
swaggart tearfully confessed in 1988 to moral failure 
defrocked by the assemblies of god and ordered to stay away from 
television for a year he instead took a threemonth tv break and 
saw his audience nosedive from 2 million households to 923000 
according to arbitron the tv rating service this year he is seen 
in 628000 households 
falwells revenues this year were 135 million up 47 million 
from the previous year because of cassette sales and other nontv 
revenue falwell took over ptl from bakker but failed to keep it 
out of bankruptcy court 
it was our greatest growth ever falwell spokesman mark 
demoss said of the favorable revenues we finally feel far 
removed from the situation we found ourselves in the middle of two 
years ago 
robertson also has rebounded ratings are up 18 percent since 
robertson returned to the 700 club 15 months ago he also is 
building a 21 million conference center in virginia beach va 
it was a chastening thing a cleansing thing spokesman 
david hummel said of the scandals weve weathered the storm

house passage of an 11 billion 
deficitcutting bill shifts the spotlight to the senate where 
lawmakers are preparing to work through the weekend and next weeks 
recess on the politically prickly measure 
on a 33391 vote the house approved the legislation thursday 
after nearly two weeks of clamorous debate that saw the leaders of 
the majority democrats take a series of embarrassing tumbles 
chief among them was the adoption of a capital gains reduction 
coveted by president bush and rejection of a democratic plan to 
raise taxes on the wealthy while restoring some individual 
retirement account benefits 
my gosh how many more wins can we have in a oneweek or 
twoweek period of time house republican leader robert michel of 
illinois asked reporters 
on final passage 187 democrats and 146 republicans voted for 
approval while 63 democrats and 28 republicans were opposed 
senate leaders hoped to finish their own version of the bill by 
sunday night 
the measure is the keystone of congressional efforts to reduce 
the projected deficit for fiscal 1990 which began sunday to no 
more than 110 billion current projections for this years 
shortfall are about 116 billion not counting the 
deficitreduction bill 
the measure has been criticized for containing phony savings 
such as not counting next years anticipated postal service losses 
of nearly 2 billion for budget purposes 
if the legislation isnt enacted by oct 16 the grammrudman 
balanced budget law will trigger automatic spending cuts on defense 
and many domestic programs averaging about 5 percent of their 
budgets 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the bill would reduce the maximum tax rate on profits from 
selling capital assets such as real estate and stocks 
the current 33 percent top rate would be reduced to 196 percent 
through the end of 1991 the rate would then be raised to 28 
percent and the basis of assets indexed so profit caused 
entirely by inflation wouldnt be taxed 
the change is expected to bring the treasury 29 billion in 
fiscal 1990 38 billion in fiscal 1991 and 27 billion in fiscal 
1992 as people take advantage of the lower rate and increase their 
capital activity

sharply with losses of more than 5 billion projected for fiscal 
1993 and 1994

to help improve child care for working parents 
it would liberalize the earnedincome credit which benefits 
lowerincome working families with children the credit could range 
up to 1790 a year for those with three or more children a new 
credit of up to 430 a year would help families with children under 
the age of 6

contractors may defer taxes elimination of special tax benefits 
for banks that lend money to employee stock ownership plans and an 
end to an interest break on big banks large loans to developing

government the payroll taxes they withhold from employees and 
repeal a 1986 tax law provision known as section 89 aimed at 
ensuring that employerfinanced health plans dont discriminate in 
favor of higherpaid employees

leaders of an association of food processors 
say they are worried about the practice of alternating loads of 
chemicals and food in the same tank truck 
truckers told a house public works and transportation 
subcommittee at a thursday hearing that they alternated loads of 
chemicals with shipments of juice wine and edible oils 
the practice while legal is worrisome said allen matthys of 
the national food processors association which represents more 
than 600 food companies and industry suppliers 
while neither the food and drug administration nor our members 
have yet discovered a case of contamination caused by this 
practice we strongly encourage the swift enactment of specific 
federal guidelines or legislation to prevent the contamination of 
food by hazardous nonfood materials matthys said in prepared 
testimony 
he told the subcommittee on investigations and oversight that 
some association members have been asking carriers for written 
guarantees that tanker trucks are used only for food 
two months ago the subcommittee was told by several truckers 
that they sometimes carried garbage in the same refrigerated trucks 
used for food 
the panel focused thursday on the related practice of hauling 
chemicals and liquid foods back to back 
trucker david helzer of hermiston ore said the practice 
appeared widespread he has worked for two washington state 
trucking companies 
on june 9 1988 i loaded ammonium phosphate washed out and 
reloaded apple juice i then loaded monethanolamine 100 percent 
washed out and reloaded apple juice helzer said 
helzers 1989 shipment log released by the panel included 
loads of cooking oil wine apple juice fire retardant marine 
lubricant and lime sulphur 
the backhauling of chemicals is dangerous disgusting and 
unfortunately legal said committee member william clinger rpa 
we need to make it a crime 
clifford j harvison president of the national truck carriers 
inc said he had not heard about any healthrelated problems 
associated with carrying alternate loads of chemicals and food the 
trade group represents more than 200 trucking companies 
specializing in carrying bulk commodities 
harvison said in a prepared statement that responsible carriers 
always clean the tanks between loads and many of the chemicals 
being transported are intended for use in food or healthcare 
products 
simply stated no responsible carrier manager who cares 
anything for his or her corporate equity or personal integrity 
would knowingly commingle noncompatible chemicals with products 
destined for human use or consumption harvison said 
food manufacturers he said have the option of rejecting dirty 
tankers 
but mathys said it was difficult for food processors to test for 
contaminants because they must know what it is they are testing 
for 
truckers jim and rikki pomerenke of yakima wash testified 
that carrying backtoback loads of chemicals and juice bothered 
them so much that they refused to haul a load of chemicals from 
illinois to the west coast in may and were fired by the premium 
transport co of yakima 
the subcommittee said premium is owned by james ketchum who 
declined a reporters request for a telephone interview thursday 
ketchum also declined an invitation by the panel to testify

the federal government is reaching out to 
women minorities and drug users infected with aids by giving 9 
million to communitybased research programs in 14 cities 
officials say 
the money will go to 18 programs that serve about 30000 people 
with aids about a third of that number are black or hispanic 21 
percent are intravenous drug users and 8 percent are women 
the message is were reaching out said dr anthony fauci 
director of the national institute of allergy and infectious 
diseases which is distributing the funds 
were attempting to make available and accessible to the 
community kinds of topnotch clinical research that has been 
classically limited to the major medical centers 
researchers say women minorities and intravenous drug users are 
underrepresented in aids drug trials largely because the research 
is conducted at academic medical centers while most aids patients 
get care from doctors in their own communities 
thursdays announcement of the programs selected for funding was 
criticized by a losing applicant the community research 
initiative in new york a pioneer of communitybased aids research 
cri was the model for many of the more than two dozen 
communitybased research programs conducting clinical trials on 
aids drugs most of the testing is sponsored by drug manufacturers 
those programs have helped move aids drug testing from the large 
academic research centers into communities where local physicians 
and their aids patients can participate 
cri officials said they had not been told why they had been 
excluded but said it may have been a punishment for past 
criticisms of federal research efforts 
fauci said the awards were decided by a panel of community 
doctors nurses social workers researchers and people infected 
with the virus 
the reviewers evaluated and ranked the proposals the institute 
then funded each in the order they appeared until the 9 million 
was exhausted fauci said 
he said that he could not by law discuss the merits of any 
applicants but that institute officials would discuss cris 
application with cri officials privately 
however fauci did reject cris contention that past criticism 
of federal research may have been a factor 
im sorry cri wasnt funded i would have liked for them to 
have been fauci said adding there were more qualified programs 
than there was available funding 
the process i saw was rigorous and equitable said reviewer 
jean mcguire of the aids action council 
the programs selected include 11 with limited clinical 
experience and seven that are capable of or have been conducting 
clinical trials they will receive from 278000 to 800000 for 
the first year of a fiveyear contract 
the programs with limited clinical experience are 
addiction research and treatment corp in brooklyn ny 
atlanta aids research consortium chicago community program for 
clinical research on aids clinical directors network of region ii 
in the bronx and brooklyn ny and newark nj comprehensive

a train carrying hundreds of east 
german refugees rolled across their homeland to the west today a 
day after a similar exodus was disrupted by thousands trying to 
board the freedom trains 
authorities said a train carrying the 633 refugees some 
chanting deutschland pulled out of a train station in warsaw 
poland late thursday on a journey through poland and east germany 
to west germany 
those aboard had crowded west germanys embassy in warsaw in 
hopes of joining more than 46000 east germans who have made their 
way through hungary czechoslovakia or poland since midseptember 
west german radio and television reported early today that more 
east germans had entered the embassy in warsaw the number at the 
embassy is not yet known the radio reported 
the zdf television said the wouldbe emigres heard the train 
had left and are also hoping to emigrate 
the journey comes as east germany deeply embarrassed by the 
exodus begins two days of celebrations marking the communist 
countrys 40th anniversary 
among those flying in to attend the festivities is soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev who is expected to ask east 
germanys aging hardline leaders how they plan to handle the 
westward flight that is draining much of the east germanys work 
force 
poland contributed two extra cars to a sixcar east german train 
sent to carry the refugees to west germany which grants them 
automatic citizenship and helps them start new lives 
the train left gdansk station in northern warsaw thursday 
evening and west german railway officials said the train had 
crossed into east germany by early today 
freedom trains that left czechoslovakia brought 7600 east 
germans to the west thursday after a trip plagued by delays and 
disrupted by a riot in dresden east germany witnesses said 
west german officials have not said whether they overestimated 
how many east germans would join the exodus from czechoslovakias 
capital of prague having initially cited a possible figure of 
10000 to 11000 
in prague 200 east germans left the west german embassy late 
thursday and headed home with promises from their government of 
legal emigration within months sources said about 10 east germans 
still were inside the mission 
czechoslovak police used riot police to seal off the embassy 
from more east germans east germany restricted travel to 
czechoslovakia earlier this week 
there was sympathy among czechoslovaks for the east german 
refugees the hardline prague government has also refused 
democratic reform 
of course they are running away a 40yearold czechoslovak 
said on condition of anonymity they want freedom 
i am sure this will have some impact on our country but it 
will take some time because our leadership is very conservative 
east germans began making their way west through hungary in may 
when that communist country removed obstacles from its border with 
austria since hungary officially opened its borders sept 10 
about 32000 east germans have used that route to west germany 
about 7000 more east germans arrived in west germany last 
weekend from warsaw and prague where they had taken refuge in west 
german embassies 
police in dresden reportedly used clubs and water cannons to 
drive crowds back from the main railroad station during the exodus 
from czechoslovakia 
it was a horrible scene said a woman in dresden who asked 
not to be identified because she feared reprisals people were 
trying desperately to get to the platforms and the tracks but the 
police forced them back 
refugees said the first train stopped outside dresden for hours 
at least three others were diverted around the city protesters 
hurled stones at police and at the dresden station smashing 
windows witnesses reported they said thousands took part 
masses of regular police secret police and workers groups 
organized by the communist party dispersed the crowds and sealed 
off the stations 
east germany insisted the trains pass through its territory 
rather than crossing into west germany from czechoslovakia so it 
could formally declare the refugees expelled

congress may be heading for another showdown 
with the white house on restricting advertising on childrens 
television shows 
the senate commerce science and transportation committee on 
thursday approved on a voice vote a bill that would limit ads on 
shows aimed at children to 10 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 
minutes per hour weekdays 
the bill also would condition a broadcasters license renewal on 
whether the station provided programs aimed at educating youngsters 
president bush hasnt said what hell do if such legislation 
reaches his desk but the justice department is recommending he 
veto it on grounds it unconstitutionally intrudes on tv program 
content 
the bill was a compromise between a television 
industrysupported measure by sens howard metzenbaum dohio and 
frank lautenberg dnj that passed congress last year but was 
vetoed by president reagan and a tougher measure proposed this 
year by sen tim wirth dcolo 
introducing his bill metzenbaum cited a dramatic increase in 
the amount of advertising on childrens shows since the federal 
communications commission repealed ad limits in 1984 he said some 
programs urge young viewers to dial 900 telephone numbers to hear 
taped messages from cartoon characters 
the house has passed the metzenbaum version 
after the bill was approved thursday sen daniel inouye 
dhawaii persuaded the committee not to send it to the senate for 
30 days 
inouye who has bitterly attacked what he calls rubbish on 
television said he wanted to consult broadcasters and consider 
further changes in the bill 
committee chairman ernest hollings dsc agreed to a request 
by sen john danforth rmo that the committee consider extending 
the bills restrictions to cable television 
inouye said studies have shown that youngsters on average 
watch between three hours and five hours of tv a day while 
spending less than an hour on homework young children lack the 
ability to distinguish between commercials and programs and 
working parents often cant supervise what their children watch 
inouye said 
the senate bill also would require the fcc to be more responsive 
to complaints about socalled programlength commercials that 
feature toys 
this bill inouye said is the least we owe our children 
until 1984 the fcc had limited commercials on childrens 
programs to 9 minutes per hour weekends and 12 minutes weekdays 
wirths bill would have reimposed those standards 
wirths bill also would have reclassified programlength 
commercials as advertisements thereby effectively eliminating them 
in other action thursday the committee on voice votes 
approved a bill to require broadcasters to provide the lowest 
possible rates to political candidates and make the ads 
nonpreemptible 
authorized fcc spending of 1098 million for fiscal 1990 and 
1178 million for fiscal 1991

restrict steroid distribution and to increase the penalties for 
illicit distribution we can prevent this plague from spreading 
levine referred to the abuse of steroids as the silent side of 
the drug disease in this country he applauded johnsons courage 
for attending the news conference 
johnson later stepped up to the microphones and in a quiet voice 
with a slight stutter told other athletes not to make the same 
mistake he did urging them to come forward to come clean 
lewis dismissed reporters questions that he had used steroids 
indicating he would be willing to run against johnson if he comes 
back and hes clean 
while lewis held the spotlight johnson slipped away to 
adjoining congressional offices 
hes not here to compete with carl lewis i hope he will 
someday said ed futerman johnsons lawyer

prospects for quick resolution of a constitutional 
standoff are fading after the provincial election that confirmed 
the separatist parti quebecois as quebecs secondranking political 
force 
all 10 canadian provinces must ratify an accord by next june 
that would allow quebec to endorse the federal constitution by 
recognizing canadas only majority frenchspeaking province as a 
distinct society within the country 
new brunswick and manitoba arguing that the agreement would 
weaken the federal government so far have refused to sign 
newfoundland also has threatened to withdraw its support from the 
accord known as the meech lake agreement 
speculation before quebecs sept 25 election had been that a 
smashing victory for the liberal party led by premier robert 
bourassa would allow him maneuvering room that might lead to a 
compromise on the constitutional agreement 
bourassa won his second consecutive majority government but the 
parti quebecois urging eventual independence for the province 
slightly improved its showing from the last provincial election in 
1985 
the party captured 402 percent of the vote up from 386 
percent four years earlier surprising analysts who had predicted 
its demise 
the liberals hurt by defections to a new party of 
englishspeaking voters irate about provincial language policies 
slipped from 56 percent to 499 percent although they still hold 
92 of the 125 seats in the provincial assembly 
the liberals argue that any change in the constitutional 
agreement reached by prime minister brian mulroney and the 10 
provincial premiers in 1987 would kill the plan and further kindle 
quebec separatism 
the meech lake agreement was seen as a way for quebec whose 
population is 81 percent frenchspeaking to get around its 
objections to signing a national constitution earlier in the decade 
canadian independence dates to 1867 but british jurisdiction 
over the constitution did not formally end until april 17 1982 
when queen elizabeth ii proclaimed the new constitution act 
quebecs assembly was the first to ratify the agreement on a 
distinct society for the province seven other provincial 
legislatures followed as did parliament on june 22 1988 but the 
two holdout provinces are needed for it to take effect 
opponents of the accord charge that recognizing a distinct 
society within canada would weaken the federal charter of rights 
and that provinces would be given too much power in addition the 
englishspeaking provinces traditionally have been wary of quebec 
the federal constitution applies to quebec even though it has 
not signed the document but the refusal makes it more difficult 
for changes to be made on such national issues as native rights and 
the way the senate operates 
bourassas statements since the provincial election have implied 
that those who supported his party did so with the expectation that 
it would lead to quebecs recognition as a distinct society 
and voters could support separatism if the meech lake agreement is 
killed 
the facts are there to be read he said adding that 40 
percent of the voters have supported a party whose main plank is 
independence for quebec 
other provinces argue that quebecs election was fought largely 
over local issues unrelated to separatism and the parti quebecois 
might not fare so well in a referendum held solely on independence

the transportation department is proposing 
that foreign airlines be given exclusive rights to fly between 
their home countries and some us cities that have little or no 
international air service 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said thursday that he 
will explore the possibility of opening more us cities to flights 
by foreign airlines without the usual bilateral negotiations 
if the plan is adopted skinner said many more us cities 
will have the opportunity to enjoy the economic benefits of 
direct international flights 
in a speech at a forum on international aviation skinner said 
the department would propose the new rules within a few days a 
period for public comment usually about two months would follow 
before the rules would take effect 
skinner did not detail what cities or routes might be affected 
he said the department had been flooded with letters from 
governors members of congress mayors and business leaders urging 
a policy that would open up more international routes from cities 
where passengers have to make connecting flights to go abroad 
permission for foreign airlines to fly the routes would be 
dependent upon having a procompetitive agreement that would allow 
us carriers all the rights our airlines require within the 
country where the foreign carrier is based skinner said 
international routes generally are awarded through bilateral 
negotiations between the united states and other countries 
under the proposal the united states would approve foreign 
service between a us city and the carriers home country only if 
no other airline served the route if the united states has no 
aviation dispute pending with the country and if no us airline or 
other party raises any overriding public interest objection 
we stand ready to share our free market competitive concept 
with any country willing to listen skinner said 
the proposal he said would not replace traditional aviation 
negotiations but skinner said that had not worked in cases where 
us carriers have no immediate plans to service a route that a 
foreign carrier is willing to fly or where no additional foreign 
government permission is needed

us trade representative carla hills says the 
trade controversy of the 1990s could be import barriers caused by 
unverified rumors about products tainted by chemicals 
for nations to simply allege that the way youre raising 
your beef endangers consumers or there may be some problem with 
your grapefruit without testing it is just a guise for 
restricting trade she said 
the united states will try to negotiate rules for reputable 
international testing at the coming round of global trade talks in 
geneva mrs hills said during a preview this week of a planned 
journey to south korea and japan 
we simply must rely upon scientific data and medical data to 
support the allegations that a product is harmful and if it is not 
harmful there ought to be no barrier whatsoever she told the 
gathering of mostly asian reporters 
if we dont get discipline in this area i think this will be 
the trade controversy of the 90s it will be very unpleasant 
because it will be based upon misinformation it will fan public 
passion and it will be enormously unfair 
the united states the worlds major exporter of agricultural 
products is particularly sensitive to the market impact of 
unverified claims about food contamination 
mrs hills who leaves saturday for seoul said she expected the 
south korean government to prevent vandalism and 
misinformation she says has been used there against us products 
she said continuing boycotts of us grapefruit and other 
products in south korea were outrageous saying they were 
triggered by rumors about the use of harmful chemicals such as alar 
the alar report was pure myth and fiction in our view a 
means of preventing the sale of grapefruit in korea mrs hills 
said 
she said it was on the same level as a tactic of putting snakes 
in a theater to prevent distribution of us films in korea last 
year 
her reference to beef recalled last years trade conflict over 
western europes ban on us meat produced using a growth hormone 
favored by american livestock producers the us government 
sharply disputed european claims that the hormone left a harmful 
residue and for a time ordered retaliatory tariffs against european 
products 
the dispute ended after us packing houses recaptured markets 
by exporting meat from animals not treated with the hormone

president bush saying a senateapproved 
statutory ban on defacing the american flag is inadequate is 
renewing his support for a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag 
burning 
i believe that a constitutional amendment properly drawn is 
necessary in order to provide the proper protection bush said 
thursday after 919 approval by the senate of the statutory ban 
the housepassed measure now returns there for consideration of 
changes made by the senate it calls for up to a 1000 fine and a 
year in jail for burning or otherwise defacing the flag 
a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning is set to come up 
in the senate on oct 16 the house also is expected to take up 
such a measure 
republican senators kept up pressure for a constitutional 
amendment as the only effective counter to a june supreme court 
decision that threw out the conviction of texas flagburner gregory 
lee johnson on freespeech grounds 
they scoffed at the notion that the democraticsponsored bill 
would meet the high courts test of constitutionality 
democrats countered that free speech guaranteed by the 
constitution should be limited only as a last resort they claimed 
to have carefully worded their bill to protect it against an 
expected new court challenge on freespeech grounds 
bush was among those saying the bill didnt go far enough 
i respect the intention of those who voted for a statutory 
ban bush told reporters but i continue to believe such an 
approach is inadequate in light of the supreme court decision 
before passage the senate voted 5347 to table or kill an 
amendment offered by minority leader bob dole rkan to apply the 
defacement ban only to those who acted in public 
it added an amendment from sen pete wilson rcalif that 
would make it illegal to physically defile the flag 
the dole amendment was the potential killer amendment sen 
joseph r biden ddel chairman of the judiciary committee said 
afterward 
biden had told the senate the dole and wilson amendments would 
skew the language and push the bill closer toward the danger zone 
in which a court could find that it limited free speech 
biden said after the senate acted however there was not much 
to fear from the wilson amendment 
wilsons ok he said i just didnt want a trend to start 
and thats why i opposed it my expectation is that the house will 
accept our changes and i think they may act fairly quickly 
house democratic leaders tried thursday afternoon to bring the 
bill to the floor for final action but republicans succeeded in 
blocking that move 
biden said it was too early to forecast the prospects for the 
proposed constitutional amendment in the senate itll be 
tight he said 
it was clear that some lawmakers hoped support for the bill 
would insulate them from charges on the campaign trail next year 
that they failed to support the constitutional amendment a number 
of lawmakers indicated that they would vote for both the bill and 
the amendment 
burning the flag already is outlawed under federal law but few 
believe that statute could withstand a court test such as the one 
in the texas case 
democratic sponsors sought to design a bill that would ban any 
act of defacement regardless of whether it involved political 
protest that way they said there would be no danger of it being 
held unconstitutional 
those voting against the measure were sens howard m 
metzenbaum dohio edward m kennedy dmass bob kerrey dneb 
daniel p moynihan dny dole orrin hatch rutah charles 
grassley riowa john h chafee rri and gordon humphrey

a measure to allow airborne federal agents to 
fire on cocainecarrying aircraft has been rejected in the senate 
with lawmakers expressing concern that the plans safety features 
might be unworkable 
lets not go into a piranhalike feeding frenzy every time 
somebody mentions drugs sen john glenn dohio said thursday 
lets send it back where it came from before we kill some 
innocent people out there 
reversing an action it took only weeks ago the senate voted 
5248 to kill the measure that sponsors had sought to add to a 
wideranging drug bill 
the senate then peppered the drug bill with more than a score of 
mostly minor amendments and unanimously approved it the measure 
now goes to the house 
glenn a former combat pilot and astronaut who still flies 
civilian planes scoffed at claims that the safeguards built into 
the measure would protect innocent aviators who might be mistaken 
for drug smugglers 
he said the safeguards were guaranteed to fail because they 
didnt take into consideration what frequencies would be used for 
radio warnings and how pilots flying at night would see visual 
warnings 
sen gordon humphrey rnh also a pilot said he would be 
uncomfortable about another plane getting close enough to his 
airplane so that it could send him visual signals because it might 
bump into me 
supporters said such a measure was needed to combat cocaine 
being flown into the united states from south america 
only a few weeks ago the senate attached a similar measure to a 
defense department authorization bill now in a housesenate 
conference committee 
the sponsor sen mitch mcconnell rky added a number of 
safeguards to the new version after critics complained about the 
danger of shooting down an innocent pilot 
theres virtually no chance that the dentist from peoria is 
going to get shot out of the air mcconnell said 
in other action on the bill the senate restored a provision 
that would require parolees to pass a drug test before their 
release 
as initially offered the bill would have required such tests of 
not only parolees but also those arrested jailed and placed on 
probation but the senate struck out that provision in favor of a 
pilot program under which the justice department will study what 
kind of testing works best 
the senate also attached a provision that would create 20 new 
federal judges the judiciary committee would determine exactly 
where the new positions would be allocated 
under an agreement between lawmakers the committee also will 
produce legislation to create an unspecified number of additional 
judgeships 
other provisions would 
require the department of health and human services to 
establish programs of aftercare for patients who have completed 
treatment programs expanded services for women and minorities and 
stopgap assistance for addicts waiting to get into treatment 
programs 
provide incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop 
antiaddiction drugs 
raise the minimum mandatory federal penalty for selling 
narcotics to minors from five years in prison to 10 years 
allow the government to seek fines of 100000 in civil suits 
against crack house operators

tv preacher jim bakker has been convicted of fraud 
this verdict doesnt bother the work of the lord the work of 
the church continues to go on no matter what happens said the

it is dependent upon the holy spirit 
bakker was convicted thursday in charlotte nc of bilking his

and theme park near fort mill sc prosecutors said bakker 
diverted 37 million of ministry money to pay for his lavish 
lifestyle he faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in prison and 
5 million in fines 
there are still countless thousands of men and women in the 
ministry serving as pastors teachers missionaries and 
evangelists being faithful to what god has called them to do 
many of them on very low incomes said graham 
the rev robert schuller a tv evangelist who preaches from the 
crystal cathedral in garden grove calif said now that the 
jury has reached a verdict i am optimistic because americans will 
know that it is safe to trust in trust again

an end i think a lot of people will realize how easy good people 
with good intentions can get off track

resigned in 1987 said he had no interest in defending my brief 
involvement with ptl some two and a half years ago as that has 
already been well documented

mistake said don baldwin acting general manager of jim and 
tammy ministries which runs a church and produces a television

civil libertarians are criticizing chief 
justice william h rehnquist for bypassing the federal courts 
policymaking body and sending congress a plan that could lead to 
swifter executions for death row inmates 
the move also appears to have dismayed many of rehnquists 
colleagues on the judicial conference the 28 federal judges headed 
by rehnquist who serve as a kind of board of directors for the 
federal courts 
fourteen of the judges wrote congress to request hearings on 
whatever recommendations the conference makes according to todays 
editions of the new york times 
rehnquists move would essentially render the us judicial 
conference impotent leslie harris of the american civil 
liberties union told legal times a washingtonbased newspaper for 
lawyers 
in its oct 2 issue the newspaper quoted opponents as saying 
rehnquists action may suggest federal judges are split over what 
changes if any are needed in handling death penalty appeals 
the 14 judges including the chief judges of eight of the 13 
federal judicial circuits this week wrote conference secretary 
ralph mecham asking him to transmit to the chairmen of the senate 
and house judiciary committees a request that hearings be held so 
that the recommendations of the judicial conference which will be 
adopted at its next meeting can be considered according to the 
new york times 
mecham told the newspaper he had forwarded the letter 
a special committee appointed by rehnquist issued a report last 
month offering a plan to reform a system it said encourages endless 
legal maneuvering years of delay and frenzied lastminute moves to 
stave off executions in the 37 states with death penalty laws 
the committee report was submitted to the judicial conference 
but action on it and any recommendation to congress was 
postponed until the conferences next meeting march 13 
the committee recommended that states enact laws to limit death 
row inmates to two rounds of appeals in state and federal courts 
one round would challenge a verdict directly a second would be 
based on alleged violations of an inmates rights 
the current system permits successive rounds of appeals in the 
federal courts 
states that choose to adopt the new system which would require 
congressional approval would have to assure legal help to death 
row inmates at taxpayer expense throughout the appeals process 
that is not the case now 
rehnquist forwarded the report to the chairmen of the house and 
senate judiciary committees without any recommendation on sept 
22 the day after it was made public

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan reiterating the bush administrations position says a 
move in congress to make the social security administration an 
independent agency would be devastating to the elderly 
this would be devastating for senior americans because it 
would disrupt services to them sullivan told a national press club 
luncheon audience thursday 
he also said it would mean the serious and legitimate concerns 
regarding care and support of our senior citizens will lose cabinet 
level advocacy 
social security is now part of the department of health and 
human services 
supporters of the proposals in congress say that making social 
security an independent federal agency would give it increased 
visibility and would protect its trust funds from being tapped for 
other uses 
measures to make social security independent of hhs are in the 
budget reconciliation bill passed by the house on thursday and in 
the senates reconciliation bill that will be acted on soon

president virgilio barco named a new 
justice minister to lead colombias crackdown on drug traffickers 
after they sent death threats to the previous official and 
reportedly warned other candidates for the job 
his government also announced plans thursday for a referendum on 
whether suspected drug traffickers should be extradited to the 
united states 
late thursday two bombs exploded at a supermarket and a bank in 
bogota injuring two people police saidthe explosions were 
believed part of the traffickers violent response to the 
governments unprecedented 7weekold crackdown on drugs 
since aug 23 when cocaine chieftains declared a total war 
against the government traffickers have been blamed for 148 
bombings that have killed 10 people and wounded 165 
a government spokesman said roberto salazar manrique former 
treasury official and deputy director of the national bank 
accepted the job as justice minister 
but five people including three government officials turned 
down the post after receiving death threats from drug traffickers 
according to colombian news reports 
traffickers from the powerful medellin cartel are blamed in the 
1984 slaying of justice minister rodrigo lara bonilla since 1981 
about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been killed 
traffickers also threatened salazars predecessor monica de 
greiff who quit on sept 21 after disagreements with president 
virgilio barco on the countrys antidrug policy salazar becomes 
barcos ninth justice minister 
as justice minister salazar heads the governments war against 
trafficking he processes extraditions of colombian drug 
traffickers to the united states 
as part of emergency measures declared during the crackdown the 
government revived colombias extradition treaty with the united 
states 
cocaine bosses have enjoyed relative impunity from colombian 
courts through payoffs or intimidation of judges and they want the 
government to reverse its stand on extradition 
so far just one suspect has been extradited but proceedings are 
under way against another two more are being held pending the 
arrival of us documents asking for their extradition 
barcos plan for a referendum on the extradition issue was 
announced in a communique late thursday the vote could come as 
early as january 
the naming of a new justice minister came as part of barcos 
second cabinet change in three months communications minister 
carlos lemos simmonds was named interior minister 
replacing him at the communications ministry will be enrique 
danies rincones the former governor of guajira state 
the army late thursday caught three alleged hired assassins just 
before they were to meet with leaders of the medellin cartel 
according to national television news 
the army reportedly caught the two men and one woman on a farm 
in versalles in the state of antioquia which includes the city of 
medellin 
the three were reportedly waiting for pablo escobar and gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha who together with jorge luis ochoa are thought to 
control the medellin cartel 
the barco administration has offered a 250000 reward for 
information leading to the capture of rodriguez and escobar both 
on the list of 12 colombian drug figures most wanted for 
extradition 
the barco government declared war on the traffickers following 
the aug 18 assassination of leading presidential candidate luis 
carlos galan an antidrug crusader

the dollar strengthened against the japanese yen 
friday while share prices on the tokyo stock exchange declined 
the dollar closed at 14245 yen up 140 yen from thursdays 
close of 14105 yen it opened at 14195 yen and ranged between 
14180 yen and 14275 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues a 14019point 
gainer thursday shed 31364 points or 088 percent closing at 
3520935 
currency dealers said the dollars strength followed a 
surprising upswing in overseas markets thursday despite interest 
rate hikes by central banks of west germany and several other 
european countries 
the bundesbank west germanys central bank raised its key 
lending rates by 1 percentage point including the official 
discount rate to 6 percent to help curb the dollars strength and 
stem inflationary pressures in that country 
central banks in britain france and other european nations made 
similar moves 
the discount rate the rate a nations central bank charges on 
loans to commercial banks has a strong impact on other domestic 
interest rates higher interest rates tend to support a currency 
masaaki tanahashi a dealer with mitsui bank said japans 
central bank stepped into the market intermittently during early 
trading to sell dollars but said the intervention helped 
little to stop the dollars upward pressure 
the bank of japan does not comment on its monetary activities 
but traders estimated the size of the intervention at about 100 
million 
tanahashi said the market was awaiting us unemployment figures 
for september due out later friday in washington as a factor in 
finding the dollars direction 
meanwhile finance minister ryutaro hashimoto told a news 
conference friday morning that japan will watch carefully for any 
impact from the west germanys interest rate raise but said japan 
isnt thinking of changing its monetary policy for now 
on the stock market the markets main barometer held back for 
the first time in three days due to the west german interest hikes 
and the yens easing against the dollar stock dealers said 
they said concern over the upcoming us jobless rate was 
another factor keeping many investors on the sidelines

a florida supreme court ruling that 
allows teenage girls to have abortions without their parents 
consent was criticized by gov bob martinez as a blow to the 
sanctity of the family 
im going to work to make certain that somehow parental 
consent comes back martinez said thursday if the florida 
supreme court will not protect children and parents cannot then 
the legislature must by passing new abortion clinic regulations 
in a majority decision thursday the court struck down a 1988 
law requiring girls under age 18 to get the consent of a parent 
guardian or judge for abortions the states constitutional 
guarantee of privacy outweighed the law the court said 
the challenged statute fails because it intrudes upon the 
privacy of the pregnant minor from conception to birth the court 
wrote such a substantial invasion of a pregnant females privacy 
by the state for the full term of the pregnancy is not necessary 
for the preservation of maternal health or the potentiality of 
life 
the courts ruling came just five days before the state 
legislature was to convene in a special session called by martinez 
to consider new laws restricting access to abortion 
senate president bob crawford said he planned to ask martinez to 
postpone the session in the wake of the courts decision 
i think it demonstrates very clearly that the abortion session 
is premature crawford said 
attorney general bob butterworth charged with defending state 
statutes said his office would petition the court for a rehearing 
in the case of a 15yearold lake county girl identified in court 
records as tw 
in washington molly yard president of the national 
organization for women said the florida decision sends a 
powerful message to the supreme court 
our position is that the constitutional right to abortion 
extends to all women regardless of their age regardless of where 
they reside she said 
ken connor president of florida right to life called the 
decision a big defeat for the unborn child 
charlene carres an attorney with the american civil liberties 
union in tallahassee called the decision a huge victory 
its turning back the tide of an apparent trend in 
especially the us supreme court to allow erosion of these 
rights carres said the florida supreme court in effect has 
said no the tide here doesnt go that way we have built a dam 
 
tw was denied permission for an abortion by a local judge but 
her appeal wound its way to the us supreme court which returned 
the case without comment to the florida supreme court 
in the decision the florida court noted the us supreme court 
has made it clear that the states not the federal government 
are the final guarantors of personal privacy 
we can conceive of few more personal or private decisions 
concerning ones body that one can make in the course of a 
lifetime the court determined in upholding a 5th district court 
of appeals decision 
the court opinion revealed that tw lawfully received an 
abortion while the case was under review she was identified in 
court records as a high school student active in band and flag 
corps who was worried that news of an abortion would kill her 
ailing mother 
four of the seven justices concurred in the decision two partly 
dissented and justice parker mcdonald disagreed principally on 
common law provisions that say minors lack the right to enter into 
contracts 
the court heard oral arguments june 27 but after the us 
supreme court issued a ruling in july giving states more latitude 
to regulate abortions the florida court asked the parties to 
submit new briefs taking that decision and floridas privacy 
provision into account 
also in july martinez scheduled a special session for oct 
1013 and issued four objectives he wanted lawmakers to consider 
martinez is seeking fetal viability tests a ban on use of 
public funds personnel and facilities for abortions tougher 
abortion clinic standards and a notice to women seeking abortions 
on the development of their fetuses

downed power lines after a hurricane are more 
likely to kill nowadays than the storms fierce winds and mighty 
sea surges according to a federal study of hugos swipe across 
puerto rico last month 
of nine deaths associated with hurricane hugos pass over puerto 
rico on sept 18 just two came by drowning in the storms rains 
and floods the us centers for disease control reported thursday 
seven people died in accidental electrocutions however most 
during cleanup efforts 
five electric company workmen died in separate accidents 
repairing downed power lines a sixth man was electrocuted taking 
down a tv antenna before the storm and another man was 
electrocuted when he hit a downed electric line while chopping 
trees after the storm hit 
in the past the cdc said in its weekly report 
hurricanerelated mortality has occurred primarily as a result of 
drownings associated with storm surges the huge wave of 
water hurricanes bring at landfall 
it looks like the pattern may be changing said dr rossanne 
philen a researcher with the atlantabased cdc because of the 
increased forecasting ability we have were able to evacuate more 
people ahead of time 
in puerto rico more than 18000 people were evacuated from 
floodprone areas the night before the storm 
but we found unfortunately in puerto rico that the cleanup 
efforts led to quite a few deaths she said people need to be 
aware of the possible dangers just because the hurricane is gone 
it doesnt mean you are no longer at risk of injury or death 
public health officials must realize that the risks 
associated with hurricanes extend beyond the impact phase the 
cdc said efforts to minimize injury and other health risks for 
both disasterrelief workers and the general population are 
crucial 
at least 71 deaths ultimately were attributed to hugo as it 
moved across puerto rico the virgin islands and the carolinas and 
rained itself out over the northeastern united states at least a 
dozen deaths ultimately were logged in puerto rico 
the cdc said the same pattern occurred four years earlier when 
tropical storm isabelle hammered the island killing 95 only 21 
of whom drowned 
researchers from the cdc are studying the effects of hugo in the 
virgin islands and along the south carolina coast they plan 
further analysis on the storm and the injuries and deaths that 
resulted

for northeastern suburbanites increasingly at 
risk for lyme disease the tickborne illness has grown so much 
that bug spray may not be a realistic solution federal health 
officials say 
the national centers for disease control said thursday that 
4572 cases of lyme disease were reported last year 13 years after 
it was first identified in the united states thats almost doubled 
from 1987 when 2368 cases were reported and up more than 
ninefold from 1982s 492 cases 
in 198788 80 percent of the us cases were reported in six 
northeastern states new york new jersey connecticut 
pennsylvania rhode island and massachusetts 
new york alone reported 56 percent of the 1988 cases and two 
counties in the suburbs around new york city westchester and 
suffolk reported 44 percent 
health professionals recommend protective clothing and insect 
repellent to guard against ticks carrying the disease but in some 
highrisk areas that may not be realistic the atlantabased cdc 
said 
in suburban areas where lyme disease is endemic infection 
may be acquired principally around residences and risk of 
exposure may be continuous during the transmission season the 
agency said 
under these circumstances certain personal protection 
measures such as the daily application of repellents may not be 
practical 
the disease can cause rash aches and even lifethreatening 
heart disturbances most cases occur in the warm weather months 
when the tick problem is worst 
certainly it is on the increase said dr robert craven a 
coloradobased lyme disease specialist with the cdc everyone who 
lives in an area where lyme disease is probable should be aware of 
it and take the necessary precautions 
its recommended that suburbanites clear their yards of leaves 
and debris that can harbor tickcarrying rodents craven said 
scientists are studying ways to wage chemical warfare against ticks 
the cdc said only nine states all west of the mississippi 
have not reported lyme disease the agency said the increasing case 
count is probably due not only to spread of the disease but also 
to increased awareness and reporting 
the cdc also said health officials in new york and connecticut 
have reported five cases of seizures in people who used insect 
repellents containing an ingredient known as deet or 
nndiethylemtoluamide the cdc said deet present in many 
bestselling bug sprays has been marketed in this country since 
1956 and is used by 50 million to 100 million people each year 
obviously this needs to be looked at in perspective craven 
said there have been reported cases of toxicity as in any 
compound certainly some people are going to have allergic 
reactions 
four of the five seizure patients all of whom recovered 
quickly were younger than 8 three of the cases were reported by 
the same pediatric neurologist at least six cases of toxic 
reactions from repeated exposure to deet have been reported since 
1961 the cdc said 
the cdc said none of the new yorkconnecticut cases have been 
confirmed as deet poisoning but the agency recommended not 
applying insect repellent in large quantities to exposed skin 
especially in children

soldiers stormed the building where 
opposition leader guillermo endara was holding a hunger strike but 
a colleague said he was safely spirited away before the raid 
a nearby resident said the troopers fired tear gas in the raid 
late thursday it came hours after gen manuel antonio noriega who 
survived a coup attempt tuesday told the nation that the 
government would get tough with its opponents 
endara the former opposition presidential candidate is now 
in a safe place a collegue willie cochez said later thursday 
he would not elaborate 
endara is in the 16th day of a fast he wants panamanians to 
delay tax payments and boycott government lotteries and casinos 
thus depriving the government of needed revenues 
in noriegas televised speech he ridiculed endaras hunger 
strike and said he had evidence that the united states had planned 
to install endara as president noriega annulled may 7 national 
balloting that international observers said endara was winning by a 
31 margin 
noriega compared the coup attempt with the failed usbacked 
bay of pigs invasion of cuba in 1961 and said he would propose a 
package of war laws dealing with national security 
brandishing a rifle given him by supporters and quoting a 
spanish proverb noriega promised blows for the undecided lead 
for the enemy and silver for the friend in a speech from 
santiago 150 miles west of panama city 
a resident living near the opposition office where endara had 
been staying said two truckloads of soldiers surrounded the block 
stopped traffic and then entered the building apparently looking 
for endara 
journalists were kept 200 yards away from the scene 
associated press photographer john hopper was hit on the head 
and his equipment was confiscated the wound required stitches 
equipment also was taken from a cameraman for an american 
television network 
cochez would not say how endara managed to leave the offices 
without being captured by troops 
security forces were at the building throughout much of the day 
when reinforcements arrived eight gunmen in civilian clothes fired 
in the air outside endaras office dispersing scores of supporters 
earlier members of the defense forces dressed in civilian 
clothes entered the building and arrested two people they held 
everybody inside for three hours 
ten rebels died and 23 people including three members of 
noreigas general staff were arrested when troops loyal to the 
government crushed the revolt the government said 
calling the coup attempt another bay of pigs noriega said the 
united states had left in the lurch those it had bribed 
he said american troops from the southern command military 
installations along the panama canal tried to block loyal forces 
from coming to his rescue when soldiers took him hostage in the 
defense forces headquarters building 
they should not be hypocritical noriega said referring to 
the united states they were involved 
in washington defense secretary dick cheney said the rebels 
contacted us military officials in panama and requested possible 
blockage of routes leading to the headquarters building he said 
however president bush never gave the orders to block the routes 
the united states has used political and economic pressure to 
force noriega from his post as chief of the defense forces since 
february 1988 when he was indicted in florida on drug trafficking 
charges 
noriega denies the allegations and says the us is trying to 
back off 1977 treaties that give his country control of the panama 
canal in 1999 
dressed in civilian clothes and wearing a panama hat the 
general said in the speech the war laws would boost the 
economy benefit the people and take away the privileges of the 
traitors 
in a referrence to the jubilation that overtook government 
offices during the coup attempt noreiga urged government employees 
to list traitors in their ranks 
public employees who are not nationalists must be fired so we 
can give those jobs to worthy men he said a public official 
who does not fire the traitors is himself a traitor 
questions persisted about whether the rebel soldiers killed died 
during the conflict or later nine of the 10 who died were officers 
the government has said only that they died in the coup attempt

as the countdown reached zero and the rocket 
rumbled to life jim bennetts emotions hopscotched from anxiety to 
elation to puzzlement and ultimately to sickening disappointment 
bennett president of american rocket co watched on a video 
monitor thursday morning as his companys product billed as the 
nations first commercially developed and built rocket went up in 
flames on the launch pad 
the failure of the launch from vandenberg air force base left 
bennett and his 90some employees with an emotional hurdle to 
overcome as they look to the next launch attempt the camarillo 
calif company will wait six months to a year before trying a 
second launch 
its just a sick feeling we worked so hard and it meant so 
much to us bennett said in a telephone interview we worked a 
long time to get this far and we hoped that it would be a success 
that we can go on at this point we can go on but we dont have 
that success 
the attempted launch of the 58foottall unmanned rocket was an 
especially emotional moment for amrocs employees because of the 
july death of company founder george koopman in an automobile 
accident the rocket was nicknamed the koopman express 
the rocket was to have soared on a 2 million 15minute 
suborbital flight conducting two experiments 
in a test of satellite sensors being developed for the star wars 
missile defense system the rocket was to release a cloud of inert 
gas the idea was to see if the gas would shield the rocket from 
detection by sensors aboard the militarys delta star satellite 
the rocket also was supposed to deploy a 390pound test model of 
an 8footwide parashield designed by massachusetts institute 
of technology students it is a combined heat shield and parachute 
that someday might be used in a new type of reentry vehicle such 
as an escape system to allow space station astronauts to return to 
earth 
early indications were the launch failed because a liquid oxygen 
valve opened only 20 percent to 30 percent said george 
whittinghill amroc marketing director not enough liquid oxygen 
fuel reached the engine to mix with solid fuel so the thrust was 
inadequate for liftoff 
for bennett the launch drama played itself out across video 
screens and electronic monitors in his post in the launch 
operations control center on the base 140 miles northwest of los 
angeles 
hopes ran high as the countdown concluded to the second 
within the twominute launch window another launch attempt on 
sept 28 had to be scrapped because bad weather pushed amroc past 
the launch window 
at first we were kind of elated because we made the countdown 
to the second really an achievement on a first flight bennett 
said 
at 1028 am the engine ignited but flames shot up the sides 
of the rocket spectators shouted it didnt take off it didnt 
take off koopmans widow and sister started to cry 
as bennett drove from the base to his hotel he thought of how 
company founder koopman would have reacted 
i knew george pretty well and i know exactly what his 
response would have been said bennett he would have been up 
there saying were going to continue were going to succeed 
and thats what were going to do

a train carrying more than 600 east 
german refugees rolled into west germany today after a similar 
exodus had been disrupted several hours by thousands seeking to 
board the freedom trains 
the east germans chanting deutschland and shouting thanks 
left warsaw by train thursday night on a trip via their communist 
homeland and arrived in laatzen a hanover suburb nearly 14 hours 
later 
west germans welcomed the 633 refugees with cheers and pats on 
the back the refugees looked wellrested and more relaxed than 
those who arrived earlier in the week from czechoslovakia 
west german officials and red cross workers readied temporary 
housing and other forms of care 
those aboard had crowded west germanys embassy in warsaw in 
hopes of joining the east germans who have made their way through 
hungary czechoslovakia or poland since midseptember more than 
47000 east germans have left since then 
west german radio and television reported that as soon as the 
train left about a dozen more east germans entered bonns embassy 
in warsaw in hopes of gaining permission to go west 
the journey comes as east germany deeply embarrassed by the 
exodus begins two days of celebrations marking the communist 
countrys 40th anniversary 
among those flying in to attend the festivities is soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev who is expected to ask east 
germanys aging hardline leaders how they plan to handle the 
westward flight that is draining much of the east germanys work 
force 
west german radio said some people reportedly were gravely 
injured when east german police in dresden prevented people from 
boarding trains heading west late wednesday and early thursday 
also 150 injuries and 80 arrests reportedly occurred during a 
demonstration monday in leipzig by 20000 east germans 
the figures were cited at a prayer service in an east berlin 
church late thursday the radio said without elaborating 
poland contributed two extra cars to a sixcar east german train 
sent to carry the refugees to west germany which grants them 
automatic citizenship and helps them start new lives 
julia lange said the train stopped shortly after crossing from 
poland to east germany and officials boarded 
we were informed that we were being expelled and they 
collected our passports said ms lange 30 
the freedom trains that left czechoslovakia brought 7600 east 
germans to the west thursday 
in prague 200 east germans left the west german embassy late 
thursday and headed home with promises from their government of 
legal emigration within months sources said about 10 east germans 
still were inside the mission 
czechoslovak police used riot police to seal off the embassy 
from more east germans east germany restricted travel to 
czechoslovakia earlier this week 
there was sympathy among czechoslovaks for the east german 
refugees the hardline prague government has also refused 
democratic reform 
of course they are running away a 40yearold czechoslovak 
said on condition of anonymity they want freedom 
i am sure this will have some impact on our country but it 
will take some time because our leadership is very conservative 
east germans began making their way west through hungary in may 
when that communist country removed obstacles from its border with 
austria since hungary officially opened its borders sept 10 
about 32000 east germans have used that route to west germany 
about 7000 more east germans arrived in west germany last 
weekend from warsaw and prague where they had taken refuge in west 
german embassies 
police in dresden reportedly used clubs and water cannons to 
drive thousands of people back from the main railroad station 
during the exodus from czechoslovakia 
it was a horrible scene said a woman in dresden who asked 
not to be identified because she feared reprisals people were 
trying desperately to get to the platforms and the tracks but the 
police forced them back 
masses of regular police secret police and workers groups 
organized by the communist party dispersed the crowds and sealed 
off the stations 
east germany insisted the trains pass through its territory 
rather than crossing into west germany from czechoslovakia so it 
could formally declare the refugees expelled

twenty relatives of political 
prisoners and disappeared people held 13 hostages at the costa 
rican embassy to protest repression by the rightist government but 
said they would leave today 
the group the federation of committees of mothers and relatives 
of political prisoners initially took 16 hostages when they 
stormed the embassy compound thursday 
but ambassador jesus fernandez was taken from the embassy in an 
ambulance later in the day and two other diplomats were allowed to 
leave the offices 
fernandez who had heart bypass surgery two months ago appeared 
to be breathing with difficulty as he left the building he was 
taken to a hospital and then sent home the ambassadors wife 
janine said 
the 20 human rights activists who were mostly women allowed 
consulgeneral humberto murillo and first secretary rene aldama to 
leave the thirdfloor offices to talk to fernandezs wife through 
the back gate 
the consul said four women and nine men were still being held 
also in the offices but not being held hostage early today were 
four journalists three of them americans 
a spokeswoman for the group said on condition of anonymity that 
the activists would leave the embassy today 
the action was to draw attention to alleged human rights 
violations under the rightist government that took power june 1 and 
to pressure the administration to take concrete measures to end 
the decadeold civil war the spokeswoman said 
the federation of committees for the past eight years has 
protested the kidnapping and killing of suspected leftists by 
rightist death squads 
fernandez said some of the activists were armed he did not say 
what weapons they carried but reporters saw what appeared to be a 
handgun tucked into the pantwaist of one woman 
there were also several packets of what looked like fuses 
wrapped in newspaper 
in a communique late thursday the government said the 
demonstrators were armed with grenades and handguns it called the 
takeover a flagrant violation of the human rights of the people 
taken hostage 
the government statement said the takeover was intended to 
frustrate the dialogue process a reference to preliminary peace 
talks with leftist guerrillas that began last month in mexico they 
are scheduled to proceed oct 1617 in costa rica 
fernandez said the hostagetakers made no specific demands or 
stated conditions for eventually abandoning the embassy 
they have made their point he said 
several dozen soldiers and police surrounded the sixstory 
embassy building shortly after the takeover but fernandez asked 
that the cordon be lifted and by early today only 20 troopers 
manned unobtrusive positions around the block 
the government of president alfredo cristiani considers the 
group as well as dozens of other union peasant and human rights 
organizations leftist guerrilla fronts 
more than 70000 people have been killed since a leftist 
guerrillas began their war against a succession of usbacked 
governments a decade ago human rights groups say many victims have 
been civilians slain by rightwing death squads 
cristianis party the republican nationalist alliance has been 
linked to the death squads after taking office cristiani said he 
planned to introduce draft legislation giving the police armed 
forces and courts a freer hand against suspected subversives 
opposition political union and human rights organizations have 
described the proposed measures as totalitarian

the acquittal of a rape suspect on 
grounds that the woman wore a lace miniskirt with no underwear was 
a horrendous verdict that could deter victims from prosecuting 
rapists counselors said 
no woman asks to be raped dorothea gallagher of the 
national organization for womens broward county chapter said 
thursday i cant think of any other crime in which people would 
say that the victim asked for it 
a jury of three men and three women said just that in explaining 
their acquittal of steven lord 26 on kidnapping and rape charges 
wednesday 
she asked for it foreman roy diamond said the way she 
was dressed with that skirt you could see everything she had she 
was advertising for sex 
she was obviously dressed for a good time but we felt she may 
have bit off more than she could chew juror mary bradshaw said 
according to testimony the 22yearold woman wore a tank top 
and a short white lace skirt without underwear last nov 6 the 
night she said she was raped 
alexander siegel the womans attorney said his client was 
bewildered shocked angry astounded by the verdict 
detective tom white of the indian river county sheriffs 
department who worked on the case termed the acquittal very 
disappointing 
i honestly believe as a police officer that he raped her that 
he forcibly had sex with her white said i took her to the 
emergency room we took her clothing and her car into evidence we 
caught him the following day 
white said the woman told him that lord took off her underwear 
when he allegedly raped her the first time 
joanne richter director of the sexual assault treatment center 
in fort lauderdale said the verdict could discourage rape victims 
from prosecuting their attackers 
no matter who you are or what you are wearing it doesnt mean 
you should be a victim of sexual assault richter said i am 
having a hard time believing that people think that if youre not 
dressed appropriately that you should be a victim of sexual 
assault 
its a fairly horrendous verdict said ellen vargyas at the 
national womens law center in washington dc 
at the trial the woman said lord pulled a knife on her in a 
fort lauderdale restaurant parking lot forced her into her car 
drove north on interstate 95 and pulled over twice to rape her at 
knifepoint 
defense attorney tim day told jurors the woman agreed to have 
sex with lord in exchange for 100 and cocaine but later changed 
her mind 
how could anyone think that someone would want to be cut up 
with a knife hit with a rock and raped siegel said they put 
her on trial 
thats common though said sally goldfarb staff attorney at 
the now legal defense and education fund in new york 
in most rape trials its the victim not the suspect thats 
on trial she said 
barbara mitchell who heads the sexual crimes and child abuse 
section of the broward state attorneys office said the attitudes 
reflected in the jurors comments die hard 
i thought we had done a better job educating the public she 
said well have to try it again

the president of tufts university 
rescinded a ban on verbal attacks after legal experts suggested the 
ban prompted by an offensive tshirt violated students first 
amendment rights to free speech 
i have decided we are better off erring in the tradition of 
free speech jean mayer said thursday in an interview we 
decided we would decide each case on its merits 
students had rallied around the right to free speech and 
objected to the policy published in the student handbook which 
barred verbal attacks whether spoken or written against an 
individuals race ethnic group religion or sexual orientation 
but billy jacobson the student body president said he was 
sorry to see the university drop a policy supported by many of its 
7000 students 
the university has a responsibility to protect students he 
said it cant insulate students but this is their home and 
students shouldnt have to worry about going into their dorms and 
their dining halls and seeing something offensive to them 
the policy was prompted by an outcry last spring when an 
enterprising student marketed a tshirt stating 15 reasons why 
beer is better than women at tufts all 15 reasons disparaged 
women one of the more printable ones was hangovers go away 
the tshirt dealer was placed on probation and ordered to do 50 
hours of community service but mayer recommended the committee on 
student life reconsider that sentence which it eventually 
suspended when lawyers advised it was unconstitutional 
the student life committee comprising faculty and students 
imposed the free speech restriction last june on the campus abut 
six miles outside boston protests began after the policy made its 
way into this years student handbook 
some experts say the first amendment only bars the government 
from restricting speech and doesnt apply to private universities 
mayer said but others say it upholds free speech anywhere short 
of sparking a riot he said 
however a court ruling found a similar policy at the university 
of michigan at ann arbor was unconstitutional and vague mayer said

bimbo a word much in vogue in the 
scandalridden 80s was first used as a relatively sexless term 
for lackluster males of the roaring twenties the slightly stuffy 
word academy has a much racier past a daring exploit 
involving a youthful helen of troy 
from bunk the unfortunate legacy of a longwinded 
congressman to zany derived from the word for a 16thcentury 
italian clown a new book by dictionary publisher merriamwebster 
inc examines the strange stories and forgotten figures lurking 
behind everyday words 
this book was a little bit more fun to work on than the usual 
things we do here said frederick c mish editorial director of 
merriamwebster 
websters word histories touted as a companion for 
armchair etymologists is a departure from the dictionary 
publishers generally sedate product filled with lively prose and 
complete with an eyecatching bikini entry on the jacket 
that was probably picked because it would be of some 
interest mish said dryly hastily pointing out the selection was 
an advertising not editorial decision 
scholarly tomes about the origins of words already exist most 
notably the oxford english dictionary which exhaustively defines 
hundreds of thousands of words and gives their sources 
but word histories published in september and priced at 1495 
is aimed more at the kinds of people who contact merriamwebster 
regularly asking where words or phrases come from mish said 
i make no bones about that this is intended to be a popular 
book he said we have not targeted linguists or historians or 
any particular group of people of advanced educations or highly 
specialized interests 
audrey duckert a lexicographer at the university of 
massachusetts who has contributed to merriamwebster dictionaries 
and to the last supplement of the oxford english dictionary said 
there are surprising numbers of nonscholars who are interested in 
word origins 
one of my jobs at merriamwebster was to answer all the 
dear mr webster letters i settled more scrabble arguments than 
you can shake a stick at she said 
sometimes theyre intimidated by scholarly things scholars 
are very often put off by cutesy things if this goes that middle 
line between being cute and scholarly i think it would be a good 
thing she said 
some of the derivations described are classical such as 
academy which stems from the abduction of the 12yearold 
helen of troy a man named akademos showed her brothers castor and 
pollux where she was hidden athens later named a park and 
gymnasium after him akademeia there the philosopher plato set 
up his school the prototype prep 
others put their stamp on less erudite words bunk or 
nonsense is the unfortunate legacy of a longwinded early 
19thcentury congressman felix walker who represented the 
district in which buncombe county nc is located 
bimbo now used to describe attractive but foolish females 
is found as early as 1919 to describe a fellow who was 
unimportant or undistinguished according to word histories the 
word is believed to have derived from an italian term for baby use 
of the word to describe a sexually promiscuous woman did not catch 
on until the advent of 1930s detective novels peopled by beautiful 
but dumb blondes 
zany is believed to derive from an italian dialect name for 
a stock comedy character zanni in improvised comedies of the 16th 
century the word first appeared in english in shakespeares 
loves labour lost with a reference to some slight zanie 
some words refuse to be neatly explained and editors note in 
the introduction to the book that etymology is not an exact science 
for example the entry for bikini describes 1946 atomic 
bomb tests on the atoll of bikini in the marshall islands in the 
summer of 1947 another bombshell hit the beaches of the french 
riviera the bikini the entry continues 
editors confess they do not know how one led to the other 
although they offer the theories that the effect of a bikiniclad 
woman compares to an atomic blast or the groundstripping effect 
of an atomic blast compares to a bikini a third theory that the 
shape of the atoll looks like a bikinied figure is dismissed as 
unlikely even to the most perfervid imagination 
by the way perfervid means extremely or excessively 
fervent

colombo in central kandy district it brought to 39 the number of 
slain youths found in the area in two days those found thursday 
had been beheaded or fatally shot then dumped on a university 
campus 
military officials blamed progovernment vigilante groups for 
both massacres 
the slayings on wednesday and thursday were to avenge the death 
of a volunteer soldier gunned down by two unidentified men on a 
bicycle the officials said on condition of anonyity edward 
nagahawatta an assistant registrar at the university was killed 
inside the campus wednesday officials said 
the countrys eight universities were closed more than two years 
ago because of student unrest the government contends the campuses 
are a stronghold of the peoples liberation front an extremist 
sinhalese group that advocates overthrowing the govenrment 
military officials said on condition of anonymity that the 21 
victims were found today around the town of kandy 
two bodies were discovered in the main bus terminal in kandy 15 
were found in gelioya village and the remaining four in mahiyawa 
village officials said 
elsewhere five people were killed in southern sri lanka the 
govnerment said without elaboration 
human rights groups say the military and vigilante groups 
routinely kill sympathizers of the sinhalese militants the 
government denies the charge 
president ranasinghe premadasa called a meeting with opposition 
parties last month to try to resolve ethnic differences dividing 
the indian ocean island 
the front refused to attend the peace conference and spurned a 
temporary truce called last week by government forces at least 80 
people were killed during the sixday truce which expired tuesday 
the front has rejected all peace offers from the government 
saying it wants premadasa to resign because he came to power in 
what they called fraduulent elections in december 1988 
when it began its campaign in 1987 the sinhalese front opposed 
the governments peace overtures to tamil separatists demanding an 
independent homeland in the northeast it also objected to the 
indian peacekeeping soldiers deployed in sri lanka to help 
implement a peace treaty with tamil guerrillas 
the soldiers will be pulled out by dec 31 the indian 
government has said 
at least 11000 people including 1000 indian soldiers have 
died in the 6yearold tamil rebellion tamils say they are 
discriminated against by the majority sinhalese in jobs and 
education 
the predominantlybuddhist sinhalese make up 75 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people and control the government and military 
tamils comprise 18 percent of the population

some 300000 massachusetts motorists have had 
their licenses suspended and state officials estimate at least 
half of those are continuing to drive illegally 
the statistics have prompted the registry of motor vehicles to 
begin taking away the license plates of drivers caught behind the 
wheel with suspended driving licenses officials said 
state registrar robert m hutchinson jr released the figures on 
license suspensions during a news conference thursday where he 
defended the registrys decision to reinstate the drivers license 
of a man charged with killing a 10yearold girl while driving 
drunk in new hampshire on sunday 
following the arrest of peter dushame of north andover the 
registry said his license had been suspended and that he was 
driving illegally when he allegedly hit lacey parker in nashua 
but hutchinson said thursday that dushame had a valid license at 
the time of the accident he said either human or technical 
error led authorities to believe initially that dushames license 
was still under suspension 
the registry suspended dushames license in march 1988 after 
being notified by new hampshire authorities that he had been 
convicted of a serious motor vehicle offense there 
hutchinson declined to identify the offense citing privacy laws 
according to the new hampshire division of motor vehicles 
dushames record includes two drunken driving convictions there 
since 1986 the year that state began notifying massachusetts 
authorities of vehicle offenses committed in new hampshire by 
massachusetts drivers 
hutchinson said the registry was aware of only one offense by 
dushame in new hampshire dushame would have received a longer 
suspension if the registry known of the other conviction he said 
dushames sister beth davis said he got his license back about 
two months ago 
asked whether the registry acted properly by returning his 
license hutchinson said based upon the law at the time we 
acted correctly yes

indication of criminal conduct in the crash of a usair jetliner 
into the east river last month 
the boeing 737400 skidded into the river after an aborted 
takeoff from laguardia airport sept 20 killing two passengers 
so far theres been no evidence of criminality queens 
district attorney john j santucci said thursday in what he 
described as an interim report on his investigation of the wreck of 
flight 5050 
the local probe into possible criminal negligence or vehicular 
homicide is unusual the national transportation safety board is 
charged with investigating airline accidents 
santucci said he wanted to consult with ntsb investigators and 
speak to capt michael w martin and first officer constantine 
kleissas before calling off his investigation he also said he 
wanted to listen to the cockpit voice recordings 
the district attorney said interview with 25 witnesses failed to 
substantiate a report that martin was acting incoherently before 
the flight and left the scene immediately after the accident 
that report originated with the copilot who has since 
withdrawn the remark and apologized 
investigators found the pilot went to an airport lounge and then 
to a hospital after the crash santucci said 
the ntsb hasnt finished its probe shortly after the crash a 
board spokesman said the copilot reported he accidentally punched 
a button that cut the throttle and the pilot told officials he 
aborted takeoff because he felt a vibration and the jet began to 
veer

the political support to stay in power

top cabinet or party posts credeitials generally required for the 
premiership

masked gunmen today kidnapped two swiss 
red cross employees who worked distributing artificial limbs to 
victims of lebanons civil war and drove them to a palestinian 
refugee camp police said 
the two workers were seized when they arrived at a red cross 
center outside this port 25 miles south of beirut police said 
officials at the geneva headquarters of the international 
committee of the red cross condemned the kidnapping which comes 11 
months after the abduction of another swiss red cross worker in 
sidon 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility a sunni moslem 
militia leader indicated a radical palestinian group was involved 
police and the red cross identified the victims as emmanuel 
christen 32 and elio erriquez 23 and said both worked as 
orthopedic technicians at the red cross center which distributed 
the artificial limbs to victims of the 14yearold civil war 
the red cross pulled all its 31 swiss delegates from lebanon on 
dec 20 after the abduction of peter winkler a red cross official 
in sidon the swiss man was kidnapped nov 17 1988 and released 
dec 16 
news reports in switzerland and lebanon said at the time that 
winklers kidnappers threatened new antiswiss attacks claiming 
the red cross and swiss authorities reneged on a pledge to pay 
ransom for winklers freedom 
the red cross mission returned to lebanon jan 22 after all 
parties in lebanon pledged it would not be attacked 
the assailants today wearing black masks were waiting in two 
cars at the entrance of the center near the ein elhilweh refugee 
camp when the relief workers white peugeot car arrived police 
reported 
christen parked the car at the centers parking lot and 
climbed out holding an artificial limb erriquez got out from the 
cars opposite door followed by a lebanese icrc employee a 
police spokesman said 
two men immediately leaped out of a darkcolored mercedes one 
with a pistol and the other a machine gun trained at the red cross 
men said the spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules 
christen and erriquez immediately threw their arms up 
offering no resistance they were bundled at gunpoint into the 
trunk of the mercedes which sped off followed by the other car 
loaded with armed guards the spokesman said the spokesman said 
the two cars headed in the direction of the camp 
the abduction was the latest in a chain that targeted relief 
workers with foreign humanitarian organizations in south lebanon 
police blamed most of the previous kidnappings in southern 
lebanon on the fatahrevolutionary council the radical palestinian 
guerrilla group headed by terrorist abu nidal abu nidal is the nom 
de guerre of sabri albanna a former official in yasser arafats 
mainstream fatah movement who split with the palestine liberation 
organization leader in 1973 
sidon houses the teeming palestinian refugee camp of ein 
elhilweh and the nearby town of mieh mieh where abu nidals group 
maintains bases 
mustafa saad commander of the sunni moslem nasserite militia 
that has governed sidon since the outbreak of lebanons civil war 
in 1975 pointed an accusing finger at the palestinians 
this is an ein elhilweh affair not mine saad told 
reporters after a 10minute meeting at his house with red cross 
south lebanon chief delegate roland sidler sidler would not speak 
with reporters 
in geneva red cross spokesman joerg bischof said the abductions 
came as a surprise following the assurance by lebanese groups 
that red cross workers wouldnt be attacked 
we condemn that humanitarian workers who bring assistance to a 
country at war are kidnapped because it hinders a very important 
work the red cross is doing in lebanon bischof said 
apart from the two swiss abducted today 16 westerners 
including eight americans are held hostage in lebanon 
most of them are held by proiranian shiite moslem extremist 
factions the longest held is american journalist terry a 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
in beirut today irish ambassador patrick mccabe appealed for 
information about irish hostage brian keenan who turned 39 in 
captivity two weeks ago 
mccabe who is ambassador to both lebanon and iraq and based in 
baghdad came to beirut early this week he held meetings with 
commanders of the un peacekeeping force in south lebanon before 
conferring with lebanese foreign ministry undersecretary farouk

agreed to meet with anglican archbishop desmond tutu and two other 
church antiapartheid leaders next week for unprecedented talks 
about south africas racial conflict 
de klerk immediately agreed to a request by the church leaders 
for urgent talks about the crisis in our land the presidents 
office said 
it will be de klerks first direct meeting with top 
antiapartheid leaders since he replaced pw botha as president 
aug 15 the meeting has been scheduled for wednesday in pretoria 
tutu who was in the united states today released a statement 
through his office in cape town saying he and his colleagues 
believe de klerk does not appreciate the farreaching nature of 
the steps he must take to get negotiations off the ground between 
blacks and government leaders 
de klerk has offered to negotiate a new constitution within five 
years that would extend political rights to the disenfranchised 
black majority but he has ruled out participation by the outlawed 
african national congress guerrilla movement unless it renounces 
violence 
tutu referring to this position said negotiations which 
exclude the legitimate leaders of our people which the government 
appears to be contemplating will intensify not resolve our 
countrys crisis 
it is not our intention to go to mr de klerk claiming to be 
negotiators tutu said as church leaders we would see 
ourselves as facilitators who would try to create the climate for 
negotiations 
the actual negotiations he said would have to be entered 
into by those identified by our people as their true political 
leaders 
in addition to tutu the clergymen who requested the meeting 
were the rev allan boesak president of the world alliance of 
reformed churches and the rev frank chikane generalsecretary of 
the south african council of churches de klerks office said 
tutu expected back in south africa on sunday after traveling to 
washington for the funeral of episcopal bishop john t walker met 
four times with botha during the former presidents 11 years in 
power the archbishop has not met with de klerk since bothas 
resignation in august 
government sources have been quoted in news reports this week as 
saying jailed anc leader walter sisulu and another prominent black 
activist oscar mpetha will be freed by oct 18 
sisulu 77 the outlawed groups general secretary was 
sentenced in 1964 along with nelson mandela and other anc leaders 
to life in prison for plotting antigovernment sabotage

the colombian government is forcing cocaine 
cartels to hustle out large stockpiles and the united states is 
taking advantage of the chaos to seize huge shipments a federal 
official said 
were seizing a lot more cocaine because a lot more cocaines 
moving out because its not safe to leave it in colombia any 
more transportation secretary samuel k skinner said thursday 
the 35 tons of cocaine seized during the past week in 
california texas and louisiana is a clear indication that the war 
on drugs is working he said 
skinner spoke beside the zedom sea a rusty 185foot former 
offshore supply boat seized monday by the coast guard in the gulf 
of mexico it was carrying more than six tons of cocaine worth more 
an estimated 500 million 
the ship was escorted to new orleans on thursday and the crew 
of nine colombians was turned over to the drug enforcement 
administration 
the eight men and one woman were arraigned on charges of 
importing cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine 
and ordered held without bond the charges carry a possible maximum 
penalty of life in prison 
dea spokesman billy fernandes said the cocaine found aboard the 
zedom sea totaled 12208 pounds or slightly more than six tons 
and had a street value of more than 550 million earlier 
officials had estimated the amount seized at about 5 tons 
the seizure was one of three major finds in less than a week 
texas state troopers found nine tons of the drug wednesday in 
harlingen stacked in a house believed to be a center for 
repackaging cocaine after its arrival in the united states agents 
continued to look for the owner of the house three mexican 
citizens at the scene were arraigned thursday on charges of 
engaging in organized criminal activity and aggravated cocaine 
possession 
about 20 tons were found late last week in a los angeles 
warehouse the worlds largest seizure 
the gulf seizure along with about 3000 to 3500 pounds seized 
near puerto rico over the weekend brings the coast guards total 
take in the first four days of fiscal 1990 to more than the coast 
guard seized in all of the previous fiscal year officials said 
it is not business as usual in the drug business today said 
skinner pressure by the colombian government since a leading 
presidential candidate was assassinated in august is creating 
what id call chaos and were taking advantage of that and were 
seizing cocaine that otherwise would have been transmitted in 
smaller groups and probably would not have been detected 
most of the cocaine on the zedom sea was found in two of 10 
boxcarsized freight containers on the deck said ruben monzon 
special agent in charge of the deas new orleans office

although damage estimates in the wake of 
hurricane hugo were hiked upward to more than 4 billion the 
return of carriage rides and parking tickets are signs that 
historic charleston is trying to get back to normal 
mayor joseph p riley jr said the city had made an absolutely 
remarkable recovery in two weeks since the hurricane lashed the 
city with its 135 mph winds 
the city is open the curfew is over and we invite the people 
of the state and the country to come to charleston riley said 
but he noted that the recovery will take longer for those who lost 
homes possessions or jobs in the hurricane 
horsedrawn carriages were to be back on the streets this 
weekend and the city will start ticketing parking violators on 
monday the mayor said 
meanwhile the ben sawyer bridge the only link between the 
mainland and the isle of palms and sullivans island about 10 miles 
north of charleston is back in place said carol todd 
spokeswoman for the army corps of engineers 
she said the corps finished its work about 2 am today but 
that she does not know when the swing bridge will open to traffic 
officials from the state highway department were inspecting the 
bridge this morning she said 
the bridge one end of which was submerged in the intracoastal 
waterway by hugos winds was lifted onto barges wednesday but a 
broken cable prevented the barges from positioning the bridge back 
on the road before today 
hugo hit the coast sept 21 leaving at least 18 dead in south 
carolina and damaging and destroying homes businesses schools 
and municipal buildings in all 29 people were killed on the us 
mainland and at least 33 in the caribbean 
gov carroll campbell said thursday that damage from the storm 
was revised upward to 4 billion to 5 billion previous estimates 
had been closer to 3 billion 
state and local governments would pick up about 25 percent of 
the 200 million cleanup cost with the federal government covering 
the rest 
the state highway commission suggested a 1cent increase in the 
gasoline tax to help pay for the cleanup but campbell said he 
would first shift funds from other programs before increasing taxes 
riley who had asked campbell to request army troops to help 
clear debris said thursday he wrote to president bush himself when 
the governor rejected the idea 
in a letter to campbell riley and two other mayors said the 
state has been inundated with as much debris as one might expect to 
collect over 50 years they said private contractors could not meet 
the cleanup demand and local governments couldnt afford to pay 
them 
but campbell said the cities can still contract with private 
contractors and would have to pay 12 percent of the cost 
also thursday national hurricane center director bob sheets 
said damage from the storm could have been halved had coastal 
structures been built to the tougher hurricane building codes of 
south florida 
the extent of the damage is far more widespread than ive seen 
from any previous hurricane said sheets in the state to tour 
storm damage 
workers used bulldozers to rebuild dunes along beaches scarred 
by the hurricane private contractors were supported by 550 army 
troops and marines using 100 dump trucks to haul sand to build up 
eight miles of beach in myrtle beach 
tides at least 2 feet above normal are expected along the coast 
from oct 1418 caused by the moon coming unusually close to the 
earth said ms todd 
campbell hopes to have 65 miles of dunes rebuilt along the 
states northern coastline before the high tides hit

energy secretary james d watkins is 
encountering stiff resistance to his plan to store radioactive 
waste from a colorado nuclear weapons plant in several states until 
a permanent dump is completed in 1990 or 1991 
sen brock adams dwash was meeting today with watkins top 
adviser on waste leo duffy to reinforce his states opposition to 
accepting waste at the hanford nuclear weapons site near richland 
which already is the most polluted arms plant in the nation 
nevada gov bob miller said he had tried unsuccessfully thursday 
to reach watkins by telephone to tell him we wouldnt accept 
this waste under these circumstances 
sen richard bryan dnev said in a statement today dont 
even ask nevada to take any of the waste 
in congressional testimony thursday watkins said he anticipated 
a tough battle 
people are going to say not in my state watkins said 
the retired admiral suggested he would propose in a private 
meeting next week with state governors that seven states share the 
wastestorage burden in the interest of keeping the crucial rocky 
flats nuclear weapons plant operating 
watkins told the senate energy and natural resources committee a 
permanent waste repository in new mexico would not be ready to open 
by march when colorados unilaterally imposed waste storage limit 
is expected to be reached 
thus temporary storage sites must be found by march 1 or rocky 
flats could be forced to close the 364acre plant near denver is a 
vital link in the nations nuclear arms complex because it is the 
only maker of plutonium triggers for warheads 
watkins said he had not decided which states to approach the 
most likely candidates include colorado idaho new mexico nevada 
and washington which have some of the departments main weapons 
facilities the two other nearest states with nuclear weapons sites 
are texas and california 
radioactive waste equivalent to 49 boxcar loads about 4900 
cubic yards would have to find temporary storage over the next 
two years he said the amount could be even greater if further 
delays are encountered in completing the waste isolation pilot 
project near carlsbad nm 
the new mexico repository was scheduled to open a year ago but 
has been hampered by a series of environmental technical and 
regulatory problems 
watkins said he expected the problem of finding a temporary 
storage site for rocky flats waste to become a very contentious 
issue 
eddie binder a spokesman for new mexico gov garrey carruthers 
said the governors position had not changed 
theres no way ill accept any other waste than what is 
already in this state for temporary storage carruthers said two 
weeks ago 
the waste is contaminated with plutonium which remains 
radioactive for 240000 years and is generated at the rocky flats 
weapons plant the plant recovers plutonium from retired nuclear 
weapons and reprocesses it to make triggers for new ones 
idaho had been storing part of the rocky flats waste but gov 
cecil andrus closed his states borders sept 1 to further 
shipments to protest the energy departments failure to open the 
800 million waste isolation pilot project 
watkins said he had received a letter from washington gov booth 
gardner that said in essence dont look my way he added 
later however that he had received some informal indications 
from unspecified states that they might consider dropping their 
opposition if a multistate agreement was reached to spread the 
waste burden 
on a related subject an energy department study released 
thursday concluded that rocky flats which is under investigation 
by the fbi for possible criminal violation of environmental laws 
poses no imminent threat to public health 
the report raised doubts however about the accuracy of 
measured concentrations of plutonium in the air surrounding the 
complex it said the air samplers were outofdate prone to 
breakdowns and not properly located

declining tax revenues in northeastern states 
may spell economic trouble for the nation as a whole state 
officials said today 
growth of the national economy has helped the fiscal condition 
of many states said raymond g scheppach executive director of 
the national governors association 
but at the same time spending pressures on the states have 
continued to build he said citing increased costs from 
congressional action on catastrophic illness insurance medicaid 
and other programs 
scheppach said many states closed out fiscal 1989 with ending 
balances higher than the previous years because they anticipated 
economic slowdowns that did not occur 
scheppach spoke at a news conference as the governors 
association and the national association of state budget officers 
released their annual fiscal survey of the states 
the survey reported that total state ending balances in fiscal 
1989 were higher than in 1988 
it also showed however that many northeastern states often 
an index of trends in the national economy reported declining 
ending balances in 1989 and revenues below estimates 
the rapid decline in revenues in these states could portend 
downturns in other states the two groups said

general electric co has paid 4700 to five 
farmers whose fall harvests turned up parts of a jetliner that 
crashed at sioux city but a 50000 bounty remains for the part 
most sought by investigators 
the harvest is in full swing right now and theyre getting 
crops out and theyre able to see where they havent been able to 
see before buena vista county sheriff chuck eddy said 
officials of the national transportation safety board and ge 
hope missing parts will provide clues to why united airlines flight 
232 crashed july 29 the crash killed 112 people but 184 survived 
most of the parts turned in including three this week appear 
to be engine fan blades or pieces of blades said stephen gadd a 
lawyer representing ge the company made the cf66 tail engine that 
disintegrated before the crash 
many other pieces of engine were found immediately after the 
july 19 crash 
still missing is the 300pound titanium disk that held the 
blades the company is offering 278000 in rewards for the parts 
ranging from a 500 minimum to 50000 for the disk and has paid 
4700 gadd said 
investigators suspect the disk failed causing the engine to fly 
apart over western iowa a bit of metal from the disintegrating 
engine severed hydraulic lines causing the pilots to lose control 
they believe 
the chicagobound plane crashed during an attempted emergency 
landing after turning back to sioux city about 50 miles from here 
farmer john husman found what appeared to be part of a fan blade 
while running a combine through his soybean field about six miles 
north of alta 
it was pretty well mashed up he said it looked like it 
must have gone through an awfully big force 
husman said he found the part last friday but continued to 
harvest his crop until rain idled him on thursday he said the 
reward money is appreciated 
that would make up for some of the repair bills on the 
combine he said

donald trumps 7 billion buyout bid for american 
airlines has been greeted with skepticism by analysts who wonder if 
the billionaire developer is really looking for a quick buck 
through stock plays 
that seems to be a popular question said robert decker an 
analyst for the chicago investment firm duff amp phelps inc after 
americans parent company amr corp revealed trumps proposal 
thursday 
trump wrote amr chairman robert l crandall offering 120 for 
each of the 589 million shares of stock in the nations largest 
airline 
the deal would be the biggest airline takeover ever 
shares in fort worthbased amr closed 1687 higher at 9987 
in heavy trading thursday on the new york stock exchange other 
airline stocks also jumped in related speculation amr advanced 
further this morning to 10325 in heavy trading but that was 
still well below trumps offering price 
some in government concerned about high debt levels in the 
industry brought on by buyouts viewed the deal unfavorably 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas a member of the senate committee on 
commerce science and transportation called for the immediate 
adoption of legislation approved by the committee thursday that 
would require department of transportation approval of airline 
takeovers 
others called for the justice department to review the deal for 
antitrust violations because of trumps purchase in june of eastern 
airlines northeast shuttle since renamed the trump shuttle 
the amr bid followed weeks of speculation about airline 
takeovers much of it centered on profitable american which has 
about 22 percent of the domestic market 
trump said his offer would expire oct 20 amr said it would 
consider the proposal in due course 
but the airline added there has been no change in amrs 
policy and belief that amr and its shareholders will be best served 
by amr remaining an independent company and continuing the strong 
partnership among american airlines its employees the communities 
it serves and the public 
analysts said the companys response could involve selling 
assets including jets or its computer reservations system or 
searching for a friendly buyer to compete with trump 
trump said he was prepared to put up at least 1 billion in 
equity 
some of the concern over recent airline takeovers has focused on 
foreign participation susan heilbron executive vice president of 
the trump organization said trump has no foreign partners in the 
bid 
trump has accumulated stock in companies and suggested he 
planned takeovers only to sell out at a profit after the price 
rose on ensuing takeover speculation or when another bidder 
emerged analysts noted 
i think wall street is skeptical said analyst kevin burke 
who follows airlines for first union corp a bank holding company 
in charlotte nc 
one reason is trumps history he said he has a history 
of coming off better off in these deals than if the buyout had 
gone through 
besides the eastern shuttle which he bought for 365 million 
trumps empire consists of huge real estate holdings that include 
hotels office buildings and atlantic city nj casinos 
the recent wave of airline takeovers includes the 365 billion 
buyout of northwest airlines parent nwa inc and pending 675 
billion employeemanagement takeover of united airlines parent ual 
corp

a judge has denied randall dale adams request to 
clear state records of his 1977 capital murder conviction which 
was thrown out after the movie the thin blue line cast doubt on 
the evidence 
judge larry baraka said he denied the motion thursday because 
adams attorneys did not prove that he was wrongfully indicted 
we dont know if he did or didnt do it baraka said 
adams spent 12 years in prison after being convicted of the 1976 
fatal shooting of dallas police officer robert wood the jury had 
recommended adams be put to death but the sentence later was 
commuted to life 
earlier this year the texas court of criminal appeals ordered a 
new trial for adams after reviewing evidence mostly obtained 
through errol morris producer of the documentary movie 
adams had maintained his innocence and said the real killer was 
david ray harris who had provided investigators with clues that he 
said linked adams to the slaying harris withdrew his accusation in 
a court hearing last year and provided so many details about the 
case that baraka declared his statements a virtual admission of 
guilt 
after the appeals court ruling dallas county district attorney 
john vance dismissed the capital murder charge against adams 
saying his office lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute adams 
who now lives in ohio but erasing any record of the conviction 
required a separate ruling 
adams attorney george preston said he probably will file a 
motion for a new trial asking baraka to reconsider 
right now if he were even stopped on a traffic violation his 
arrest charge and conviction of capital murder would be accessible 
by the officer preston said

east germans hoping to flee to the west are 
politely denied entry to the us embassy in east berlin and 
only those who have normal business there are permitted to enter 
the state department says 
a press notice issued thursday night reinforced earlier us 
statements that the embassy is not equipped to grant waves of 
wouldbe emigrants extended sanctuary 
our embassy is not in a position to accommodate large numbers 
of people who want to sit there until other governments do 
something said richard boucher a state department spokesman 
eighteen east germans 10 adults and eight children 
voluntarily left the us embassy wednesday evening after a 31hour 
occupation that touched off an effort by dozens of others to try to 
get past east german police and into the building 
boucher said the east german government had given assurances 
that their desire to emigrate would be considered positively and 
that no reprisals would be taken against them also he said a 
woman pushed away by police from the entrance was given similar 
assurances 
we try to do what we can to express our humanitarian concerns 
for individuals as well as whole groups of people the us 
spokesman said 
but while asserting again american support for the right to 
travel boucher said it was worth remembering that the vast 
majority of east germans trying to emigrate wish to settle in west 
germany and not the united states 
the embassy that we have in berlin is of course not set up 
as a place where people can go boucher said we do not have 
the capability to handle even a limited number of people 
the us official also cautioned wouldbe east german emigrants 
that people potentially put themselves in a difficult situation 
with respect to their own government 
boucher said the advice was based on recent statements by the 
east german government that flocking to western embassies was no 
longer acceptable 
the notice to the press thursday night said visitors to the 
embassy were asked by us officials why they wanted to enter the 
building 
those who have normal embassy business are allowed to enter 
it said those who do not are informed that the us is unable to 
assist them on other types of matters they are politely denied 
entry no one is forced from embassy premises 
when hundreds of east germans tried to rush the fivestory stone 
building in downtown east berlin on wednesday the doors were 
slammed shut and east german police called in reinforcements about 
100 formed a line in front of the embassy 
boucher said the fact that thousands of east germans are trying 
to flee relfects a deep sense of dissatisfaction with their 
government 
he said the police were not requested by us embassy officials 
we deplore the manhandling of the crowd the spokesman said 
and the embassy has protested the stopping of people trying to 
visit it

phnom penh when it became clear that vietnams troops would be 
withdrawn by the end of september the officials said speaking on 
condition of anonymity

deliveries had increased this year 
in cambodia and afghanistan governments backed by moscow have 
lost the protection of armies from powerful neighbors and now face 
determined welltrained guerrilla movements 
moscow greatly increased the quantity and quality of munitions 
it sent to afghanistan after soviet troops completed their 
withdrawal earlier this year

from september 27 there does not remain a single vietnamese 
volunteer soldier in cambodia either army man adviser or military

resistance coalition including its strongest guerrilla army the 
khmer rouge which ruled cambodia from 1975 until ousted by vietnam

people starve to death in zaire what zaire are you talking about

thirteen nuns locked themselves into 
their henhouse for three hours friday to prevent health officials 
from slaughtering their flock of 5000 chickens 
the chickens at the our lady of the passion monastery 65 miles 
northwest of london were condemned to death by the ministry of 
agriculture on wednesday after a salmonella victim blamed them for 
her food poisoning 
an inspection found salmonella in the flock 
but the nuns led by americanborn mother catherine from 
erlanger ky said the birds were well cared for and not connected 
to any outbreak of salmonella poisoning 
the strain that was found in our chickens has been in chickens 
since 1913 mother catherine said friday no one has done 
anything about it because there was no real danger we will not 
allow the chickens to be slaughtered 
richard north a spokesman for the nuns said their action 
prevented the slaughter he added that the nuns relied entirely on 
income from the sale of eggs and that if the chickens were killed 
the convent might have to close 
they the ministry officials were formally and officially 
refused entry and that was why the slaughter did not take place 
said north 
but ministry officials said they could not proceed because they 
didnt have anywhere to dump the carcasses they said they would 
return 
the united kingdom egg producers association supported the nuns

antiabortion lawyers told a federal judicial 
panel today that the us supreme court cleared the way in july to 
reinstate a louisiana law making nearly all abortions illegal 
john baker a louisiana state university law professor told the 
three us district court judges that the july 3 decision upholding 
missouri abortion restrictions changed the way abortion cases can 
be reviewed by the court 
that means louisiana may ban abortions if it proves it has a 
compelling interest in protecting the unborn he said 
such an interest is already evident in state laws giving fetuses 
the right to such things as support payments said baker and 
jennifer schaye a lawyer for state attorney general william guste 
rachael pine an attorney for the prochoice side said there is 
no basis for lifting the 1976 federal court order that keeps 
louisiana from sending doctors to jail for performing abortions 
she said all nine supreme court justices agreed that the 
missouri case webster vs reproductive health services does not 
overturn roe vs wade the 1973 ruling establishing a womans right 
to abortion 
pine disagreed with bakers contention that webster changed the 
judicial standard for review of abortion cases and said the courts 
still must bar any law that unduly restricts a womans access to 
abortion 
if this law is not an undue burden on a womans right i dont 
know what is pine said 
baker countered that he wasnt asking the court to overturn roe 
vs wade but simply to set up a test case to see if louisianas 
interest in protecting the unborn would indeed be upheld by the 
us supreme court 
there was no indication when the judges will rule 
before the hearing about 70 demonstrators on the courthouse 
steps sang keep abortion safe and legal to the tune of the 
battle hymn of the republic a dozen antiabortion protesters 
arrived later and walked quietly in a circle 
new orleans district attorney harry connick spearheaded the 
effort to revive the antiabortion law shortly after the supreme 
court ruled on the missouri case guste joined the case later 
the action brought immediate protest from the national 
organization for women the aclu and other groups 
louisiana is a major battle ground said shirley peddler 
director of louisianas aclu chapter it is the first state to 
try to criminalize abortion even without grounds to do so

a top communist leader today urged a 
historic congress of his ruling party to effectively terminate its 
70year existence and start anew under a banner of democratic 
values 
party chairman rezsoe nyers also appealed to the 1279 congress 
delegates to rid the party of members opposed to sweeping change 
orthodox marxists and centrists who want to tinker with the system 
without scrapping it for a new one 
the historic role of the hungarian socialist workers party has 
reached an end here said nyers using the formal name of the 
communist party in a keynote speech on the opening day of the 
congress 
it is my belief that the new party cannot be communist said 
nyers he said the fledgling party should be a synthesis of the 
communist party and europeanstyle social democratic parties with 
a new name no longer mentioning workers to reflect its broader 
base 
nyers a moderate reformer occupies the middle of the political 
spectrum among the fourman leadership he echoed his more liberal 
coleaders imre pozsgay and premier miklos nemeth in calling for 
the removal of conservatives who cannot accept fundamental change 
but karoly grosz the most conservative member of the party 
leadership launched a veiled attack on pozsgay and nemeth both of 
whom have said they would rather see a party split than cooperate 
with orthodox marxists 
grosz said that alleged intolerance of unidentified party 
leaders toward differing opinions was reminiscent of old 
stalinist practices even if theyre covered with the sweet glaze 
of reformism 
the fourman leadership was formed in june in an attempt to 
bridge growing ideological differences within the party 
but the differing political persuasions of the leaders 
themselves led to growing estrangement at the top and grosz 
acknowledged major differences between him and his colleagues 
he also directly contradicted nyers formally the senior leader 
saying the party should not give up communist ideals and should 
keep the word workers in its name 
earlier reformist central committee member maria ormos evoked 
the memory of imre nagy the executed political leader of the 1956 
antistalinist revolution who for more than three decades had been 
branded a triator 
in its new reformist drive the party rehabilitated nagy early 
this year hailing him as a forerunner of current change ms ormos 
compared him to revered 19th century revolutionary leaders who 
fought for greater democracy 
nothing less than the political direction of hungary is under 
discussion at the congress which opened today and is scheduled to 
end sunday 
the reformist leadership wants to move toward a multiparty 
system and a market economy conservatives want a return to marxist 
orthodoxy 
the opposing stances have meant a growing polarization within 
the party 
conservatives say they will seek to oust reformist leaders 
reformists have called on supporters to cleanse the party of 
conservatives and just about the only issue both sides agree on is 
the possibility of a party split 
communist leaders and the political opposition have agreed there 
will be free elections by june but sentiment within the party 
against farreaching reform could doom such plans 
at times in recent months hungary has moved ahead of poland 
the only soviet bloc country not dominated by communists in its 
pace of reform but unlike hungary poland has been cautious not to 
offend its hardline warsaw pact partners 
hungary alienated three east bloc allies east germany romania 
and czechoslovakia with its liberal policies including its 
decision to allow east germans free passage to the west 
the orthodox marxists are joining critics from abroad they are 
angry about a central committee draft manifesto that proposed a 
radical change in the makeup of their communist party 
the 20page document prepared for the congress foresees a 
constitutional state based on a multiparty system in which the 
source of power is the will of the people manifested at free 
elections and an efficient market economy 
voting on the draft is a principal task of the 1200 delegates 
but they also face other tough choices such as electing party 
leaders a defeat of pozsgay or nyers would be a major setback for 
the reformists

a grassy plot of unmarked graves of indians 
who were consigned to an insane asylum early this century is 
getting new attention amid a growing national reburial movement 
activists plan a traditional ceremony saturday to promote 
respect for the cemetery long visited mostly by golfers who stray 
from a surrounding course 
golfers forget the cemetery exists there said harold iron 
shield an organizer of the event sometimes their balls are 
knocked into the cemetery they either tee off there or they walk 
on the graves 
it is not difficult to miss the cemetery the rectangular plot 
surrounded by hedges has neither a fence nor a gate a single 
concrete monument lists the names of all the dead but only two 
graves have individual markers 
about 120 patients died at the hiawatha asylum for insane 
indians during its operation from 19021934 as the nations only 
mental hospital for indians 
iron shield said organizers are trying to locate relatives of 
those who died at the asylum to see if they would want the remains 
returned to their home communities or to a national indian cemetery 
the patients came to this city about 20 miles south of sioux 
falls from all over the nation and from 50 tribes including 
cherokee comanche osage pawnee winnebago shoshone chippewa 
and sioux 
the smithsonian institutions recent decision to return indian 
remains in its custody to tribes has spurred interest around the 
nation in reburials 
a lot of tribes are beginning to develop reburial 
committees iron shield said theres a lot of interest in this 
issue 
he said he hoped that interest will help draw attention to the 
asylum patients whom he considers forgotten victims of racism and 
oppression 
many of the indian people that were sent there would be termed 
as resisters of government policies he said not wanting to 
live on the reservations not wanting to see the kind of treatment 
that indian people were receiving on reservations 
larry zimmerman a professor of anthropology at the university 
of south dakota in vermillion agreed that the legacy of the asylum 
was one of shame 
this particular case is a very poignant one he said the 
asylum was a convenient place to put political prisoners 
lloyd collier superintendent of the cityoperated hiawatha golf 
course said he wants to work with the indian group to encourage 
remembrance and respect for the cemetery 
theres 120 indians buried here and we shouldnt just forget 
them he said 
collier said the cemetery had fallen into disrepair when he took 
over the job several years ago 
the graves were caving in he said i thought i was going 
to break axle on the tractor when i filled them in and smoothed 
them over it had been neglected for too long 
collier has planted russian olive and ponderosa pine trees along 
the fairway to help keep balls out of the plot he also spreads the 
word that the cemetery is offlimits for play 
its just a rule here if you hit the ball in the cemetery 
you have to pick it up and move it out 
relatives and others are welcome to visit the cemetery to pay 
respects collier said 
id hate to have somebody tell me i couldnt see my mothers 
grave he said if they want to come in here and visit their 
ancestors they should have that right 
but zimmerman said relatives of the dead may believe removing 
the remains is the only way to achieve respect he said the golf 
course on the former asylum grounds where the doors to the 
clubhouse restrooms still are marked squaws and braves may 
stir painful memories 
reburial may be the only realistic solution he said

deregulation in the airline industry has led 
to domination of domestic air travel by a few companies two 
republican senators said friday in introducing legislation they say 
would increase competition 
sens john c danforth rmo and john mccain rariz said 
that deregulation has failed to benefit the traveling public 
despite an early flurry of competition but that their bill is not 
a return to regulation 
the bill would instead address what we consider the most 
egregious airline practices inhibiting competition mccain said 
the traveling public is not going to be dangling from the 
strings of a few huge airlines danforth said 
under their proposed legislation 
airlines would be barred from owning computerized reservation 
systems used by 85 percent of travel agents the sponsors say that 
the owners require agents to book a minimum number of the owners 
flights the system updates the owners fare and seat availability 
more quickly and other airlines without the systems must pay 
booking fees to use the system 
slots the landing rights at airports currently controlled by 
the major airlines would be auctioned off giving preference to 
new entrants in the industry 
the department of transportation would have a stronger say in 
assuring competition by monitoring activity in the industry using 
standards developed by the justice department for use in antitrust 
enforcement 
the transportation department would allow airports to levy 
perpassenger user fees earmarked for expanding airport capacity 
improving security or reducing the impact of airport noise 
the federal trade commission would be given authority to police 
the industry for unfair practices some of the practices would be 
predatory pricing overcharging for subleases of terminal space 
gates and baggage carousels and use of majorityininterest 
clauses in airport leases to restrict expansion 
airlines would be forbidden to share booking codes the 
initials for airlines for instance a flight from columbia mo

twa owned each airline would have a unique code danforth said 
which would facilitate competition for bookings among regional 
carriers 
mccain said the market share of the nations top nine airlines 
grew from 78 percent in 1985 to 94 percent in 1986 on the other

just when many chinese thought political study 
classes were winding down a new command has come down from the 
communist partys top levels study well comrade jiang zemins 
important speech 
jiang is the new party general secretary and he delivered the 
speech last week as the nation prepared to mark the 40th 
anniversary of communist rule 
it was an 80minute hardline lecture on the evils of western 
liberalism and the correctness of the june military attack in 
beijing on students and citizens protesting for greater freedom 
only socialism can save china jiang said replacement of 
capitalism with socialism is the great historical trend 
over the past week the party and chinas official media have 
praised the speech to a degree unprecedented for the words of 
anyone lower than senior leader deng xiaoping 
it is a programmatic document guiding the communist party of 
china in all its tasks in the near future the partys propaganda 
department said in the order 
the party newspaper the peoples daily said the speech 
crystalized the collective wisdom of people inside and outside 
the party and should be used to conscientiously raise the 
theoretical level and political acuteness of all party comrades 
many see the intense campaign as an effort to convey on ziang an 
aura of leadership that he lacks 
a party source said jiang is not at ease in his post the 
source speaking on condition of anonymity said jiang has been 
treading carefully since taking office in june in the aftermath of 
the protests trying to make peace with both the hardline and 
reformist camps of the fractured party and trusting few people 
he appears to have dengs full support but a government 
employee also speaking on condition of anonymity predicted that 
will count for little after the death of the senior leader who is 
85 and reportedly suffering from cancer 
jiang is only an interim leader the government worker said 
echoing a widespread opinion he is like hua guofeng 
hua took over as party and government leader after the death of 
mao tsetung in 1976 but lacked his own power base in beijing and 
had lost all his top posts by 1981 
jiang too has no beijing power base having spent most of his 
career in shanghai where he was party leader before june 
until this weeks calls to study his latest speech the level of 
official media coverage of jiang was normal for a party leader 
the new campaign goes beyond anything ordered under jiangs 
predecessor the nowdisgraced zhao ziyang at least in part 
reflecting the leaderships new concern with strengthening 
ideological education 
government ministries research institutes provincial and city 
governments military units and factories all have issued their own 
orders to employees to earnestly study the speech and build 
socialism under its inspiration 
half of national televisions 30minute nightly news program has 
been taken up showing groups hard at study following a 
timehonored ritual that starts with the group leader summarizing 
the correct line 
each participant then makes his own statement mostly using 
phrases from jiangs speech and newspaper editorials about it 
chinese who spent most of the summer studying a speech by deng 
condemning the prodemocracy protests are not heartened by the new 
campaign 
we are so tired of saying all this stuff one intellectual 
said with a groan

israels divided inner cabinet today rejected 
an egyptian peace plan calling for talks with a palestinian 
delegation in cairo 
after two days of debate the 12 leaders of the coalition 
government of the rightist likud bloc and the centerleft labor 
party voted along party lines and deadlocked 6 to 6 on the issue 
the tie vote automatically defeated a proposal by vice premier 
shimon peres head of labor to accept the egyptian invitation 
israel today suffered a severe setback said defense 
minister yitzhak rabin of labor 
all labor ministers in the policymaking inner cabinet voted to 
support the egyptian plan and all likud ministers voted to reject 
it peres and other labor ministers met immediately to discuss 
their next step 
police minister chaim barlev also of labor called for the 
party to leave the government but rabin said he first wanted to 
see the reaction of the egyptians and the international community 
we have a new political situation well convene our party 
institutions and decide about how we proceed peres said 
in cairo a senior plo official said israels rejection of the 
plan puts the middle east peace process on hold and that only the 
united states can solve that problem 
despite all efforts by egypt and president mubarak the 
intransigence of prime minister yitzhak shamir and his likud bloc 
takes us back again to stagnation said nabil shaath a key 
political adviser to plo chief yasser arafat 
the situation calls for movement by the united states because 
it holds the key to israel he said 
shaath a wealthy cairobased businessman chairs the political 
committee of the palestine national council the plo 
parliamentinexile he is considered a moderate and his name has 
been mentioned as a possible participant in peace talks 
many leaders of shamirs likud viewed the egyptian invitation 
involving meetings with palestinians from outside the occupied 
territories as a trick to get israel to talk indirectly to the 
palestine liberation organization 
avi pazner a senior aide to shamir said labor had been 
hasty in forcing a vote in the inner cabinet and that there was 
no reason for the yearold government to fall apart 
its not the end of the peace initiative and not the end of 
the government said pazner 
he added it was still possible that us secretary of state 
james a baker iii would propose a specific plan to decide on the 
makeup of a palestinian delegation to talks in cairo a compromise 
involving us help on the issue was discussed before the vote 
it is very possible we will get concrete american proposals 
and then we will consider them he said 
peres had questioned whether there was a firm us offer to hold 
threeway talks on the issue he pushed instead for egyptian 
president hosni mubaraks proposal to hold talks in cairo with a 
10member palestinian delegation that would include several 
palestinians from outside the west bank and gaza strip 
david levy a leading member of likud said the labor 
proposal was contradictory to the initiative accepted by the 
government 
the israeli government proposed on may 14 that elections be held 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip to select representatives 
to negotiate on autonomy for the 17 million palestinians of the 
territories 
levy said meeting with a palestinian delegation as proposed by 
egypt was unacceptable to likud because it was a backdoor attempt 
to hold talks with the plo 
the prime minister formulated it well when he said that if we 
adopt labors proposal we recognize the ploisrael would have 
walked into a trap said levy 
he said the government would continue with its election proposal 
speaking on israel radio before todays meeting peres accused 
shamir and likud of stalling and trying to evade peace negotiations 
every time we reach something practical there is a new 
attempt to get out of it a new story said peres he rejected 
likuds position of excluding outside palestinians from 
participating in the elections 
likud has no proposal it has one interesting offer to create 
a new palestinian people because its not satisfied with those in 
existence we are talking about negotiations with palestinians as 
they are in the field 
ariel sharon the trade minister and a leading likud hardliner 
urged rejection of the proposed talks in cairo before todays vote 
what worries me is that we are pushing ourselves into a trap 
in which we would stand alone against the arab world that supports 
the plo and against the united states which is our greatest 
friend sharon said on israels armed forces radio 
likud argued the presence of outside palestinians would 
implicitly recognize the plo and its demand to allow millions of 
exiled refugees to return to what is now israel 
some likud hawks such as yitzhak modai proposed breaking up the 
yearold coalition government if agreement could not be reached on 
the peace proposals but peres and shamir have indicated this would 
not happen 
israelis have killed more than 580 palestinians during the 
22monthold uprising against israeli rule of the west bank and 
gaza strip palestinians have killed more than 120 suspected arab 
collaborators and 40 israelis have died in the uprising

at least two burmese students hijacked 
a burmese airliner with 85 people aboard today and threatened to 
blow it up unless their countrys military government frees all 
political prisoners and restores democracy 
burmese ambassador nyunt swe went to the hijacking site and 
rejected the hijackers demands said a thai navy spokesman lt 
somchai kaewvibunphan 
the students forced the fokker 28 aircraft to land at a thai 
military airfield and held the passengers hostage said col 
somchai dhanarajata of thailands supreme command joint operations 
center 
one hijacker appeared in the door of the plane with a hand 
grenade in his upraised fist hijackers later released 35 hostages 
kaewvibunphan said 
in a list given to thai authorities the hijackers demanded the 
release of top burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi an end 
to the curfew imposed by the military government and restoration of 
democracy in burma 
they said they would detonate a bomb they had on board unless 
their demands were met by 11 pm noon edt kaewvibunphan said 
the deadline passed however as thai army negotiators talked with 
the hijackers 
earlier somchai said the hijackers had insisted on a response 
to their demands by midnight 
thai marines surrounded the aircraft of burmas national 
airline myanmar airways and a ustrained antihijacking unit 
from the thai air force was en route to the airfield he said 
the plane was returning from mergui to burmas capital rangoon 
when the hijackers ordered the pilot at gunpoint to divert to 
thailand burmas neighbor according to burmas official news 
agency the report said three hijackers were involved rather than 
two as reported by somchai 
the plane landed at 540 pm in utaphao 80 miles southeast of 
bangkok and the hijackers presented a list of demands to military 
officials at the airfield somchai said 
the plane carried 81 passengers and a crew of four the 
passengers were believed to be burmese nationals since mergui is 
offlimits to foreigners 
it was the first known hijack of a burmese aircraft in recent 
decades 
thailand has attempted to establish good relations with the 
military government in rangoon and has made several deals to 
exploit burmas abundant timber and fishery resources burmese 
student activists have criticized these links and want the 
international community to isolate the military government 
thousands of burmese students joined ethnic rebel groups along 
the thaiburmese border after burmese troops crushed a studentled 
uprising in burma in september 1988 killing thousands of people 
demonstrating against years of authoritarian repression 
the crackdown on dissent continued this year and a rangoon 
military tribunal recently sentenced three students to death for 
allegedly planting a bomb at an oil refinery near rangoon which 
killed two people in july 
the government blamed this and another explosion in july at 
rangoons city hall on students groups in contact with the 
insurgents 
diplomats and dissidents say several thousand prodemocracy 
supporters have been arrested since july when the two leading 
opposition politicians suu kyi and tin oo were placed under house 
arrest 
suu kyi whose release was demanded by the hijackers was 
arrested july 20 after making strident speeches denouncing the 
military government her national league for democracy has emerged 
as the largest opposition party in burma

jim bakker maintained his innocence and 
said he was sad but encouraged in god after a jury found the 
ptl founder guilty of using his television ministry to bilk 
followers of 37 million 
i went into this courthouse several weeks ago saying i was 
innocent of the charges against me a smiling bakker said after 
posting bond thursday i come out still innocent of the charges 
against me i put my faith in god 
today bakker and his wife tammy faye left for their home in 
orlando fla and their lawyer said they would suspend their 
ministry for the time being to concentrate on their appeal but a 
volunteer answering the telephone there who declined to give her 
name said she knew of no such plans 
the jury foreman said money corrupted bakker who prosecutors 
said took 37 million in ministry funds and spent it on vacation 
homes rollsroyce and mercedes cars and unusual luxuries like an 
airconditioned doghouse 
he was called by god but eventually the money became too much 
for him said ricky hill who said during jury selection that he 
was a christian we kept looking for something from the defense 
and we never saw it 
bakker faces up to 120 years in prison and 5 million in fines 
for his conviction on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy he was 
charged with raising 158 million by overselling lodging 
guarantees called lifetime partnerships at his heritage usa 
retreat 
the message is you cant lie to the people and use television 
and the mails to get them to send you money said prosecutor 
deborah smith a justice department fraud specialist it doesnt 
matter who you are or how well known you are you simply cant do 
it 
in an interview today on cbs this morning smith added i 
dont think any conviction is a cause for celebration at all i 
think its very sad for his family very sad for him but she 
said it was saddest for the 158000 people across the country who 
were defrauded many of them of their life savings 
bakkers attorney said he would appeal the verdict 
weve lost a battle but well win the war lawyer george t 
davis said there was so much negative pretrial publicity that he 
was unable to get a fair trial in this community 
davis said he would return to charlotte for the oct 24 
sentencing with a surprise for judge robert potter i think 
it will be a real suprise but i cant say now the big day is 
really when the sentencing comes 
he said the bakkers are going to fold up their ministry for 
the present and concentrate on the appeal but he declined to 
elaborate after leaving ptl the couple began the jim and tammy 
ministries which runs a church in orlando and conducts a 
fivedayaweek evangelistic television show seen on eight cable 
outlets 
the bakkers did not appear on the daily television show today 
and their replacements did not mention the verdict but closed by 
urging viewers to give your prayers to the bakkers 
bakker took off his glasses and stared straight ahead as the 
verdict was read mrs bakker sat quietly behind him her eyes 
welled with tears 
outside the courthouse mrs bakker serenaded a crowd of 
hundreds with a verse of on christ the solid rock i stand all 
other ground is sinking sand 
then she said its not over till its over 
along with supporters in the crowd were some spectators who 
agreed with the verdict 
im not the smartest man in the world but when you get caught 
with your hand in the cookie jar youve got to take whats 
coming ira bostic said 
later us district court judge robert potter released bakker 
on 250000 bond after expressing concerns that his followers might 
try to help him flee the country 
my concern is that his supporters are so zealous that they 
have what i call the jim jones mentality potter said referring 
to the cult leader who led hundreds of followers to commit suicide 
in guyana a decade ago 
they think he can walk on water he said of bakkers 
supporters 
potter known as maximum bob for handing out tough prison 
terms and fines scheduled sentencing for oct 24 
on his release bakker waded through a crowd of reporters to a 
waiting white cadillac and said i feel sad but encouraged in 
god 
trial testimony showed ptl paid 265000 to jessica hahn to 
cover up a 1980 sexual encounter with bakker that led to his 
resignation from ptl in 1987 
im sorry i dont have a song to sing like tammy but i know 
this is gods amazing grace ms hahn said after the conviction 
prosecutor smith called bakker the governments star 
witness saying his fraud had been preserved on videotapes of 
ptl club broadcasts in which bakker appealed for 1000 
donations in exchange for yearly stays at the retreat and theme 
park near fort mill sc 
the government said more than 152903 partnerships were sold 
between 1984 and 1987 when bakker had only 258 rooms available and 
some partners testified they were unable to use their lodging 
benefits although others testifying for the defense said they had 
no such problem 
just about every sentence he used he put god in it juror 
vivian ferguson said he kept taking the peoples money and i 
couldnt go along with that 
bakker was his own worst enemy on the witness stand juror 
dempsey jones said today on abcs good morning america 
his defense testimony was almost like a programmed speech 
jones sad but when he was crossexamined by the prosecution it 
was really damaging to him the halting answers to questions the 
obvious not looking at jurors and things like that 
the trial started aug 28 and was interrupted aug 31 when 
bakker didnt come to court his psychiatrist told the judge bakker 
was cowering in a fetal position with his head under a couch 
potter ordered bakker sent to the mental hospital at the federal 
prison at butner nc on sept 6 he was declared fit to resume 
the trial

predominantly black atlanta school have made her optimistic that 
the nations poor will see improved health care

morehouses mission of providing doctors for the poor mainly in 
innercity areas was a major reason for her optimism 
she said the schools student body is growing rapidly it has a 
95 percent passing rate on national board tests and it has never 
experienced an operating budget deficit

solve all the health problems but im optimistic she said 
she urged students to keep the schools mission of serving the 
poor in mind after they graduate our communities need your 
skills and commitment she said 
mrs bush said she wanted to dispel the widely held notion that 
she was responsible for getting the medical schools founder dr 
louis sullivan nominated as secretary of health and human services

and who came up with the idea of the cabinet nomination 
mrs bushs appearance at the school today kicked off a 
threeday series of events leading to sundays inauguration of dr 
james a goodman who will succeed sullivan as the schools

the agriculture department says it has ended a 
fourmonth testing program in 10 states for possible contamination 
of swine and poultry by the pesticide heptachlor 
lester crawford administrator of the departments food safety 
and inspection service said tests results show there is no 
contamination problem and that will will return to routine 
monitoring 
crawford said thursday that since the program began in may tests 
were run on more than 2100 hogs from 146 plants and nearly 1800 
poultry samples from 70 plants 
none showed any heptachlor residues except for an isolated 
case one hog in tennessee he said because of difficulties 
in tracing that hogs owner we continue to investigate that case 
the environmental protection agency in 1978 banned heptachlor 
for all agricultural uses except as a seed treatment because the 
pesticide had been shown to cause cancer in mice last may the epa 
banned heptachlor as a seed treatment 
but also in may illegal levels of heptachlor were detected in 
chickens at one poultry operation in arkansas crawford said the 
firm voluntarily destroyed more than onehalf million chickens and 
thousands of pounds of processed products 
as a consequence the usda agency set up an intensive 
testing program in arkansas and nine other states illinois 
kansas kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri oklahoma 
tennessee and texas to determine if the problem was widespread 
on july 10 the agency announced that no evidence of further 
contamination had been found however the testing was continued as 
a further check

the tax and mail fraud conspiracy 
conviction of lyndon h larouche jr was challenged friday in a 
federal appeals court as a rush job that violated the political 
mavericks due process rights 
but the prosecutor said larouches attorneys failed to show 
prejudice in the handling of the case 
larouche a political extremist who has espoused bizarre 
conspiracy theories that include allegations of drugdealing and 
other crimes by world leaders was convicted in december in us 
district court in alexandria on 11 counts of mail fraud one count 
of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to 
defraud the internal revenue service 
the trial of larouche and six associates stemmed from more than 
30 million in loans raised by larouches political supporters the 
government said larouche had no intention of repaying the loans and 
avoided taxes by reporting no income and having his personal 
expenses paid through corporations he controlled 
former attorney general ramsey clark chief attorney for 
larouches appeal told a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit 
court of appeals that trial judge albert v bryan jr allowed only 
35 days from arraignment to trial and once the proceedings began 
failed to adequately question jurors on how much they knew about 
larouche 
it was just an incredible rush clark said you just have 
to ask why 
the appeals panel did not rule immediately decisions from the 
court usually take from a few weeks to several months 
odin phillips anderson another lawyer for larouche said the 
defense chose not to antagonize bryan by requesting a delay but 
pushed to have the trial moved to boston where a similar case 
against larouche had resulted in a may 1988 mistrial the boston 
charges were dropped after the alexandria case was concluded 
larouche is 67 years old he said hes sentenced to 15 
years surely if this case isnt reversed its a death sentence 
us attorney kent s robinson ii said the substantial 
overlap in the boston and alexandria cases and the effort to move 
the trial showed that larouches lawyers were well acquainted with 
the issues before the court 
theres just no showing that the defendants lawyers were 
unable to try this case he said adding that government 
witnesses were thoroughly and extensively crossexamined 
robinson also said bryan was careful to prevent irrelevant 
information about larouches political views from getting into 
testimony he said the judge also questioned potential jurors about 
their awareness of news reports concerning larouche and those who 
showed bias were dismissed

lawmakers agreeing on a massive expansion of 
child care aid through tax credits and subsidies still must decide 
between competing proposals on how to divide up the subsidies 
its a good day for americas children rep pat schroeder 
dcolo said thursday as the house approved the child care 
measure which is expected to cost 227 billion over the next five 
years the congress is more enlightened than a lot of people 
thought she said 
the house overwhelmingly rejected a smaller 172 billion 
administrationendorsed child care plan that would have eliminated 
requirements for state regulation of child care providers the 
substitute offered by rep charles stenholm dtexas was defeated 
on a 230195 vote 
also rejected by a 285140 margin was an amendment by rep 
mickey edwards rokla mirroring bushs proposal last march to 
expand child care aid solely through tax credits 
democratic leaders refused to allow a vote on competing 
proposals on how to divide up some 175 billion in new direct 
subsidies instead they sent both to a conference with the senate 
which approved its own child care package last june 
the child care measure was included as part of a bill to reduce 
spending by nearly 11 billion in fiscal 1990 which began last 
sunday the overall bill with a variety of unrelated proposals 
such as a cut in capital gains tax rates and a repeal of the 
yearold catastrophic care program for the elderly was approved on 
a 33391 vote 
house republican whip newt gingrich of georgia predicted after 
the houses action thursday that bush would veto the entire bill if 
housesenate negotiators retain language specifying regulatory 
mandates and restricting aid for churchprovided child care 
both the senate version and one of the house versions target 
much of the aid toward establishing child care facilities in the 
public schools 
however the house also armed its negotiators with a version 
written by its ways and means committee to provide the 175 
billion in new direct subsidies over the next five years through 
existing entitlement block grants to the states 
that plan supported by governors as well as churches would 
allow the new aid to continue flowing to churchsupported child 
care centers through voucher programs 
stenholms measure would have dropped requirements that states 
inspect child care centers and provide 15 hours of annual training 
it also would have ended current child care tax deductions of up to 
2400 for families with incomes above 90000 
we believe the family is the best determiner of how child care 
should be provided not the federal government stenholm said in 
leading the attack on the proposed standards 
supporters of the proposed standards however argued that 
increasing the quality of child care is just as important as 
increasing its availability and reducing the cost of it to poor 
families 
the federal government has found it appropriate to regulate 
the type of food we eat so that our health is protected said 
rep thomas j downey dny clearly our health is important and 
so are our children they deserve the finest and the best care we 
can provide for them 
all the surviving proposals would double the size of the 
preschool head start program for poor children and convert it into 
a yearround 10hoursaday operation 
the bulk of the new aid 135 billion over the next five years 
is in the form of increased earned income tax credits for poor

an israeli officer wanted by colombia in 
connection with alleged training of drugcartel hit squads is 
offering americans a twoweek antiterrorism course that includes 
instruction in hostage rescue and sniper techniques 
but the chicagobased company which is recruiting for the course 
said friday that the first session scheduled to start in israel on 
nov 25 would probably be canceled because applicants so far lack 
the required experience 
ads which appeared in recent months in journals devoted to 
military and police issues described the israeli course as 
consisting of all phases of handson antiterrorism training 
ending with a helicopter assault to rescue hostages from builtup 
areas or from aircraft 
the training is being conducted by hod hahanit an israeli 
security firm run by reserve col yair klein colombia last month 
issued an arrest warrant for klein and for another israeli 
accusing them of training drug cartel hit squads 
klein told police investigating the case in israel that he 
trained colombian farmers to protect themselves against leftist 
guerrillas and was unaware of any connection to the countrys drug 
lords 
michael epstein who runs a security company called 
international association of airborne veterans ltd said his firm 
had received the franchise from hod hahanit hebrew for spearhead 
to run foreigners through the israeli antiterrorism training 
the course costs 3685 including round trip air fare from new 
york to tel aviv lodging meals and insurance according to the 
printed information issued by epsteins firm epstein said 15 
applicants had sent him deposits and their money would be refunded 
because most of them were not qualified 
he said the decision to scrap the first session was not 
connected in any way to the israeli police investigation of klein 
and several other officers involved in security work abroad 
the application form asks applicants about their military or 
police service their rank and awards they have received 
your physical condition must be superior according to the 
ads 
the course is the most comprehensive and professional in the 
world today the israelis are the number one in the world today for 
terrorist prevention protection and hostage rescue 
according to the ads 
klein is at the top of a list of seven israeli instructors all 
of them reserve officers with ranks ranging from major to major 
general 
the list of courses includes lectures on antiterrorism combat 
submachine gun use sniper training in daylight or at night and 
familiarization with sovietmade weapons such as ak47 rifles and 
rocketpropelled grenades 
there is also a course in driving techniques including shooting 
from and at a vehicle employment of helicopters combat in 
builtup areas and rappelling 
other classes include hostage negotiations endurance training 
and classified training not to be published the ads do not 
elaborate on the last item

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev urged east 
germans today to be patient for change as he helped observe 40 
years of a communist system that thousands of east germans have 
rejected by fleeing west 
the kremlin chief said he had complete confidence in east 
germanys ability to solve its growing problems 
communist authorities closed three major border crossings 
between east and west berlin and church sources said riot police 
with clubs tear gas and water cannons patrolled the streets of 
major cities throughout east germany 
the sources also reported new clashes between police and 
protesters and west german television showed battles in dresden 
between police and protesters hoping to join the exodus of refugees 
be patient dont panic and dont be sad we are very close 
partners and we will solve our problems and struggles together 
gorbachev told 1000 east germans at a monument for the victims of 
facsism 
gorby gorby east germans shouted as gorbachev arrived from 
moscow 
asked if he thought the situation in east germany was dangerous 
he said i dont think so 
compared to our problems there is no comparison he said 
with a chuckle nothing surprises us anymore 
we have complete confidence in east germanys ability to 
solve its problems he said 
gorbachev joined other east bloc leaders for a twoday show of 
unity despite fractured relations over the refugee flight and east 
germanys reluctance to try the type of political reforms he has 
championed 
east german leader erich honecker welcomed gorbachev at east 
berlins schoenefeld airport the state news agency adn said 
gorbachev later planned to address communist party dignitaries 
also today a train brought 633 east german refugees from poland 
to west germany the latest of more than 47000 citizens who have 
fled this tightly controlled society to the west since 
midseptember 
there were efforts to avoid further embarrassment to the east 
berlin government authorities closed three of the nine busiest 
border crossings into the city turning back hundreds of tourists 
and west germans since thursday said werner thronicker a 
spokesman for the west berlin government 
east berlin the site of anniversary events was bedecked with 
the fixtures of socialist celebration huge red banners were draped 
from the communist party headquarters reviewing stands were set 
for parades and flags hung from public buildings and apartment 
blocks 
kiosks were plastered with posters showing construction workers 
and young mothers appreciating accomplishments of the postwar 
republic founded on oct 7 1949 
but the image of the east germans who fled to the west through 
czechoslovakia hungary and poland was broadcast nationwide by west 
german television 
the west german government said it saw no reason for 
celebration since the date marks four decades of the division of 
the german nation it also criticized the latest developments in 
east germany 
the blocking of borders the sending back of tourists the 
violent supression of peaceful demonstrations and the officially 
declared rejection of political and economic reforms takes away all 
hope from the people chief government spokesman hans klein said 
in bonn 
and on thursday as the ailing 77yearold honecker prepared for 
festivities meant to show the virtues of strict doctrine thousands 
of wouldbe emigrees clashed with police in dresden west germanys 
zdf television network said young demonstrators threw stones at 
security forces on thursday and dozens of windows were broken at 
dresdens train station 
witnesses said police used water cannon and truncheons to 
disperse those who hoped to jump aboard trains carrying east german 
refugees westward from prague 
in magdeburg north of leipzig police clashed with 600 people 
who joined a silent march through the city after a church prayer 
service late thursday said church sources in east berlin about 
200 people were arrested 
riot police equipped with clubs tear gas shields and water 
cannons patrolled the streets of many major cities throughout the 
country said the sources who demanded anonymity 
those who left said 40 years had created a country ahead of its 
east bloc neighbors in consumer goods but behind in the less 
tangible measures of opportunity 
they described a nation where communist party loyalty determined 
education and employment censorship concealed truth and police 
supervision was a part of daily life many hid from television 
cameras fearing relatives left behind would be harassed 
i cannot say i was ever wanting for food or things thats why 
it was so hard said a young east berlin woman who reached the 
west german embassy in warsaw with her 2yearold daughter but 
there was nothing else just limits 
gorbachevs attendance at the celebration is viewed as a formal 
show of support for east germany which has rebuffed the economic 
and political reforms sweeping much of eastern europe 
although he did nothing to censure the warsaw pact allies who 
served as springboards to freedom for the refugees it was not 
likely he would criticize honecker who some say is likely to be 
replaced soon as communist party chief 
but there were reports gorbachev might privately pressure east 
germanys aging leader to ease his resistance to reforms 
unrest within east germany along the east blocs frontier with 
the west is unacceptable to the soviets 
it is equally unacceptable for disagreements between east 
germany and hungary which allowed thousands pass to the west to 
develop into an open split that might weaken the alliance 
gorbachev has stated that the eastern european allies may follow 
their own path to socialism the soviets have watched quietly as 
hungary reforms its economy and poland experiments with the blocs 
first noncommunist government 
a west german newspaper bild said today that gorbachev would 
try to persuade east berlin to ease press censorship permit 
greater freedom of expression and loosen travel restrictions 
other western reports said gorbachev and his foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze quietly helped arrange the exodus of east 
german refugees from prague over the weekend

coastal areas damaged by hurricane hugo may be 
facing a new threat from slightly higher than normal tides next 
weekend 
the combination of a full moon and the moons nearness to earth 
will conspire to raise the tide a couple of feet above average the 
national ocean service reported 
aiding in this is the fact that the moon will be at its closest 
point of the year 
but weather is a much bigger factor than the moons alignment 
pointed out milt rutstein of the ocean service a division of the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
as long as theres no storm its just another high tide 
said rutstein 
average high tide at charleston sc is 53 feet explained 
rutstein while the prediction calls for high tides of between 70 
feet and 73 feet on oct 1416 
however strong northwest winds could drive the tides back out 
to sea while a strong southeast wind could pile up even more water 
and increase the threat he pointed out the most important 
consideration will be the weather on those days 
similar tidal circumstances are expected to occur in november 
and again in april 
causing the high tide will be the fact that the moon is at 
perigee at the same time it is full rutstein explained 
the orbit of the moon is not perfectly round but rather oval 
shaped perigee is the time of the month when the moon is closest 
to earth and that closeness allows it to exert greater pull on the 
oceans 
perigee will occur shortly after midnight oct 15 rutstein said 
leroy doggett of the us naval observatory reported that at 
that time the moon will just over 221000 miles from earth thats 
the closest the moon has come so far this year although doggett 
said slightly closer passes are possible 
its enough i think to make a difference compared to the 
month before and after the perigee in september for example 
found the moon 1500 miles farther away 
and in november when high tides are again expected with the 
full moon and perigee occurring one day apart the moons perigee 
will be about 300 miles farther away than this month 
besides the perigee the fact that the full moon occurs late on 
the 14th also encourages the high tide said rutstein 
the highest tides called spring tides occur every 14 days 
when the moon is new and full new moon occurs when the moon is on 
the same side of earth as the sun and the two pull together on the 
oceans full moon means the moon is on the opposite side of earth 
from the sun and the two pull against one another 
lower tides called neap tides occur when the sun and moon are 
at right angles to one another

the senate today defeated a plan that would 
have killed catastrophic health coverage for physicians fees and 
repealed the unpopular surtax on retirees that finances most 
benefits under the program 
the amendment by sen edward m kennedy dmass would have 
retained insurance coverage for catastrophic hospital and 
prescription expenses it was defeated on a 6435 vote 
other plans for significantly changing the catastrophic program 
would drop coverage for prescriptions kennedy said 54 million 
people had to bear catastrophic health costs because of 
prescriptions last year compared to 13 million because of 
hospital bills and 23 million due to physicians fees 
nobody has any information on how much this drug program 
will cost protested sen william roth rdel he noted estimates 
that administration of drug benefits will cost 2 billion a year 
kennedy and sen john mccain rariz sponsor of a plan that 
would retain coverage for physicians fees and hospital costs but 
not drugs agreed on one point the surtax on retirees should be 
eliminated 
the surtax is the object of the anger and ire of senior 
americans mccain said 
in addition to repealing the surtax which is paid by about 40 
percent of retirees mccains amendment would wipe out coverage for 
prescription drugs and expanded coverage for physicianss fees 
while retaining full coverage of hospital bills 
senate leaders are rallying behind a plan by sen david 
durenberger rminn that would keep more benefits of the program 
wipe out drug coverage and significantly reduce but not repeal 
the surtax which is paid by higherincome retirees 
but there is considerable support for outright repeal 
durenbergers proposal was embraced thursday by health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan who said the rush for repeal 
is shocking but a short time later richard g darman 
director of the white house office of management and budget said 
the administration has not endorsed any specific plan to salvage 
the program 
the senate was expected to decide the programs fate today the 
house already has voted by a lopsided margin to repeal it 
sullivan in a speech to the national press club and in a letter 
to sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee said repeal would represent a major setback to national 
health policy 
to take back from tens of millions of elderly americans the 
comfort of knowing that serious illness will not cause them 
financial ruin would not only be unwise health policy but would 
simply be an unforgivable act of political expedience sullivan 
told the press club 
congress is considering repealing or scaling back the program 
because of loud complaints from its intended beneficiaries the 33 
million retirees who are eligible for medicare 
the program is being attacked by some retirees who already have 
other catastrophic coverage and from some with higher incomes who 
must pay an income surtax of up to 800 a year to finance coverage 
for themselves and lowincome older americans 
durenberger said his proposal would provide seniors with the 
equivalent of 4000 worth of private medigap insurance coverage at 
a cost of between 48 and 300 per year 
his amendment had the support of bentsen senate majority leader 
george j mitchell dmaine and republican leader bob dole of 
kansas 
the catastrophic law expanded medicare benefits to protect 
retirees against being wiped out financially by a long illness 
this protection includes full coverage of hospital bills after 
the beneficiary pays the first 560 full coverage of doctors 
bills after the first 1370 a year starting in 1990 half of 
prescription drugs after a 600 deductible starting in 1991 150 
days a year of nursing home care plus other benefits for 
mammography home care hospice care and special payments for the 
poor 
the program is financed chiefly by a surtax of up to 800 a year 
on the wealthiest 40 percent of retirees who pay at least 150 
federal income tax the remaining cost is covered by a flat monthly 
premium of 4 paid by all but the poorest retirees 
durenbergers proposal would retain full hospital coverage 
delay starting full coverage of doctors bills until 1991 and then 
require the patient to pay the first 1780 a year eliminate 
coverage for most drugs require a beneficiary to spend three days 
in a hospital before qualifying for skilled nursing care and 
retain most of the lesser benefits including mammographies 
respite care and home health care 
the 800ayear maximum surtax would be held to 200 this year 
and next then raised to 250 for the following three years the 
current surtax rate of 15 percent of income tax liability would be 
cut to 10 percent for five years 
the additional catastrophic drug premium of 90 cents a month 
rising to 302 by 1993 would be eliminated

the nations top military leaders told 
senators today they would not have changed their advice to 
president bush based on what they now know about the circumstances 
of tuesdays failed coup in panama a lawmaker said 
defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff testified for three hours in closed 
session with the senate intelligence and armed services committees 
the two panels planned to issue later today a factual analysis 
of issues that remain in dispute surrounding the events in panama 
and contacts between the rebel officers who organized the coup and 
us officials 
there are a lot of things in dispute said armed services 
committee chairman sam nunn dga referring to media and other 
accounts which he said are all over the lot he declined 
further comment 
but sen john warner rva said cheney and powell basically 
would not have changed their decision and recommendations to 
the president based on what they know today 
sen david boren dokla the intelligence committee chairman 
and a leading critic of administration handling of the crisis said 
he had not changed his mind following the briefing he again 
criticized what he called a flawed policy in panama 
were going to get to the bottom of this boren said in 
advance of the hearing i am convinced the full facts have not 
been laid out to us or the american people 
among the mysteries surrounding the coup boren said in an 
interview is exactly what was said in a conversation tuesday 
afternoon between two midlevel rebel officers and an american 
officer army gen marc cisneros at a us military base in panama 
it is clear the senator said that the rebels asked the united 
states to provide logistical support by blocking roads and bridges 
that might be used by troops loyal to noriega to approach the 
panamanian defense forces headquarters where the dictator was then 
being held by the dissidents 
but whether they also offered to turn over noriega to the united 
states remains unclear he said adding it appears that differing 
versions of the conversation were given to the national security 
council the cia and the state department 
one version reports that the rebels said they were unable to 
deliver noriega to the us base but would cooperate if a us 
helicopter were sent to remove him the other version portrayed the 
rebels as refusing to turn the dictator over to the united states 
saying they wanted him to retire and remain in panama 
i want to see those cables and compare them boren said i 
think theyve got a lot of explaining to do he said he may 
schedule hearings and put some people under oath 
despite cheneys efforts to explain administration actions and 
detail the uncertainty that pervaded tuesdays situation members 
of congress in both parties continued to criticize 
sen alfonse damato rny called the administrations story 
a weakkneed explanation for failure and said the united states 
had botched the handling of the coup its an incredible 
stain on us he said 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he doubted 
administration assertions that noriega was left weakened by the 
coup attempt it seems to me that he is emerging from this 
perhaps unfortunately strengthened foley said 
cheney in a round of media interviews and in meetings with 
members of congress defended the administrations caution as the 
only responsible course in the face of incomplete intelligence and 
suspicions about the identities and motives of the rebels 
he said the coup leaders had made only general requests for 
support and called hogwash any suggestion that there was a 
direct appeal for the united states to snatch noriega away 
but in a speech on the senate floor sen jesse helms rnc 
contended the requests for help had been more extensive and more 
specific 
they told the us officers that they were holding noriega 
captive and requested us assistance to take custody of noriega 
and remove him to the united states helms alleged 
boren said helms information which came from staff inquiries 
had some basis to it 
helms made his comments during debate on an admittedly symbolic 
amendment to a drug bill that underscored bushs authority to use 
military force to apprehend noriega and bring him to justice on 
drug charges 
the amendment was later killed 7425 after sen robert byrd 
dwva termed it the officially sanctioned snatching 
provision 
the senate then adopted 991 an alternative proposed by sen 
sam nunn dga expressing support for bushs efforts to 
democratize panama through a full range of economic diplomatic 
and military options sen mark hatfield rore was the lone 
dissenter

pope john paul ii told ukrainian catholic 
bishops he hopes to travel to the soviet union to attend a 
religious gathering in 1992 ukrainian church officials said friday 
the pope expressed the desire to go to the ukraine in a private 
audience thursday with a group of ukrainian catholic bishops living 
in the west according to two american bishops at the meeting 
in his public remarks to the bishops thursday the pope urged 
soviet authorities to grant immediate legal status to the ukrainian 
church which has been suppressed 43 years 
the pope is expected to raise the ukrainian issue during soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs visit to italy on nov 29dec 1 it 
would be the first meeting between supreme leaders of the roman 
catholic church and the kremlin 
bishop basil h losten of stamford conn and bishop robert m 
moskal of parma ohio told a news conference the ukrainian 
catholic church hopes to hold a eucharistic congress in lvov 
ukraine in 1992 
a eucharistic congress is a gathering of the faithful to foster 
devotion to the sacrament of the altar 
the meeting is currently scheduled to be held in winnipeg 
canada but the bishops said it would be moved to lvov if the 
church is legalized and if soviet authorities grant visas to 
ukrainian catholics living abroad 
the holy father expressed his desire to be present at the 
eucharistic congress should it be held in ukraine losten said 
adding it would be up to the head of the ukrainian church 
vaticanbased cardinal myroslav lubachivsky to invite him 
the pope has often expressed his desire to travel to the soviet 
union but only on condition he could visit his flock throughout 
the country including ukraine and lithuania 
some church officials have expressed hope that a meeting with 
gorbachev could pave the way for the first papal visit to the 
soviet union 
the ukrainian church was forcibly merged with the russian 
orthodox church in 1946 with bishops and priests arrested 
deported and killed but the church has flourished underground and 
the bishops estimated there are as many as 5 million catholics in 
the ukraine today 
moskal said the bishops who have been holding a special 
twoweek synod in rome hope the popes meeting with gorbachev will 
lead to the churchs legalization 
but he added here and there you hear of soviet authorities 
not bothering the people in one village or town and then in 
another place the people are continually harassed and persecuted 
so we still feel pessimistic about a lot of things

president bush entered the hospital friday for 
minor surgery to remove a troublesome cyst from his finger 
bush arriving at walter reed army medical center a few miles 
from the white house smiled and waved at reporters as he stepped 
out of his helicopter 
he raised the hand that was to be operated on for photographers 
as he entered the hospital for the onehour procedure 
making light of the matter the day before the surgery bush had 
laughed over it and told reporters not to make a federal case of 
it 
the operation required a local anesthetic called a digital nerve 
block and aides said the president would be awake throughout 
the procedure was considered routine and bush planned to leave 
from the hospital friday afternoon to spend the weekend at the 
presidential retreat in camp david md 
the white house identified the surgeons as col allen smith 
chief of hand surgery at walter reed and george bogumill who 
holds a similar position at gerogetown university hospital 
bush has had the cyst on the middle finger of his right hand for 
several years but it recently came to the point of being 
bothersome said whtie house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
the spokesman told reporters the cyst was not really painful 
but its a nuisance in the sense that its large enough to cause 
him some anxiety 
doctors had drained the cyst on may 10 when bush underwent a 
routine physical examination the doctors said it had been present 
for several years and did not pose a medical problem for the 
65yearold president 
in recent weeks bush who is lefthanded has been playing 
golf tennis and horseshoes and baiting fishhooks as well as 
signing proclamations with no apparent difficulty from the cyst 
fitzwater said the the cyst was considered benign but that 
there would be a routine pathological examination of the tissue 
to verify that afterward 
the cyst was described as a quarterinch in diameter rising 
about an eighth of an inch above the surface of the finger with a 
root that extended under the skin back toward the finger joint 
the president jokingly told reporters dont tempt me when 
asked to display the finger in question for cameras and 
photographers during a pphoto session thursday with angolan rebel 
leader jonas savimbi he then explained to savimbi that the finger 
is sometimes used for an obscene gesture 
bush promised reporters i will show you my scar afterward 
bushs doctors say he is in very good health and exceptionally 
good condition for his age as evidenced by his propensity for 
vigorous sports and his often tightlypacked work schedule 
he had a basal cell skin cancer removed from his face and a 
small noncancerous polyp removed from his colon in 1986 when he 
was vice president

the cyst that grew on the middle finger of 
president bushs right hand may have started from some minor 
forgotten injury that happened during a game of tennis or 
horseshoes or while he stalked the wily trout or bluefish 
surgeons called the benign growth a mucous cyst or ganglion 
these cysts usually occur as did the presidents between the last 
joint and the finger nail they are not painful and usually dont 
affect the function of the finger but mucous cysts are susceptible 
to infection that can be quite serious 
ganglions or mucous cysts are the most common form of benign 
little tumors that occur in the hand said dr mary h mcgrath a 
hand surgeon at george washingtion university medical center 
they are associated generally speaking with some sort of 
injury often trivial 
bush she said is very characteristic of the people who get 
mucous cysts because he is active and plays sports 
the cysts are filled with a clear jellylike material that is 
the same as the fluid that lubricates joints she said the small 
growths are never malignant but doctors usually recommend that 
they be removed 
one of the bad things about these cysts is that they arise 
from the joint and consequently if they break and get infected 
the person can get an infection in the joint at the end of the 
finger said mcgrath such an infection is very hard to clear 
up and can sometimes result in amputation 
its very common for people to have no idea what the cyst is 
and they drain it themselves she said that can lead to big 
problems 
often these cysts can press against the bed of the fingernail 
leading to a groove or some other deformity in the nail 
mcgrath has not examined bush and is not personally connected 
with his case but she said the typical removal of a mucous cyst is 
a safe but meticulous procedure that takes just over an hour 
first the finger is deadened with what is called a digital 
nerve block this is done by shooting an anesthetic into a nerve in 
the hand wrist or arm then an incision is made 
you go in through the skin on the back of the finger and peel 
out the cyst she said then you follow the stalk back to the 
joint 
the stalk or root of the cyst must be removed or the growth 
could recur 
after that the skin is sewn back together and the finger is 
bandaged often a splint is worn until the stitches are removed 
about a week after surgery 
recovery is usually complete and uneventful she said which 
means the president may be back on the tennis court or pitching 
horseshoes again within a short time

a fire blamed on careless smoking struck a 
nursing home while patients were going to sleep killing nine 
people and injuring nearly 100 as rescuers rushed dazed patients to 
safety through halls flooded with choking smoke 
the elderly evacuees some in bedclothes and some naked when 
they were saved were helped down halls and down ladders as 
firefighters tackled the thursday night blaze in the 172bed 
hillhaven rehabilitation and convalescent center 
capt herbert redfield chief of the citys fire investigation 
unit said in a statement today that careless use of smoking 
materials was the cause of the fire which broke out about 1020 
pm one of the victims major leary lived in the secondstory 
room where the fire broke out along with another man who survived 
redfield said 
as the fire at the fourstory brick home was being put out early 
today patients huddled on the lawns of nearby houses attended by 
paramedics and neighbors 
the fire was mostly contained to the room where it began but 
smoke spread throughout and many of the injured suffered from 
smoke inhalation said norfolk fire chief thomas e gardner 
even though we lost nine people the potential was there to 
lose significantly more than that gardner said 
i woke up in a roomful of smoke said patient robert bell 
82 the whole room was saturated with smoke you couldnt see and 
you couldnt hardly breathe 
gardner said the nursing home did not have any sprinklers but 
said they were not required when the home was built in 1969 he 
said he hoped the fire would inspire lawmakers to require 
sprinklers 
i personally advocate that you dont build anything in the 
city that you dont put sprinklers in gardner said today im 
hoping this will cause the legislators to help make a modification 
to the building code that would require a sprinkler system in at 
least buildings of this occupancy class 
he also said the rescue efforts were hampered by the fact that 
many patients were hooked up to all sorts of medical equipment 
the nine residents eight women and one man ranging in age from 
65 to 97 died of smoke inhalation said deborah myers a 
spokeswoman for sentara norfolk general hospital 
the 98 people taken to eight hospitals suffered smoke inhalation 
and minor burns officials said twenty of people were admitted to 
sentara norfolk general including six in critical condition ms 
myers said the rest were treated and taken to other nursing 
facilities 
the fire was extinguished after midnight 
secondfloor resident harriett waddill 76 described the

state governments facing current or potential 
declines in revenues are being asked by congress to spend billions 
on social programs and will have to dip into their reserves cut 
other spending and raise taxes state officials said friday 
in their annual fiscal survey of the states the national 
governors association and the national association of state budget 
officers said many northeastern states ended fiscal 1989 with 
balances smaller than they enjoyed at the end of the previous year 
many other states closed out the year with ending balances 
higher than before because they had anticipated economic slowdowns 
that did not occur the two organizations of state officials said 
neverthless their report said the states of the populous 
northeast are often a harbinger of things to come in the economy as 
a whole and the rapid decline in revenues in these states could 
portend downturns in other states 
raymond g scheppach executive director of the governors 
association said that early indications are that a number of 
states in the northeast are not seeing any revenue growth at all 
in the first three months of fiscal year 1990 
the fiscal year ends on june 30 in 46 states on march 31 in new 
york on aug 31 in texas and on sept 30 in michigan and alabama 
scheppach said programs for catastrophic medical care will cost 
states an estimated 42 billion over the next four years despite 
repeal and cutback measures currently being considered in congress 
he said changes in nursing home laws enacted in 1987 will cost 
states an estimated 2 billion 
if medicaid revisions being considered become law states will 
have to find an additional 112 billion to pay for them over the 
fouryear period he said 
they congress still want to do a lot of things and the dont 
have any money and we are probably the easiest place to shift it 
to scheppach told reporters 
i think in general what happens is when you get the mandate 
you do one of two things he said you cut other programs 
andor you raise taxes to cover it 
the report said that in 1988 30 states had ending balances 
greater than the 5 percent of expenditures that is generally 
recommended as a safeguard against a downturn in the economy 
only 25 states had balances of this size in 1989 and 19 will in 
fiscal 1990 the report said 
it said the total funds available to the 50 states at the end of 
the 1990 period will be less than 10 billion or 35 percent of 
expenditures 
even though the states will have to dip into their reserves in 
1990 their spending growth will decline from 89 percent in 1989 
to 77 percent in 1990 the two organizations said 
they said 19 states plan to increase spending by 10 percent or 
more in 1990 but 13 states would be increasing it by less than 5 
percent 
state revenues overall will increase by an estimated 55 
percent compared to 83 percent in 1989 reflecting an assumption 
that national economic growth will slow the report said

throwing fire ants wouldnt have been 
much of a spectator sport admittedly but why rubber chickens 
you get the humane society on you if you use symbols of 
lovable pets and tossing rubber frogs would be too much like kermit 
and would upset the kids said harris county district judge 
bonnie leggat she is chairwoman of the chickenthrowing event 
expected to be a highlight of the seventh annual fireant festival 
oct 14 
we havent got any complaints she said apparently 
chickens are not thought of too fondly by anybody after all 
chicken little was a dingbat 
the sport originally was conceived as an exhibition between 
local politicians two years ago 
we found out they could throw bull but not chicken said 
george smith publisher of the marshall newsmessenger and one of 
organizers of the festival which has been growing every year and 
is expected to have an attendance of 50000 this year thats 
people not ants 
the chickens regulation rubber imports from taiwan have been 
made more aerodynamic by stuffing them with old pantyhose thus 
answering the ageold question of which came first the chicken or 
the leggs 
rigid rules require contestants to throw the chickens like a 
football 
we wont let them fling them around like a discus because 
their necks pop off and pantyhose goes flying anywhere ms 
leggat said 
mike whitworth of marshall holds the chicken toss record of 109 
feet 6 inches set in 1987 he revealed his winning technique 
if you get its little beak up in the wind then that little 
sucker can sail 
this years festival also includes a fire ant calling contest a 
beverage coaster throw a facemaking contest and the texas open 
diaper derby a 26foottall anteater balloon will make its debut 
this year

this weekend 
jager of douglasville is to be named freethinker of the year 
by the freedom from religion foundation a 3400member group based 
in madison wis 
jagers son doug sued the county school system in 1986 to halt 
prayers before douglas county high school football games after he 
won before the 11th us circuit court of appeals and the us 
supreme court refused to hear the case in may many school systems 
stopped pregame prayers 
the elder jager 53 said he would never have forced the issue

reciting the prayers when school officials did not address his 
concerns jager suggested that his son sue 
the elder jager later became active in the freedom from religion 
foundation founded in 1978 to work to keep church and state

liberal communists and their more 
orthodox counterparts clashed friday at a historic party congress 
with reformers calling for an end to orthodox communism and their 
rivals emphasizing loyalty to past values 
by deciding how much their party should change delegates at the 
fourday congress will influence the political future of hungary 
with its commitment to free elections by next year the country is 
along with poland at the forefront of reform in the soviet bloc 
while reformists seek to discard orthodox marxist concepts in 
favor of a democratic party that can compete in a multiparty 
system the conservatives only want to modify existing beliefs and 
structures 
we must say goodbye to the political mummies who refuse to 
accept change said attila agh a leader of the rankandfile 
reformist faction at the congress 
the old is no longer viable the present is stagnating and 
the new is just being born he said 
the agreement between opposition groups and the mostly 
reformminded communist leadership to hold the countrys first free 
elections in 47 years could be endangered if conservatives slow 
fullfledged liberalization 
they could do so by persuading delegates to vote for 
traditionalists instead of reformists in key party posts and by 
turning down draft documents outlining a new liberal party as a 
replacement for the traditional communist model 
sounding the reform theme in a keynote address party chairman 
rezsoe nyers urged the 1279 delegates to effectively terminate the 
70yearold party and replace it with one based on democratic 
values 
the historic role of the hungarian socialist workers party has 
reached an end here said nyers using the formal name of the 
communist party 
it is my belief that the new party cannot be communist said 
nyers he said that instead it should combine communism with social 
democratic beliefs such as those of european leftist parties or 
the british labor party 
nyers did not expand on this and other reformists told 
reporters the definition of democratic socialism still had to 
be debated by the congress 
a central committee draft document made available to reporters 
said democratic socialism would mean the party would support 
a multiparty system 
referendums and other instruments of direct democracy 
prevention of excessive centralization of power 
a freely elected parliament 
election of a president strenthening the balance between 
different branches of power and of a government responsible to 
parliament 
nyers a moderate reformer has attempted to bridge differences 
between conservative and liberal colleagues since a fourman party 
leadership was formed in june to try to respond to growing 
ideological rifts 
his comments appeared closer to the reform line touted by 
coleaders imre pozsgay and premier miklos nemeth than to karoly 
grosz the most conservative of the collective leadership 
nyers echoed standard demands by pozsgay and nemeth that those 
who cannot accept fundamental change leave the party and he 
suggested a name change that does not contain the word workers 
to reflect a broader base 
behind the podium a giant slogan proclaimed democracy a 
constitutional state socialism as congress goals 
it was a stark contrast to the slogan of the last congress in 
1985 continue proceeding along the leninist path 
grosz cautioned against too much change saying we should not 
deny our communist ideals 
in a veiled attack on rivals pozsgay and nemeth he said the 
intolerance of senior leaders to differing opinions smacks of old 
stalinist practices even if theyre covered with the sweet glaze 
of reformism

where the wright brothers lived and worked in a move that could 
lead to a national park in the birthplace of aviation officials 
said friday 
rep tony hall dohio said the national park service study 
expected to take 12 to 15 months will help congress decide whether 
to confer national park status on the sites 
a committee headed by us district court judge walter rice was 
formed to preserve the heritage of orville and wilbur wright who 
developed the first heavierthanair flying machine 
over the years we have lost many of the buildings many of 
the historic sites involved in the birth of aviation either to the 
wrecking ball or to just plain indifference rice said that 
time is over 
the sites to be studied include huffman prairie scene of the 
wright brothers first flying experiments and buildings that 
housed the wrights airplane company bicycle shop and printing 
business 
also on the list are hawthorne hill home of orville wright 
carillon park home of the wright flyer iii known as the worlds 
first practical airplane and dunbar house home of paul lawrence 
dunbar poet and friend of the wright brothers 
william gibson a national park service official based in 
chillicothe said the agency will study options for managing the 
sites including oversight by the state or local government the 
private sector or the federal government in the form of a national 
park 
we are impressed said gibson the historic resources 
associated with the wright brothers that remain in dayton are truly 
impressive 
the city of dayton and montgomery county plan to contribute 
35000 apiece toward the study private contributions will also be 
sought officials said 
while the wright brothers constructed their early aircraft at 
their bicycle shop in dayton they also are connected historically 
with kitty hawk nc where on dec 17 1903 they made the first 
controlled sustained flights in a powerdriven airplane

president bush emerged today from surgery to 
remove a cyst on his right middle finger saying all is well 
bush was operated on as an outpatient at walter reed army 
medical center for removal of the cyst which has troubled him for 
several years he was given a local anesthetic 
holding his bandaged hand stiffly upright bush told reporters 
following the hourlong operation all is well he said he felt 
just fine and had experienced no pain during the surgery 
it was real minor he said of the surgery 
on emerging from the hospital bush defended his handling of 
events surrounding a failed coup against panamanian leader gen 
manuel antonio noriega he told reporters he does not regret his 
decision against intervening militarily adding there was never 
a chance to have him noriega handed over to us 
bush arrived by helicopter smiling waving at reporters and 
holding up the hand on which the surgery was to be performed 
its not really painful but its a nuisance in the sense that 
its large enough to cause him some anxiety presidential press 
secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters 
the president during a picturetaking session with angolan 
rebel leader jonas savimbi on thursday told reporters there was no 
need to make a federal case of it and joked i will show you 
my scar afterwards 
asked to raise his middle finger to demonstrate the cyst for a 
photo bush said with a laugh dont tempt me 
however he then held out his right hand in a downward direction 
he was also asked by reporters if the surgery would interfere 
with the duties of his office or keep him from going to a world 
series game 
no no life goes on i will continue through this awesome 
burden continue what im doing he said 
the cyst on the end of his finger just above the nail has 
troubled the president for about three years it simply has 
reached the point where it has gotten larger and noticeable 
fitzwater said 
he said the president who is lefthanded would be given a 
local anesthetic called a digital nerve block and would remain 
awake throughout the procedure 
the doctors clinical observation indicates that the cyst is 
benign there will of course be a routine pathologic examination of 
the tissue fitzwater added 
he said that while bushs doctors considered it a routine 
procedure it requires hospitalization 
it requires an incision and then of course the cyst can be 
in the finger and you never know how much what it takes to get 
out of there once you get in fitzwater said 
bushs cyst is a quarterinch in diameter and rises about an 
eighth of an inch above the surface of the finger with a root that 
extends under the skin back toward the finger joint said white 
house aide stephen hart 
the surgery was being performed by col allen smith chief of 
hand surgery at walter reed and george bogumill who occupies a 
similar post at georgetown university hospital 
the last time bush was in the hospital was may 10 when he 
underwent a routine physical examination at that time the cyst 
was drained and doctors said it had been present for many years and 
did not present a medical problem 
in 1986 bush who was then vice president had a basal cell 
skin cancer removed from his face the same year he had a small 
noncancerous polyp removed from his colon 
bush planned a weekend trip to the presidential retreat at camp 
david md he will go to baltimore on sunday to address a group of 
republican women and then return to camp david and remain there 
until monday afternoon

of global warming caused by the greenhouse effect with the aim of 
eventually drafting an international convention on global warming 
according to the greenhouse theory temperatures around the 
world are slowly rising because of a buildup of gases that is 
allowing sunlight into the atmosphere but preventing heat from 
escaping although the theory is widely accepted scientists differ 
over whether the greenhouse effect is causing global warming now or 
whether that will happen sometime in the future 
the 43nation working group discussed many of the options that 
would go into forming a framework agreement on global warming but 
did not actually work on drafting a convention the chairman dr 
frederick bernthal of the united states said at a news conference 
the three main gases thought to cause the greenhouse effect are 
carbon dioxide which is emitted by the burning of fossil fuels 
methane which comes from a variety of sources including leakage 
from coal mines and pipelines and chloroflourocarbons or cfcs 
used in refrigeration and aerosol sprays 
a vice chairman of the group jiein luo of china said that 
while emissions from industrialized countries have stabilized it 
is unavoidable that those from developing countries will 
increase he said it is therefore necessary to protect the 
environment and climate on the one hand but on the other hand not 
to hurt the development of these economies 
bernthal said financial assistance and technology transfers from 
industrialized countries to the developed world could help solve 
the problem but there is no clear estimate of how much money will 
be needed

president bush said today does not regret his 
decision against intervening militarily in this weeks failed coup 
against gen manuel antonio noriega in panama adding there was 
never a chance to have him handed over to us 
we reviewed all the information and i dont see anything now 
that would have made me make a different decision then bush told 
reporters as he emerged from walter reed army medical center after 
minor surgery on his finger 
he said he still wants to see noriega removed from power the 
panamanian military leader faces federal drug charges in florida 
bush offered a defense of his handling of the coup as two top 
administration officials were called by lawmakers to answer 
questions in closed session about the affair 
im not just being stubborn but as i look at all the 
information i wouldnt have made a different decision then bush 
said 
noting the criticism by many in congress that he didnt use the 
12000 us military personnel in panama to help rebellious 
officers of the panamanian defense forces in the shortlived revolt 
on tuesday bush said he knew that some wanted him to unleash the 
full military to go in and get noriega 
he said he could have gone to general quarters but that is not 
prudent under the circumstances 
the president said he still wants to see noriega removed from 
power but there was never a chance to have him handed over to 
us during the attempted coup 
the vigorous public defense by bush and his aides of the 
administrations actions contrasted with private acknowledgements 
by admininistration officials that the united states was guilty of 
shortcomings in intelligence matters and other areas 
i hope we will have learned some things from this and be a 
little better next time one senior official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said thursday 
bush was asked today about reports that the administration had 
an information gap during the coup attempt and was in a state of 
confusion due to conflicting and garbled reports from panama 
the president said he had been engaged in almost a running 
meeting on the matter throughout tuesday as to whether he had 
sufficient information and intelligence he said i dont feel i 
can factually answer that 
bush was asked whether panamanians who want to make future coup 
attempts against noriega could have any assurance that he might 
back them militarily 
he did not answer directly but said i would not rule out any 
option but you have to look at the facts you have to keep in mind 
the lives of american citizens but i wouldnt rule that out 
he added that his decision not to use force in this case was 
because it wasnt warranted under the existing circumstances 
the commanderinchief must have the lives of american 
citizens foremost in mind when making such a decision bush said 
he said its simply not true that the insurgents offered to 
turn noriega over to us authorities 
as the administration mounted its defense the nations top 
military leaders went before senate committees investigating the 
administrations actions including whether rebel troops sought 
us support while the uprising was in progress 
the intelligence and armed services committees met in closed 
session with defense secretary dick cheney and army gen colin 
powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to press for the 
details 
after the threehour session sen john warner rva quoted 
cheney and powell as saying they basically would not have 
changed their decision and recommendations to the president based 
on what they know today 
sen david boren dokla the intelligence committee chairman 
said he already was having difficulty because the white house was 
resisting authorizing the cia to give his panel a detailed 
chronology of events 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush 
feels that we did the best we could with the information 
available and he feels he made the right decisions 
even with the benefit of hindsight the president wouldnt do 
anything differently fitzwater said contradicting a statement a 
day earlier by the senior administration official 
for the first time the administration publicly pinpointed the 
wife of coup leader maj moises giroldi as the person who tipped 
off us officials about the planned coup she contacted us 
officials last sunday fitzwater said disputing a wall street 
journal report that she had made contact three weeks ago 
the journal said adella bonilla de giroldi on sunday night 
arranged for a meeting between her husband and two officials from 
the cia it said the cia had confidence in the rebels but the us 
military did not 
fitzwater backpedaled from an earlier statement that the only 
advance contact was through third parties he said us officials 
also were in touch with giroldi himself on sunday us officials 
believe giroldi was killed after the coup attempt 
discussing the senate investigation boren said thursday 
were going to get to the bottom of this including the 
question of whether panamanian rebels offered to release noriega to 
us officials during the four or fivehour period they had him in 
custody 
sen jesse helms rnc disputed the administrations 
assertion that the rebels refused to release noriega saying 
they the rebels told the us officers that they were holding 
noriega captive and requested us assistance to take custody of 
noriega and remove him to the united states 
however defense secretary cheney said the rebels refused in a 
facetoface contact with a us military officer to turn over 
noriega during the coup attempt 
a variety of officials said tuesdays coup effort was doomed by 
a series of false assumptions and mistaken judgments by the rebels 
as well as by the american forces lack of flexibility 
one us official said american forces in panama were prepared 
for any contingency from the maximum all the way to the 
minimum but the official said constraints were placed on gen 
maxwell thurman of the southern command who assumed his duties in 
panama just two days before the insurrection 
the senior administration official asked if the white house 
wished it had done things differently replied yeah a few 
things 
this is our first bloodletting if you will first real time 
of kind of a crisis operation the official said and every 
administration has a shakedown in one way or another and weve 
learned some things about our operation that we need to improve 
and well improve them

polands new government friday announced 
plans for a market economy warning of tight money bankruptcy and 
unemployment along the way but promising to soften the pain with 
unemployment benefits 
what we must do is a quick transformation of the present 
economic system into a market system that can spur human 
initiative and bring a gradual improvement of living conditions 
deputy prime minister leszek balcerowicz said 
we have a great and unrepeatable chance to pass to a 
system whose effectiveness is proven all over the world but we 
have to do it in a very difficult economic situation 
balcerowicz detailed the preliminary plan one day after it was 
approved by the council of ministers chaired by prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki the noncommunist government has been in power 
only 25 days 
western countries stand ready to help poland and if the measures 
are put into effect beneficial effects could be discernible within 
a year balcerowicz said 
poland has been suffering from inflation that has reached 50 
percent a month as well as an alarming drop in production of meat 
coal and industrial goods 
officials of the international monetary fund will come to poland 
on oct 16 and a crucial standby loan agreement should be signed 
with the lending group by the end of november he said 
the agreement in which poland would commit itself to the 
detailed program of restructuring and internal stabilization would 
signal the start of new western loans and restructuring of polands 
40 billion western debt 
the plans presentation was the most detailed explanation yet to 
the polish public of the sacrifices to expect under the stringent 
reforms advocated by the east blocs first noncommunist government 
the plans basic thesis is that only by quickly converting 
poland to a market economy can the countrys economic crisis be 
solved previous remedies such as price controls ration coupons 
and centralized distribution would only worsen the problems and 
delay the cure he said 
the plan forsees a preliminary phase lasting until dec 31 
followed by decisive action beginning early next year balcerowicz 
told reporters 
the first phase involves loosening state ownership of property 
breaking up monopolies reforming the state budget changing the 
banking system creating unemployment benefits and other social 
security measures and making state enterprises more efficient 
the government will counter monopolistic abuse of prices 
through administrative means and the excessive growth of wages with 
legislation to reduce wage indexation balcerowicz said 
we must introduce a wageandprice policy that will stop the 
inflationary process he said without approval of this point 
i can see no chance for leading poland out of its crisis 
in the decisive phase beginning next year he said the 
government means to stifle inflation privatize many stateowned 
enterprises create a bond and stock market as well as a a new 
budget system and a new tax system 
the government also will cut off credit and subsidies which 
will lead to bankruptcies and economic problems for some 
enterprises balcerowicz said 
some enterprises will run out of money and this is a 
necessary element of all successful programs to get out of violent 
inflation he said 
balcerowicz was unable to estimate the unemployment rate but 
said it could climb to between 10 percent to 20 percent in the 
worst case 
once changes are in place and the agreement with the imf is 
signed he said prices gradually will stabilize and living 
standards will begin to improve the situation is not hopeless 
there is a chance for real improvement

angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi said friday 
he had proposed to the united states a ceasefire plan that would 
involve other african states in the monitoring of the truce 
compliance 
savimbi said the plan he presented earlier in the day to 
secretary of state james a baker iii and to president bush on 
thursday would now be passed to zairean president mobutu sese seko 
who has been serving as the mediator between the union for the 
total independence of angola unita and the sovietbacked angolan 
government 
if the proposal is accepted by the angolan government a truce 
accord can be signed before the end of the month sources said 
the sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity said the 
truce proposal also includes agreement that the troops would not 
receive new weapons during the ceasefire that all hostile 
propaganda would stop and that political prisoners be released by 
both sides to the international community 
savimbi speaking at the national press club at the end of a 
week of meetings with officials and lawmakers said he had arranged 
to meet very soon with mobutu in order to iron out their 
problems and get the negotiations with angola back on track 
mobutu and savimbi have been feuding over the interpretation of 
the zaireanmediated truce accord which collapsed soon after it 
was reached last june savimbi denies he agreed to go into exile 
while mobutu appears to be backing angolas claim that he did the 
united states is backing savimbis version 
there were some problems with president mobutu but those 
problems we consider them on the way to being solved savimbi 
said 
we got a commitment that the united states government will be 
more involved as a supporting force to help the mediator he 
added 
baker expressed his unswerving support for unita and our 
strong desire that direct negotiations between unita and angola 
resume without preconditions said a state department statement 
he also reiterated our support for national reconciliation and 
unitas goal for free and fair elections the statement said 
angola has rejected direct negotiations with savimbi as well as 
free elections

struck a submerged natural gas pipeline 
the bodies were discovered by search aircraft near sea rim state 
park about 10 miles from the scene of tuesday nights blast one 
man remained missing and was presumed dead 
three men survived the blast two remained hospitalized friday 
one in critical condition and one in good condition the third 
survivor capt darreyl wayne gough 31 of sulphur la was 
released from the hospital thursday and was to be interviewed by a 
national transportation safety board team sometime friday said

we also should have some idea of what divers found and give us 
an idea of the condition of the pipe and hull benson said 
were also talking to the pipeline company about caretaking of 
that pipe and were talking to the fishing company to get an idea 
of their operations 
the 160foot north umberland was in only four to six feet of 
water when it struck the 16inch pipeline triggering a fire that 
sent flames hundreds of feet in the air 
safety board members would not speculate on a cause for the 
accident until more evidence was gathered 
although some officials have suggested that the boats fishing 
nets became snagged on the pipeline rupturing it to cause the 
explosion an ntsb shipboard inspection thursday found the nets 
stored inside the vessel 
the interstate pipeline installed in 1973 and regulated by the 
us department of transportation is required to be at least 36 
inches below the gulf floor it is owned by natural gas pipeline of

israeli soldiers friday 
prevented seven european diplomats from visiting a palestinian town 
that has been the target of tax raids an arab teenager died of 
wounds sustained in an army clash 
shops and offices were closed throughout the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip for a second consecutive day in a strike called to 
show solidarity with residents of beit sahour where israeli tax 
raids have been under way for two weeks 
the underground leadership of the 22monthold palestinian 
uprising called for three more days of strikes starting monday the 
jewish holy day of yom kippur 
the diplomats all consuls general from jerusalem were stopped 
at a military checkpoint on the edge of bethlehem and told that 
beit sahour a nearby town of about 10000 people was a closed 
military zone 
the army frequently closes areas in the west bank and gaza strip 
to keep outsiders away including reporters and residents of other 
areas 
british consul general ivan callan said the diplomats were 
invited by beit sahours mayor hanna atrash to see the problems 
created by the governments repeated tax raids 
it is part of our duty to discover what is going on callan 
said i think it is a mistake to prevent us from entering 
the other diplomats represent belgium france greece spain 
sweden and italy 
the incident was the latest in a test of wills between israel 
and the palestinians of beit sahour 
the israeli military government launched the tax raids to try to 
make an example of the town where compliance with a tax boycott 
has been almost universal nonpayment of taxes has been a frequent 
tactic of the uprising 
on tuesday soldiers declared part of arab east jerusalem a 
closed military zone to prevent the holding of a palestinian press 
conference on beit sahours problems 
the army said in a statement friday the diplomats were blocked 
because radical elements are trying to mobilize support from 
outside the area with the help of international bodies that 
encourage their actions and the media while they increase their 
violent activities 
the statement said this interfered with the legitimate 
activity of collecting taxes and the efforts of soldiers to restore 
quiet 
atrash said the consensus in the town was no taxation under 
occupation 
he estimated that more than 500000 worth of furniture and 
machinery has been confiscated during the raids on the town which 
is prosperous from scores of familyowned shops 
atrash said in a telephone interview he appreciated the 
diplomats efforts 
i think that the diplomats acceptance of the invitation and 
their effort to come shows the political support of our people not 
only in beit sahour but also in the west bank and gaza strip he 
said it is a victory 
in jerusalems mukassed hospital hamad shami 17 died of a 
gunshot wound to the chest suffered thursday when soldiers fired at 
youths stoning trains hospital officials said 
shamis death raised to 585 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli troops or civilians during the uprising against israeli 
occupation another 127 palestinians have been killed by fellow 
arabs most on suspicion of collaborating with israel forty 
israelis have died

the trial of the skipper of the tanker exxon valdez should be moved 
from the port city of valdez but where the trial will be held has 
not been decided 
former exxon capt joseph hazelwood faces misdemeanor charges of 
operating a vessel while intoxicated reckless endangerment and 
negligent discharge of pollutants as a result of the nations worst 
oil spill a felony indictment charges him with three counts of 
seconddegree criminal mischief 
hazelwood 42 of huntington ny is scheduled for trial in 
january he is free on 50000 bail 
the tanker was under hazelwoods command on march 24 when it ran 
aground on bligh reef after he turned the controls over to the 
vessels third mate more than 11 million gallons of thick crude 
oil spilled into prince william sound 
defense lawyers richard friedman and dick madson want to move 
the trial and assistant district attorney brent cole said the state 
supported the move 
because of pretrial publicity and the economic impact of the 
spill on valdez we just agreed in the interests of expeditious 
proceedings to not go through the hassle of trying to get a jury in 
valdez cole said 
cole said he has asked that the trial be held 125 miles away in 
anchorage but friedman said he was unsure that would be a good 
choice i think were moving in the right direction away from 
valdez he said 
anchorage superior court judge karl johnstone was assigned the 
case this week after palmer superior court judge beverly cutler 
disqualified herself cutler said litigation handled by her father 
and her sister could create the appearance of a conflict of 
interest 
johnstone is a commercial fisherman who owns a drift gillnet 
permit for bristol bay friedman said johnstones fishing was known 
when he was assigned the case and the defense team does not 
believe the activity poses a conflict fishermen were among those 
affected by the spill

a former air force officer says shes 
relieved that a military appeals court has set aside her conviction 
for an alleged affair with a man who worked with her in titan 2 
missile silos 
a military appeals court at little rock air force base 
overturned naomi hayes fraternization conviction last week it 
ordered her reinstated with full back pay of about 75000 minus 
what she has earned in civilian employment since her dismissal from 
the service in 1986 
the tribunal left open the possibility that the former 
lieutenant could be retried although her attorney said another 
trial was unlikely an air force spokesman said wednesday that no 
decision had been made 
i dont know what plans they have for me mrs haye 32 
said thursday from her home in guam where she lives with her 
husband air force sgt patrick haye and two children 
a panel of military judges convicted mrs haye at a november 
1986 courtmartial of two counts of adultery with a fellow officer 
and an enlisted man she was also convicted of fraternization with 
the enlisted man 
the adultery conviction involving the enlisted man was thrown 
out after her trial because it duplicated the fraternization 
charge the air force court of military review overturned the other 
adultery conviction last year 
fraternization is defined as a friendly relationship between an 
officer and an enlisted person detrimental to military order and 
discipline 
neither of the two men was courtmartialed or denied promotion 
according to mrs hayes attorney morgan welch 
mrs haye has contended she was singled out for prosecution 
because she was a white officer married to a black enlisted man 
the appeals court decided mrs haye hadnt received a fair trial 
im very relieved mrs haye said thursday it was a phone 
call i was looking forward to 
she had been deputy commander of a missile crew at the little 
rock base

masked kidnappers pushed two swiss red 
cross workers into a car friday and sped into a palestinian refugee 
camp outside this ancient port in south lebanon police reported 
a palestinian guerrilla spokesman linked the abductions to a 
lebanese shiite moslem hijacker imprisoned in switzerland 
the victims were identified as emmanuel christen 32 and elio 
erriquez 23 orthopedic technicians at an artificial limb center 
operated by the international committee of the red cross in sidon 
25 miles south of beirut 
none of lebanons armed factions claimed responsibility 
eighteen westerners including eight americans are missing in 
lebanon most believed to be captives of shiite moslems loyal to 
iran held longest is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
fridays abductions were the latest of several involving 
foreigners working for relief agencies in south lebanon most are 
blamed on fatahrevolutionary council a palestinian group led by 
terrorist abu nidal who broke with plo chairman yassir arafat in 
1973 
zeid wehbeh spokesman for the palestine liberation 
organization said the plo would spare no effort to help rescue 
the victims 
moein shabaita spokesman for yasser arafats fatah faction the 
plos main guerrilla component linked the kidnappings to a 
lebanese shiite moslem hijacker mohammed hariri 
hariri was jailed for life in february for hijacking an air 
afrique jetliner july 24 1987 and killing a french passenger 
after the plane landed in geneva 
shabaita said the group that kidnapped christen and erriquez was 
the same that abducted swiss red cross worker peter winkler last 
year apparently for the purpose of trying to win hariris 
release 
winkler was kidnapped nov 17 and freed dec 16 
people in sidon reported seeing a convoy of seven red cross cars 
with swiss officials inside heading for beirut in late afternoon 
red cross officials would not say whether the international 
committee which is based in geneva would pull out of lebanon as 
it did last year after another kidnapping

climbed out holding an artificial limb erriquez got out the other 
door followed by a lebanese icrc employee he said 
two kidnappers jumped from a car one brandishing a pistol and 
the other a submachine gun the spokesman reported 
christen and erriquez put their hands up offering no 
resistance he said they were bundled at gunpoint into the trunk 
of the gunmens mercedes which sped off followed by the other car 
packed with gunmen 
he said several witnesses saw the two cars racing into ein 
elhilweh 
international committee spokesman jeorg bischof said in geneva 
the abduction hinders the very important work the red cross is 
doing in lebanon 
police said the orthopedic center which provides artificial 
limbs for victims of lebanons 14yearold sectarian civil war was 
closed indefinitely after the abduction 
christen in lebanon since october 1987 had told friends 
ive been here so long because i love it i dont intend to ask 
for a transfer 
erriquez who arrived in april told colleagues the 
experience of working here will be good for me 
at least nine relief agency workers west germans 
scandinavians belgians and swiss have been kidnapped in south 
lebanon during the past two years 
police and other sources have blamed abu nidal whose real name 
is sabry albanna he has bases at ein elhilweh and in the smaller 
mieh mieh refugee camp nearby 
mustafa saad commander of the nasserite militia a sunni moslem 
group that has controlled sidon throughout the civil war blamed 
palestinians for the latest abduction but was not more specific 
this is an ein elhilweh affair not mine he told reporters 
after a 10minute meeting with roland sidler the international 
committees director in south lebanon 
sidler would not talk to reporters 
saad ordered his militiamen to search all cars leaving sidon 
the international committee withdrew its 31 swiss nationals from 
lebanon on dec 20 after death threats from factions that were not 
identified 
press reports in switzerland and lebanon said winklers 
kidnappers not identified had threatened more attacks on swiss 
workers claiming swiss authorities reneged on a pledge to pay 
ransom for winkler 
a 29member swiss group returned jan 22 after all lebanese 
factions promised there would be no attacks on humanitarian 
organizations

under a ruling by a state official 
employment and training commissioner james f french ruled the 
strike has had a substantial impact on the companys operations 
overturning a decision he made sept 13 to grant jobless benefits 
to the strikers 
the latest decision french said was not a reversal but was 
based on the cumulative impact on the company of the strike that 
began aug 6 
ed fitzpatrick a business agent with local 2222 of the 
international brotherhood of machinists said the union would 
appeal frenchs ruling to the courts on the grounds he did not give 
workers a hearing 
telephone company spokesman peter cronin praised the decision 
and said he hoped it would inspire the strikers to return to the 
bargaining table 
the decision sept 13 to grant benefits was based on the fact 
the evidence did not show net experienced a substantial curtailment 
of its business activities french said now nine weeks into 
the strike they have provided information that does show a 
substantial curtailment in many areas of their company 
french said the information provided him by the company was 
confidential but he said it showed service curtailment in areas 
such as installations repairs cabling maintenance construction 
and network services 
french said workers had collected about seven weeks of benefits 
and would not have to repay that 
french said it was rare for his department to grant unemployment 
benefits to strikers he said his initial ruling came because the 
telephone company is so heavily automated at first it was not 
seriously affected by the walkout of operators service technicians 
and other employees 
but french said as the strike wore on the effects mounted 
he said massachusetts law which requires companies to prove a 
substantial curtailment of activities before strikers can be denied 
jobless benefits is unusual most states he said either prohibit 
giving strikers unemployment benefits or allow it under most 
circumstances 
the major issue in the strike is a company demand that workers 
start paying a portion of their health insurance premiums

president bush underwent minor surgery on 
friday to remove a troublesome cyst from his finger and said 
afterward he felt just fine 
it was real minor bush told reporters as he left walter 
reed army medical center holding his right hand with bandaged 
middle finger aloft 
all is well he said with a laugh 
bush said he had not felt any pain during the 25minute 
operation because he had been administered a local anesthetic 
called digital nerve block anestheisa it was expected to wear off 
three or four hours after the operation and bush said the doctors 
had told him to expect some pain then 
the white house said pain medication would be prescribed as 
necessary bush left the hospital by helicopter to fly to camp 
david md for the weekend 
in a statement white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
called the operation entirely successful 
he said bush had eight stiches for the 1inch incision and 
would wear a splint on the finger for two to three weeks 
no longterm impairmnet of movement in the finger is 
expected fitzwater said 
the cyst appeared benign according to white house physician 
dr burton lee who observed the operation however a pathological 
examination of the tissue was still under way 
the white house identified the surgeons as col allen smith 
chief of hand surgery at walter reed and george bogumill who 
holds a similar position at gerogetown university hospital 
smith was to make a followup exam of the finger at the white 
house on oct 10 
making light of the matter the day before the surgery bush had 
laughed over it and told reporters not to make a federal case of 
it 
bush has had the cyst on the middle finger of his right hand for 
several years but it recently came to the point of being 
bothersome fitzwater said 
the spokesman told reporters the cyst was not really painful 
but its a nuisance in the sense that its large enough to cause 
him some anxiety 
doctors had drained the cyst on may 10 when bush underwent a 
routine physical examination the doctors said it had been present 
for several years and did not pose a medical problem for the 
65yearold president 
in recent weeks bush who is lefthanded has been playing 
golf tennis and horseshoes and baiting fishhooks as well as 
signing proclamations with no apparent difficulty from the cyst 
the cyst was described as a quarterinch in diameter rising 
about an eighth of an inch above the surface of the finger with a 
root that extended under the skin back toward the finger joint 
the president jokingly told reporters dont tempt me when 
asked to display the finger in question for cameras and 
photographers during a photo session thursday with angolan rebel 
leader jonas savimbi he then explained to savimbi that the finger 
is sometimes used for an obscene gesture 
bush promised reporters i will show you my scar afterward 
bushs doctors say he is in very good health and exceptionally 
good condition for his age as evidenced by his propensity for 
vigorous sports and his often tightlypacked work schedule 
he had a basal cell skin cancer removed from his face and a 
small noncancerous polyp removed from his colon in 1986 when he 
was vice president

the space agency told a federal court friday 
there are no safety reasons for stopping next weeks launch of a 
nuclearpowered probe from the space shuttle and that opponents are 
trying to spread a tale of horrors 
there is no evidence that these horrors will in fact or are 
likely to occur nasa told us district judge oliver gasch in a 
court filing 
gasch has scheduled oral arguments on tuesday two days before 
the shuttle atlantis is to lift off from kennedy space center 
carrying into orbit a probe called galileo powered by two 
247pound nuclear generators 
to date nasa has spent 15 billion on the project which will 
culminate in six years when the craft begins orbiting the planet 
jupiter the nuclear devices create electricity for the long 
journey and are similar to the ones that powered the voyager probe 
as it swept past neptune recently 
a coalition of citizens groups has sought a court order to stop 
the launch claiming that the danger of plutonium contamination 
from a shuttle disaster is far greater than the government has 
admitted 
the groups led by the florida coalition for peace and justice 
asked gasch to issue a temporary restraining order and a 
preliminary injunction and have threatened to disrupt the launch in 
other ways 
in essence plaintiffs do not like the launch decision and are 
trying to get the court to secondguess the executive branch of the 
government with regard to the acceptability of risk said the 
brief filed by justice department lawyer stuart b schoenburg 
opponents of the launch warned that the possibilities of an 
accident and a deadly plutonium release from galileo are 1in350 
nasa countered in fridays filing that exhaustive 
environmental impact studies showed the most probable accident 
statistically would be failure of the rocket that is to propel the 
space probe after it is released from the shuttle cargo bay 
even if the two thermonuclear power plants reentered earths 
atmosphere broke apart on hard rock and released plutonium nasa 
said there would be no additional cancer deaths over a 70year 
period 
the space probes journey to jupiter will be a complicated one 
involving one slingshot orbit of venus and two of earth to gain 
momentum and nasa said the highest potential for human harm would 
be if the craft crashed through the atmosphere when it makes its 
closest approach to earth the chances of that happening are 5 in 
10 million 
under this maximum case scenario there is a 1 in 10 million 
probability of 94 excess cancer fatalities worldwide over a 
70year period nasa said and the average individual risk would 
be one in 25 billion 
plaintiffs seem to confuse possibility with probability the 
government brief said instead of focusing upon what is likely to 
happen they dwell upon the worst case which is highly unlikely to 
occur 
nasa said the protesters at best represent the narrow 
concerns of a small segment of the public and come to the court 
with unclean hands because they filed suit just days before the 
launch 
the space agency plans to begin the countdown on monday as 
scheduled but will halt activities at the 11hour mark to await 
any court action the shuttle does not get fuel until the final 
hours of the countdown 
the government said volumes of safety analyses had been 
prepared and circulated among experts that the public at large had 
a chance to comment on environmental impact studies and that the 
presidents science adviser had approved after an elaborate 
launch approval process 
it said the court action is an attack on the judgment and 
integrity of scientists and public officials involved 
while the action proceeded in court another group public 
citizen circulated a letter it plans to send to individual 
members of congress on monday it urges them to intercede in the 
launch because an explosion similar to the challenger disaster 
could be catastrophic for floridas heavily populated atlantic 
coast

the only thing he had was his violin and the clothes on his 
back said alex gubenko the interpreter said it was painful for 
alexov to leave his family but he does not want to go back to the

the la brea tar pits where ice age animals like 
the dire wolf became trapped and preserved in sticky goo have been 
a gold mine for scientists for a hundred years 
now the los angeles tar pits have gone on the road in an 
exhibit where people can imagine being entombed in an asphalt 
grave 
the traveling show on display at the museum of science in 
boston contains dozens of artifacts taken from the california tar 
pits the specimens which resemble finely carved wooden 
sculptures range from the 10footlong skeleton of a ground sloth 
to the tiny jaw of a lizard 
there were literally millions of animals stuck in there 
said richard sheffield senior designer for the exhibit 
the bones date back as far as 40000 years which geologically 
is just an instant sheffield said he noted that dinosaurs 
became extinct 65 million years earlier 
but with all the plant and animal specimens sunk in the tar 
scientists discovered the remains of only one human by examining 
the skull of the la brea woman researchers estimated she lived 
approximately 9000 years ago 
moreover they speculate she was murdered by a blow to the head 
its one of those crimes that it will be kind of hard to find 
a witness sheffield said 
the pits are scattered through a 22acre park in southern 
california the tar oozes up through the ground mixing with sand 
and rock to form asphalt in pits that are about 20 feet deep 
in the winter the pits get hard but on hot summer days the 
asphalt mix turns soft and gooey 
scientists got their first clues about the tarcovered treasures 
back in 1875 when a large canine tooth was presented to william 
denton a boston paleontologist 
he determined that the tooth belonged to a sabertoothed cat 
which would be approximately the size of the modern african lion 
many of the pits remains were of predators that would spot an 
easy meal stuck in the tar and become trapped themselves 
after animals were mired in the tar and died they became 
saturated with asphalt created when the tar mixes with sand and 
rocks and the bones were locked in by cool winter temperatures 
the result has been a preservation process so complete that the 
skull of an american lion still has its 2inch fangs plus dozens of 
smaller teeth 
if anyone wants to imagine the frustration of getting stuck the 
exhibit has a display case with tar taken from the la brea site 
visitors can test their strength by lifting a pair of pistons and 
then imagining it is their feet instead 
sometimes you would get an animal with one foot stuck and 
then when theyre trying to get out they would get their other feet 
stuck sheffield said 
the exhibit includes stops in new york baltimore milwaukee and 
fort worth texas before it returns to california in 1991

adults are not as impressed with the overall 
job of colleges and universities as younger americans and most 
minorities feel race makes it harder to get a college degree 
according to a gallup poll released friday 
the national survey conducted for the council for advancement 
and support of education found that the majority of adults grade 
higher education institutions a high grade 38 percent a b and 35 
percent a c 
only 6 percent think colleges and universities deserve an a 
while 10 percent would give them a d and 3 percent a failing grade 
of f eleven percent didnt know 
young people gave superior grades to higher education 
institutions in a gallup survey last year with 76 percent of 
13to21yearolds rating the overall performance of colleges and 
universities an a or b 
in the current survey young adults age 18 to 29 were more 
likely than middleaged adults age 30 to 49 to give the 
opportunities colleges offer to succeed an a or a b fiftyfour 
percent of the young people gave colleges as and bs compared to 
43 percent of older people 
young adults also gave higher rates to colleges for producing 
quality teachers 44 percent an a or b compared to 37 percent by 
older respondents 
clearly most americans especially younger people consider 
higher education to be a very worthwhile investment said gary 
quehl president of the council at the same time we in higher 
education need to continually take the pulse of the ultimate 
consumers the american public to ensure we are offering them 
the quality programs and services they want and need 
the survey results suggest areas where we need to concentrate 
our efforts in the future he said 
fortyfive percent of those surveyed believed all high school 
graduates regardless of race have equal access to a college 
education said the poll based on 1253 telephone interviews in 
july and released as part of national higher education week 
however virtually the same number 44 percent disagreed 
saying a persons race makes it harder for that person to gain 
access to a college education minorities were significantly more 
likely than whites to have that belief about race 59 percent vs 
42 percent 
questioned about ways colleges could increase the access to a 
college education for students of all races six in 10 americans 
suggested working closely with parents community and church 
groups to encourage minority participation 
other survey results were 
55 percent said colleges and universities excel in conducting 
scientific research with 17 percent giving an a in this area and 
an additional 38 percent rating the system a b thirtyone percent 
rated it c or below and 14 percent didnt know 
49 percent said colleges and universities deserve an a or b for 
providing all americans equal opportunity to succeed roughly the 
same number 47 percent gave a c or below 4 percent didnt know 
the margin of error for the telephone poll was plus or minus 3 
percentage points 
the council is the nations largest education association in 
terms of institutional membership with about 2850 colleges

americans took out 348 billion more in 
consumer debt than they retired in august the government reported 
friday resuming their borrowing practices as expected after 
reducing their debt in july for the first time in 2 years 
analysts had said the july debt liquidation was a onetime 
thing and forecast continued borrowing in the foreseeable future 
we really havent become a nation of big savers said 
economist sandra shaber of the futures group a washington 
forecasting firm people arent tearing up their credit cards 
the federal reserve board said consumer credit in august 
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 percent 
compared to julys revised decrease of 09 percent which was even 
steeper than the 05 percent originally reported 
the decline in july was the first since january 1987 when 
consumer debt fell 163 billion or 34 percent 
for all of 1988 consumer credit climbed 85 percent 
the august debt rebound had been expected in part because of 
robust automobile sales propelled by endofmodelyear sales 
incentives and the threat of steep price increases for 1990 models 
auto loans which fell 69 percent in july and 23 percent in 
june grew by 400 million in august or 17 percent on an annual 
rate auto loans had declined 167 billion in july 
the category of debt that includes credit cards rose by 357 
billion in august resuming a sharp 225 percent annual rate of 
increase it had risen only 89 percent to 141 billion in july 
down from a 201 percent hike in june 
people are shifting now from things like cars and other major 
durables to soft goods such as clothing mrs shaber said this 
reflects a shift in household spending patterns that has been going 
on for the past year 
consumer spending which represents twothirds of all economic 
activity is watched closely as a sign of economic health 
particularly in light of fed efforts to contain inflation by 
slowing the economy but without driving it into a recession 
the federal open market committee the feds monetary 
policymaking body met earlier this week to determine credit 
strategy for the coming weeks its decision will not be disclosed 
publicly for six weeks 
nevertheless analysts did not expect any major changes in 
central bank policies and look for interest rates to continue at 
their current level for much of the remainder of the year 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by 
158 million a 1 percent annual rate of growth that compared with 
a 11 percent decline in july 
mobile home debts continued to fall down a whopping 656 
million or a 333 percent annual rate of decline this category has 
fallen for seven consecutive months including a july drop of 56 
million or 28 percent 
the various changes left total consumer debt in august at a 
seasonally adjusted 7038 billion

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev told east 
germans friday their country is gripped by the changes shaking 
eastern europe but they should calmly follow their communist 
leaders through the turmoil 
gorbachev has been unable to push erich honeckers conservative 
east german leadership on a reform path but he praised east 
germanys economic and social progress in ceremonies marking the 
40th anniversary of the communist state and staunchly defended its 
sovereignty 
while thousands of east germans are fleeing to the west the 
soviet leader said east germanys communist party must lead the 
country through a difficult period of renewal 
gorbachev viewed by many east germans as the champion of 
change was greeted warmly by crowds well organized by authorities 
but at one point he was drawn to about 500 teenagers who arrived 
outside official sponsorship and shouted gorby gorby 
speaking to party and government officials at berlins palace of 
the republic gorbachev said east germany has its unique problems 
determined by the need to cross new frontiers the general 
processes of modernization and renewal which the whole socialist 
world has gotten down to 
earlier in the day with east berliners crowding around him 
gorbachev urged them to be patient dont panic and dont be 
sad he told them that the east german party has the ability to 
think through problems and change its policies if necessary 
but in comments to journalists the soviet president said no one 
could afford to sit still 
in response to questions he said of east germany the danger 
is for those who dont react to life those who grasp the impulse 
of society and base their policy on that have no reason to fear 
that comment could have been directed at the 77yearold 
honecker who has resisted gorbachevs bid for reform in eastern 
europe and the soviet union 
but gorbachev on his twoday stay in east germany does not want 
to say anything to further destabilize this outpost of the east 
bloc 
more than 100000 east germans have left their country for the 
west this year alone their flight through other eastern european 
countries especially hungary but also czechoslovakia and poland 
has threatened open breaks in the warsaw pact alliance 
gorbachev has refrained from criticizing hungary which removed 
its border barriers last month and allowed east german refugees to 
cross freely into austria and said in his speech that his policy 
toward eastern europe is based on equality selfreliance and 
solidarity 
he drew the most applause from the party and government 
officials by dismissing calls from the west to remove the berlin 
wall 
our western partners should understand that questions 
regarding the german democratic republic east germany are not 
solved in moscow but in berlin he said he added the postworld 
war ii structure that created east germany has helped keep the 
peace in europe for more than 40 years 
groups selected by authorities greeted gorbachev earlier in the 
day at a soviet war memorial and a downtown east berlin monument to 
the victims of fascism and militarism they also lined the 
motorcade routes 
gorbachev was attracted to a crowd of teenagers across the 
street from the treptow park monument to the soviet soldiers killed 
in the battle for berlin in 1945 
the young people not among those picked by authorities cheered 
gorbachev and he left his limousine for a minute to step across the 
cobblestone street and shake hands 
some teenagers who talked to reporters later praised gorbachev 
he would make socialism stronger said one another youth 
lauded gorbachev for having a more open policy in the staterun 
news media

policymakers at the federal reserve decided 
to keep interest rates unchanged in late august following a period 
earlier in the summer when they were nudging rates lower according 
to minutes of the meeting released friday 
the federal open market committee voted 101 at its aug 22 
meeting to make no changes in interest rates although it issued a 
directive that leaned toward crediteasing if the economy weakened 
for the period ahead a steady course was desirable in light 
of the latest evidence suggesting that price pressures were not 
intesifying and the economy was continuing to grow at a moderate 
pace the committee said 
the bellwether federal funds rate the interest rate most 
closely watched for signals of fed policy decisions fell from 
975 percent in early june to 9 percent by late july as the central 
bank eased its credit grip amid signs of widespread economic 
weakness 
however since that time various indicators show that the 
economy was not as weak as previously feared and the fed has made 
no further moves to ease credit conditions the funds rate the 
interest banks charge each other to make overnight loans has been 
unchanged at 9 percent for the past two months 
the open market committee composed of fed governors in 
washington and five of the 12 fed regional bank presidents met 
again on wednesday the minutes of that meeting will not be 
released until after the next open market committee meeting on nov 
14 but private economists said they believed that the central bank 
decided again this week to make no moves to change credit policy 
the labor department reported friday that the unemployment rate 
rose to 53 percent in september as manufacturing employment took 
the biggest onemonth nosedive since the end of the last recession 
but allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said he 
believed that it would take more signs of weakness than one months 
unemployment report to convince the fed to loosen credit further 
fed policymakers did leave room for further easing with a 
directive that leaned in that direction 
roger guffey president of the kansas city regional fed bank 
cast the lone dissenting vote arguing that in his view inflation 
remained at unacceptably high levels and this did not permit any 
bias toward easing

the kidnapping of two red cross workers in 
lebanon on friday occurred even as the organization was planning 
worldwide television concerts in a campaign to benefit wars 
civilian victims 
the campaign is planned to culminate with rock and classical 
music concerts and other events may 8 1991 attempting to persuade 
combatants to stop killing civilians red cross officials said 
kidnapped in sidon by masked gunmen were emmanuel christen 32 
and elio erriquez 23 who had been distributing artificial limbs 
to victims of lebanons civil war 
today the conflicts dont look like they did when the red 
cross was founded in 1864 when there were two or three big 
armies clashing on a big field and that was it said princess 
christina of sweden 
the princess representing a sevennation steering committee 
planning the campaign spoke in an interview thursday 
the organizers are enlisting rock stars and other popular 
figures to head drives in many of the 148 countries that have red 
cross or red crescent organizations said leon davico the 
genevabased campaign director 
princess christina said the red cross will base its campaign on 
conventions agreed to by virtually all nations in which they 
promised to respect rules regarding prisoners soldiers and 
combatants during wars 
davico added well tell the armies you have the duty to 
protect the civilians if you want to fight its your business 
unfortunately but you havent got the right to kill defenseless 
women and children and old people 
princess christina said there were about 30 conflicts in the 
world that cause concern but they usually dont fit the 
traditional pattern of one country at war with another 
its internal conflicts within a country or within a region 
she said noting the conflicts sometimes involve political or 
religious groups 
princess christina said the planners had yet to set a 
fundraising goal for the project 
davico said there would be a series of concerts in a worldwide 
television event with a rock concert reminiscent of the band aid 
gala to raise money for famine relief in africa 
but he said there would be other events such as a classical 
concert from the united states or a brief program from the bolshoi 
ballet in moscow or something form tokyo 
interspersed in the entertainment he said would be 10 short 
films each lasting 57 minutes about war victims the films will 
be produced by top film makers from different countries

antiabortion lawyers told a panel of federal 
judges friday that the us supreme court cleared the way in july 
to reinstate louisiana laws that would send doctors to jail for 
performing abortions 
the argument launched a court challenge by louisiana officials 
seeking to overturn the supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade decision 
legalizing abortion 
rachael pine an american civil liberties union lawyer 
countered that there is nothing in the july ruling that justifies 
the revival of three strong antiabortion statutes struck down in 
1976 
it is as simple today as it was 13 years ago pine told the 
threejudge us district court panel 
nearly 100 abortion rights supporters jammed the courtroom 
sitting quietly as pine and other aclu lawyers argued with 
representatives of louisiana attorney general william guste and new 
orleans district attorney harry connick both of whom want to lift 
a 1976 injunction banning enforcement of the abortion statutes 
both connick and guste neither of whom attended fridays 
hearing have said their effort is a test case to get a supreme 
court ruling on whether louisiana can indeed ban abortion 
the july ruling made state laws the main arena for the battle 
over abortion pennsylvania and michigan are considered likely to 
enact new legislation and lawmakers in illinois michigan and 
florida are expected to take up the issue at special sessions 
floridas supreme court gave abortion rights backers a victory 
thursday by striking down a parental consent law on the ground that 
it violated floridas constitutional privacy rights the attorney 
generals office in tallahassee said the state would file a 
petition for a rehearing next week 
some people on both sides of the issue said the florida decision 
is so broad that women in the state would have their current rights 
to an abortion even if the us supreme court reverses roe vs 
wade 
if the louisiana law were enforced doctors who perform 
abortions would face 10year jail terms people who advertise 
abortion services or sell drugs or devices to induce abortions also 
would be subject to jail terms and fines 
the laws even ban sale of contraceptives although guste said no 
attempt would be made to enforce that provision 
critics say the laws make no exceptions for rape or incest but 
guste said abortions in such cases could be considered therapeutic 
and therefore legal 
pine argued there is no basis for lifting the injunction 
john baker an attorney for connick and a law professor at 
louisiana state university said julys supreme court decision in a 
missouri case webster vs reproductive health services changed 
the standard by which courts can review abortion laws 
a state now may ban abortions if it proves it has a compelling 
interest in protecting the rights of the unborn he argued 
in louisiana such an interest is already established in laws 
giving fetuses the right to collect support payments win wrongful 
death suits or inherit property if they are born alive said baker 
and jennifer schaye a lawyer for guste 
tort law and inheritance law is not constitutional law pine 
said later during a news conference 
she also disputed bakers contention that the webster opinion 
changed the standard of judicial review she quoted chief justice 
william rehnquists opinion in which he stated specifically that 
webster leaves undisturbed the 1973 roe vs wade ruling 
baker said the webster ruling changed roes standard of fetal 
viability the point at which the fetus could survive outside the 
womb from 24 weeks to 20 weeks 
pine said the missouri requirement that doctors test for fetal 
viability at 20 weeks was upheld in webster because there is a 
fourweek margin for error in determining length of gestation 
judges william eugene davis martin lc feldman and aj 
macnamara gave no indication when or how they would rule in the 
case 
before and after the hearing abortion rights demonstrators 
gathered on the steps of the federal courthouse chanting and 
singing and carrying banners in support of a womans right to 
abortion 
they greatly outnumbered a band of about a dozen antiabortion 
pickets most of whom marched quietly in a circle in front of the 
courthouse steps while one read bible verses aloud 
no violent confrontations or arrests were reported

an audit has uncovered widespread interior 
department mismanagement of an indian trust fund including the 
unexplained disapperance of 17 million and other losses because of 
sloppy recordkeeping officials said friday 
the losses were brought to light by an inspector generals 
investigation into the bureau of indian affairs management of the 
trust fund totaling more than 17 billion 
the fund which represents money belonging to 200 indian tribes 
and 290000 individuals is managed for investment purposes by the 
bureau most of the money comes from courtordered monetary awards 
to the indians or revenue from oil gas or mineral leases 
the inspector generals report concluded that the financial and 
investment records of the trust fund were in such disarray that 
their accuracy no longer can be relied upon it called the funds 
management and control problems pervasive 
the investigators said they found no evidence indicating how 17 
million shown on the funds main ledger had been disposed of while 
there is no direct evidence that the money had been stolen the 
report said it did not rule out the possibility 
the audit identified another 195 million in actual or 
potential losses because of poor investment decisions or 
mismanagement of invested funds in many cases sloppy 
recordkeeping and inattention cost the fund millions of dollars 
the report said 
the bureau of indian affairs acknowleged severe shortcomings in 
the recordkeeping of the trust fund it said that much of the 
problem stemmed from not having a modern automated system the 
agency said it is preparing to shift the accounting 
responsibilities for the fund to a private contractor possibly 
later this month 
the report said that for the most part the losses and 
shortcomings were kept from the indian tribes or individual to whom 
the money belonged 
the bureaus practice regarding known losses of trust funds 
has been to not disclose the losses but rather wait for an indian 
tribe or individual to file a claim or sue the government for 
recovery james richards the inspector general wrote interior 
secretary manuel lujan 
in an interview richards said for the most part the tribes 
never filed such a claim because they were not aware of the losses 
they the fund managers didnt tell anybody said richards 
while investigators had no clue as to the missing 17 million 
they documented millions of dollars in losses because of poor 
management and record keeping 
for example 
at least 5 million remains unaccounted for in connection with 
the funds investments in guaranteed mortgages control of some of 
the mortgage holdings were transfered to a private fiscal agent in 
1983 but investigators found no records that showed how many loans 
were shifted or when they were to be paid off raising the 
possiblity that some funds may have been lost 
an attempt by investigators to determine the status of 17 loans 
worth 35 million was unsuccessful because of the incomplete 
records said the report we believe these funds may have been 
lost or misappropriated 
from mid1985 to the end of 1986 fund managers underreported 
the amount of uninvested money in the fund resulting in the loss 
24 million during the 18 months in overnight interest payments 
from the us treasury 
in 1984 fund managers deposited 78 million in a kansas city 
bank to buy certificates of deposits supposedly from a credit 
union but no cds were ever received nor interest paid because the 
money was fraudulently diverted by a middleman 
the bureau eventually recovered most of the money but as of 
last april 15 million was still lost as was an estimated 12 
million in interest that the money could have earned the losses 
were never recorded on the trust funds ledgers or officially 
recognized the report said 
the fund has lost nearly 4 million in recent years from bank 
failures while such losses normally are recovered in about 60 
days it has taken five years for the bureau to recover some 31 
million as a result of bank failures the delay has cost the fund 
an estimated 38 million in interest alone said the report

business and community leaders in this 
southern tennessee community are taking a simple approach to 
saturdays scheduled march by white supremacists they plan to shut 
the town down 
im hoping its pouring down rain thatd put a damper on 
them mayor hal stewart said friday the group has a 
constitutional right to march he said but town residents arent 
happy about the gathering 
i doubt therell be over five places open in pulaski and 
theyll probably be on the outlying sections of the city stewart 
said 
were just going to shut the town down and let them have their 
march there wont be anything open around the square all the 
merchants downtown agreed to close 
the aryan nations a white supremacist group based in hayden 
lake idaho plans the early afternoon march to commemorate the 
oct 6 birthday of civil war hero sam davis 
davis a confederate scout was hanged in pulaski after refusing 
to tell union leaders who revealed information about movements of 
northern troops 
pulaski population 7600 also has a footnote in history as the 
1865 birthplace of the original ku klux klan the current klan 
which traces its roots to 1915 georgia also has marched here 
no one knows how many marchers to expect saturday in this town 
90 miles south of nashville but the tennessee highway patrol will 
help police from pulaski and surrounding towns with security 
all weve got to go on is what their leader says and he says 
theyre going to bring in a thousand the mayor said of the 
groups chief the rev richard g butler we dont have any 
proof therell be that many 
city officials are counting on police chief stanley newtons 
experience with the klan 
hes had three years of experience with three other marches by 
the klan so we feel he and his officers are wellseasoned said 
alderman dan speer 
pulaski residents were quietly indignant about the klan marches 
which began in 1986 to protest designation of martin luther kings 
birthday as a national holiday but this time they decided to take 
a stronger stand 
a group called giles countians united after trying to 
discourage the march with petitions and resolutions is urging 
giles county residents to stay away from the downtown area to avoid 
possible confrontations with the marchers 
our whole goal is to at least tell the rest of the world that 
pulaski does not share the views of that group said organizer 
mike curry president of pulaskis first national bank 
many residents have made a point of leaving town saturday and 
two high school football games were moved up to thursday night to 
avoid incoming aryan nations members 
more than 130 businesses agreed to close their doors saturday 
no small decision according to speer an insurance agent and 
former restaurant owner 
this is going to be the first saturday of the month which 
traditionally is the most profitable saturday and the busiest of 
the month speer said this is going to cost each business 
several thousand dollars the sacrifice the owners and employees 
are making needs to be recognized

fires that strike nursing homes are especially 
dangerous because the elderly are a high risk group for fire 
deaths a spokeswoman for a national fire safety group said friday 
in fact americans over the age of 65 accounted for nearly 
onefourth of the fire fatalities in the ountry during a recent 
fouryear period said julie reynolds a spokeswoman for the 
national fire prevention association 
they have the highest fire fatality rates involving smoking 
materials heating and cooking equipment and electrical fires 
reynolds said in a telephone interview 
careless smoking was blamed for the fire that killed nine people 
and injured nearly 100 others when it struck a 172bed nursing home 
in norfolk va thursday night the nine residents who died ranged 
in age from 65 to 97 
an association study from 19821986 showed the elderly have a 
fire death rate of 578 per 1 million population about three times 
the national average of 196 per million reynolds said 
during the same period the study showed that americans over 65 
accounted for 241 percent of the nations fire deaths 
there are certainly some factors that contribute to the higher 
fire fatality rates reynolds said noting some senior citizens 
may be confined to living situations like nursing homes where they 
may be bedridden or have physical problems which make their rescue 
or escape difficult 
for both private homes and nursing homes the group recommends 
smoke detectors in each sleeping room institutions should also 
place smoke detectors in corridors and common spaces the group 
recommends 
in addition the fire association said portable fire 
extinguishers should be provided near hazardous areas it also 
recommends automatic sprinkler systems for new high rise buildings 
fire officials said the norfolk nursing home did not have any 
sprinklers but added they were not required when the home was 
built in 1969 
reynolds noted the virginia nursing home tragedy came right 
before the groups national fire prevention week which is oct 
814

several east germans detained by police 
outside the us embassy in east berlin will be permitted to leave 
the country the state department said friday 
spokesman richard boucher said the assurances were given by the 
east german government and that he did not know how many people 
were involved 
all of those detained were released from custody with the 
exception of two who were arrested for reasons unrelated to 
emigration boucher said 
in a related development the state department press office said 
it had erroneously distributed a notice to reporters that east 
germans hoping to flee to the west were politely denied entry 
to the us embassy 
a statement issued in its place said the embassy staff asks 
those who seek to enter the chancery what their purpose is in 
entering the building 
those who have normal embassy business are allowed to enter 
the statement said no embassy employees force people off the 
premises 
the initial press notice which was issued thursday night 
reinforced earlier us statements that the embassy was not 
equipped to grant waves of wouldbe emigrants extended sanctuary 
our embassy is not in a position to accommodate large numbers 
of people who want to sit there until other governments do 
something boucher said thursday 
eighteen east germans 10 adults and eight children 
voluntarily left the us embassy wednesday evening after a 31hour 
occupation that touched off an effort by dozens of others to try to 
get past east german police and into the building 
boucher said the east german government had given assurances 
that their desire to emigrate would be considered positively and 
that no reprisals would be taken against them also he said a 
woman pushed away by police from the entrance was given similar 
assurances 
we try to do what we can to express our humanitarian concerns 
for individuals as well as whole groups of people the us 
spokesman said 
but while asserting again american support for the right to 
travel boucher said it was worth remembering that the vast 
majority of east germans trying to emigrate wish to settle in west 
germany and not the united states 
the embassy that we have in berlin is of course not set up 
as a place where people can go boucher said we do not have 
the capability to handle even a limited number of people 
the us official also cautioned the wouldbe east german 
emigrants that people potentially put themselves in a difficult 
situation with respect to their own government 
boucher said the advice was based on recent statements by the 
east german government that flocking to western embassies was no 
longer acceptable 
the notice to the press thursday night said visitors to the 
embassy were asked by us officials why they wanted to enter the 
building 
those who have normal embassy business are allowed to enter 
it said those who do not are informed that the us is unable to 
assist them on other types of matters they are politely denied 
entry no one is forced from embassy premises 
when hundreds of east germans tried to rush the fivestory stone 
building in downtown east berlin on wednesday the doors were 
slammed shut and east german police called in reinforcements about 
100 formed a line in front of the embassy 
boucher said the fact that thousands of east germans are trying 
to flee reflects a deep sense of dissatisfaction with their 
government 
he said the police were not requested by us embassy officials 
we deplore the manhandling of the crowd the spokesman said 
and the embassy has protested the stopping of people trying to 
visit it

a psychological autopsy released 
friday on the stockton schoolyard killer found he was a solitary 
racist who took out his hatred on southeast asian children because 
they were visible targets 
patrick purdy who committed suicide after gunning down five 
children at an elementary school blamed minorities for his 
shortcomings said the report released by attorney general john van 
de kamp 
his crime was not the result of sudden impulse it was 
premeditated murder van de kamp said 
the attorney general said that although purdy acted on racial 
motives in his jan 17 attack he was not connected with any racist 
group 
purdy was filled with hate and anger toward many groups van 
de kamp said and in his final days that hatred focused on 
stocktons very visible southeast asian community 
the report deals with why someone who had extensive contact with 
the mental health and criminal justice systems wasnt prevented 
from going on a rampage with an assault rifle 
by the time he had reached his late teens purdy had received 
treatment for alcoholism worked as a prostitute and sought 
voluntary treatment at mental health centers but rarely returned 
for voluntary followup treatments according to the report 
the tale of patrick purdys life is a sad and depressing 
account of a failed family of a child without resources who failed 
to cope with severe stress and lack of affection and of a human 
who ended his short life with virtually no ties to the community 
and society surrounding him said the report 
the report revealed that two weeks before the shootings purdy 
entered a stockton bar wearing camouflage clothing he told the 
bartender that he had an ak47 rifle and talked about the weapons 
capabilities 
he complained about the vietnamese receiving compensation from 
the government saying as he left the bar youre going to read 
about me in the papers 
the report said purdy was filled with anger and hate toward 
virtually all identifiable ethnic minorities

the senate foreign relations committee 
approved legislation friday that would require us sanctions 
against countries that violate the ban on using chemical and 
biological weapons 
the legislation approved on a voice vote also would encourage 
international sanctions against violating countries 
in addition it requires the president to monitor efforts by 
iran iraq libya syria and other developing nations to develop or 
acquire chemical and biological weapons 
the approval comes on the heels of a proposal made by president 
bush before the united nations to cut us and soviet stockpiles of 
such weapons by 80 percent the soviets countered with a proposal 
for total elimination 
us sanctions include a cutoff of arms sales an embargo on 
imports from the violating country an end to credit guarantees 
from the exportimport bank a halt to financial assistance from 
us banks and an end to military and economic assistance 
the united states would also encourage a denial of assistance 
from international lending institutions as well as other sanctions 
the bill says that as many as 20 countries are capable of 
producing chemical weapons and that by the year 2000 at least 15 
developing countries will have the ability to produce ballistic 
missiles capable of delivering the weapons

the soviet union has invited vice prime 
minister shimon peres for a visit officials said friday he would 
be the first israeli cabinet minister to travel there since moscow 
broke relations over the 1967 middle east war 
the invitation to peres head of the labor party was offered by 
the nongovernmental soviet peace committee during peres meeting 
in new york last month with a fivemember soviet trade delegation 
officials said 
no date has been set said spokesman elie yosef of the finance 
ministry which peres also heads 
arye levin the head of israels consular mission in moscow 
said the visit could include very seniorlevel contacts 
israeli newpapers said peres might meet with president mikhail s 
gorbachev and foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
the trip would be another step in renewing ties between the two 
countries a process that started with the exchange of consular 
delegations in 1986 and 1987 moscow and most of the soviet bloc 
had broken relations after israel captured land from arab countries 
in the 1967 war 
levin noted in an israel army radio interview that peres was 
invited not as an israeli minister but as a public figure head 
of the labor party its an invitation from an official body but 
not in the name of the soviet government 
we should not see such visits as foretelling an immediate 
renewal of ties he said the issue is to create a contact 
in order to tighten relations between leaders of the two 
countries 
the soviets have said the renewal of diplomatic ties with israel 
depends on progress on middle east peace the soviet union supports 
a unsponsored international peace conference and talks between 
israel and the palestine liberation organizaion 
some israelis view the invitation to peres as encouragement to 
the leftcenter labor party which has not opposed the plan for an 
international peace conference prime minister yitzak shamir head 
of the rightwing likud bloc is against such a conference and any

president bush vigorously defended his 
handling of the failed coup in panama on friday saying there was 
no opportunity to seize gen manuel antonio noriega and use of us 
force wasnt warranted under the existing circumstances 
im not being stubborn but as i look at all the information i 
wouldnt have made a different decision then bush said 
he added that he wouldnt rule out any option including 
military intervention in any future coup attempt 
amid a torrent of complaints and questions over the us action 
the white house and pentagon marched in step saying the united 
states had responded correctly when rebels attempted and failed 
to depose noriega who faces drugtrafficking charges in florida 
bush offered his defense during a closeddoor meeting with 
senate republicans on capitol hill and then publicly after 
undergoing surgery at walter reed army medical center for removal 
of a finger cyst 
similarly top military leaders defense secretary dick cheney 
and gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
testified in closed session before the senate intelligence and 
armed services committees 
the two panels were preparing an analysis of issues that remain 
in dispute surrounding the events in panama and contacts between 
the rebel officers who organized the coup and us officials 
armed services chairman sam nunn dga said a lack of clear 
policy guidance from bush had greatly contributed to us confusion 
in dealing with the coup attempt and that there should have been 
specific arrangements for how us troops were to react 
we have had a definite longstanding policy in this country of 
encouraging a coup in panama nunn told reporters we should 
anticipate that our policy might succeed then we have to know 
what were going to do next 
privately a senior administration official said that with the 
benefit of hindsight the united states should have done some 
things differently and had learned some things we need to 
improve 
bush however said we reviewed all the information and i 
dont see anything now that would have made me make a different 
decision then 
many members of congress have complained that bush erred by not 
using the 12000 us military forces in panama to assist in 
tuesdays attempted coup and the president said he knew that some 
people wanted him to unleash the full military to go in and get 
noriega 
bush said the decision not to use force was made because it 
wasnt warranted under the existing circumstances the 
commanderinchief must have the lives of american citizens 
foremost in mind when making such a decision 
the president said he still wants to see noriega removed from 
power but there was never a chance to have him handed over to 
us sen jesse helms rnc has said he had information that 
the rebels wanted to give noriega to the united states 
recounting bushs remarks on capitol hill white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said he just said he had felt we made 
the right decisions when he reviewed the information involved that 
he had as good information as could be expected and that he was 
confident he did the right thing 
he said we were willing to use force but not unless we 
know the circumstances and have better information 
sen john warner rva quoted cheney and powell as saying they 
basically would not have changed their decision and 
recommendations to the president based on what they know today 
while insisting that all of the administrations statements 
about the coup had been correct fitzwater withdrew an earlier one 
that the united states had not been in direct contact in advance 
with any coup leaders 
he confirmed that us representatives had been in touch before 
tuesday with the coup leader maj moises giroldi who is believed 
to have been killed perhaps by noriega earlier fitzwater had 
said that advance word had come through a thirdparty contact 
fitzwater emphatically denied a report in the wall street 
journal that giroldis wife had tried to alert us officials about 
the coup three weeks ago similarly cheney said he had not heard 
that kind of information 
nevertheless cheney said there are coup reports on a fairly 
regular basis that is not new 
fitzwater during a briefing with reporters offered 
clarifications on several points 
the rebel forces asked and the united states agreed for 
american forces to block access routes to noriegas headquarters 
even so fitzwater said we dont consider that participation in 
the coup we were not involved in the planning in the operation 
in the carrying it out 
a cable transmitted to washington by us military officials 
in panama incorrectly stated that the rebels wanted the united 
states to take custody of noriega fitzwater said the cable should 
have said the rebels wont let the us have custody 
fitzwater said the erroneous cable never reached bush there 
was never a piece of information in this white house that said 
anything other than they were not willing to give him up period 
sen helms has repeatedly said he had information that the 
rebels wanted to turn noriega over to the united states fitzwater 
said helms staff was interviewed by white house chief of staff 
john sununu and could not back up their claims 
despite earlier suspicions the united states now believes 
giroldi was actually trying to overthrow noriega earlier cheney 
had said us officials feared a setup because giroldi had been 
a noriega confidant and had helped repel a coup attempt last year 
fitzwater said that doubts about giroldi were major factors 
that led to a concern that maybe the whole thing was a setup 
disputing the wall street journal on another point fitzwater 
denied that the rebels had ever asked the united states to deploy a 
helicopter to take noriega into custody

salvadoran activists freed 12 
hostages friday and left the costa rican embassy after a 28hour 
occupation to protest alleged human rights abuses by president 
alfredo cristianis government 
the hostages and 20 members of the federation of committees of 
mothers and relatives of political prisoners were taken away in six 
international red cross vehicles at about 130 pm 
journalists watched but police kept them 30 yards away and 
would not let reporters talk to evacuees none of the hostages one 
costa rican diplomat 11 salvadorans employed in the embassy 
appeared to be harmed 
government spokesman mauricio sandoval told reporters the 
hostages were taken to red cross headquarters in san salvador for 
medical checks before being sent home and that the activists 
returned to their organizations office 
he said charges eventually might be filed against some of those 
involved 
the government spokesman said some activists who had been armed 
apparently left their weapons inside the offices or hidden 
because they boarded the red cross vehicles unarmed 
those occupying the embassy had insisted they were not armed 
but costa rican diplomats said they carried weapons 
the swiss and the peruvian embassies which share the sixstory 
central america building with the costa rican mission were not 
affected by the occupation the costa rican embassy is on the third 
floor of the building on san salvadors west side 
the activists arrived in small groups thursday morning 
pretending to be applying for visas then seized the embassy and 
took 16 hostages they later allowed ambassador jesus fernandez 
who had heart trouble and some employees to leave along with 
visitors who were there on business 
sandoval called the embassy takeover an affront to the 
government and people of costa rica a violent action that makes 
no sense he accused the activists of having direct links to 
leftist guerrillas who have fought salvadoran governments for 10 
years 
a spokeswoman for the activists who did not give her name told 
reporters earlier the purpose was to protest alleged human rights 
violations by cristianis rightist government which assumed power 
june 1 and bring pressure for concrete measures to end the war 
for eight years the federation has protested kidnappings and 
killings by rightist death squads of people suspected of leftist 
sympathies more than 70000 people have died in the war and 
related political violence most of them civilians

ptl founder jim bakker headed home to 
florida on friday to prepare for an appeal of his fraud and 
conspiracy conviction and the possibility he might be jailed later 
this month his lawyer said 
we got a lynch verdict defense lawyer george t davis said 
friday one of the happy things about this is that we werent 
strung up were alive and kicking and raring to go 
davis said the bakkers plan to suspend their storefront ministry 
in orlando for the time being to concentrate on the televangelists 
appeal bakker is free on 250000 bond pending his sentencing oct 
24 
were under some tight time restraints he said we have 
to anticipate the judge might refuse bail on appeal 
on thursday a federal jury found bakker guilty of all 24 counts 
of wire fraud mail fraud and conspiracy for bilking his followers 
of 37 million he faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in prison 
and fines of more than 5 million 
theyre doing well said davis who shared farewells 
thursday night with bakker and his wife tammy faye before 
returning to his home in hawaii i think jim has an inner peace 
theyre in the same mood im in for some strange reason we 
dont feel down 
following the verdict jury foreman ricky hill criticized the 
performance of bakkers defense team we kept looking for 
something from the defense and we never saw it he said 
after leaving ptl in march 1987 the couple began the jim and 
tammy ministries which runs a church in orlando and conducts a 
fivedayaweek evangelistic television show seen on eight cable 
outlets 
during fridays television show a standin for the bakkers 
urged the faithful to pray but didnt specifically mention the 
verdict 
an aide in orlando said bakker would address his followers on 
sunday 
it will be a regular church service said don baldwin 
acting general manager of jim and tammy ministries jim will be 
there i dont know exactly what all the plans are for it 
the bakkers left charlotte by car on friday they emerged from 
cocounsel harold benders office about 1230 pm and bakker 
grabbed some pillows as he joined his son jamie charles in the 
back seat of a ford taurus sedan 
mrs bakker slipped into the front passenger seat next to 
bakkers sister donna puckett who was driving 
davis said a key to the appeal will be the lack of any obvious 
signs of fraud in the government evidence 
there are no badges of fraud in this case no hidden bank 
accounts or false entries in false books davis said one of 
the key things on appeal is the fact that he actually received less 
than 1 percent of all the money he raised he raised about 450 
million for ptl 
bakker raised 158 million by selling lodging guarantees called 
lifetime partnerships at his heritage usa retreat near fort 
mill sc the indictment said he oversold the partnerships after 
he knew there werent facilities for the people who bought them 
justice department special prosecutor deborah smith said in a 
television interview friday that the conviction wasnt a reason to 
celebrate 
i think its very sad for his family very sad for him she 
said but she added that it was saddest for the thousands of people 
who sent money many of them their life savings 
bakker maintained his innocence after his conviction thursday 
i went into this courthouse several weeks ago saying i was 
innocent of the charges against me a smiling bakker said i 
come out still innocent of the charges against me i put my faith 
in god

the environmental protection agency ordered a 
62 million fine friday against a california company for allegedly 
storing more toxic wastes than it was authorized to handle 
the civil penalty the largest fine ever under federal toxic 
waste disposal laws was levied against casmalia resources of 
casmalia calif operator of a hazardous waste treatment storage 
and disposal facility 
the epa accused casmalia resources of accepting more hazardous 
waste materials than its existing landfills were authorized to 
handle 
the company also was charged with violating federal toxic waste 
regulations because it improperly expanded its existing landfills 
to accommodate additional wastes 
epa spokeswoman robin woods said the company must pay the fine 
within 30 days or appeal 
the penalty was based on an estimate on how much additional 
profits were earned because the company received the unauthorized 
waste shipments ms woods said the penalty amount could be changed 
as more information on the amount of profit becomes available to 
the agency 
prior to fridays action the largest penalty obtained by the 
epa for violation of the federal law governing toxic waste disposal 
was 278 million last march against the four county landfill in 
rochester ind that penalty came as a result of a federal judges 
ruling in a civil suit 
the fines were issued under the resource conservation and 
recovery act which established disposal and storage requirements 
for hazardous wastes 
meanwhile the epa announced friday it was establishing a new 
policy in the way it selects contractors for the socalled 
superfund program to avoid a potential conflict of interest that 
has been the subject of controversy 
the superfund program deals with the cleanup of nearly 1200 of 
the most dangerous hazardous waste sites in the country critics 
have charged that too often contractors who deal with actual 
cleanup activities also work for the epa on policy matters that 
determine how cleanup activities are to be conducted 
in some cases critics have charged a single contracting 
company may be in a position to virtually create a job for itself 
the epa said the new policy would prohibit contractors actually 
involved in cleaning up toxic waste sites or with providing 
technical assistance in enforcement actions from competing for 
contracts that deal with superfund policy and regulatory issues

members of the congressional black caucus 
friday accused sen orrin hatch of violating constitutional and 
civil rights in his complaint to the justice department about 
activities of the lobbying group transafrica 
but hatch rutah immediately backed down from his complaint 
and disassociated himself from it 
his press secretary paul smith quoted hatch as saying i 
called the attorney general and asked him to ignore the letter it 
was overzealousness on the part of my office 
hatch had written attorney general dick thornburgh on monday 
asking that he investigate the efforts of transafrica and its 
president randall robinson in support of angolan president 
eduardo dos santos and his sovietbacked government 
hatch charged in the letter that robinson was receiving 
financing from the angolan and cuban governments and was working to 
change us policy in direct coordination with the marxist regime 
in angola 
it appears that these activities may be a direct violation of 
the foreign agent registration act hatch wrote referring to the 
federal law requiring agents of foreign nations in the united 
states to register with the government 
i would like to request that you personally look into this 
matter hatch wrote mr robinson is actively working against 
the foreign policy interest of the united states and i believe 
this is a matter that deserves the attention of the department of 
justice 
a spokesman for thornburgh dan eramian said the department has 
received hatchs letter its under review he said 
robinson denied hatchs claims that the angolan and cuban 
governments finance his group and that a trip last week by 
transafrica officials to the angolan capital of luanda was paid for 
by angola 
in an interview he called hatchs letter an outrage and 
an attempt to intimidate me he said joseph mccarthy is 
alive and well in utah 
the black caucus prepared a letter friday voicing profound 
concern to thornburgh over hatchs request the letter was signed 
by rep ron dellums dcalif chairman of the group signatures of 
other black members of congress were being collected before the 
letter was sent 
in the letter the congressmen refer to hatchs letter as an 
attempt to curb and restrict the constitutional rights of 
transafrica 
we wish to place on the record our serious concerns regarding 
the violation of constitutional and civil rights reflected in 
senator hatchs letter to you they wrote 
transafrica is a lobbying group concerned with us policy 
toward africa and the caribbean and was a leader in pushing for 
tougher us sanctions against south africa it has worked to alter 
official us opposition to the angolan government and opposes the 
us support for jonas savimbi chief of the angolan rebel group 
unita 
savimbi met with president bush on thursday 
unita is one of the largest recipients of covert us military 
aid estimated by some observers at more than 40 million annually 
transafrica estimates the aid at twice that amount 
continuing support for savimbi has become a focus of some us 
conservatives including hatch 
robinson said the only money the group has received from angola 
and cuba were the purchases of tickets to the groups annual 
fundraising dinner at 2000 per table he said representatives of 
50 countries bought tickets but the group otherwise accepts no 
money from foreign governments

the bush administration on the eve of a march 
which looms as the largest housing protest since ronald reagan 
stiffened the governments helping hand promised friday to win 
this war against poverty homelessness and despair 
after meeting with march organizers for nearly three hours at 
his office housing secretary jack kemp signed a letter of 
understanding commiting the administration to several early steps 
designed to ease the dilemma of the homeless 
among those steps 
next year at least 10 percent of the singlefamily homes in 
the housing and urban development departments inventory will be 
made available for occupancy by the homeless hud now has about 
50000 such homes mostly from foreclosures meaning that about 
5000 would be assigned for use by those without shelter estimates 
of the nations homeless range from 250000 to 4 million 
the administration will propose changes in the 28 billion 
worth of community development block grants given to local 
governments each year so that they will be used to fight poverty 
increase selfsufficiency and opportunity in lowincome 
communities 
a vow to turn the abandoned homes throughout our cities and 
towns into decent affordable homes for the homeless and lowincome 
people kemp pledged to work directly and aggaressively with 
state and local governments to make this happen 
the secretary presented his letter to barry zigas president of 
the national lowincome housing coalition and a principal organizer 
of the threeday protest which already has bent and blistered the 
ears of congress zigas was accompanied by a halfdozen homeless 
people who shared their personal experiences with kemp 
i pledge to work directly with individuals and groups 
throughout the country to assure that huds programs properties 
and funds are used to expand opportunities for lowincome people 
and help make decent affordable housing a reality for all and to 
make it possible for all homeless men women and their families to 
live in a decent home said kemps letter 
in a handwritten ps kemp added that on this occasion of 
the war on poverty be assured of my desire to work full time to 
win this war against poverty homelessness and despair 
saturdays marchers are in part the hardcore homeless the 
flatbroke dwellers of heating grates and abandoned cars and 
cardboard boxes whose drained spirits and bodies are so baffling 
to visitors of wealthy america so disquieting to the bustling 
citizens who pass them by 
their plight is the most obvious but hardly the exclusive 
grievance of those who have gathered in washington to knock on the 
doors of congress and the administration the past two days 
organizers of the housing now effort hope to muster 100000 or 
more for a march and rally on the mall 
many of the demonstrators are the less visible homeless able 
but jobless adults with children who subsist on welfare and live in 
municipal shelters or dowdy motels 
many too are americas reluctant renters young workers 
struggling to secure their first mortgage to them the term 
affordable housing has become a contradiction in terms 
the protest is backed by more than 200 national organizations 
including the aflcio the us conference of mayors the ymca the 
ywca the national urban league catholic charities usa the 
southern christian leadership conference and the national 
organization for women dozens of state and local politicians are 
participating as well as scores of celebrity activists 
hundreds of the marchers already are footweary 
about 125 endured miserable weather and racial taunts on a 
backroads hike from roanoke va 240 people came by foot from new 
york city others from north carolina 
some are sleeping in churches and the homes of sympathizers 
some are camping here in tents in the parking lots of robert f 
kennedy stadium 
in one confrontation on the steps of the capitol members of 
congress were shouted down by protesters who chanted if you 
didnt walk you cant talk rep duncan hunter rcalif was 
nudged from the podium by a homeless marcher who declared 
its time we stand up and speak for ourselves we did not come 
here to listen to any tightcollared politicians its time they 
listen to us 
conservative groups countered with seminars and white papers 
extolling the promise of private enterprise for resolving the 
nations housing woes 
also irving welfeld a senior analyst in the department of 
housing and urban development told a conference friday that claims 
of a crisis in public housing are greatly exaggerated 
welfeld said there are 115 million vacant housing units in the 
united states of these 35 million are available to 
lowincome people he said or five to seven units for every 
homeless person 
he complained that there is a general attitude in this country 
that the sky is always falling somehow there is always a 
housing crisis 
according to the us conference of mayors there are an 
estimated 3 million homeless people in the united states that 
figure has been repeatedly cited by march organizers and members of 
congress but it is widely disputed the liberal urban institute 
for example said in 1988 that the homeless numbered no more than 
600000 
mitch snyder a washington activist for the homeless said 
friday we already have the attention of virtually everyone in 
america what we dont have is the kind of pressure focused on 
congress and the administration that translates out in a policy in 
money he commented on nbctvs today show 
snyder and other activists have complained that the reagan 
administration cut the budget authority for federal housing 
assistance programs by 77 percent from 32 billion to less than 
8 billion a year 
but the department of housing and urban development says that 
while budget authority the spending limit was lowered actual 
spending has risen almost 150 percent since 1978 
still huds own figures indicate that at least 25 million 
americans spend more than half their income on housing one in four 
eligible poor renters receives federal help 
some conservatives including former president reagan have 
argued that homelessness has little to do with federal budget cuts 
but results from addiction and the release of mentally disturbed 
people from institutions 
peter ferrara moderator of a conference friday at the cato 
institute said that you could build more public housing and 
these people would still be lying in the streets because they are 
unable to care for themselves 
activists for the homeless vehemently disagree with that 
portrayal saying it ignores the growing numbers of homeless 
children the childrens defense league puts that figure at up to 
750000 as well as the affordability problem for adults who are 
unemployed or underemployed 
according to a rutgers university report issued earlier in the 
week unlike the stereotype of the bowery bum or the lone 
drifter todays homeless are substantially functioning adults 
and families with children they are a crosssection of our poverty 
population 
on that score the national association of realtors says the 
ability of the typical american family to buy a home is at its 
lowest level in years harvards joint center for housing studies 
said the percentage of young families owning homes fell from 71 
percent in 1980 to 63 percent in 1988 
i think there are very broad agreements among reasonable 
people that youve got a big problem of affordability said 
stuart butler director of domestic policy studies for the 
conservative heritage foundation 
anthony downs of the more liberal brookings institution agreed 
those struggling to find adequate homes simply need more money 
he said what were talking about fundamentally is poverty

adm elmo r zumwalt jr whose son died of 
cancer after being exposed to agent orange that his father had 
ordered sprayed in vietnam has been named a senior adviser to 
veterans affairs secretary edward j derwinski the department said 
friday 
the appointment of zumwalt 68 is one of several steps the va 
department has taken under derwinski to address the concerns of 
veterans who have health problems that they say are linked to 
exposure to the defoliant 
the va said zumwalt will counsel on a variety of issues but 
the first on the agenda will be agent orange 
zumwalt who retired as chief of naval operations in 1974 was 
commander of incountry naval forces in vietnam in the late 1960s 
when agent orange was sprayed in the mekong delta 
his son elmo r zumwalt iii had served as a patrol boat 
commander at the same time he died in august 1988 of a form of 
cancer linked to agent orange exposure he was 42 
a grandson elmo russell zumwalt iv suffers from a congenital 
dysfunction of his physical senses agent orange has also been 
blamed for birth defects 
the father has said he still would have ordered spraying the 
defoliant because overall casualties were reduced 
the two cowrote a book my father my son about the 
experience it was later made into a television movie 
on monday the va department published regulations creating 
lessstringent guidelines for determining whether there is a link 
between agent orange exposure and a host of ailments a va panel 
will reexamine studies in november in light of the new guidelines 
government scientists have said there is no way of determining a 
positive link a position challenged by veterans groups and outside 
scientists the american legion for example has released a major 
study showing that exposure is related to benign fatty tumors 
adult acne skin rash with blisters several other ailments and an 
increased risk of miscarriages in wives of veterans 
although the study said it couldnt determine a link with cancer 
because the sample was too small the legion said the methodology 
proved such a study could be made 
the new regulations allow for a link to be established if 
studies permit the conclusion that it is at least as likely as 
not that the purported relationship between a particular type of 
exposure and a specific adverse health effect exists 
some 35000 veterans have filed agent orange claims but only 
five have been allowed because of the policy that no firm 
connection exists more than 230000 veterans have reported their 
exposure to the va about 26 million personnel served within the 
borders of south vietnam

pulitzer prizewinning journalist seymour hersh 
did not libel a former indian prime minister in a book that called 
the indian official a paid cia informant a federal jury found 
friday 
jurors deliberated less than six hours over two days 
morarji desai indias prime minister from 1977 to 1979 
contended hersh libeled him in his 1983 book the price of power 
kissinger in the nixon white house by writing that desai was a 
paid cia informant 
desais lawyer cyriac d kappil asked the sixmember jury to 
award 35 million to his client desai 94 and living in bombay 
is ill and did not appear at the trial 
its a terribly important victory for any journalist hersh 
said outside the courtroom after the verdict 
i think its going to make it easier for all the people in my 
profession he added nonetheless its also very chilling 
its also very frightening to realize that you can write things 
that can put you through a process like this 
kappil said he disagreed with instructions us district judge 
charles r norgle gave the jury after the threeweek trial the 
attorney said desais dispute centered on two chapters in the book 
but jurors were allowed to consider the whole book 
the book went in to the jury room in its entirety my 
lawsuit dealt only with chapter 32 and portions of 33 kappil 
said adding that jurors access to the book may have strengthened 
their belief the disputed chapters were factual 
he said he would confer with his client before deciding whether 
to appeal 
kappil said in closing arguments wednesday that hersh libeled 
desai by writing that he had been paid 20000 a year by the cia 
and been considered a valuable asset to the us government 
during the administrations of lyndon johnson and richard nixon 
with the stroke of a pen mr hersh assassinated his 
reputation his honor kappil said 
defense lawyer bernard j nussbaum countered that hersh had 
based his assertions about desai on consistent information from a 
halfdozen high level government sources 
when you have that kind of information doesnt the journalist 
have a responsibility to publish it nussbaum said wednesday 
to reach a finding that libel occurred jurors must conclude 
that hersh knowingly printed false material with malice or with 
reckless disregard for whether or not it was true 
kappil alleged that hersh fabricated notes to back up the 
assertions about desai and said the author knew the assertions 
were false 
it is entirely out of keeping with his career as a 
journalist nussbaum said 
hersh won the pulitzer prize for international reporting in 1970 
for his coverage of the my lai massacre in vietnam he was a 
reporter for the associated press and then the new york times and 
left the newspaper to pursue his own writing

freedom trains to west germany about 7000 more arrived last 
weekend on trains from prague and warsaw 
in all more than 47000 east germans have left their homeland 
through hungary poland and czechoslovakia since midseptember 
when reformist hungary sparked the exodus by opening its border to 
the west 
the new emigrants on the train from warsaw said the exodus was 
having severe effects on their homeland 
things are really bad in east germany said lutz kopecky 
29 there are towns without bakers and shopkeepers and theyre 
having trouble keeping supplies moving 
but kopecky like others leaving east germany said he felt he 
had to go because of the lack of democratic freedoms and slim 
chances that things will change soon 
some refugees told of reluctantly leaving relatives behind 
my son suddenly came down with a high fever so he and his 
mother stayed behind one saddened man said but i am going to 
go through the authorities to try to get them out 
other refugees said communist police some with attack dogs 
lined the route through east germany and that some train stations 
were surrounded by barbedwire fences 
the heavy security was apparently meant to prevent a repeat of a 
wednesday night riot in dresden east germany where thousands of 
people waited in hopes of boarding refugee trains but were forced 
away by police swinging clubs 
nonetheless a number of fridays arrivals told of a young east 
german couple and their child who succeeding in getting onto the 
train just before it left polish territory 
the train doors were locked tight but they were able to get 
in through a window one refugee said 
some people told of receiving help from poles in their efforts 
to join the exodus 
we drove to warsaw with mixed feelings said walter irmshar 
40 but after we got there the poles were so helpful they even 
showed us the way to the embassy 
the 633 refugees who were accompanied on the train by west 
german envoys cheered whistled and hugged each other when a local 
politician welcomed them as my countrymen 
im not the type who gets tears in my eyes but this time i 
felt something deep down said manfred mix a 36yearold refugee 
they looked wellrested and more relaxed than those who arrived 
earlier in the week from czechoslovakia 
west german officials and red cross workers had prepared 
temporary housing and other forms of care 
the journey came as east germany deeply embarrassed by the 
exodus began two days of celebrations marking its 40th anniversary 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev arrived in east berlin to 
mark the anniversary and expressed complete confidence in east 
germans ability to come to grips with the rising discontent he 
urged east germans to be patient 
flights to the west through hungary were continuing with 363 
east german refugees taking that route in the past 24 hours 
bavarian border officials said friday 
east germans began making their way west through hungary in may 
when that communist country removed obstacles from its border with 
austria since hungary officially opened its borders sept 10 
about 32000 east germans have used that route to west germany 
earlier this week east germany restricted travel to 
czechoslovakia in an attempt to staunch the flow of refugees and 
controls at east germanys border with poland have also been 
tightened 
polish border guards have turned back 407 east germans caught 
attempting to enter poland illegally since sept 18 the government 
said friday but more than 100 others have reached the west german 
embassy in warsaw

a lack of clear policy guidance from president 
bush was largely responsible for us confusion in dealing with 
tuesdays panamanian coup attempt senate armed services committee 
chairman sam nunn said friday 
meanwhile sen david boren chairman of the intelligence 
committee questioned whether bush was given enough information in 
the right context to make a crucial decision as the uprising took 
place 
us forces had information indicating troops loyal to gen 
manuel antonio noriega were being flown into tocumen airport 
several miles east of panama city tuesday morning but had no 
authorization to share that information with the rebels 
however said boren dokla the rebels believed the 
reinforcements were coming from another direction and had asked 
us forces to block two other roads they believed would be used by 
the loyalists leaving the airport road clear 
i just dont believe the information was distilled and 
presented to bush in a way that gave him an understanding of the 
yesorno decision he had to make on whether to authorize 
blocking of the airport road boren said 
boren also said no senior personnel from the central 
intelligence agency were present during white house meetings to 
deal with the coup on monday and tuesday 
nunn said there should have been definite arrangements for how 
us troops were to react in the event of a coup 
we have had a definite longstanding policy in this country of 
encouraging a coup in panama nunn dga told reporters we 
should anticipate that our policy might succeed then we have 
to know what were going to do next 
nunn who was among senators who met friday with defense 
secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff said many of the specific facts of the coup 
remained murky and were under continuing congressional 
investigation 
a report from the armed services and intelligence committees was 
being prepared but was expected to be delayed by declassification 
procedures at least until next week 
nunn complained there were no real plans as to how the people 
on the ground in panama were to react if a coup took place i 
do think there were implicit kinds of commitments made when we 
called for the overthrow 
had us officials known what questions to ask of the coup 
leaders and under what circumstances they were free to intervene 
the outcome might have been far different he said 
nunn said officials of the us southern command based in 
panama city should have been under standing instructions to 
determine the intent of any leaders of a coup did they intend to 
recognize and support the duly elected government which was thrown 
out by noriega did they want us intelligence data would they 
turn noriega over to us authorities 
on all of those questions american personnel groped throughout 
the morning tuesday until any opportunity for the united states to 
become involved evaporated nunn said 
if there had been clear answers the whole flow of events 
might have changed it would have put us in a totally different 
legal and moral position he said 
nunn said the united states failed to make proper use of its own 
intelligence by bringing appropriate officials together and pooling 
information flowing in from all sources the situation was further 
complicated by the simultaneous visit of president salinas of 
mexico and a senior soviet military official he said 
all of those entered into this and further underlined the 
need for advance policy setting and contingency planning said nunn 
on one disputed point whether the rebels asked for help in 
getting noriega out of the headquarters building where they held 
him nunn said he tended to accept cheneys version that no such 
request was made 
during a visit to capitol hill friday bush visited senate 
majority leader george mitchell to explain what he had known on 
tuesday when he decided not to commit us force to the coup 
attempt 
mitchell dmaine said he related to bush the concern many 
senators have about whether the united states passed up an 
opportunity to apprehend noriega but said bush and chief of staff 
john sununu emphatically and categorically denied such an 
opportunity existed

the ontario provincial government has averted a 
transit strike that could have disrupted traffic to sundays 
scheduled american league baseball playoff at the downtown skydome 
after an announcement from the ontario provincial government 
that backtowork legislation would be introduced tuesday union 
and management of the toronto transit commission announced that 
normal schedules would resume sunday 
gerry phillips the ontario labor minister said thursday the 
legislation would send the parttime employment issue to an 
independent fact finder who would report back in eight or nine 
months 
the normally efficient transit system has operated erratically 
for five weeks because of a work to rule slowdown by local 113 
of the amalgamated transit union 
a strike or management lockout sunday had appeared likely the 
union opposes management plans to hire 450 parttime workers to 
ease scheduling and take care of service at peak hours 
sundays game would be the fifth in the bestofseven playoff 
series between the toronto blue jays and oakland athletics who won 
the first two games at oakland 
this bill will get the parties back to work and give them the 
tools to solve the one remaining issue phillips said in a 
statement 
toronto residents have been allowing as much as 45 minutes 
extra travel time on the transit system which operates subways 
buses and streetcars 
the union had been planned to ignore new work schedules the 
transit commission was introducing sunday management threatened to 
shut down the system in response

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir asked 
the bush administration on friday to set up talks to break a 
deadlock on which palestinian arabs would participate in 
negotiations for selfrule on the west bank and in gaza 
shamir made the request after the israeli cabinet turned down 
by tie vote a labor party proposal for a meeting with egypt on the 
difficult issue he also offered assurances that israel had not 
closed the door on the peace process 
shamirs request for us intervention was aired in an interview 
with israel television and elaborated in discussions between us 
and israeli officials 
it represents an attempt to keep the process alive by having 
secretary of state james a baker iii set up threeway talks with 
egypt and israel on a principal sticking point 
that is whether two palestinians who were deported during the 
22month rebellion in the territories should be included in the 
palestinian delegation 
we await these proposals and when they arrive we will give 
them serious consideration shamir said according to israeli 
embassy spokeswoman ruth yaron 
meanwhile a us official who demanded anonymity said baker 
was considering the idea as well as other ways to set up 
israelipalestinian negotiations the official insisted the peace 
process was not at a dead end 
we are working hard and we are hopeful he said 
after the cabinets tie vote baker talked by telephone with 
israeli foreign minister moshe arens and egyptian foreign minister 
esmet abdelmeguid 
a state department spokesman richard boucher insisted israel 
had not rejected egyptian president hosni mubaraks 10point 
proposal our view is that the israeli cabinet has held a full 
discussion and neither accepted nor rejected the egyptian ideas 
he said 
mubarak had proposed negotiations in cairo between an israeli 
delegation and palestinians including two who were deported from 
the west bank during the rebellion against israeli control 
mubaraks approach also would require israel to concede in 
advance that it should relinquish territory on the west bank and in 
gaza as a basis for gaining peace with the arabs 
the egyptian leader put his proposal forward after the palestine 
liberation organization had declined to endorse a plan by shamir to 
hold elections among the 14 million palestinian arabs who live in 
the territories 
the elected palestinians then would negotiate with israel an 
interim fiveyear arrangement for local selfrule to be followed 
by wider negotiations on an overall middle east settlement 
after baker met last week in new york with arens and 
abdelmeguid he called on the israeli cabinet to decide how to 
move forward on the shamir proposal otherwise baker said at a 
news conference friday we will have to go back to the drawing 
board 
but after the israeli cabinet deadlocked us officials said 
there was no reason to start afresh instead the officials said 
baker intended to keep the discussions going while also seeking an 
accommodation between the shamir and mubarak approaches 
any conclusion that its over because it didnt happen today 
is just not right boucher said i dont think the secretary 
put any time limit on this 
the spokesman said baker was not planning to go to the middle 
east to continue the discussions 
baker endorsed the shamir plan after it was adopted by the 
israeli cabinet last may he has also praised the 10 points 
unveiled by mubarak last month but said they were no substitute 
for shamirs proposal 
on a related subject boucher confirmed reports that robert 
pelletreau jr the us ambassador to tunisia recently held two 
additional meetings with an official of the palestine liberation 
organzation 
the spokesman declined to disclose what they talked about 
the plo news agency wafa said the meetings concerned the 
efforts under way and the positions of the different concerned 
parties to realize a net gain in the peace process 
pelletreau has been meeting in carthage with plo officials since 
december the state department has given only skimpy reports of the 
sessions

the general assembly on friday condemned 
israels killing and wounding of defenseless palestinian 
civilians in revolt in the occupied territories 
a resolution denouncing israeli rule in the west bank and gaza 
strip passed by 140 votes with only israel and the united states 
voting against it all other western nations and japan voted for 
condemnation 
six nations abstained uruguay st vincent and the grenadines 
el salvador zaire antigua and barbuda and grenada 
conveniently absent from the resolution is any reference to 
the resort to violence by palestinian extremists said israeli 
ambassador johanan bein 
noting that at least 120 palestinians have been killed by fellow 
arabs who accused them of collaborating with israel bein said the 
residents of the occupied territories indeed they need 
protection palestinian citizens are being slain by plo 
terrorists 
bein denounced the palestine liberation organization for 
encouraging an arson campaign to set forest fires in the 
territories and israel 
the war by the plo is against the land itself and is nothing 
but wild destruction 
farouk khaddoumi the plos foreign secretary retorted that 
israel claims to be distressed about the trees that are being 
burned when children are being killed and children are being 
jailed by the thousands 
the secondranking us ambassador alexander f watson 
explained the negative american vote by saying resolutions 
incorporating onesided and unbalanced rhetoric do not help 
alleviate the conditions they purport to describe such 
resolutions only deepen divisions harden positions and poison the 
atmosphere 
the resolution expresses profound shock at the continued 
measures by israel the occupying power including the killing and 
wounding of palestinian civilians and the recent action of 
ransacking the houses of defenseless citizens in the palestinian 
town of beit sahour 
israel began tax raids on beit sahour on sept 20 and troops 
have confiscated at least 500000 worth of household goods and 
machinery 
the mayor of beit sahour hanna alatrash estimated that 90 
percent of the town has boycotted israeli taxes 
the general assembly resolution condemns such practices as 
the opening of fire by the israeli army and settlers that result 
in the killing and wounding of defenseless palestinian civilians 
the beating and breaking of bones the deportation of palestinian 
civilians and economic crackdowns 
israelis have killed more than 580 palestinians during the 
22monthold uprising against israeli rule of the west bank and 
gaza strip palestinians have killed more than 120 suspected arab 
collaborators and 40 israelis have died in the uprising 
about 17 million palestinians live in the occupied territories 
the general assembly took up the palestine resolution the same 
day that israels divided inner cabinet rejected an egyptian peace 
plan calling for talks with a palestinian delegation in cairo

mikhail s gorbachev advised east germans to be 
patient dont panic as he paid a 40th anniversary visit friday 
to a country torn by dissent and rejected by tens of thousands of 
citizens 
but in an apparent hint that east germanys aging leaders should 
soften their hard line he urged them to work with all forces in 
society to solve the countrys problems 
political suppression and authoritarianism have led to a growing 
number of opposition groups one delivered an appeal for help from 
gorbachev to the soviet embassy on friday 
police fought protesters in dresden and magdeburg and communist 
authorities barred western tourists from east berlin dissatisfied 
east germans continued fleeting to freedom in the west 
unconfirmed reports by the hamburg newspaper die welt and west 
germanys zdf television said east germany was building barbed wire 
fences on its borders with poland and czechoslovakia communist 
allies refugees have used to reach the west 
gorbachev expressed complete confidence in the leaderships 
ability to deal wtth discontent declaring we know our german 
friends well and their ability to think through problems to learn 
from life and to make corresponding political changes if they are 
necessary 
some in the crowd called out gorby help us gorby keep it 
up to the soviet leader whose reforms have been rejected by 
their government 
be patient dont panic and dont be sad we are very close 
partners and we will solve our problems and struggles together 
gorbachev told about 1000 east germans at a monument for victims 
of fascism 
were staying here several onlookers shouted 
speaking friday night to the party hierarchy and hundreds of 
invited guests gorbachev said we have heard demands such as the 
ussr should take down the berlin wall and then people could 
believe in the soviet unions peaceful aims our western partners 
should understand that questions regarding east germany are not 
solved in moscow but in berlin 
in appealing to the leadership gorbachev said there is no 
doubt that the socialist unity party has the intellectual 
potential rich experience and political authority to cooperate 
with all forces in society to answer the questions placed on 
todays agenda 
the public welcome for gorbachev appeared subdued in comparison 
with enthusiastic receptions in the united states west germany and 
elsewhere most people allowed on the downtown motorcade route were 
chosen by authorities 
erich honecker the wily 77yearold who has run the country 
for nearly two decades used his own speech to reaffirm the hard 
line and condemn international efforts toward the destabilization 
of socialism 
for the first time in recent memory east german television did 
not carry a live broadcast on the soviet leaders arrival 
asked if he thought the situation in east germany was dangerous 
he said i dont think so held up against our problems there is 
no comparison nothing surprises us anymore 
in a clear reference to opponents of his reforms gorbachev 
said those who grasp the impulse of society and base their 
policy on that have no reason to be afraid 
east berlin was decked with huge red banners flags and posters 
praising accomplishments of the communist nation founded oct 7 
1949 
honecker was reported gravely ill after gallbladder surgery in 
august asked about his health friday he replied with a smile 
people pronounced dead keep on living 
communist authorities closed at least three of the nine crossing 
points from west berlin to east berlin to western tourists on 
friday western allies strongly protested the closings saying it 
violated the right to free travel 
i wanted to see the celebration and all the communist hype 
im extremely disappointed joel gardner of washington dc 
said at checkpoint charlie 
church sources speaking to the associated press on the 
condition of anonymity said heavy police forces with clubs tear 
gas and water cannon patrolled through the countrys major cities 
following the clashes 
the sources said about 200 people had been arrested and at least 
four seriously injured in the clashes late thursday 
to squelch any further protests the communist leadership 
stepped up security nationwide while communist paramilitary 
workers groups in leipzig vowed to take up guns if needed to crush 
opposition movements 
west germanys zdf television and church sources reported 
clashes beteen protesters and police in dresden and magdeburg 
in magdeburg north of leipzig police clashed with about 600 
people who joined in a silent march through the city after a church 
prayer late thursday 
there was street fighting in dresden two times earlier this week 
as mostly young citizens hoped to board trains carrying other east 
germans to a new life in the west 
more than 47000 east germans have turned their backs to their 
communist homeland since midseptember in a mass exodus unseen 
since the berlin wall was constructed in 1961

friday from poland more than 360 others took advantage of 
hungarys openborder policy and arrived from there

discarding its oncesacrosanct policy of 
unilateral nuclear disarmament britains opposition labor party 
completed a transformation at its annual convention this week 
from rambunctious radical and noisily leftwing the socialist 
movement has shifted to the center spruced up its image dumped 
its old workingclass rallying cries and borrowed some of 
conservative prime minister margaret thatchers clothes 
the reward has been labors most commanding and consistent lead 
in polls since the party lost power to mrs thatcher a decade ago 
the price dismayed labor leftists complain has been the 
partys soul 
they the labor leaders aim to win by detaching the labor 
party as a whole former energy secretary tony benn doyen of the 
labor left complained during the weeklong party conference that 
ended friday in brighton 
but for the socialist anthem the red flag this years 
convention was scarcely recognizable as a british socialist 
gathering even the red flags were gone 
there were hardly any marxists shoving tracts at delegates no 
howling down of party leaders by leftwingers fewer jeans 
tshirts and banthebomb symbols more collars and ties more 
coiffured hairdos 
the turnaround on britains nuclear arsenal an issue that has 
bedeviled the labor party more than 30 years was endorsed with 
almost studied calm as part of a wholesale revamping of the party 
platform 
there was no hint of the uproar of 1981 when the convention 
moving left adopted the nonuclearweapons doctrine which played 
a key role in labors electoral defeats in 1983 and 1987 
there was none of the drama with which aneurin bevan an 
architect of the welfare state headed off unilateralism in 1957 
when he pleaded to the convention not to be sent naked into the 
conference chamber 
this year the 32 vote to ditch unilateralism was greeted with 
scattered applause a few scarcely audible boos and then silence 
it was a triumph for party leader neil kinnock the one time 
leftwinger and ardent antinuclear campaigner who has shifted 
markedly in the six years since he took over but it is only since 
1987 and labors third successive trouncing by mrs thatcher that 
he has succeeded in clamping down 
ours is the winning way declared 47yearold kinnock who 
aims to become prime minister by mid1992 the deadline for the 
next general election 
other key changes adopted by the convention included dropping 
commitments to renationalize most of the stateowned industries 
sold off by mrs thatcher and abolishing some but not all of 
the curbs she has imposed on trade union freedom 
the new policy calls for abandoning britains submarinelaunched 
nuclear missiles only as part of an international disarmament 
accord us bases will be allowed to remain in britain and a 
labor government would buy the us trident nuclear missiles 
ordered by the thatcher government 
it envisages a top income tax bracket of 50 percent compared 
with 83 percent when labor was last in government 
the conservatives who hold their convention next week dismiss 
the changes as public relations touches by an avowedly socialist 
party but they are clearly on the defensive 
inflation is above 7 percent the pound is weak and on 
thursday interest rates were hiked to 15 percent the 11th 
increase since june 1988 labor is 5 to 12 points ahead in polls 
denis kavanagh professor of politics at nottingham university 
noted that labors big problem was being associated with union 
power high taxation oldfashioned nationalism and weakness on 
defense 
these findings are not new kavanagh wrote in londons 
sunday times what has changed since 1987 is the leaderships 
determination to dump unpopular baggage

who attended the first festival in 1973 
at the swappin ground where the audience sat on bales of 
hay while listening to tales rodriguez told about three brothers 
who were quizzed about the meaning of easter 
one confused it with thanksgiving another halloween the third 
at least had jesus in his version but he believed that christ 
arose after three days and saw his shadow that meant six more 
weeks of winter 
jay stailey of texas told about a dog owner in upper level 
management for ibm who believed his pet had killed a neighbors 
beloved cat when the dog dragged the muddy corpse of the cat to 
his home the man cleaned it and took the dead animal back to its 
house 
the next day he discovered the cat had died two days earlier 
and had been buried the cats owner found it strange the cat 
suddenly appeared in its favorite sleeping spot

who told tales friday afternoon the regional contests were 
sponsored by the national association for the preservation and 
perpetuation of storytelling the group is also sponsoring the 
festival

to try to interest children in storytelling 
david holt a texas native now living asheville nc used a 
banjo as a prop while he told about uncle ike who had his banjo 
taken by a bear holt one of the 15 featured storytellers also 
told the fairy tale of sleeping beauty who pricked her finger 
on a spinning wheel and fell asleep for 100 years 
the first festival was held in this northeast tennessee 
community in 1973 and brought together four storytellers and 60 
people who listened to tales told from the back of a farm wagon at 
the washington county courthouse according to jimmy neil smith 
creator of the festival 
smith thinks storytelling has been revived in recent years 
because of disenchantment with television and radio we were 
overcome overwhelmed by those forces he said 
smith said organizers tried to bring together a diverse group of 
storytellers home for the featured storytellers include 
california minnesota nevada massachusetts and zimbabwe and 
scotland 
some storytellers came just to listen and wont be sharing their 
tales this weekend and some of the spectators may spin tales as 
well 
edward cattey and his wife barbara both retired teachers 
traveled to the festival from wallington conn for the third 
consecutive year

here are excerpts of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs speech to east german communist party and government 
officials friday at a celebration of the countrys 40th anniversary 
the event that we are commemorating today has great political 
meaning the creation of a workers state in the eastern part of 
germany has had a fundamental effect on the history of postwar 
europe and has influenced the course of world history 
in an historically short period the leadership of the german 
democratic republic brought about a deep social and economic 
restructuring by the 1960s the german democratic republic had 
found a firm place among the top 10 industrially developed nations 
of the world and its economy continues to grow and everyone knows 
the successes that have been achieved in everyday life 
of course the german democratic republic like all countries 
has its own problems of development demanding well thoughtout 
solutions they are determined by the internal needs of 
modernization and renewal which the whole socialist world has now 
gotten down to 
all governments are going through a process of integration 
restructuring of international politics and the economic order 
nobody can avoid taking part in the global problems and demands of 
the world technological revolution there is no doubt that the 
socialist unity party has the intellectual potential rich 
experience and political authority to cooperate with all forces in 
society to answer the questions placed on todays agenda 
the soviet union is sincerely interested that east germany 
continues to grow and develop 
the relationships between socialist countries are characterized 
by equality selfreliance and solidarity diversity is no obstacle 
and is in contrast a further important reason for the development 
of cooperation 
we have heard demands for example that the soviet union should 
tear down the berlin wall because only then could one finally 
believe in our peaceful intentions recently in west germany voices 
have been heard suggesting the reunification of germany within the 
borders of 1937 and silesia in poland also has been mentioned our 
western partners should understand that questions regarding the 
german democratic republic are solved not in moscow but in berlin 
the german democratic republic is a sovereign state which 
undertakes its own independent actions in defense of its interests 
and its domestic and foreign policy 
if one believes recent polls in west germany many young people 
believe that the soviet union was responsible for the division of 
germany after the war but they must be reminded that the soviet 
unions position was just the opposite it argued for the unity of 
germany 
we dont idealize the order that has come about in europe but 
the most important thing is that we now recognize the realities of 
postwar europe to ensure peace in europe 
every time the west has attempted to change the postwar map of 
europe it has led to renewed international tension and an increased 
danger of nuclear war and never contributed to a solution to actual 
problems that touched the interests of people 
we look optimistically at the chances for progress in european 
and world politics the agreements just reached in wyoming are good 
news for the world president bush in his speech to the united 
nations talked of his readiness to jointly work toward solving a 
broad range of international problems and undertakings that face 
us i welcome this announcement and attach great importance to the 
new sovietamerican summit meeting

the only bridge linking the mainland and 
two barrier islands reopened to limited traffic friday two weeks 
after hurricane hugo ripped the span apart 
traffic on the ben sawyer bridge was limited to one direction 
with the direction changing every two hours the bridge was 
scheduled to close at sundown and reopen saturday morning 
residents of isle of palms and sullivans island 10 miles 
outside charleston have used boats or taken ferries to their homes 
since the hurricane tossed one end of the swing bridge into the 
intracoastal waterway 
it was wonderful not to have to climb over rocks not to have 
to climb over docks and then get into a car said isle of palms 
mayor carmen bunch who was in the first car to drive over the 
bridge 
traffic was light during the first few hours the bridge was 
opened 
in fact the only people they are allowing are people that 
live on the island or have legal business said capt hg 
holloman of the state highway patrol 
officials from the two island communities agreed to close the 
bridge from 7 pm to 8 am until further notice to keep out those 
who do not live or work there the highway patrol monitored traffic 
while the islands police departments checked drivers licenses 
friday holloman said 
engineers were still inspecting the bridge though and it was 
not clear when it would be open to boat traffic on the intracoastal 
waterway 
so far repairs have cost 700000 to 1 million said brian 
ellison spokesman for the state department of highways and public 
transportation 
hugo hit the coast on sept 21 with 135 mph winds leaving at 
least 18 dead in south carolina and damaging and destroying homes 
businesses schools and municipal buildings in all 29 people were 
killed on the us mainland at least 33 wee killed in the 
caribbean 
gov carroll campbell said damage in south carolina was revised 
upward to 4 billion to 5 billion from a preliminary estimate of 
3 billion the new figure was based on discussions with county 
officials state department chiefs and emergency management 
officials said campbells spokesman tucker eskew 
the state department of insurance has estimated 317 billion in 
insured losses alone insurers expect to receive 350000 claims 
also friday president bush agreed to the governors request 
that the federal government pay a larger portion of the cost of 
cleanup and repairs saving state and local governments at least 
20 million in law enforcement road and bridge repairs cleaning 
debris water control on dams uninsured losses to public buildings 
and utility costs 
we know that we have a huge exposure and its going to save us 
lots of money campbell said 
cleanup costs in south carolina alone have been put at about 
217 million 
the state employment security commission on friday estimated 
south carolinas economy would lose 168 million if the 292000 
residents unemployed since hugo do not return to work after three 
weeks executive director robert e david said 
only about 33000 residences and businesses remained without 
power friday in the charleston and summerville areas with 
scattered outages in rural areas hardhit by the hurricane at one 
point nearly 1 million people in the carolinas were without power

one of the countrys largest advertising 
agencies was indicted friday on charges it paid nearly 1 million 
in bribes over five years to obtain and keep the jamaican tourist 
boards ad account 
a federal grand jury on friday returned the 43page indictment 
against young amp rubicam three of its current or former executives 
and two former jamaican officials said us attorney stanley a 
twardy 
the indictment alleges that starting in 1981 and continuing for 
the next 5 years two young amp rubicam executives funneled payments 
through arnold foote jr a jamaican businessman to eric anthony 
abrahams who was jamaicas minister of tourism at the time 
both foote and abrahams were charged with racketeering twardy 
said his office working with the us state department will seek 
their extradition 
young amp rubicam along with executive arthur r klein and former 
executive thomas spangenberg were charged with racketeering and 
conspiracy to violate the foreign corrupt practices act steven m 
mckenna another yampr executive was charged with perjury 
the new yorkbased agency which developed the come back to 
jamaica ad campaign and still holds the account denied any 
impropriety 
we are shocked and dismayed by this move we believe these 
allegations are based on speculation and innuendo and are without 
substance or merit young amp rubicam said in a 2page statement 
friday 
the company with annual billings of more than 5 billion is 
the largest privately held advertising firm in the country its 
clients include kraft general food kentucky fried chicken colgate 
and dr pepper 
the jamaica account is relatively small twardy said it amounted 
to 29 million over five years and the company said friday it 
represents less than one onethousandth of the companys worldwide 
billings 
federal prosecutors opened the investigation in 1986 after 
reading diaries seized from author robin moore formerly of 
westport conn during an investigation into phony tax shelters 
twardy said 
moore author of bestsellers such as the green berets and 
the french connection pleaded guilty in 1986 to unrelated tax 
charges and cooperated fully in the young amp rubicam investigation 
twardy said 
twardy said moore who has business interests in jamaica dating 
back 40 years was an essential gobetween a middleman who 
knew about the scheme and profited from it he will not be charged 
twardy said 
he was forthcoming as to his knowledge of all illegal 
activities including this one twardy said 
twardy said the kickback scheme took shape shortly after 
abrahams became tourism minister according to the indictment 
abrahams summoned an advertising executive to his office and asked 
him how the previous administration had handled kickbacks when 
told there had been none abrahams responded things may be 
different in the new administration the indictment said 
according to the indictment moore and an associate frederick 
sturges set up the initial meetings between the jamaicans and 
young amp rubicam executives 
twardy said the company agreed to take the account for a 15 
percent commission 2 percent more than the jamaican government 
had previously paid agreeing at the same time to kick back 
onethird of the commission to abrahams and foote 
most of the alleged payoffs were routed through a sham 
advertising firm set up by foote that had secret caribbean bank 
accounts twardy said 
foote is described in the indictment as a prominent citizen with 
close political ties to the administration of prime minister edward 
seaga who took office in 1980 
the indictment does not trace any of the money directly to 
abrahams who was tourism minister from 1980 to 1985 and was a 
member of the jamaican parliament from 1980 to 1986 asked if the 
investigation had done so twardy responded we can trace it but 
its not in the indictment and its not appropriate for me to 
comment on it 
at the time of the alleged offenses klein was an executive vice 
president spangenberg was a vice president and mckenna was a 
senior vice president one of the three spangenberg is no longer 
with the company twardy said 
in its statement the company also said that foote and abrahams 
both steadfastly denied that money from young amp rubicam went 
through footes company to abrahams 
the company said it conducted its own internal investigation and 
found no illegal acts 
if convicted on all counts klein and spangenberg face up to 25 
years in jail and fines of up to 500000 twardy said mckenna 
faces up to five years in jail and a fine of up to 250000 young 
amp rubicam faces up to 1 million in fines and forfeiture of about 
375 million it made from the jamaican contract 
abrahams and foote both face 20 years and up to 250000 in 
fines

leaders of israels coalition government cast a 
tie vote friday in effect a rejection on an egyptian plan to hold 
israelipalestinian talks in cairo as a step toward reviving middle 
east peace efforts 
some ministers in the labor party which backed egypts 
proposal said the leftcenter party should leave the coalition 
with prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc labor 
party leader shimon peres said it will be considered 
in washington us officials said secretary of state james a 
baker iii was seeking to keep negotiations alive they said that 
after the israeli cabinet vote baker talked by telephone with 
israeli foreign minister moshe arens and egyptian foreign minister 
esmet abdelmeguid 
israels policymaking inner cabinet of 12 members voted 66 
along party lines on a labor motion to accept the proposal by 
president hosni mubarak of egypt egypt is the only arab country to 
sign a peace treaty with israel a tie vote amounted to rejection 
mubaraks plan was to hold talks about the israeli proposal that 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip elect delegates for 
negotiations with israel 
likud objects to the mubarak suggestion that former residents of 
the occupied lands be included in the palestinian delegation to 
cairo talks 
shamir told members of the inner cabinet that acceptance of 
exile delegates would bring the plo into the peace process and 
israel would have entered into the peace process which could lead 
to a palestinian state 
defense minister yitzhak rabin of labor said of the vote 
israel today suffered a severe setback i am very 
disappointed 
palestine liberation organization representative nabil shaath 
said in cairo the rejection brought peace efforts back again to 
stagnation 
abdelmeguid was less pessimistic saying without elaboration 
that consultations are under way with the united states and 
israel he spoke with reporters in cairo 
state department spokesman richard boucher insisted israel had 
not rejected mubaraks proposal our view is that the israeli 
cabinet has held a full discussion and neither accepted nor 
rejected the egyptian ideas he said in washington 
baker met last week in new york with arens and abdelmeguid he 
urged the israeli cabinet to move forward on the shamir 
proposal and at a news conference friday he said if the cabinet did 
not we will have to go back to the drawing board 
but after the tie vote us officials said there was no reason 
to start afresh instead baker intends to keep the discussions 
going while seeking an accommodation between the shamir and mubarak 
approaches they said 
boucher said any conclusion that its over because it didnt 
happen today is just not right i dont think the secretary put any 
time limit on this 
after the cabinet meeting shamir said bakers efforts could 
restart the peace process 
there is an american idea maybe even a proposal for some kind 
of a meeting with the arabs of judea samaria and gaza in better 
circumstances for us shamir said on israel televsion using the 
biblical names of judea and samaria for the occupied west bank 
after the inner cabinet vote police minister chaim barlev of 
labor said he believed time had run out for the 10monthold 
national unity coalition labor has threatened previously to 
leave the goverment over the peace stalemate 
peres told reporters friday i dont know if i will recommend 
leaving the government or other steps but its clear that this 
requires us to draw conclusions 
mubarak also urged three other steps that likud opposed and 
labor favored endorsement of the usbacked concept of trading 
land for peace a freeze on building jewish settlements in the 
occupied territories and participation in the elections by arabs 
in east jerusalem which the government has declared part of israel 
the israeli initiative which the government endorsed in may 
calls for the election of palestinians to negotiate an interim 
autonomy agreement with israel the final status of the occupied 
lands would be determined later

the largest decline in payrolls at auto plants 
and other factories in nearly seven years helped push the nations 
jobless rate to 53 percent in september the government said 
friday in a report showing unexpected softness in the economy 
the civilian unemployment rate was up from 52 percent in both 
july and august the labor department said in the first 
comprehensive look at the economy last month 
nonfarm employers told the government they added a seasonally 
adjusted 209000 jobs in september more than double a revised 
88000 in august but nearly all of the growth can be attributed 
to two special factors teachers returning to their classrooms and 
75000 telephone workers ending a strike analysts said 
this report is the first in quite a while that suggests the 
economy could be heading for a tailspin said economist allen 
sinai of the boston co another report like this one would 
begin to cause a good deal of worry 
manufacturers reported a loss of 103000 jobs including 33000 
at auto plants it was the biggest drop since november 1982 at the 
end of the last recession payrolls either declined or were flat 
within all manufacturing industries except food processing 
the most disturbing feature of septembers business survey 
data was the large decline in manufacturing employment 
commissioner of labor statistics janet l norwood told congress 
joint economic committee real growth in overall factory 
employment ended last march since then we have lost 135000 
factory jobs 
unemployment in michigan home of many auto plants leapt from 
69 percent in august to 81 percent last month the highest among 
11 large industrial states surveyed 
reacting to the data the stock market rallied brokers took 
sluggish job growth as a sign that the federal reserve board has 
more leeway to lower interest rates the dow jones average of 30 
industrials rose 1196 to 278552 
early last year the fed embarked on a yearlong program of 
raising interest rates to slow the economy and cool inflationary 
pressures 
then after signs of sluggishness emerged this spring 
particularly in interestratesensitive sectors such as 
construction and auto manufacturing the central bank nudged rates 
down a bit hoping to keep the nation from toppling into a 
recession 
data for july and august indicated the fed appeared to be 
getting what it wanted slower but sustained growth however 
with fridays employment report some analysts said the fed which 
hasnt loosened credit since midjuly must do more to guard 
against a downturn 
i have felt the federal reserve for some time has been less 
worried about deflation and unemployment than it should be said 
jeffrey faux president of the economic policy institute a 
unionfunded think tank i just think theyre courting 
disaster 
according to minutes released friday of an aug 22 meeting 
federal reserve policymakers were satisified with the moderate pace 
of growth and convinced that the economy was not as week as feared 
only months earlier 
meanwhile in a separate report the federal reserve said friday 
that americans took out 348 billion more in consumer debt than 
they retired in august resuming their borrowing practices after 
reducing their debt 09 percent in july the first decline in 2 
years 
overall the unemployment rate has changed little over the last 
12 months a year ago it was 54 percent moving down to a 15year 
low of 50 percent in march since then it has fluctuated narrowly 
between 51 percent and 53 percent 
in september 1175 million americans held jobs and 66 million 
were looking for work essentially unchanged from august 
however in a worrisome sign the government said for the first 
time in 6 years more industries lost jobs than gained indicating 
that weakness is spreading more generally throughout the economy 
the jobless rate reported by the labor department is derived 
from a survey of american households a separate survey of 
businesses provides the job growth figures 
september job growth was artificially bolstered by the return of 
striking telephone workers but in the household survey strikers 
are counted as employed so their return did not affect the 
unemployment rate 
of the 95000 government jobs added 87000 were at local 
governments a swing the labor department attributed largely to the 
end of summer vacation for school employees 
average hourly earnings of nonfarm workers rose 05 percent to 
973 last month after holding steady in august for the year 
ending in september average hourly earnings increased 38 percent 
well behind the rate of consumer price inflation 
the average manufacturing work week and factory overtime edged 
up 01 hour to 410 and 38 hours respectively offsetting small 
declines in august 
here are the september unemployment rates for some demographic 
groups listed in the labor departments report compared with 
august 
adult white men 42 percent up from 38 percent 
adult white women 38 percent down from 41 percent 
white teenagers 121 percent down from 128 percent 
blacks 116 percent up from 111 percent 
adult black men 100 percent up from 98 percent 
adult black women 96 percent up from 94 percent 
black teenagers 373 percent up from 316 percent 
hispanics 83 percent down from 90 percent 
in a separate calculation that includes military personnel 
stationed in the united states the labor department said the 
unemployment rate was 52 percent up from augusts 51 percent

the white house and senate democrats neared a 
deal friday to speed work on a deficitreduction bill by keeping it 
free of controversial specialinterest provisions including 
president bushs proposed capital gains tax cut 
late in a day of publicly made offers and counteroffers private 
meetings and news conferences senate leaders of both parties had 
come close to agreeing to a democratic proposal for a strippeddown 
budget bill 
in exchange democrats would agree to guarantee a separate vote 
on capital gains in the next few weeks republican supporters of a 
capital gains tax cut believe they would win such a vote 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said 
republicans still wanted democratic leaders in the house which has 
already passed its own version of a capital gains reduction to 
promise to work out a compromise bill with the senate a meeting 
among house and senate leaders was scheduled for saturday 
i think were pretty close to an agreement bentsen said 
friday morning bush traveled to capitol hill to discuss the 
situation with senate republicans 
capital gains is vital he said before the meeting its 
not an extraneous matter with me 
the senates majority democrats who first offered to pare down 
the bill thursday night said debate on the measure would begin 
with an unusual saturday session 
in a latenight session this week the senate finance committee 
approved a package of revenue increases raising 37 billion over 
the next five years the panel then voted to help dozens of 
interest groups by granting them 28 billion in tax cuts or other 
benefits 
democrats argued that stripping down the bill to its 138 
billion in revenues and spending cuts for next year is the only way 
to quickly pass it unless the measure is approved by oct 16 
which until now has been considered unlikely the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law will automatically impose acrosstheboard 
cuts on defense and many domestic programs 
the democratic proposal positioned them to blame the gop for 
forcing lengthy debate on a needlessly complex bill thus 
triggering the automatic cuts 
theyre putting the issue of capital gains ahead of meeting 
the targets of grammrudman and delaying the laws spending cuts 
said bentsen 
bentsen said he has offered to drop his own proposal to restore 
individual retirement account benefits from the bill if the capital 
gains effort is also abandoned 
republicans however were unwilling to consent to the 
democratic plan unless the democrats agreed to a senate vote on 
cutting the capital gains rate which was a major plank in bushs 
election campaign last year 
its been part of the process from the very beginning said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater its already passed the 
house and we believe now is the time to include it in the bill 
for their part democrats seemed reluctant to promise such a 
vote both bentsen and senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine declined to predict whether the senate would adopt a 
capital gains cut if it came to a vote 
the house approved its own version of the deficitreduction bill 
thursday on a 33391 vote a measure that included a temporary 
reduction in capital gains tax rates 
gop lawmakers who attended the capitol meeting with bush gave 
differing accounts afterward of whether bush would agree to forgo a 
vote on capital gains until some other time 
sen pete domenici rnm said bush wants capital gains in 
this package but sen john chafee dri said if bush was 
promised a future vote thats obviously something hell have to 
consider 
for procedural reasons capital gains supporters would 
apparently need 60 votes to prevail if the provision is part of the 
deficitreduction bill only 51 votes would be necessary if it was 
freestanding legislation 
capital gains which are profits from the sale of investments 
now are fully taxed at the same rates as other income under the 
housepassed bill the top rate of 33 percent would be cut to 196 
percent until 1992 when it would be raised to 28 percent and 
indexed to avoid taxing gains arising solely from inflation 
sen bob packwood rore has proposed a capital gains plan 
under which the longer an investment was held the less of its 
profits would be taxed when sold he wants to substitute his 
proposal for the democratic ira restoration 
packwoods plan which failed in the senate finance committee on 
a 1010 vote earlier this week is expected to be the starting 
point for whatever plan the senate considers

the alleged manager of a los angeles warehouse 
where raiders seized the largest cocaine haul ever told drug agents 
that 60 tons of the drug passed through in the last year alone a 
prosecutor said friday 
james mctague also identified the leader of the drug ring as 
rafael munoz a mexican who lives in juarez according to an 
affidavit filed in us district court in los angeles and unsealed 
here 
the disclosures came during an identity and bail hearing for 
carlos tapia ponce and his son hector tapia anchondo who 
authorities claim ran the us leg of the smuggling operation 
us magistrate lawrence leavitt citing a serious risk of 
flight ordered the tapias held without bail pending their return 
to los angeles to face narcotics charges leavitt set a preliminary 
hearing wednesday 
mctague married to tapia anchondos sister was identified in 
the affidavit as the manager of the warehouse in sylmar where 
authorities last week found 19 tons of cocaine and 122 million in 
cash 
he indicated that since he had been in charge they had moved 
60 tons of cocaine through the warehouse said tom green an 
assistant us attorney the ledgers showed that 80 million cash 
had gone through his hands since hed been involved 
green said mctague arrested along with three others in the los 
angeles raid told drug enforcement administration agents he was 
hired a year ago to run the warehouse the building was rented by 
tapia ponce beginning in december 1987 for 1700 a month 
he said mctague told agents after his arrest they could find the 
tapias at a las vegas hotel where they were vacationing with 
family members 
these two individuals were identified as the operators of the 
organization by mctague green said 
an informant alerted authorities to activities at the warehouse 
and surveillance began only two days before the raid dea special 
agent james l capra said in the affidavit 
authorities initially said they found 20 tons of cocaine 
estimated to have a street value of between 2 billion and 20 
billion but green said friday that after weighing the drugs the 
final figure was about 19 tons 
the 66yearold tapia ponce a mexican national admitted to 
agents when arrested that he was involved in narcotics trafficking 
and that he had been paid 5000 a trip to bring 100 kilos of 
cocaine over the border near el paso several times a week green 
said 
defense attorney david chesnoff didnt ask bail for tapia ponce 
but argued that his son should be granted bail because he was 
linked to the drug activity only by mctagues statements a picture 
of tapia ponce was found in the warehouse 
chesnoff said the 38yearold tapia anchondo a resident alien 
lives in el paso with his wife and 2yearold child and makes his 
living on a ranch in mexico he described him as a college graduate 
working on a masters degree in psychology 
there is no record hes ever been in california or had 
proprietary interest in cocaine chesnoff said 
but green described both men as the top hierarchy of a ring 
that transported several thousand pounds of cocaine a week from el 
paso to los angeles in semitrailers then sold it at 100 to 500 
pounds a deal from the warehouse 
green said both men probably will be charged with running a 
continuing criminal enterprise and under federal guidelines face 
a minimum of nearly 20 years in prison without possibility of 
parole if convicted 
theyre virtually facing the rest of their lives in prison and 
they have every reason to flee green said in support of bail 
denial 
in los angeles meanwhile a prosecutor dismissed drug charges 
against mctague and three others to turn the four over to federal 
authorities for prosecution 
they would be jailed under a federal hold order until they could 
be arraigned probably tuesday said grace denton a spokeswoman in 
the us attorneys office 
deputy district attorney curt hazell who dismissed the state 
charges said the maximum punishment under state law is 20 years in 
prison of which offenders usually serve 10 in federal court the 
four if convicted would face a maximum of life in prison without 
the possibility of parole he said

an immigration judge ordered political 
asylum for two prodemocracy chinese students saying they would 
undoubtedly suffer the same fate as the martyrs of tiananmen 
square if returned to china 
the ruling released friday is the first decision made public 
by us immigration officials stemming from the chinese 
governments crackdown on protesters in early june which resulted 
in the deaths of hundreds possibly thousands of people in beijing 
the students who are engaged to be married took part in a 
protest against the crackdown in tokyo and fled to the united 
states on aug 7 saying they had received threatening telephone 
calls 
until china changes its policy of death fear and terror 
against dissidents foreign students involved in the 
democratization movement should not be forcibly returned to red 
china by the government of the united states said immigration 
judge bernard hornbach 
this is a turning point in our lives one of the students 
luo jian guang said in chinese at a news conference as 
interpreted by his lawyer eugene wong 
i came to this country and for the first time am breathing the 
air of freedom luo 32 said 
i am very happy his fiancee hoy yu yi 27 said in 
english wong interpreted another of her statements as saying she 
was taught in china that america is a cold and inhuman society 
and was pleased to discover otherwise 
hornbachs ruling would allow the couple to seek permanent 
resident status its legal conclusions are not binding on other 
immigration judges unless it is appealed by the government and 
upheld by the board of immigration appeals 
were reviewing the decision to determine what action if any 
were going to take said david ilchert district director of the 
immigration and naturalization service 
wong said the decision if it became a precedent could help 
other chinese students living overseas including some 73000 in 
the united states but he said he did not expect a wave of asylum 
applications in part because president bush has given usbased 
chinese students an additional year of protection against 
deportation 
wong said the us government had formally opposed asylum before 
the hearing but did not contradict testimony by a scholar a 
journalist and others about the dangers to dissidents in china 
crucial points for hornbachs ruling 
the ruling contrasted with decisions by immigration judges that 
have rejected all but a fraction of applications for asylum by 
refugees from el salvador and guatemala 
in those cases the us government has generally denied that 
central americans face a provable danger if deported and has 
argued that they entered the united states for economic rather than 
political reasons 
luo an international business student and ms hoy studying 
linguistics attended a protest rally outside the chinese embassy 
in tokyo on june 4 the second day of the killings in and around 
beijings tiananmen square both signed a petition that was 
delivered to the embassy and said their pictures were taken by 
embassy officials 
after the demonstration they said they got anonymous phone 
calls telling them they would face the consequences when they 
returned to china 
after arriving in the united states both were jailed initially 
and later released on 5000 bail they said they plan to study 
english look for work and marry soon

when 15yearold anthony lopez dared his 
captor to shoot him he didnt think he would be taken seriously or 
that the gun was real moments later he felt pressure in his face 
i chuckled and he shot me right there lopez said from his 
hospital room i heard the fire and saw the sparks it didnt 
hurt 
lopez wasnt the only loara high school student held hostage 
during drama class thursday who thought the armed student was just 
kidding and trying to get attention when he took over the class 
the armed youth identified as cordell cory robb joked 
during the siege at one point referring to himself as the dirty 
harry with acne and offering classmates sips of his cocacola 
then they saw lopez get shot in the face 
when he shot blood went all over the place all over the 
tiles and carpet said diana rankin 14 everyone was crying 
and screaming 
lopez 15 was in fair condition friday said fran tardiff 
spokeswoman at the university of california irvine medical center 
friends and acquaintances said robb 15 was a frequent reader 
of stephen king horror novels and wasnt taken seriously because he 
made threats before he had threatened to commit suicide and take a 
class hostage they said 
he said he was going to hold hostage a drama class second 
period said friend faye peterson he said there were people in 
the class he didnt like i guess they bugged him 
last month a 17yearold high school student in kentucky held 
11 of his classmates hostage in what police said was a plot 
directly from kings novel rage no one was injured during the 
daylong standoff 
classmates said robb was also fascinated with the movie 
heathers in which a troubled teenager named jd kills the 
popular kids at school the sarcastic antihero dies when he tries 
to blow up his school 
mike berault 14 who described himself as robbs best friend 
said the youth thought jd was cool 
robb himself was described as anything but cool and most 
classmates saw him as an outsider 
a lot of kids teased him they made fun of him and called him 
names i guess they thought he was strange said miss peterson 
people called him psychopath 
friends said robb was haunted by memories of his father ronald 
eugene robb the teen said his father committed suicide 
he also had a strained relationship with his stepfather 
it was a conflict all the time said carol sharkey who 
babysat for robb until he was 14 cory said his dad was real 
strict 
hostages said robb asked a police negotiator to bring his 
stepfather to the school auditorium 
officer steve stempniak was the negotiator who calmly talked the 
boy into giving up when i was putting the cuffs on him i guess 
it finally hit me just what could have happened the 11year 
police veteran said 
robb was being held friday in a juvenile facility awaiting 
charges 
nina sartore 16 said she has known robb since grammar school 
and wasnt really surprised when she heard what happened 
truthfully hes got a lot of problems i kind of expected 
something like this for him to flip out she said i tried 
to help him he didnt want the help

the soviet union on friday called for a 
treaty giving the world court binding authority to settle 
international disputes 
if negotiation or mediation did not succeed within a 
reasonable period of time any party to a dispute could take the 
matter to arbitration said the plan submitted by vladimir 
petrovsky a deputy foreign minister 
currently decisions by the uns world court at the hague 
formally known as the international court of justice are only 
advisory unless a nation agrees to the courts authority in a 
particular case or area of law 
dmitri m bykov a soviet deputy permanent un representative 
told reporters the proposal should be a treaty an international 
agreement 
the proposal called for nations in dispute to open negotiations 
and ultimately to resort to procedures which entail binding 
decisions that is submit the dispute at the request of either of 
the parties to it to arbitration or judicial proceedings 
in this connection the international court of justice will 
be enhanced says the soviet plan 
president mikhail s gorbachev called last december for a 
comprehensive strengthening of international law 
us state department legal officers responded to his appeal by 
opening negotiations with the soviets on various areas of 
international law but washington has not endorsed the whole 
package proposed by the soviets 
at a meeting last month soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze and secretary of state james a baker iii agreed both 
nations should obey the world court in cases not involving national 
security 
that would exclude cases like nicaraguas 1986 dispute with 
washington in which the leftist sandinista government contended 
the united states was illegally mining its harbors and supporting 
the contra rebels the us government refused to honor a world 
court ruling that sided with the sandinistas 
washington accepts world court rulings under about 60 treaties 
dealing with a range of diplomatic and commercial rights 
for 40 years the soviets rejected the courts authority but 
moscow reversed its policy under gorbachev 
the soviet union said in march it will obey the courts rulings 
in human rights treaties condemning genocide banning traffic in 
prostitution and other forms of slavery guaranteeing political 
rights for women banning racism and outlawing torture

two burmese students demanding 
democracy in their militaryruled homeland hijacked a jetliner 
carrying 83 other people but surrendered peacefully early saturday 
to thai authorities 
the hijackers commandeered the burmese fokker 28 friday while it 
was on a domestic flight from mergui burma to the capital of 
rangoon they forced the plane to land in neighboring thailand at 
the military airport at utaphao 80 miles southeast of bangkok 
at one point the hijackers threatened to blow up the plane but 
made no other threats after their deadline passed 
they had demanded the release of political prisoners an end to 
military rule and the restoration of democracy in burma 
no passenger list was issued but it was believed all aboard 
were burmese nationals because foreigners are barred from mergui 
the hijackers released 35 hostages friday night and then the 48 
other passengers and crew early saturday after negotiations with 
thai and burmese authorities 
early reports had said at least one of the hijackers had a hand 
gregnade and that a box possibly contained explosives but hours 
later authorities would not say if the sky pirates were armed thai 
explosives specialists checked the plane and took away the 
suspicious box for examination 
the burmese government rejected all of the hijackers demands 
and before the two men surrendered one gave a written statement 
containing seven demands to a reporter who read the list to other 
journalists gathered around the plane 
i can say all are free and the plane and passengers will go 
to burma this morning except the two hijackers who are in thai 
custody aug gyi a counselor at the burmese embassy in bangkok 
said 
thai government spokeman likit hongladarom identified the two 
hijackers as ye yin and ye thi ha and said they wanted their 
damands published by the press he noted those names mean brave 
and lion and said they probably were pseudonyms 
thai officials gave this account of the drama 
the fokker landed at utaphao at 540 pm friday the hijackers 
released 35 hostages but threatened to destroy the plane if burma 
refused their demands 
after further negotiations led by thai deputy prime minister 
tienchai sirisunpan one of the hijackers left the aircraft and had 
a reporter read a handwritten statement that began gentle 
government please help us 
but the statement also said if negotiations failed the hijackers 
would kill the passengers destroy the aircraft and commit suicide 
after the note was read the remaining 44 passengers disembarked 
at about 425 am saturday the hijackers four crew members and 
tienchai left the plane and nine navy commandos entered the craft 
to conduct a search they removed the box that it was believed 
could obtain explosives 
inside the plane a felt pen had been used to scribble such 
slogans as our heads are bloody but unbowed and democracy 
and human rights for our people 
a thai navy spokesman lt somchai kaewvibunphan said during 
the initial negotiations one of the two men who hijacked the plane 
was seen in the doorway of the aircraft holding what appeared to be 
a hand grenade 
among the hijackers demands were the release of opposition 
leader aung san suu kyi an end to the curfew and a democratic 
government 
mrs suu kyi a daughter of the late national hero aung san was 
placed under house arrest july 20 after speeches denouncing the 
government her national league for democracy is the largest 
opposition party in burma 
burmas official news agency in a brief report said there were 
three hijackers among the 81 passengers along with a pilot 
copilot and two flight attendants and the sky pirates ordered the 
pilot at gunpoint to fly to thailand thai officials said two men 
hijacked the craft 
burmese students were at the forefront of an uprising for 
democracy in burma last year that was crushed by the military on 
sept 18 1988 
in recent months the government has intensified its crackdown on 
dissident groups and western diplomats say that several thousand 
members of opposition groups have been arrested since july 
thailand has attempted to establish good relations with the 
military government in rangoon and has made several deals to 
exploit burmas timber and fishery resources these links have been 
criticized by burmese activists who want the international 
community to isolate the military government 
it was the first known hijack of a burmese aircraft in recent 
decades 
in 1952 one of burmas numerous rebel groups forced a pilot to 
land his domestic dc3 at gunpoint and made off with a bundle of 
cash destined for government employees

project elf the navys 400million web 
of antennas allowing communication with submerged submarines 
worldwide went into operation friday after more than a quarter 
century of planning protests and revisions 
elf which stands for extremely low frequency transmission has 
been tested for two years at ki sawyer air force base near 
marquette full power testing began in may 
ten years ago elf was envisioned as an underground grid of 
about 2000 square miles designed to survive an enemy bomb 
the navy later said even such a grid would be unlikely to 
survive a nuclear attack todays unit resembles a utility power 
line 
ceremonies at sawyer friday commemorated the system coming on 
line and gave it a new name the naval communications unit 
marquette the unit will work with a similar facility in clam lake 
wis 
some of the more than 60 environmental and health tests that 
have been conducted will continue including monitoring of the four 
mouse motel compounds where mice have been living with no 
apparent harm from the transmissions 
woodpeckers occasionally drill holes in the 1492 pine poles 
holding the transmission cables and the navy has replaced poles as 
necessary 
the state department of natural resources which has shadowed 
development of elf said the project has proceeded smoothly despite 
some environmental protests over the years 
navy spokeswoman lt maureen cahill said 30 military and about 
50 civilians will be employed on project elf

the artist christos plan to erect 1700 
giant yellow umbrellas in the hills of southern california is on 
schedule with all the needed permits obtained a spokesman said 
thursday 
the outdoor artwork christo proposes to erect near the mountain 
community of gorman about 60 miles north of los angeles is half 
of a transpacific project envisioned by the 54yearold bulgarian 
artist 
everything is still on line the schedule date is there 
said thomas m golden us project director for the undertaking 
christo has described as a symphony in two parts 
christo creates transitory landscapes of unexpected colors and 
materials to achieve what he calls a gentle disturbance of the 
mind 
he previously has wrapped the oldest bridge in paris in 
champagnecolored fabric surrounded 11 islands in floridas 
biscayne bay with shocking pink polypropylene and erected a 
transluscent running fence across northern california 
the two movements of christos umbrella symphony are to begin 
simultaneously in october 1991 in california and japan places 
christo selected for their geographical and cultural contrasts 
as autumn burns the rumpled hills of southern california to 
golden hues some 1700 yellow umbrellas each 28 feet in diameter 
will blossom like california poppies along the tejon pass 
at the same time about 1300 identical blue umbrellas will open 
in the lush bamboo forest rice paddies crowded villages and farms 
of japans ibaraki province about 70 miles north of tokyo 
in both countries the umbrellas will stay up only for about 
three weeks 
although all the permits for the california project have been 
gathered many details remain to be worked out with the japanese 
golden said in a telephone interview from his office in freestone 
calif 
we keep going back so they know you are sincere in pursuing 
this golden said its entirely different they dont have 
public hearings and they dont have agencies that issue 
encroachment permits for example 
in japan there are about 435 landowners and golden said in at 
least one instance the umbrellas 28foot diameter is wider than 
the parcel of land where it will be erected 
in contrast christo has obtained permission to erect his 
umbrellas from a total of 23 landowners in california including 
two governmental agencies golden said 
the california highway patrol expects a bit more than gentle 
disturbance from the project 
i can imagine freeway commuter traffic almost 
bumpertobumper on weekends said capt patrick harrington head 
of the california highway patrols legislative unit in sacramento 
i told that to christo at one of our meetings and and he was 
quite taken aback and he said no not really but i just 
know its going to be really heavy traffic

executionstyle at three locations in houston and irving a dallas 
suburb more than 15 months later police have found neither the 
murder weapons nor the killers 
we still have insufficient evidence to file any charges 
said houston homicide lt richard holland 
still authorities think they know where to look theyre 
investigating followers of the sects late leader ervil lebaron 
some former sect members fear that before he died lebaron 
targeted a number of people for death primarily for being 
unfaithful to his preachings 
authorities already were studying the murders and disappearances 
of former lebaron followers as many as 22 victims in several 
states when the texans were killed 
houston police discovered the body of mark chynoweth 36 at his 
houston appliance store he had been shot several times in the head 
several miles away his brother duane chynoweth 31 and 
duanes daughter jennifer were gunned down in the driveway of a 
vacant home chynoweth had gone there to deliver a washing machine 
but a call made earlier to his brothers store asking for the 
appliance apparently was a ruse 
the vacant homes address sent an eerie message itself it was 
on rena street duane and marks sister rena once was one of 
lebarons wives but like her brothers left the church of the lamb 
of god 
the fourth victim 32yearold eddie marston was a stepson of 
lebaron he was found dead in the driveway of a vacant home in 
irving he had been called there to pick up a washer and dryer 
apparently another deadly ploy 
his girlfriend had received a frantic call from former group 
members in houston after the chynoweths were killed but too late 
all three men had abandoned the lebaron sect which believes in 
blood atonement 
lebaron organized the church of the lamb of god in 1971 in 
mexico it is one of many groups that advocate a return to 
polygamy which was taught by joseph smith founder of the mormon 
church but banned by that church in 1890 
lebaron died in 1981 of a heart attack while serving a sentence 
in utah for the 1977 murder of rival polygamist leader rulin allred 
marston and mark chynoweth were acquitted in allreds slaying 
marston also was acquitted in the 1975 slaying of another 
polygamist leader 
authorities believe lebarons followers are responsible for 
killing at least 22 people over the past two decades in several 
states 
lillian chynoweth marks wife and ervils daughter once told 
the salt lake tribune that she was worried her father had left a 
book of new covenants which his sons were using as a blueprint 
for vengeance 
she said the writings included a list of people my father 
thought needed to be killed lillian fatally shot herself several 
months after her husbands death and is buried beside him 
although houston police havent seen such a hit list they 
believe one may exist that includes the names of the three men 
slain 
although the lebaron clan has suffered setbacks recent 
developments show it is still functioning six of ervil lebarons 
younger children ages 12 to 18 disappeared on sept 30 from 
foster homes in salt lake city and authorities said they may have 
headed for a hideout in mexico 
police believe andrew lebaron 29 may have organized the 
escape which came as other clan members who had abandoned the 
church of the lamb of god were seeking to adopt the children 
glenn chynoweth renas brother said the disappearances 
thwarted efforts to turn the younger ones away from the patriarchs 
violent message to break that chain 
several members of the lebaron group have been sought for 
questioning about the texas murders and some members are being 
held in phoenix and chicago on unrelated charges 
in august five lebaron followers were sentenced to prison in 
phoenix for stealing trucks they include heber lebaron 25 and 
douglas lee barlow 28 
heber lebaron another of ervils sons also faces charges of 
robbing a savings and loan in richardson texas barlow is wanted 
in houston on a vehicle burglary charge 
harris county assistant district attorney terry wilson said 
authorities are seeking to extradite barlow but not until arizona 
officials are through with appeals in the trucktheft case 
at this point were not doing anything to bring someone here 
for questioning in the killings wilson said 
holland said police havent found the weapons used to kill 
marston and the chynoweths 
he would not say if any threats have been made against other 
former lebaron members or if any of them are still under police 
protection as they were for a while after the killings 
at the funeral of the four victims bombsniffing dogs and armed 
police guarded grieving relatives and friends

united methodist policy makers may be 
slightly more liberal than the average clergy and the lay members 
in the nations second largest protestant denomination according 
to a new study 
united methodist leaders were defined as ministers and 
laypersons who were elected as delegates to the united methodist 
general conference in 1988 the general conference which meets 
every four years has final authority in all matters in the 9 
millionmember denomination 
on a scale of one to five with one being the most liberal and 
five the most conservative the average clergy delegate rated 
himself 27 on social issues while the lay delegates rated 
themselves at about 3 the clergy at large had a 3 rating while 
the laity at large was rated at 33 
a total of 616 clergy and lay delegates to the general 
conference responded to the mail poll in the same period 6048 
randomly selected clergy who were not delegates responded to a 
similar mail poll and 526 randomly selected lay people answered

the party line helped make great friends 
and great enemies and once even helped derail a presidential 
campaign 
now for rural telephone customers in west virginia the partys 
over reflecting a national trend the chesapeake amp potomac 
telephone co is hanging up its party lines after stringing them 
throughout the countryside for the first six decades of this 
century 
the 16party line service was basically used as an intercom 
one person would call somebody else on the line and everybody would 
pick up said kenneth pitt a spokesman for bell atlantic campps 
parent company 
the housewives would get on there and talk for two hours or 
maybe three hours it was a different day and age those days are 
gone 
there was a time however when telephone company workers like 
sonny stroud climbed mountains crossed rivers and dug trenches to 
set up the party lines 
just being able to provide service even on a party line just 
thrilled us then said stroud of rainelle who took a campp job in 
1948 wed do anything to get the system to whoever wanted it 
phone service first came to southeast west virginia in 1904 the 
majority of it through party lines onetenth of west virginias 
telephone customers were on party lines on nov 1 1985 when the 
public service commission approved a campp request to eliminate that 
service 
its considered a lesser quality of service like driving the 
battered pickup truck versus driving a shiny new one with velour 
seats explained pitt in an interview from his office in 
arlington va it isnt even seen as telephone service 
talcott residents made their last party line calls this summer 
when a handful of eastern panhandle residents are switched over 
soon all of campps 635000 west virginia customers will be on 
private lines 
one customer whos happy about that is jim monroe jr of 
greenbrier nurseries which was on a party line for 31 years a 
terrible inconvenience 
most of the time we had it we had only one other person on 
it there was this family up at barger springs they were a greek 
family that barely spoke english so they barely made phone calls 
but then there once was another woman who spread gossip around 
and was on the phone all the time 
the business now plans to install a tollfree 800 number 
something not possible on a party line 
around the nation 28 million people remained on party lines at 
the end of 1987 the latest year for which figures were available 
according to the united states telephone association in 1985 
there were 46 million party lines 
the rural electrification administration in washington which 
lends money to rural telephone companies that serve 5 million 
people still will handle requests from 4party line systems 
but said fred albrecht an rea telecommunications specialist 
i dont know of one made in the last 10 years 
we discourage them in todays age you can build a 1party 
plant as cheaply as a 4party plant 
although party lines sometimes promoted neighborliness they 
sometimes did the opposite 
eight families were on a line operated by a missouri company 
albrecht once worked for and one of the families had eight 
children another nine 
one day the other six people on the line all showed up at my 
office to complain that they couldnt get to the phone we put the 
other six on one line and put the families with the 17 kids on the 
other 
when the two big families continued to complain he said we 
told them they would have to work it out 
it wasnt unusual to have even more people on the line said jim 
davis an external affairs manager for campp recalling one copper 
line that had five 10party lines it was so hot they had to use 
gloves to handle it 
nowadays thousands of calls can be routed simultaneously on 
fiberoptic cables a standard cable with 12 pairs of lines can 
handle hundreds of customers as computerized equipment switches 
from line to line thousands of times per second and sends voice and 
data impulses clean and crisp 
even though privateline service will add a little more than 4 
to the roughly 17 monthly phone bill for the average family 
formerly on a party line customers like sara sowers are not 
complaining 
its better this way you can go to the phone and just pick it 
up she said before you had to pick it up to see if anyone 
was on it then you would pick it up a little later and theyd 
still be on there you just had to keep picking it up 
and sometimes you had to put it down too as the late hubert 
humphrey learned during west virginias democratic presidential 
primary race in 1960 
two days before the vote humphrey held a slight lead over john 
f kennedy in the polls and purchased a halfhour of television 
time for a statewide callin show 
theodore h white in the making of the president 1960 
wrote that humphrey already was flustered by callers straying from 
the topics when a voice interrupted a party line calling clear 
the wires this is an emergency 
humphrey attempted to explain they were on the air they were 
answering questions to a tv audience white wrote the voice 
again ordered humphrey and his caller to surrender the line and 
the candidate his face blank and bedazzled hung up shaken to 
press the button for another call 
kennedy won the primary and the presidency

namedropping is a favorite pastime in the 
entertainment business and musician lenny kravitz has a few at his 
disposal 
theres his wife actress lisa bonet of nbcs a different 
world his mother roxie roker who pla in the 
longrunning tv sitcom the jeffersons and his father sy 
kravitz a former nbc executive 
but the younger kravitz who also goes by the name romeo blue 
prefers discussing a few wellplaced strangers such as john 
lenyed helen willisnon jimi hendrix bob marley and lou reed all influences 
for 
his debut album let love rule 
im not hip on the way records sound today the 25yearold 
kravitz said all this digital and sampling everywhere 
my record sounds like the kind you just drop a needle on and 
play i grew up on records that sound like this i dont think 
records sound any better than in the late 50s or early 60s 
he makes his point on the records opening track sitting on 
top of the world proudly performed a little offkey his voice 
cracking early in the song 
i dreamed the whole song he said and i hummed it into 
the tape recorder i did that one live in one take with just 
guitar and mikeuntil now i think 
i turned down about eight record deals he said they wanted 
trendy black music which i hate this is too white you have to 
get your black base first then you can cross over everybody has 
to go get yourself a drum machine and make yourself a funk record 
that was a big issue but what im doing is black music 
anyway rhythm and blues rock n roll people think if you dont 
sound like bobby brown its not black music 
he spent time in the studio recording songs meant for his ears 
only when a friend heard a tape and passed the word around that a 
promising new star was waiting to be discovered after meeting and 
falling in love with bonet kravitz was an even hotter property 
being that i was married to her people were interested in 
what i was doing i was on the cover of all these magazines just 
because i was married to her who is this guy 
bonet not only brought him muchneeded publicity but helped 
kravitz find himself as a musician 
when i first met lisa i was a studio musician but i still 
didnt know what to do because i played funk rock jazz whatever 
and could play all sorts of instruments said kravitz who plays 
all the instruments on let love rule 
were so similar i saw myself in her a reflection of myself 
all of a sudden i knew what i had to after she was finished with 
her show i started writing and cutting i came to new york and 
booked myself in a studio my writing come back and i started 
building up these tunes 
kravitzs nasal vocals on let love rule and be recall 
lennon and elvis costello and mr cab driver an angry talking 
blues has the manonthestreet feel of reeds best known songs 
i got the best of lou reed and walk on the wild side just 
blew my mind i fell in love with that lower east side new york 
sound getting that message over but i dont think about doing a 
lou reedsounding record certain sounds just come out of me 
he vows to include other musicians on his next record and is 
touring with a 10piece band kravitz hopes to win over fans who 
know him only for the names he can drop 
what if i came out to see you because your wife is soandso 
if thats what brings people out fine he said but ive got 
something to say im not interested in being mr bonet

the latest news from linda ellerbees end of 
lifes great parade other than that she doesnt want to host a 
talk show is this 
her lucky duck productions has just finished its first 
documentary a onehour smithsonian world course on the history 
of food in america it is tentatively called moveable feast 
the show heading for a pbs date in february is written 
reported and anchored by lloyd dobyns her partner from two 
sardonic acclaimed nbc news series of yesteryear weekend and 
nbc news overnight 
she isnt involved in moveable feast she says other 
than to annoy lloyd from time to time 
i recused myself she explains savoring the word recused 
because of my general foods connection although theres nothing 
in the documentary having to do with general foods the 
connection is the maxwell house coffee commercials she taped last 
spring a deed for which critics roasted her 
she has not as was implied in a recent published report been 
approached by nbc news to be a temporary coanchor at sunday 
today when coanchor maria shriver takes a sixweek maternity 
leave starting nov 15 
nbc which she left in 1985 hasnt asked her ellerbee says 
its all news to me she says of the report adding that no 
network has talked to her about a job including abc which she 
left in 1987 after her our world was axed 
ellerbee also is back doing her cnn commentaries after a summer 
in which she lost she reckons 26 pounds through a strict regimen 
she disclosed all this in an interview 
queries included whether she will do more of those stillrunning 
maxwell house commercials i dont know she replied to that 
one 
to those who say she sold her journalistic credibility for a 
mess of instantcoffee money she would say and did that people 
can think what they want i had good reasons to do it and if the 
circumstances were the same id do it again 
she and rolfe tessem her production partner explained that 
starting her company required a healthy infusion of cash the 
maxwell house money they declined to say how much it was seemed 
the best way to do this and retain control they might have lost 
with other means of financing they say 
being the host of a syndicated talk show might have provided the 
money she says but i did not want to do a talk show i feel 
they cloud the line between news and entertainment far more than a 
commercial does theres no clouding with a commercial 
having gotten lucky ducks first show on the road so to speak 
she and tessem say they have other journalistic projects in the 
discussion stages on three fronts cable syndication and public 
television 
they decline to elaborate on these efforts citing the 
possibility of conceptpoaching by others but she doesnt rule out 
working onair again with doybns who left nbc now lives near 
raleigh nc and still is her pal 
its possible she says i do get along with the man and 
there are few enough who do 
ellerbee as some may have noticed is a woman of many opinions 
all strong when asked for a thought on the state of television 
nowadays she immediately gave this one 
the more i see the recreations of the news and read about the 
stagings of the news the more clean i feel about that commercial

imagine one company owning a rental car 
business a fleet of taxis a chain of used car dealerships and an 
auto parts company the firms all supply each other working 
together to control a cars life cycle 
that is what the ambitious dan bayha 45yearold president of 
bata group in morristown nj wants to do in the world of 
microcomputers 
bata controls a group of subsidiaries that concentrate on a 
computers afterlife 
psx inc buys from retail chains computers that have been traded 
in and refurbishes them for resale mostly to rental companies 
for units too outdated or damaged psx scavenges parts 
personal computer rentals in which bata acquired a controlling 
interest in may is a rental franchise with 43 stores nationwide 
the franchise group is psxs largest customer 
bata capital finances equipment leased by corporations directly 
or provided via lease by personal computer rentals 
bata is focusing its attention on what bayha and others in the 
industry see as a new growth front in the personal computer world 
rentals bayha said he hopes to more than double personal computer 
rentals stores in two years 
bata a name formed by bayha and the last name of his partner 
steve tafaro started 10 years ago as an ibm mainframe leasing 
firm a change in the tax laws in 1986 made it less advantageous 
for companies to lease mainframes bayha said so the firm turned 
to microcomputers 2 years ago 
each step of the business took them further it was natural to 
look at maintaining microcomputers as a leasing company which led 
to the idea of refurbishing and selling them used they found that 
rental firms were buying many of the retooled computers so bata 
bought a controlling interest in personal computer rentals 
we kept bumping into things and said gee look at that 
bayha said 
with revenues of 15 million in 1988 not including the leasing 
and rental business bata group has not turned a profit but that 
should change this year he said 
its not going to be unreasonable to believe that every home 
will have two or three microcomputers just as they have two to 
three televisions he said 
the personal computer market next year is expected to approach 
40 billion with up to 15 million computers sold said analyst kim 
brown at prudentialbache securities inc hundreds of small 
companies either broker or rent computers 
brown was skeptical about the chances that a company like bata 
could make it 
computer technology advances so quickly and prices drop so 
dramatically that purchasers may prefer to keep on buying new 
equipment said brown 
for instance an ibm pc with a color screen and 640 kilobytes of 
memory cost from 4000 to 5000 when introduced in 1982 and is 
now worth in the 200 range ibm and apple are expected to 
introduce lowend pcs for under 1000 within a year he said 
the costs of refurbishment and handling might also make the 
endeavor less profitable said brown im not saying it cant be 
done he added 
theres an awful lot of companies out there that dont have to 
have the latest technology countered bayha potential users in 
homes small businesses and lower education dont necessarily need 
high horsepower computers he said

when pierre cardin brings the first russian rock 
musical to new york in january he expects sparks to fly 
sparks of love that is says the french 
couturierentrepreneurtheater producer 
cardin feels like something between cupid and a diplomat for 
having arranged a monthlong engagement of the rock show juno and 
avos at new yorks city center 
in an interview at maxims the belle epoque gastronomic 
monument cardin bought nine years ago he bubbled like champagne 
over his plans 
avos roughly means a kind of hope he said and hope is 
what he exudes for his mission to put on the unique musical 
love story for the americans 
cardin first brought the play to his espace cardin theater in 
paris in 1983 it might not be another les miserables but the 
french loved it and the romantic scenario is particularly fitting 
for todays burgeoning sovietamerican flirtation 
the rock opera was written in 1980 by dissident soviet poet 
andrei vosnesensky it is based on the true tale of a russian sea 
captains love affair with the daughter of the spanish governor of 
san francisco circa 1800 it has a kind of romeojuliet twist the 
couple cant marry because of religious differences she is roman 
catholic he is orthodox 
it was kind of an allegorical cry for more mutual ussoviet 
understanding said cardin who is a good friend of the poet 
fortunately things are going just that way 
despite vosnesenskys fears cardin insisted he could succeed in 
getting the rock opera to paris and even the united states thanks 
to glasnost the new soviet policy of openness and pulling some 
strings with officials in both countries hes making his dream 
come true 
problems were not really political or cultural cardin said 
the american unions are very sticky about allforeign 
productions but i did it the whole russian cast and crew of 86 
will be there this is a great moment americans have seen russian 
ballet folklore and the circus but theyve never seen anything 
like this 
long a fan of the russian people and culture cardin has 
manufactured and sold readytowear clothing at luxury shops there 
since 1986 he first heard about vosnesenskys musical during an 
earlier business visit 
but it was only playing in repertory and not the night i was 
there so they took the entire company out to a provincial town and 
put it on for me and the townspeople 
he decided nothing would get in the way of his producing the 
show at his paris theater known since it opened in 1970 for 
everything from ballets starring maia plissetskaya to the american 
avantgarde group pilobus 
red tape of getting the big show to paris was a mere trifle 
compared to his worst moment opening night 
just as my show was opening in november 1983 the soviets blew 
up that kal civilian plane over kamchatka cardin said and the 
show itself almost bombed everyone told me i was out of my mind 
in fact the first night the theater was almost empty after all 
it wasnt the artists fault i went ahead 
finally the show was a hit even though the new rock sound 
synthesizers and all was astonishing for an oldfashioned love 
story critics were flabbergasted to see the virgin of kazan a 
prime chorus figure played by a bearded countertenor changing 
his voice from baritone to the seraphic notes of the virgin 
difficulties have never bothered cardin who regularly flies 
around the world to visit his factories and sell his goods whether 
couture underwear or maxims champagne 
my whole career is based on the impossible he said my 
readytowear wouldnt work they told me more than 30 years ago 
then all the other couturiers started copying that idea i was told 
i was quite mad to start factories in russia and china but they 
flourished 
critics made the same comments about taking maxims all over 
the world he said the peking maxims was a big hit from the 
time it opened six years ago though it had to close after the 
tiananmen square events last summer it will open again within 
weeks 
russophile cardin will see his newest maxims open in the soviet 
union next year in spite of a few headaches 
meanwhile cardin is off to some of his worldwide enterprises in 
china and australia ending up in new york on friday to promote the 
russian musical a production thats intially costing him the 
eyes right out of my head as the french expression goes 
but money is never any concern of mine he said i just 
want to see more mutual russianamerican understanding its 
already miraculous and i dont think americans know enough about 
the russians i think this should help

henry goldrich is the guy who told harry chapin 
that taxi ran too long to be a hit hes also the guy who 
kicked george benson out of his store because of that annoying 
guitar 
back in the 60s i told paul simon that simon and garfunkel 
was a lousy name and i still think it is says goldrich 
fortunately musicians want instruments and not advice from 
goldrich which is why his music store mannys on west 48th 
street has served everyone from dizzy gillespie to guns n roses 
in the past five decades 
the beatles invaded mannys before they did the rest of country 
these days sean lennon buys his guitars there mick jagger was 
looking for the right ax for this years stones tour when he ran 
into bo diddley david johansen has been a customer since he was a 
new york doll he visits now as buster poindexter 
the who when they were in town doing the show they were 
in here except daltrey he bought a guitar once and never played 
it says goldrich dropping names as fast as clapton works a fret 
board they came to my sons bar mitzvah flew over theyre 
friends 
goldrich a grayhaired bearded man with a slight pot belly is 
the son of the original manny and current keeper of the family 
business his dad established the store in harlem 54 years ago and 
they became a 48th street fixture in the late 1940s the musicians 
followed and never left 
its word of mouth we have a very long and great 
reputation says goldrich whose earliest recollections of the 
store involve a nodding john coltrane asleep on an upstairs couch 
mannys customer list reads like a history of american music 
charlie parker in the 40s buddy holly in the 50s jimi hendrix 
in the 60s paul simon in the 70s david byrne in the 80s most 
have provided autographed pictures an invaluable collection that 
covers the walls of the stores 
elvis presley is the only big rock star who never walked in 
the store we delivered stuff to his hotel says goldrich 
mannys and rudys music stop across the street still cater to 
the big names but most of their old neighbors are gone there were 
once 25 music stores along the strip that comprised the big apples 
bandstand today a halfdozen remain the rest replaced by the 
westward creep of rockefeller center and the eastern move of 
grocery stores and fastfood joints 
such intrusions dont mean the area has lost its magnetism for 
musicians who still pass through midtown construction and the 
surrounding porno shops to check out whats what 
go to west 48th street to look at all the guitars and amps go 
to mannys and rudys look at all the great new equipment thats 
my idea of a good time lou reed told rolling stone most 
musicians heed his advice 
guns n roses featured the store in their video for paradise 
city soviet rock star boris grebenshikov hit the 48th street 
shops shortly after arriving in the united states to examine the 
merger of music and capitalism and then theres the time mark 
knopfler turned a salesman into a sideman at rudys music stop 
parttime rudys worker jack sonni met knopfler through the 
shop which the dire straits leader began frequenting in 1979 five 
years later sonni signed on with dire straits for the brothers 
in arms lp after getting a surprise invite from knopfler 
at least sonni knew who knopfler was when guns n roses 
guitarists izzy stradlin and slash showed up at mannys goldrich 
didnt have a clue as to their identities 
the music now is very heavy metal which is not my favorite 
you cant whistle it said goldrich itzhak perlman is his kind 
of musician but the kids theyre probably just as nice 
when goldrich started in the business the musicians were as 
hard up for cash as the struggling manny a days receipts could 
total 18 many of the musicians bought on credit and took a long 
time to pay he says 
charlie parker used to come in and play tenor sax and 
gillespie played piano and we used to have the greatest jam 
sessions in the world goldrich recalled coltrane tenor and 
soprano saxophone was there coltrane theres guy that owed me a 
lot of money 
goldrich is understandably proud of the autographed pictures 
that line his store on a small portion of one wall the who the 
rolling stones janis joplin hendrix buddy holly and bob dylan 
sit side by side 
keep one eye closed at all cost advised dylan on his 
picture 
goldrich himself is a oneman rock n roll repository he sold 
guitars for hendrixs and hollys families after their deaths his 
friends include ella fitzgerald john entwistle and james taylor 
and he has a bit of advice good advice for once for anybody 
hoping to open a place on 48th street 
when somebody walks in the store thats famous i think they 
get worse treatment than the standard customer said goldrich 
were not on them constantly they come in here they wander 
through the store i dont go in awe of these guys

not to be outdone by other industries in an age 
of business innovation wall street has come up with a new 
phenomenon the no frills bull market 
as in classic bull markets of yore stock prices have risen 
sharply and steadily this year reaching record highs closing in 
on the second anniversary of the fearsome market meltdown of 
october 1987 the stock tables seem to proclaim what crash 
but from the perspective of many brokers and investors alike 
many of the oncestandard trappings of a great bull market are 
conspicuously absent 
what kind of bull market is it for example when all the 
brokers arent getting rich 
before the big drop in 1987 a membership seat on the new york 
stock exchange was sold for 115 million last week the best 
price a seat could bring was 475000 
at a time when stock prices are going through the roof 
investment firms should be coining money 
yet the trend in securitiesindustry profits to be reported soon 
for the third quarter of the year is clearly deteriorating in 
the words of analyst david eisenberg at sanford c bernstein amp co 
in most cases moves to record peaks in stock prices are 
accompanied by new highs in trading volume 
but activity this year is running barely ahead of its pace in 
1988 when new york stock exchange volume was down 145 percent 
from 1987 
on a less measurable level many market participants say the big 
gains this year havent caught the publics fancy the way the good 
old bull markets did the story of the markets full recovery from 
the crash of 1987 isnt drawing anywhere near the attention that 
the big drop commanded two years ago 
many observers attribute the dearth of public enthusiasm to a 
longstanding trend evident in both government statistics and 
private surveys for individual investors to shift away from direct 
ownership of stocks into alternatives such as mutual funds 
then there is also the suspicion often voiced if difficult to 
prove that just about all the money in the market these days is 
being made by bigtime takeover specialists and professionals 
engaged in computerprogram trading 
a majority of individual investors remain unconvinced that the 
bull market is real says andrew lanyi who heads a division 
specializing in retail brokerage at the firm of ladenburg thalmann 
amp co investors believe that the bull market is very narrow and 
is attributed largely to takeover stocks and a few blue chip 
issues 
some say these perceptions are misguided in a survey of 
investors commissioned by the american stock exchange in august and 
september more than twothirds of the respondents said they hadnt 
lost confidence in the market since the crash 
but other data lend at least partial support to the view that 
the 1989 model bull market hasnt yet become a vehicle for the 
masses 
consider the recent performance of two market indexes calculated 
by frank russell co investment consultants the russell 1000 
made up of the stocks with the biggest market value has handily 
outperformed the russell 2000 composed of smaller issues this 
year 
that demonstrates that the bull market lately has been less 
bountiful among many secondary stocks than it has been for the 
bigname issues most heavily owned by investing institutions and 
used in programtrading strategies 
another reason why the individual isnt there said lanyi 
has been the persistent bearishness of many investment advisory 
services with large followings among the public 
assuming that they will sooner or later turn bullish lanyi 
suggests these advisers and their subscribers represent an 
untapped source of future fuel for the bull market 
in my opinion he said it has much farther to go

free tuition and open enrollment 
at the onceprestigious university of buenos aires is under study 
as part of the peronist governments program to control costs and 
improve public services 
the university has an enrollment of 175000 in 10 schools 
we must bring education in line with reality just as 
president carlos menem has done with the economy education 
minister antonio salonia said in a recent radio interview 
unrestricted university admission will be reviewed 
but student and leftist political groups already have charged 
that cutbacks would reduce the upward mobility of argentinas 
working poor 
the university suffers the same problems afflicting the 
government demand is overwhelming but resources and programs have 
been eroded by inflation and a lack of funds 
nowadays at the university that was once considered the best in 
latin america upperlevel students teach newer ones teachers 
forced by low salaries to take other jobs sometimes skip classes 
and the quality of instruction has diminished 
nobody is really committed to the effort required for a good 
university guillermo jaim etcheverry dean of the school of 
medicine said in an interview 
the problem is the system not the students it is a system 
that promises much more than it is prepared to deliver the system 
is an illusion 
argentines who have a literacy rate of 90 percent or better 
consider free schooling a basic right 
president juan d peron in the 1950s did away with tuition and 
eased entrance exams at the university of buenos aires 
teachers administrators and students at the university say 
however the dropout rate now is high test scores are low 
classrooms crowded equipment and libraries outdated students can 
retake exams until they pass and wages are as low as 15000 
australs 23 a month for parttime professors 
the university also has suffered from staff purges and rigid 
curriculums imposed by successive leftwing and rightwing 
governments over the past four decades 
the idea is to get the degree not necessarily learn said 
alejandro nunez a 28yearold lawyer who graduated from the 
university and remains on its studentfaculty board of advisers 
hector torres dean of the school of natural sciences wrote 
recently in the newspaper la nacion that the university is in 
danger of becoming a degree factory 
the university opened its doors in 1823 tuition has been low 
since the university reforms of 1918 exams to regulate the number 
and aptitude of firstyear students were abolished following raul 
alfonsins election as president in october 1983 to replace a 
military dictatorship enrollment surged by about 60000 
after 10 years of being kept out there was a huge backlog 
of students who wanted a university education said antonio 
donini dean of the graduate school at the privately run university 
of belgrano which was founded in buenos aires in 1964 and has an 
enrollment this year of 18000 
they could enter the university without any examination 
donini added a student only needed a high school diploma 
grades or which high school a student went to did not matter 
the englishlanguage buenos aires herald newspaper commented in 
a recent editorial for nearly half a decade the utopian 
principle of unrestricted university admission has been in effect 
imposing hopelessly overcrowded lecture halls on the brighter 
students by luring in young people who should never be there and 
thus making university education impossible for everybody 
the universitys own data cited by la nacion indicate that 11 
of every 12 graduates of the school of medicine failed exams given 
by hospitals in 1987 for doctors applying for residencies 
consumer advocates complain it is almost impossible to monitor 
standards among lawyers because law school graduates are not 
obliged to pass a bar exam before opening a practice 
businesses are forced to extensively train new employees because 
college graduates often are unprepared for the work they were hired 
to do according to a gallup survey 
menem who took office july 8 has pledged to reduce the 
dominant role of the state in the economy as a way to balance the 
national budget and improve the quality of public services 
plans are being drawn up to sell the state telephone company 
railroad and airline and to seek foreign investment to help 
develop the oil industry

narcotics officers seize a mound of cocaine 
and say its worth 300000 on the street but whose street 
a crack dealer is arrested carrying dozens of crack rocks worth 
1000 officials say but what is a rock 
an informal survey by the associated press of narcotics officers 
nationwide found a kilo of cocaine ranges from 10000 in los 
angeles to 35000 in iowa city to almost 70000 in shreveport la 
the street price of powdered cocaine meanwhile ranges from 16 
per gram in los angeles to 20 for poor quality powder in yakima 
wash to 35 in new york city to as much as 125 in iowa city and 
shreveport 
a rock of crack cocaine meanwhile generally runs about 20 
nationwide but the size of the rock varies tremendously even 
within one city 
drug enforcement administration officials often get wary when 
asked the street value of cocaine spokesman frank shults cites 
the extreme variations in major cities across the country the 
widespread variation in purity level and the frequent regular 
market fluctuations 
the street value also doesnt reflect the wholesalers loss a 
crucial factor when law enforcement is trying to cripple drug 
trafficking organizations 
when officials do try to estimate the street value of drugs 
seized they sometimes trip over themselves 
federal agents in los angeles seized about 20 tons of cocaine 
from a warehouse sept 29 the largest such seizure in history 
local dea spokesman ralph lochridge issued the first very 
conservative estimate of street value 2 billion the dea 
special agent heading the los angeles office john m zienter 
later placed the street value at 20 billion 
meanwhile los angeles police calculate the street value of 
cocaine at 170250 per pound making the haul worth 7 billion 
but the people who bought that cocaine lost far less than even 
2 billion los angeles county sheriffs sgt tim beard said the 
price per kilo runs about 10000 to 15000 depending on the 
quantity and buyer based on the 10000 price the 20 tons would 
have cost 181 million 
the impact of colombias crackdown on drug traffickers launched 
in august remains unclear cocaine prices have gone up in some 
areas while declining in others 
law enforcement officials say some of the increase may be due to 
entrepreneurs taking advantage of fears that supplies may dry up 
wholesale prices of kilos around the country are 14000 to 
15000 in far south texas near the mexican border 14000 to 
18000 in new york 16000 to 18000 in dallas 16000 to 
20000 in seattle and in the northeast region including boston 
18000 to 20000 in new orleans 18000 to 24000 in colorado 
and about 20000 in kansas city mo 
law enforcement officials say kilo and street prices are 
determined by several factors among them 
proximity to foreign suppliers or direct connections to them 
miami had the lowest price per kilo 9000 to 10000 before 
the crackdown but that has shot up to 20000 said metrodade 
police detective george reyes 
surprisingly one of the lowest prices found in the survey 
11000 was found in montana which is not considered a major 
cocaine center 
gary carrell of montanas justice department said the cocaine 
was almost 100 percent pure and the sellers apparently had good 
connections to suppliers in medellin colombia 
quantity purchased 
if youre only buying one or two kilos it could cost you 
20000 to 23000 but five to 10 kilos would only cost 18000 to 
19000 per kilo said john fernandes of the dea in miami 
likewise an eight track or eighth of an ounce of cocaine 
in los angelese costs 100 to 120 a pergram price of 28 to 34 
on the street said detective dennis zeuner chief of the narcotics 
unit in the hollywood division an ounce of powdered cocaine costs 
450 to 500 reducing the pergram price to 16 to 18 to buy by 
the gram the price would be 60 to 100 said beard of the county 
sheriffs office 
the customer 
sellers sometimes offer discounts to regular or potential 
customers 
mexican sellers are the only source of cocaine in central 
washington state and if the customer is another mexican the price 
per kilo ranges from 13000 to 15000 said robert dreisbach the 
dea agent in charge of the yakima office if the buyer is a 
nonmexican the price ranges from 17000 to 19000 
a 20 rock of crack can mean anything from onesixteenth of 
a gram in tacoma wash to onetenth of a gram in minneapolis to 
onefifth of a gram in san diego to onefourth of a gram in 
washington dc in los angeles one official said a 20 rock is 
onetenth of a gram another said its onefifth of a gram smaller 
rocks in each place can sell for less depending on the customers 
savvy 
some enterprising juveniles in miami get together 10 buy one 
rock from a dealer break that in two and sell each piece for 10 
elsewhere and go back to the dealer to buy another said james n 
hall of the miamibased up front drug information center 
powdered cocaine prices also vary widely 
in miami a gram costs 55 to 60 up from 35 to 40 a year 
ago reyes said 
the price in yakima ranges from 40 to 60 although a gram of 
extremely low quality cocaine can be bought for as little as 20 
said capt don biasio of the local narcotics unit 
in new york city police spokesman sgt joseph mcconville said 
the price of a gram is 35 to 55 in iowa city and shreveport 
powdered cocaine can cost as much as 125 per gram 
other typical street prices for a gram of cocaine 50 to 75 in 
san diego 60 to 80 in fort lauderdale fla and seattle 80 in 
chicago and san bernardino 80 to 100 in dallas philadelphia 
montana and louisiana 100 in harlingen texas 100 to 120 in 
minneapolis and 120 in kansas city mo 
the purity of the cocaine 80 percent to 95 percent in most 
areas also is dependent on location and market conditions low 
prices dont always reflect poor quality cocaine 
for example in los angeles purity levels for powdered cocaine 
on the street range between 75 percent and 95 percent said beard 
for kilos it runs an average of 95 percent he said the prices 
are relatively low because of the drugs availability he said 
in spokane lt roger bragdon the commander of special 
investigations said the cocaine in his city is 85 percent to 90 
percent pure 
if you cut it in the northwest you cant sell it and you 
might get killed bragdon said 
the situation is similar in seattle but 40 miles away in 
tacoma police narcotics investigator dick caron said a gram on the 
street ranges from 20 percent to 80 percent pure kilos from 60 
percent to 80 percent pure 
and in yakima in southcentral washington biasio said cocaine 
on the street usually is 85 percent to 95 percent pure but a 
recent bust yielded cocaine that was only 60 percent pure

the national endowment for the arts shaken by 
a conservative furor over subsidizing obscene art is getting a 
new chairman this week who promises to strike a balance between 
freewheeling artistic freedom and respect for the publics trust 
we are not the nations official pornographer and its 
important that the country know that said john e frohnmayer a 
47yearold lawyer from portland ore who takes command of the 
beleaguered arts endowment tuesday 
nonetheless some members of the cultural community are 
expressing fear that the bitter controversy over the endowments 
role in financing controversial art might undermine future support 
for bold innovative and unpopular artistic ventures 
the worst political crisis in the neas 24year history began 
earlier this year when conservative members of congress were 
outraged to discover that 45000 in endowment funds had been used 
to support two exhibitions they found offensive 
one featured works by the late photographer robert mapplethorpe 
that included homosexual and sadomasochistic themes and pictures of 
nude children the other show by artist andres serrano featured a 
photograph of a crucifix submerged in a container of urine 
in a surprise move jesse helms rnc won senate approval of 
his sweeping proposal to prohibit spending federal funds on 
obscene and indecent art or any work that denigrates debases 
or reviles anybody on the basis of race creed sex handicap 
age or national origin 
his amendment to the arts endowments 171 million 
appropriations bill caused a furor in the arts community and 
housesenate negotiators finally produced a compromise last week 
that contains a watereddown version of the helms proposal 
approved by the house and awaiting final senate action was 
legislation barring government financing of works that may be 
obscene and lack serious literary artistic political or 
scientific value the supreme courts 1973 guideline on 
obscenity 
the nea chairman however would retain authority to make final 
decisions on the artistic merit of grant applications 
also the bill earmarks 250000 for a 12member commission to 
study the neas grantmaking process to determine whether new 
standards should be adopted governing federal subsidies for 
controversial art 
its certainly going to put a chill in the air because the 
endowment is being asked not only to judge artistic quality but to 
act as a moral watchdog said martin friedman director of the 
walker art center in minneapolis 
hoping to avoid becoming embroiled in the controversy 
washingtons corcoran gallery of art canceled plans to display the 
traveling mapplethorpe exhibition last july but the move backfired 
disastrously 
the venerable museum suffered artist boycotts the resignation 
of the museums chief curator loss of a 15 million bequest from 
artist lowell nesbitt a plunge in staff morale and a tarnishing of 
the corcorans reputation as a showcase for contemporary american 
art the corcoran trustees are studying how to repair the damage 
including whether director christina orrcahall should be fired 
frohnmayer vacationing in oregon late last week said in a 
telephone interview that he intends to shift public attention from 
the mapplethorpeserrano controversy to the endowments largely 
overlooked good works in underwriting artistic excellence 
we have a very fine line to walk here between continuing 
artistic freedom and maintaining the public trust when youre 
using taxpayer dollars said frohnmayer a former chairman of the 
oregon state arts commission 
he rejects any notion that hell be coming to washington as a 
government censor but he intends to find out how we got into 
this controversy in the first place and to make sure we avoid a 
similar controversy in the future 
frohnmayer said he specifically will take steps to ensure 
greater nea control over grants to local arts institutions that 
currently dispense the money to artists at their discretion 
the mapplethorpe exhibition was organized by the university of 
pennsylvanias institute for contemporary art in philadelphia and 
partially financed by an nea grant serranos works were 
underwritten by endowment funds awarded to the southeastern center 
for contemporary art in winstonsalem nc 
frohnmayer will succeed frank hodsoll who departed in february 
as chairman of the independent federal agency which dispensed 156 
million last year to about 800 artists and 3800 arts institutions 
from major symphony orchestras and opera companies to poets folk 
artists and smalltown theater companies 
grants are awarded after an exhaustive selection process 
involving peer panel review of applicants by fellow artists 
these panels recommendations are subject to approval by the nea 
chairman and the national council on the arts the endowments 
independent presidentially appointed advisory body 
besides putting the governments imprimatur on cultural 
endeavors of the highest quality endowment officials say the 
matching grants serve as a catalyst for private financial support 
of the arts they estimate that every federal dollar spent in nea 
grants has yielded more than 5 in contributions from individuals 
corporations and foundations 
the endowment is no stranger to political controversy it has 
weathered recurring congressional hearings on its grantmaking 
process it rebuffed allegations by conservative lawmakers a few 
years ago that it was subsidizing pornographic poetry and 
wasting taxpayers money on projects to design a new bathtub and 
make clothing from sheet metal 
but livingston l biddle who drafted the legislation that 
created the arts endowment in 1965 and served as nea chairman under 
president carter said there has been nothing in my experience 
like the firestorm that erupted over mapplethorpe and serrano 
biddle is confident the helms controversy wont inhibit the 
endowments nurturing of artistic freedom but he sees an 
affirmation of john miltons warning that freedom involves 
responsibility 
what has emerged is a cautionary signal to the endowment that 
it must be alert to difficulties that could arise from the 
extremely controversial said biddle 
were all pretty worried about censorship said deborah 
butterfield a bozeman mont sculptor who serves on an endowment 
oversight panel on the visual arts 
i think its vital to preserve the voices that threaten people 
like mr helms she said the purpose of art is to make people 
look at things in a different way to solve problems in a creative 
way that is not necessarily comfortable for those in power 
richard andrews director of the university of washingtons 
henry art gallery in seattle said the really diabolical effect 
of the helms amendment will be its inhibiting influence on 
artists rather than endowment bureaucrats 
in closing house debate on the issue last week rep fred 
grandy riowa himself a former actor on televisions the love 
boat said he hoped his colleagues werent getting into the 
business of defining what is good taste and what is bad taste 
in the arts 
grandy noted mischievously that the current production of a 
local neasupported theater includes what he called transvestism 
and implied lesbian love 
the play he said is shakespeares twelfth night appearing 
at the folger shakespeare theater

a new wave of violence recalling the 
worst of the brutal days of military rule is sweeping across this 
central american nation 
a rash of assassinations kidnappings and bombings has eroded 
the fragile hopes that a working democracy can take firm root 
shadowy organizations like the white hand and jaguar justice are 
on the prowl again grenades are tossed anonymous voices hiss 
death threats into telephones student leaders peasants labor 
leaders vanish or flee the country a leading banker is gunned down 
in his home 
president vinicio cerezo has survived two coup attempts but 
people speak of a democracy defrauded and some claim cerezo is 
unwilling to do anything about it 
ambition corruption and immorality in so many hearts have 
bred monstrous personalities guatemalas roman catholic bishops 
said in an anguished message about the wave of violence 
the kidnappings murders tortures and bombings of recent weeks 
stem from a lethal mix 
some of the killing is blamed on a 28yearold leftist guerrilla 
insurgency and the brutal effort to suppress it some is blamed on 
rightwing extremists trying to destabilize the government some on 
elements of the state security apparatus and then there is the 
influx of drug traffickers 
is there any hope for guatemala asked peter kooijmans a 
special envoy from the un human rights commission drawn here by 
the deteriorating situation he does not have the answer 
for an expert on torture like kooijmans this ohiosized country 
of almost 9 million people is fertile ground bodies commonly turn 
up with their hands chopped off or partly flayed or bearing signs 
of electric shock 
neither violence nor political uncertainty is new to guatemala 
what makes the current crisis so disturbing is that it represents 
the crumbling of hopes again 
the expectations of the 1985 elections have vanished in a 
matter of months said labor leader sergio guzman 
guatemalas previous experience with democracy ended in 1954 
with a ciabacked coup against president jacobo arbenz a 
reformist an estimated 100000 people died and 40000 disappeared 
in the three decades of political violence that followed under 
military rule 
those deaths included thousands of victims of a brutal 
counterinsurgency campaign that defense minister hector gramajo 
once said used the techniques of an occupation army in our own 
country 
hundreds of indian villages in rebel territory were wiped out 
the labor movement was driven underground labor leader guzman 
recalls unionists meeting secretly in churches and convents during 
the early 1980s 
many guatemalans saw the return of civilian government in 1986 
with cerezo at the head as the beginning of the end of a long 
bloody nightmare but the optimism of those first years is dying 
the most regressive forces in our country are trying to 
neutralize the most progressive said edgar agusto portillo 
recinos dean of the economics faculty at the university of san 
carlos 
the current violence began heating up with a teachers strike 
over wages that began in may and lasted until august there also 
was a coup attempt in may in july when cerezo tried to deliver a 
nationwide address a television station was blown off the air 
on aug 21 armed men with walkie talkies began whisking student 
leaders off the streets of guatemala city in broad daylight 
four bodies bearing signs of torture turned up near the 
university of san carlos on sept 10 a fifth was found a week 
later in a ravine used as a body dump during the dark days of 
military rule five students are still missing 
the central american report independently published by 
inforpress centroamericana and distrubuted to embassies 
businesses educational institutions and other private groups 
lists 77 political killings since midaugust but nobody knows how 
bad it really is in the countryside 
maria rumalda camey was one case she was the wife of a peasant 
farmer and a member of a humans rights support group near the end 
of august men came in the night and dragged her from her home 
her family seven children and three adults hid out with the 
red cross for six weeks before making a terrified dash across a 
rainslicked sidewalk to a waiting spanish embassy van and 
political asylum 
her husband jose spent his last night in guatemala hanging 
tattered laundry and trying to patch together battered suitcases 
he tried to fight off despair as he faced raising two babies alone 
in a strange land 
ill be afraid but i would be afraid here he said 
guatemala is returning to the bloody times 
diplomats political analysts and human rights activists all say 
the student disappearances seem to be the product of a military 
operation

one diplomat in close contact with the guatemalan military said 
the brazenness and the technical proficiency the weapons 
vehicles and communications equipment as well as the careful 
targeting of victims are earmarks of a security forces operation 
the students may have been suspected of links to leftist 
guerrillas several were involved in the teachers strike to many 
conservatives here association with a union movement is enough to 
brand someone as an extreme leftist 
peasant and labor leaders and human rights activists also have 
suffered in the backlash to a surge in political activity since 
1986 
cerezo and his christian democrats blame a rightist campaign to 
destabilize the government but the government also is seen by some 
as ineffective and incompetent paralyzed by fear of rightist 
violence 
mario sandoval alarcon a former vice president and leader of 
the rightwing national liberation movement said guatemalans will 
be ready to vote for a lawandorder president perhaps even a 
military candidate in november 1990 
gen efrain rios montt who presided over some of guatemalas 
worst savagery in the early 1980s when reported deaths and 
disappearances ran as high as 500 a month has already announced 
his availability 
the newest threat to guatemalan peace and democracy appears to 
be drug trafficking 
on aug 24 four men broke into the home of banker ramiro 
castillo love and shot him to death 
he refused to launder drug money said sandoval a friend of 
castillos sandovals assessment was shared by several diplomatic 
sources and political analysts 
there is no doubt that it was an execution designed to put the 
fear of god into the banking community one diplomat said 
the death aug 1 of danilo barillas a christian democrat is 
also said to be linked to the drug trade barillas headed a 
commission looking into corruption inside his party and is widely 
believed to have found links to colombian cocaine cartels 
many on the right believe the drug traffickers and the 
guerrillas reduced to perhaps fewer than 2000 fighters have 
formed an unholy alliance 
while there is no hard evidence of that the guerrilla war has 
taken a higher profile the guerrillas have begun staging 
attentiongetting attacks close to urban areas 
diplomatic pressure is on cerezo to rein things in but so far 
he has done nothing 
the central america report and diplomats say the un human 
rights commission is considering returning guatemala to a list of 
persistent human rights violators a list it left in 1987 
a us state department traveladvisory warning of 
indiscriminate terrorist attacks crime and clashes between the 
army and guerrillas will probably cut into tourism 
all us aid was suspended in 1977 because of human rights 
violations economic aid resumed early in the reagan administration 
and military aid in 1985 
for 1989 nonmilitary aid amounts to 153 million and military 
aid to 95 million the army has also bought 20000 m16 rifles 
for 138 million 200000 below a limit that would have required 
us congressional approval 
human rights advocate nineth de garcia believes cerezo is doing 
nothing because behindthescene negotiations after the coup 
attempts gave the security forces a free hand 
he has negotiated with the blood of the people she charged 
when cerezo took office he said he would consider himself a 
success if he handed over power to another elected president in 
todays guatemala that may well turn out to be his major 
accomplishment 
his government will survive portillo recinos predicted 
bitterly but the country is being destroyed

riding the waves the bismarck plowed across 
the seas as the fiercest fighting ship in world war ii collapsed 
on the ocean floor the german battleship looks cowed a beaten 
nazi relic 
the 1941 sinking of the bismarck and this years discovery of 
its eerily wellpreserved wreckage is the subject of national 
geographic explorer airing on cables tbs on oct 29 at 9 pm 
est 
the host of the onehour special is robert ballard the 
oceanographer who previously discovered the remains of the titanic 
the 1987 television account of the titanic find still stands as 
basic cables most popular show 
the bismarck initially was just another hunt just another 
ship ballard said but when i saw the faded remains of the 
swastika on the ships bow and stern and a solitary seamans boot 
lying on the ocean floor that symbolized to me the great tragedy 
of world war ii 
ballards bismarck show will repeat oct 30 at midnight est and 
nov 4 at 8 am est a videocassette of the program will be 
released in december by national geographic whose november 
magazine also details the bismarck exploration 
the bismarck was the most formidable battleship of its era in 
its first tour of duty the 820foot floating fortress literally 
blew britains prize battle cruiser hood out of the water killing 
all but three of the hoods 1419person crew 
at the time it was the most powerful ship on the sea peter 
schnall coproducer of the bismarck documentary said of the 
german warship it threatened to stop basically all of the supply 
ships that were coming in through the north atlantic to england 
a terrorized britain put every available warship into the 
1750mile chase after the bismarck prime minister winston 
churchill made his orders to his navy perfectly clear sink the 
bismarck 
two days after destroying the hood and racing for protection 
the bismarck was crippled by a british torpedoequipped biplane and 
the countrys carrier ark royal the combined assault ruined the 
bismarcks steering gear and rudders 
functionally immobile the warship was bombarded all night and 
finally scuttled by the germans only 115 of the bismarcks 2200 
hands survived 
the germans put everything into the battleship schnall 
said but like everything it had an achilles heel knock out the 
rudder and its like a big ship with nowhere to go 
ballards finding the bismarck required almost as much 
determination and luck as did britains sinking it with sonar and 
video and still cameras whirring away ballard spent two summers 
combing a 100square mile area of the oceans bottom 600 miles west 
of brest france 
ballards cabin was a couple of doors down from us said 
schnall who accompanied the oceanographer on the search and all 
of sudden one morning we hear this incredible scream because 
ballard has a video monitor in his room he had just woken up and 
he saw it just as the underwater camera was crossing the 
midsection of the ship right across the gun turrets 
and he let out a whoop that woke me up we ran down and 
grabbed our camera just as he was running out the door it was 
one of those rare moments in film when you catch something exactly 
as it happens 
what ballards cameras found more than 15000 feet below the 
surface of the atlantic startled the team 
it looked like the ship had just been launched from its 
original berth schnall said it sat straight up on its 
bottom 
there were no skeletons or human bones in sight 
the exciting thing about making the documentary is that it 
is almost like a natural story schnall said you have the 
bismarck going out you have the bismarck eluding the british and 
then eventually being sunk 
and we have an explorer ballard who goes to find the 
bismarck cant find it has to regroup himself and then go back 
out again the next year and find it 
after the filmmakers collected footage of the bismarcks 
wreckage they met with some of the men who once served on her 
decks and showed them the underwater footage 
very slowly they started to say yes isnt that the gun 
where i was standing or wasnt that the deck where soandso 
was standing before it went down 
and on and on it went eventually they saw the swastika on 
the stern of the ship one of the survivors heinrich kuhnt 
was asked what it felt like to have survived this horrible sea 
battle and he hesitated and slowly tears filled his eyes and he 
couldnt stop crying

zaw ye says he fled to the jungle after 
being beaten by soldiers with truncheons in rangoon and seeing a 
young woman who tried to help him pinned to the ground and killed 
by a bayonet thrust through her temple 
also at the demonstration in the burmese capital he said 
another woman student near him was struck in the head and as she 
reeled a second blow popped one of her eyes out 
zaw ye and other students then came to a conclusion we 
realized that no peaceful protests debates or strikes would work 
the only course is to resort to arms 
he and his companions slipped from rangoon after that 
demonstration in july and joined nearly 5000 others who had 
escaped earlier 
they are pledged to fight burmas military government until 
democracy is won 
but democracy appears to have become a distant glimmer for the 
millions of burmese who marched in the streets last year and faced 
the blazing guns of soldiers who finally put down the uprising in 
september 1988 
since then a 17member junta the state law and order 
restoration council has wielded power it has promised elections 
next may and is allowing more than 200 political parties to form 
but it simultaneously has arrested several thousand dissidents and 
silenced the main opposition leaders 
after the council took power the first wave of about 10000 
protesters leaving wives and families behind sought the 
protection of ethnic minority rebels along burmas rugged borders 
with thailand india and china 
about half of them returned however enticed by a government 
promise of amnesty and unable to put up with disease malnutrition 
and other hardships but the border movement did not falter as some 
had predicted 
the military council initially tried to make amends with an 
angry population and refurbish its brutal image internationally it 
allowed the daughter of national hero aung san to campaign and draw 
huge crowds 
but in late july when protests broke out and speeches by aung 
sans daughter suu kyi grew increasingly strident the military 
struck again she was placed under house arrest and martial law was 
tightened the united states charged that political detainees were 
being tortured 
a second wave of dissidents fled to the frontiers describing 
rangoon as a prison where people feared the military intelligence 
and the nighttime knock on the door 
today the all burma students democratic front claims a 
membership of more than 4800 students young professionals 
buddhist monks and others at 24 border camps compared to a year 
ago they appear to be tougher and better organized but also 
largely forgotten by the rest of the world 
we have a rough journey ahead of us said the fronts 
general secretary than win 
some students contrast their own status to that of students who 
fled military repression in china in june the chinese are given 
scholarships at us and other universities and international 
platforms to voice their protests the few burmese students who 
tried have had difficulties entering the united states and 
recently thailand eager for economic deals with the burmese 
government expelled those who had crossed into its territory 
life is marginal at camps like the one here at mawke a base for 
260 students who fight alongside the karen national union one of 
many ethnic rebel armies struggling for greater autonomy in burma 
set in a forest near the thai frontier the camp is a collection 
of crudely fashioned thatch huts offering little protection from 
monsoon rains two sleepers must sometimes share one blanket and 
there are few mosquito nets leaders say 75 percent of the student 
soldiers have suffered from malaria each can obtain only about 
350 worth of food rations a month 
the karentrained students at mawke have only about 100 weapons 
of assorted makes and the ammunition they carry most likely would 
run out in about 10 minutes of combat they acknowledge they could 
not face a main force burmese unit without karen help 
student leaders emphasize propaganda work in villages deeper 
inside burma where they claim to be warmly received units pass out 
leaflets give talks entertain and help villagers clear trails 
dig latrines and build small schools 
an hours walk from mawke the student front has built a school 
for its own members opened aug 1 as the jungle university 
its staff of teachers and doctors who fled with the students 
teaches political science english thai basic medicine 
agriculture and other subjects 
the students hope the us congress will pass legislation that 
would provide them up to 225 million worth of assistance to 
supplement the meager funds they now receive from various burmese 
exile groups and other private donors 
the united states and much of the inernational community have 
shunned burma politically since last year but the military 
government has been able to attract some investors by opening the 
country to foreign businessmen for the first time in a quarter 
century 
critics charge that much of the badly needed foreign currency 
being earned goes to buy weapons for the fight against the ethnic 
minorities with whom the students are allied 
although one western diplomat based in rangoon said that the 
students have been wrecked or driven to the border into 
irrelevance other analysts give more balanced assessments and 
the student front sees itself at the forefront of the prodemocracy 
fight 
the fronts chairman htun aung kyaw said that despite the 
sweeping arrests of dissidents the border camps can maintain links 
with underground antigovernment cells in burma their own ranks 
he said could easily be swelled from the interior but this is 
discouraged because the camps could not cope with an influx 
we are young brave and we are not selfish the chairman 
added in an interview students are the only ones the people 
trust we give the people inside courage and can tell the outside 
world what is happening in our country 
students have traditionally been at the cutting edge of burmese 
politics and the front hopes to endow itself with the aura of 
future leadership 
last february 30 student leaders met to seal their pledge to 
end authoritarian rule by drinking drops of their own blood mixed 
in a silver cup 
it was the same ritual burmas nearly legendary thirty 
comrades went through during world war ii when they pledged to 
liberate the country from the british

here are excerpts from an april 10 1987 memo written by 
william black a savings and loan regulator in san francisco to 
edwin gray then chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
black and other regulators met privately in washington with five 
us senators who questioned the handling of lincoln savings its 
parent company american continental corp and its chairman 
charles keating who was a large contributor to the senators 
the federal home loan bank of san francisco responsible for 
overseeing savings banks in california nevada and arizona wanted 
to seize lincoln in 1987 after keatings complaints supervision 
was transferred to washington regulators finally seized control of 
lincoln last april after acc filed for bankruptcy protection

sen dennis deconcini dariz we wanted to meet with you 
because we have determined that potential actions of yours could 
injure a constituent they lincoln have two major 
disagreements with you first with regard to direct investment 
where the sampl becomes a partner in a real estate venture second 
on your reappraisal theyre suing against your direct investment 
regulation we suggest that the lawsuit be accelerated and that 
you grant them forbearance while the suit is pending i know 
something about the appraisal values of the federal home loan bank 
board they appear to be grossly unfair lincoln is prepared to 
reach a compromise value with you 
sen alan cranston dcalif arriving im sorry i cant join 
you but i have to be on the floor to deal with the bill i just 
want to say that i share the concerns of the other senators on this 
subject cranston leaves 
sen john mccain rariz one of our jobs as elected officials 
is to help constituents in a proper fashion acc is a big employer 
and important to the local economy i wouldnt want any special 
favors for them i dont want any part of our conversation to 
be improper id like to mention the appraisal issue it seems 
to me theres a problem arizona is the second fastest growing 
state land values are skyrocketing that has to be taken account 
of in appraisals 
sen john glenn dohio even the accounting firm says 
youve taken an unusually adversary view toward lincoln to be 
blunt you should charge them or get off their backs if things are 
bad there get to them 
james cirona president of the federal home loan bank of san 
francisco this meeting is very unusual to discuss a particular 
company 
deconcini its very unusual for us to have a company that could 
be put out of business by its regulators 
richard sanchez supervisory agent lincoln had underwriting 
problems with all of their investments the examiners looked at 
52 real estate loans that lincoln had made since the 1984 exam 
there were no credit reports on the borrowers in all 52 of the loan 
files 
cirona these underwriting practices violate our regulatory 
guidelines 
black they are also an unsafe and unsound practice 
sen donald riegle dmich wheres the smoking gun where are 
the losses 
deconcini whats wrong with this if theyre willing to clean up 
their act 
cirona this is a ticking time bomb 
riegle these people saved a failing thrift acc is reputed to 
be highly competent 
black lincoln was not a failing thrift before acc acquired it 
it met its net worth requirement it had returned to profitability 
before it was acquired 
michael patriarca director of agency functions im relatively 
new to the savings and loan industry but ive never seen any bank 
or sampl thats anything like this this isnt even close you can 
ask any banker you know about these practices they violate the law 
and regulations and common sense 
glenn what violates the law 
patriarca their direct investments violate the regulation then 
theres the file stuffing they took undated documents purporting 
to show underwriting efforts and put them into the files sometimes 
more than a year after 
glenn have you done anything about these violations of law 
patriarca were sending a criminal referral to the department 
of justice not maybe were sending one this is an 
extraordinarily serious matter 
deconcini the criminality surprises me were not interested in 
discussing those issues our premise was that we had a viable 
institution concerned that it was being overregulated

houses condos and hotels sit like castles in the sand a 
developers vision realized next to the waves of the atlantic and 
the gulf of mexico 
but environmentalists see them as interlopers on the shifting 
dunes vulnerable to destructive storms such as hurricane hugo 
theres foolishness in building in gods sandbox unreasonably 
close to the ocean said dana beach of the south carolina coastal 
conservation league we have to make sure were not building or 
rebuilding on places that may not be there after the next storm 
while hugos roar and 135 mph punch have hit and run a 
philosophical squall still blows pitting private property rights 
against the public good 
sounding a charge to grow developers argue people have a right 
to build and protect their investment 
urging a strategic retreat environmentalists counter that 
overdevelopment is risky and can deny public access to eroding 
beaches 
states from new england to florida and around to texas have laws 
attempting to preserve the oceanfront in south carolina a 1988 
law may prevent the rebuilding of an estimated 213 oceanfront 
houses that were at least twothirds destroyed by hugo 
the law prohibits building in a socalled dead zone 20 feet 
behind an established dune line owners of damaged homes who dont 
have enough property to move inland out of the zone may be out of 
luck 
nature just delivered a very clear and enuciated message we 
have been setting ourselves up for a disaster the way we have 
developed the shoreline said orrin pilkey a duke university 
geologist and an expert on coastal dynamics if hugo doesnt 
prove that something has to be done nothing will ever do it 
barrier islands beaches and dunes are natural lines of defense 
that protect the mainlaind they surrender sand to absorb the 
energy of storm waves then are replenished gradually 
the problem comes if structures are built on the shifting 
shores pilkey and others believe that barriers built to protect 
buildings actually accelerate erosion 
what pilkey and his advocates want is to pull back to give 
nature a buffer in which to work even if it means letting homes 
fall into the ocean 
hugo was a warning shot for the entire us east coast said 
rob thieler a research assistant to pilkey at duke we know how 
to back up but are we willing to start knocking down buildings in 
new jersey because hugo hit in south carolina 
thats an easy question for many developers and coastal 
officials 
beaches are money machines that lure sun worshippers and tourist 
dollars realtors and investors have capitalized on the nations 
love affair with the shore by making it attractive to visit 
america is not going to abandon its coast people are going 
to live at the beach said richard beck former mayor of the 
barrier island community of folly beach off charleston 
abandonment is a cruel joke i defy anyone to show me where 
abandoning property has brought back the beach 
added john singleton an investor in heavily developed myrtle 
beach you cant expect a man who has a multimilliondollar hotel 
to walk away from it 
another punch faces stormbattered south carolina the highest 
tides in nine years are forecast for oct 16 a 65 million 
emergency effort aims to rebuild the dunes to prevent flooding 
it would be like pouring salt into a wound if the tides come 
in without any protective barrier said tucker eskew spokesman 
for gov carroll campbell 
meanwhile to protect property from erosion some beaches have 
been armored with seawalls and bulkheads but these intrusions can 
deny public access to the shore and critics object to spending 
public money to protect the ocean views of private landowners 
others note that more than just property is at stake in the 
debate future hurricanes could kill more people if they hit 
overdeveloped spots 
our concern is about the potential loss of life said robert 
sheets director of the national hurricane center we need to 
restrict the type of development were seeing 
south carolina had eight lawsuits filed before hugo in one 
case it was ordered to pay 12 million to a landowner unable to 
build on two lots in the dead zone but it is appealing the case 
more lawsuits are expected but other states have had their 
share of legal storms after hurricanes 
after hurricane alicia pounded galveston in 1981 texas 
probihited many residents from rebuilding under its open beaches 
act the courttested law bans building on the seaward side of a 
line of vegetation 
alicias storm surge moved the vegetation line back by as much 
as 175 feet 
its a poker game building on the beachfront and its a 
gamble with mother nature said ken cross an assistant texas 
attorney general 
under a 1981 law north carolina decreed that houses must be set 
back behind the first line of stable vegetation at a distance 30 
times the erosion rate the distance for larger structures is 60 
times structures built before the law cannot be rebuilt if they 
suffer 50 percent damage in a storm 
since 1985 the state has banned seawalls bulkheads and 
revetments to guarantee that beaches are accessible to the public 
it sends a message that these are not very safe places to 
build said george everett director of thenorth carolina 
division of coast management and were not going to let 
buildings impact on the publics right to have access the beach 
belongs to the public 
florida which has an 8000mile shoreline that is longer than 
any states except alaska protects its beaches in a number of ways 
in one example nothing can be built beyond the frontal dune 
which is the first raised portion of land from the waters edge if 
a hurricane destroys any building seaward of either the erosion 
line or the frontal dune it cant be rebuilt 
everybody wants to be able to walk out the door to the 
water said andy grayson director of floridas division of 
beaches and shores 
in massachusetts permits are given on a casebycase basis 
under the states wetlands protection act which gives the state 
authority to deny building or rebuilding 
if you can show you can build without harm to the beach or the 
dune you can do it but we have the authority to deny said 
jeff benoit chief of the states coastal zone management office 
rhode island the ocean state prohibits building on barrier 
beaches and dune crests a structure built before the law that is 
50 percent or more destroyed by a storm cannot be rebuilt without a 
permit 
if its destroyed by a storm that gives us a pretty good 
indication that it may be in an area thats inappropriate to be 
built on said tim dillingham a marine resource specialist 
georgias shore assistance act requires a specific setback for 
buildings proposed on sand dunes and barrier islands an existing 
building destroyed by a hurricane must comply with the setback law 
new jersey allows rebuilding but gov thomas kean has sought a 
coastal protection commission to control development keans order 
to require state approval for oceanfront development is being 
argued in appeals courts 
virginia and delaware govern new buildings but not existing 
ones damaged by storms maryland also does not restrict rebuilding 
theres no doubt people along the eastern seaboard have built 
too close to the ocean said clay brittain a hotel owner in 
myrtle beach we wouldnt do it again but you cant move back 
completely from a developed area its not practical to retreat

too much of a good thing has been bad for boeing 
co the worlds leading maker of commercial airplanes and the 
nations biggest exporter so in a sense a little bad news might 
help 
nearly 58000 unionized machinists struck the company this past 
week after contract negotiations collapsed the workers want a 
greater share of boeings record profits and less mandatory 
overtime which has kept many toiling seven days a week to fill 
staggering order backlogs 
on first glance the strike came at a bad time for the 
seattlebased company which dominates the commercial airplane 
market despite intense competition from mcdonnell douglas and 
europes airbus industrie 
domestic and foreign airlines ordered more than 700 planes this 
year from boeing stretching backorders to more than 1600 
aircraft worth 80 billion delaying deliveries by months and 
irritating customers who had been counting on those planes to 
modernize aging fleets 
of particular concern to buyers and boeing management is the 
companys commitment to deliver 57 of its new 747400 jumbo jets by 
yearend before the strike boeing officials had ordered assembly 
lines to turn out an unprecedented 27 of the big planes just in the 
last three months of the year 
the strike will almost certainly disrupt that accelerated 
schedule which could cost boeing latedelivery penalties and 
narrow the profit it makes on the new planes a few important 
clients have even dropped hints they want to renegotiate existing 
orders or even shop elsewhere 
the international association of machinists has hoped to exploit 
this pressure on boeing to make the company capitulate in what 
labor leaders are calling one of the most important 
unionmanagement struggles of the decade 
but some analysts say the strike could actually help the company 
and backfire on the machinists a militant and powerful union that 
historically has enjoyed enormous influence in the aerospace 
industry 
for one thing the walkout provides a reasonable excuse for 
delivery delays since its unlikely customers are going to demand 
airplanes assembled by strike replacements or foremen 
for another boeing had maintained such a relentless production 
agenda that many of its parts suppliers had failed to keep pace so 
the walkout gives them an opportunity to catch up 
but perhaps the most important reason the strike may not hurt 
boeing is the nature of the commercial airplane business itself 
built on longstanding relationships between airlines and aircraft 
makers buyers cannot simply repudiate multibilliondollar 
contracts that stretch over periods of years 
even if they could they may have nowhere else to go to buy the 
airplanes they need boeings competitors face many of the same 
orderbacklog problems that boeing has 
mcdonnell douglas for example has doubled its work force in 
the past two years to satisfy growing demand for new planes but 
the companys productivity has dropped because the new employees 
are so inexperienced 
at airbus where production is expected to double within four 
years officials have acknowledged a similar productivity problem 
the 20yearold fourcompany consortium also faces pressure from 
european governments tired of subsidizing its moneylosing 
operations 
of course the boeing strike outcome depends partly on how long 
the walkout lasts strikers have a 90 million fund that will pay 
them 100 a week after the third week so they wont deplete that 
money for more than three months 
they also may get financial help from other forces in organized 
labor which seem to be targeting boeing to regain some of the 
ground lost over the 1980s to other bluecollar employers in this 
country 
the unions have shown that they can no longer deliver higher 
wages or increased job security even in the highestpaying 
industries the airlines the auto companies steel and regulated 
public utilities said daniel lacey a clevelandbased consultant 
who tracks labor trends 
aerospace is the last highpaying target industry they have 
left so organized labor just cant afford to lose at boeing 
in other business and economic news this past week 
developer donald trump lobbed something special in the air at 
the parent of american airlines a 7 billion takeover proposal 
which if successful would be the biggest in the rapidly 
consolidating airline industry trump was expected to face a tough 
fight from amr corps hardboiled chief executive robert crandall 
who has said he wants to keep the no 1 airline independent 
government statistics suggested more evidence the economy is 
slowing civilian unemployment rose slightly in september to 53 
percent reflecting a shrinkage in manufacturing jobs stock and 
bond investors liked the news that more people were out of work 
because it suggested the federal reserve might cut interest rates 
to stimulate the econmy 
a strategic marriage in the auto business and a sale in the 
computer business suggested some new directions by a few wellknown 
american manufacturers general motors corp and chrysler corp 
announced the firstever big three joint venture to make key 
automotive parts zenith electronics corp sold its fastgrowing 
computer subsidiary to frances cie des machines bull in order to 
concentrate on televisions

researchers on wall street appear to have hit 
upon a promising antidote for the chills of disastrous octobers 
past 
the medicine in question combines hopes for falling interest 
rates a strong dollar and steady doses of slow but sustainable 
economic growth 
so far it seems to be working wonders lifting stock prices to 
record highs at a time when wall streeters have plenty of seasonal 
memories to dampen their spirits 
for those who like to keep track of such things this month 
marks the second anniversary of the market meltdown of 1987 
ten years ago there was the october massacre of 1979 when 
stock prices plunged amid fears of a credit crunch echoing a 
similar selloff in october 1978 
and 60 years back lingers the specter of the great crash of 1929 
against this daunting backdrop stocks got an unexpected boost 
as october 1989 began from talk that the federal reserve might find 
reason before long to consider relaxing its credit policy further 
since midyear interest rates had been climbing as investors 
concluded that the fed had less and less reason to worry about a 
recession and thus might shift back toward a restrictive 
inflationfighting strategy 
but statistics on wholesale and consumer prices showed no signs 
of mounting inflationary pressures as the economy kept chugging 
along 
and heading into the last quarter of the year the suspicion 
began to spread that the fed might find more maneuvering room to 
stimulate the economy without taking any big inflationary risks 
those feelings were reinforced on friday when the labor 
department reported that the civilian unemployment rate rose a 
tenth of a percentage point in september to 53 percent 
the monthly data also showed an increase of 209000 in nonfarm 
payroll employment well short of advance estimates on wall street 
in the range of 275000 to 300000 
even though several european countries posted increases in 
interest rates the dollar held its ground in foreign exchange and 
rates declined in this country 
that gave the stock market the encouragement it needed to chalk 
up the biggest weekly point gain of the year in the dow jones 
industrial average 
the widely recognized average of 30 blue chips climbed 9270 
points to 278552 for its best weekly showing since it jumped 
11486 points may 31june 3 of 1988 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 497 to 19894 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
1036 to 48364 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 717 at 39593 
volume on the big board averaged 17099 million shares a day up 
from 15148 million the week before 
until the last few days the dollar had been under pressure 
against leading foreign currencies since the group of seven 
industrialized countries issued a statement declaring strength in 
the american currency inconsistent with longer run economic 
fundamentals 
that assertion was followed by what jack lavery global research 
director at merrill lynch called an allout blitz against the 
dollar by the nations central banks 
thus many observers were impressed when the dollar bounced back 
quickly on thursday from the news of interestrate increases in 
west germany britain and other european nations 
over the long pull capital flows which we expect to be 
strong almost always have swamped the effects of central bank 
intervention said maury harris economist at painewebber inc 
harris concluded recent economic developments are pointing to 
lower interest rates

scores of cambodians complain they are 
blind or suffer blurry vision although their eyes are normal a 
malady some experts blame on the horrors they witnessed in the 
killing fields of their native land 
these women saw things that their minds just could not 
accept said psychology professor patricia rozeekoker of 
california state university long beach who studies vision 
complaints of the khmer rouge regimes refugees 
seventy percent of the women had their immediate family killed 
before their eyes she said so their minds simply closed down 
and they refused to see anymore refused to see any more death 
any more torture any more rape any more starvation 
the majority of the refugees with vision complaints are 40 to 
70yearold women who fled the khmer rouge regime which was 
toppled a decade ago 
experts believe the refugees suffer hysterical psychosomatic or 
functional blindness in which psychological turmoil spurs people 
with normal eyes to believe they are blind or see poorly 
many of the cambodians also show signs of severe depression and 
posttraumatic stress disorder which afflicted many vietnam war 
veterans rozeekoker said 
eye doctors said it is very difficult to distinguish patients 
with hysterical vision loss from malingerers who fake blindness to 
obtain disability benefits attention or sympathy 
some question whether psychological vision problems were 
triggered by sights of mass murder in cambodia or by trauma 
endured by khmerspeaking cambodian peasants adjusting to us life 
i think its a real phenomenon said dr hector sulit a 
long beach eye doctor who examined dozens of cambodians in recent 
years it could be the trauma the other possibility is 
cultural shock there might be a few looking for sympathy 
dr michael f marmor ophthalmology chairman at stanford 
university school of medicine said cambodians examined there for 
the most part were not consciously malingering although its 
almost impossible to rule out 
hundreds of thousands of cambodians were killed from 1975 to 
1978 by pol pots fanatical communist khmer rouge who tried to 
transform the nation into an agrarian commune until vietnam invaded 
in late 1978 nearly 200000 cambodians fled to the united states 
vietnam withdrew its troops in september 
hysterical blindness has been reported among shellshocked 
soldiers during world war i children of divorced parents and 
people involved in traffic accidents 
five years ago an unusual number of female cambodian refugees 
with psychosomatic vision problems were noticed by gretchen van 
boemel an electrophysiolgist at doheny eye institute in los 
angeles 
she contacted rozeekoker an old friend and since then they 
identified about 150 cambodian refugees in long beach who claim 
blindness or blurred vision although brain wave and eye tests found 
nothing physically wrong 
one woman saw her four children and husband killed in front of 
her then lost her vision right after van boemel said one 
woman watched her husband and three children taken away in 1975 
they never returned she reported she cried daily for four years 
then she stopped crying and couldnt see 
about 15 percent of the women said they were blind with no 
perception of light and the rest claimed varying degrees of 
blurry vision she added 
at stanford marmor and dr michael drinnan examined a number of 
people with psychosomatic blindness during the last two years 
there were more southeast asians with functional vision loss 
than other members of society and almost all seem to be 
cambodians a majority of them women marmor said most had 
some perception of light but they ranged widely over what they 
could see we speculated this may have to do with war trauma 
rozeekoker and van boemel initially interviewed 30 cambodian 
women through an interpreter and found those with the worst vision 
spent the most time living under the khmer rouge or in refugee 
camps 
the womens trauma history was extreme rozeekoker said 
they had lost several to all of their relatives they experienced 
beatings starvation forced labor humiliations separation from 
their families she also suspects the women may have been raped 
dr eric nelson an ophthalmology fellow at uclas jules stein 
eye institute said the womens psychosomatic vision problems did 
seem to happen shortly after they saw some horrendous things but 
they also went through horrendous changes of life as refugees 
marmor speculated cambodian refugees may be more prone to 
complain of vision trouble because they tend to be uneducated 
peasants who experience difficulty adapting to life in a new 
country 
to know whether the cambodian war was the cause of this would 
really take some scientific scrutiny particularly when we have 
such a different social situation and culture to understand said 
dr john keltner ophthalmology chairman at the university of 
californa davis 
since 1977 keltner and colleagues examined 137 patients who 
complained of vision problems but had healthy eyes they included 
laotian refugees but not cambodians most were faking to obtain 
disability payments or awards in lawsuits keltner said 
nelson studied eight cambodians to determine if their vision 
complaints were sincere 
some had applied for disability but some months before their 
vision loss he said in five cases the patients were given a 
diagnosis of major depression and two more also probably 
suffered it 
van boemel said most of the women she studied also suffered 
psychosomatic headaches dizziness general malaise and stomach 
cramps 
rozeekoker said the women sit isolated in their rooms and 
live over and over the trauma through horrible nightmares and 
intrusive thoughts and their vision problems are worse when they 
feel depressed 
two years ago van boemel and rozeekoker placed five of the 
women in group psychotherapy while five others participated in a 
group where they learned survival skills how to call police shop 
and ride buses 
after 10 weekly sessions about threefifths of the women 
reported improved vision and reduced depression rozeekoker said 
sulit said some cambodians get better without treatment he 
refers many to mental health clinics but the system is not there 
to help them with longterm counseling he said 
blurry vision suffered by lor poy a 54yearold cambodian 
resident of long beach improved after survival skills training 
rozeekoker said 
her eyesight worsens when she feels depressed or recalls how the 
khmer rouge killed her relatives and forced her to look at the 
bodies of slaughtered villagers said konthea kang a community 
rehabilitation services program coordinator who led the survival 
skills group 
poys case illustrates the difficulty distinguishing hysterical 
vision loss from malingering at a meeting with reporters she 
easily moved through her small apartment and when asked about 
relatives killed by the khmer rouge pointed to their photographs 
on a wall 10 feet away 
an eye disease textbook says that ability to move about 
without colliding with objects is an outstanding feature of 
hysterical blindness 
people who are faking it have exaggerated behaviors like 
groping the wall things blind people dont do rozeekoker said 
they are accustomed to their blindness and dont have to grope 
the wall

ethanol alcohol squeezed from the united 
states abundant corn supply is being injected into diesel bus 
engines turning billows of black exhaust smoke into nearly 
invisible white clouds 
supporters say the alcohol fuel will reduce air pollution 
extend the life of engines and raise the price farmers receive for 
their corn by boosting demand 
the first ethanoldiesel buses are rolling through the streets 
of des moines iowa in the heart of the cornbelt 
and dozens of other transit systems including cedar rapids 
iowa and decatur have expressed interest in burning ethanol in 
their fleets as they prepare for tougher emission standards 
our findings could revolutionize the way mass transit systems 
are fueled in the future said k stephen spade general manager 
of the des moines metropolitan transit authority 
by using ethanol we expect to reduce hazardous emissions 
by 50 percent while maintaining diesel fuel mileage 
the ethanol injector system is manufactured by midwest power 
concepts a radcliffe iowa company that developed the technology 
so farmers could burn ethanol in diesel tractors and combines 
the test buses have separate fuel systems one for diesel fuel 
and one for ethanol mpc president warren dobbertin said the fuels 
are not mixed as gasoline and ethanol are blended to create gasohol 
the buses draw ethanol during high power demand such as 
acceleration when the greatest pollution would occur with diesel 
fuel at other times such as cruising speeds buses switch to 
diesel for top economy dobbertin said 
you dont have to scrap all the engines that are in place now 
as you would with other alternative fuels said dobbertin we 
can do this now with existing buses in a few hours 
des moines will run 17 buses with the ethanol injectors they 
will be tested for pollution from the exhaust pipes and for fuel 
mileage 
spade said an initial sidebyside test of two buses was 
dramatic with the ethanol bus creating virtually no visible 
exhaust 
its just a white plume versus the big billows of black smoke 
we all see when were driving behind a bus said martin andreas 
senior vice president of archer daniels midland co in decatur 
adm a huge grain processor is the nations largest ethanol 
manufacturer with an annual production capacity of up to 600 
million gallons 
cities are choking to death its like dday and some 
decisions have to be made said andreas the thing that excites 
me about diesel is its a whole new market weve never been able to 
get into 
ethanol is expected to replace about 20 percent of the diesel 
fuel normally burned in buses dobbertin sid it also allows the 
engines to run cooler so they live longer he said 
about 850 million gallons of ethanol were sold last year almost 
all of it blended with gasoline 
the demand for ethanol could rise as much as 158 billion 
gallons if 20 percent of the diesel fuel burned in the united 
states was replaced by ethanol supporters say that would take 
about 632 million bushels of corn nearly 10 percent of an average 
us crop 
the thing that appeals to me is it is very simple you can put 
it on existing engines and you dont have to risk an entirely new 
design of engine said bob reed mass transit administrator for 
decatur 
the city council has approved a plan to seek 122000 in federal 
funds to equip and test five buses with the ethanol system 
andreas said the ethanol used in the buses is 80 proof and is 
not nearly as expensive as the 200 proof fuel alcohol blended with 
gasoline to make gasohol he said ethanol in the buses costs about 
the same as diesel fuel 
dobbertin said conversion of the bus engines with handbuilt 
injector systems costs about 7000 each and takes just two or 
three hours with mass production he said the cost could be far 
less 
by using an environmentallysafe renewable resource we can 
improve air quality cut foreign oil imports stimulate economic 
activity and create new demand for the nations corn crop 
dobbertin said

droopyeyed and weak millions of 
people visit their doctors every year with a common complaint they 
are tired 
doctors at the university of connecticut health center have 
discovered that relatively little study has focused on chronic 
fatigue despite interest in the socalled yuppie disease 
chronic fatigue syndrome 
they decided to help bridge the research gap by establishing a 
clinic for patients whose major complaint is chronic fatigue 
after seeing more than 300 patients over the past three years 
the doctors believe many of the chronically fatigued are suffering 
from depression not chronic fatigue and can be treated with 
antidepressants and therapy 
there is a great tragedy of saying that chronic fatigue is 
viral without a shred of evidence said dr thomas lane the 
clinics director depression and panic disorder are easily 
treatable 
contrary to the beliefs of many of their patients the doctors 
believe that few of their clients at the clinic are suffering from 
chronic fatigue syndrome 
the centers for disease control in atlanta defined the syndrome 
as an illness just last year the cdc says its victims have other 
symptoms besides unending tiredness including headache sore 
throat fever weakness lymph node pain muscle and joint pains 
memory loss and difficulty concentrating 
both the cause and the cure for the syndrome are unknown but 
many doctors believe the root is viral several studies have 
attempted to link chronic fatigue to the epsteinbarr virus which 
is related to herpes 
the mystery surrounding persistent fatigue prompted a fateful 
discussion between lane and his colleagues dr dale matthews and 
dr peter manu in 1985 
we compared notes and thought it might be one patient in 10 
whose main complaint was chronic fatigue so we went to the 
literature and found it was the fourth most common complaint for 
seeing a doctor said lane the fatigue clinics director 
fatigue accounts for 105 million visits to us doctors each 
year he said 
research so far has been minimal and even that has been 
descriptive lane said doctors simply describe the people 
theyve treated 
in november 1986 lane and his colleagues began asking patients 
plagued by fatigue to come to a special clinic they treated adults 
who have not been hospitalized in the past three months and whose 
primary complaint is feeling tired at least half the time for at 
least the past month 
most of the clinics patients are between 20 and 30 years old 
women outnumber men two to one many come to the clinic convinced 
they have chronic fatigue syndrome 
the physicians complete a medical history of their patients 
give them a physical examination and comprehensive blood tests the 
physicians check for the textbook causes of fatigue thyroid 
problems viral infections and low blood sugar 
patients also must complete a 260item questionnaire recognized 
by the national institute of mental health as an accurate test for 
psychiatric diagnoses special tests like sleep studies are 
ordered as needed lane said 
the clinics findings on 135 patients published in 1988 showed 
that the major causes of fatigue for 67 percent of the patients 
were active psychiatric disorders for 3 percent medical disorders 
were the major causes only 6 percent of patients met the cdc 
definition of chronic fatigue 
the major cause of fatigue in the remaining patients was unclear 
the clinics findings have gained recognition including 
publication in prominent medical journals and criticism from some 
chronic fatigue syndrome sufferers who question the link between 
chronic fatigue and depression 
he prescribes drugs and psychotherapy for patients who are 
depressed or suffer panic disorders 
jane packer 36 of thomaston said she regained her energy after 
accepting lanes prescriptions 
before she saw lane she would wake up in the morning and feel 
as though she had not slept the night before she became so 
melancholy she said she would cry at the drop of the hat 
after tests failed to tell her what was wrong she wanted to 
believe she was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome 
its not easy to admit that youre depressed theres a 
stigma she said i think some people with chronic fatigue may 
have something viral wrong with them but i think most people are 
like me

the cervical cap is somewhat more effective 
in preventing pregnancy than condoms and diaphragms and twothirds 
of its failures are caused by improper use according to a study of 
3433 women 
there are a shrinking number of contraceptive options for 
women said dr gary richwald of the university of california 
los angeles the iud is now recommended for limited use and 
while the pill has a lower failure rate 6 percent the cap 
offers a new relatively safe form of birth control with fewer and 
less serious side effects than the pill 
the ucla study found about 12 percent of women who use the 
cervical cap become pregnant within the first year of use that 
compares with firstyear pregnancy risks of 16 percent for the 
diaphragm and 14 percent for condoms according to the american 
college of obstetricians and gynecologists 
previous studies of the cervical caps effectiveness found 
firstyear pregnancy rates ranging from 8 percent to 19 percent 
richwald says his eightyear study of 3433 women who used the 
birth control device is the largest longest and involves patients 
of doctors nurses and midwives which allows for greater 
generalization of the findings 
about 70000 women use the cervical cap which is a small rubber 
cup that fits over the cervix or uterine opening and stays in 
place by suction it was approved for widespread use in may 1988 by 
the us food and drug administration which said the cap should be 
used with spermicide and worn for no more than 48 hours 
some studies have suggested the cap can induce precancerous 
cervical abnormalities reflected by abnormal pap smear results 
richwald found few such changes but noted further studies are 
needed to clarify the risk 
twothirds of pregnancies among cap users were due to improper 
use rather than failure of the cap itself ucla said in a news 
release a statement by the acog said the risk of pregnancy was 
only 6 percent among near perfect cap users who never had 
unprotected sex and always used spermicide in the cap 
the study was published in the august issue of the journal 
obstetrics and gynecology

when acupuncture prevents pain it doesnt 
act on the same parts of the nervous system as painkilling drugs 
say scientists who studied patients undergoing surgery in china 
most anesthetic agents will change brain waves and alter how 
nerve fibers conduct impulses and one can measure these changes 
acupuncture works by other mechanisms we currently have no way of 
measuring said dr arnold starr of the university of 
california irvine college of medicine 
starr a neurology professor and his colleagues visited 
hangzhou china to measure brain waves nerve impulse conduction 
and ability to perform tasks such as recognizing musical tones in 
five patients undergoing surgery for removal of thyroid tumors one 
to two inches in size 
acupuncture needles were inserted 20 minutes before surgery and 
the acupuncture points were restimulated during the operations but 
the patients remained alert and able to speak 
they also received very small doses of painkilling drugs and a 
muscle relaxant starr said the drugs alone would be inadequate to 
block the pain of surgery but may work in concert with acupuncture 
to alter how the patients perceived pain 
the patients brain nerve and sensory activity remained 
unchanged during surgery even though they felt no pain starr and 
colleagues reported in septembers issue of the journal archives of 
neurology 
the findings suggest acupuncture acts on the bodys system of 
endorphins which are chemicals that bind to parts of the nervous 
system to reduce the perception of pain starr said

trials of the first 30 hip replacement 
devices designed at the mayo clinic show they are less painful to 
their recipients and less likely to fail than todays standard 
devices a mayo physician says 
the new design is dramatically different from other implant 
devices on the market said dr bernard morrey professor and 
chairman of mayos department of orthopedics 
primarily it is shorter than traditional devices and the 
doublewedged tapered design allows it to be affixed to the bone 
without cement it is less invasive and less of the patients bone 
must be removed to implant it important factors in case the 
device must be replaced he said 
mayo clinic has performed about 20000 hip replacements in the 
last 20 years in recent years however about onethird have been 
secondtime replacements because an earlier device failed 
morrey a specialist in adult reconstructive surgery has been 
the only surgeon using the new device other mayo physicians will 
begin implanting it and if it proves successful the device could 
be widely available in about a year if the results continue to 
prove successful 
a mayo team began designing the device in the early 1980s 
because of the need for an implant that could be affixed to the 
bone without relying on cement 
although cemented implants are successful with older patients 
they tend to crack and fail in more active people when the cement 
cracks the implant loosens and the surgery must be redone 
initially specialists thought an implant would need to be 
large with a large surface area to be affixed without cement 
morrey said 
but there was concern the body would produce an adverse 
biological or biomechanical response he said in fact early 
evidence suggested that bones could dissolve because the stress 
they needed to be viable was taken by the implant instead 
mayo clinic specialists designed the shortstem implant with a 
working part of about three inches about half the length of the 
traditional device because of its shorter length the bone 
receives the stress it needs to avoid dissolving 
the shorter length could explain why people dont have the thigh 
pain that affects about one in 10 people with noncemented 
implants morrey said although the pain usually subsides in a 
year it can compromise the success of implants that otherwise look 
perfect 
the implement was designed to be easy to manufacture in hopes of 
keeping costs down morrey said the same implant can be used in 
the right hip or the left hip so medical facilities can keep their 
inventory low

results as americans spent freely on clothing last month but 
hesitated about expensive items like home appliances 
retailers who depend on apparel for much of their business said 
thursday they had strong sales gains but other stores including 
the nations biggest retailer sears roebuck and co did not fare 
as well 
overall sales were pretty good better than we would have 
expected said jeffrey edelman a retail industry analyst with 
drexel burnham lambert inc 
apparel retailers got a boost when cooler weather in many areas 
sent consumers in search of warmer clothing during the last week to 
10 days of september analysts said 
but sales of more expensive durable goods which include items 
such as home appliances continued slumping because consumers were 
still juggling high amounts of installment debt said jeffrey 
feiner an analyst with merrill lynch amp co 
analysts said this trend was most noticeable in the performance 
of sears the company reported its overall sales rose 04 percent 
when compared with september 1988 but declined 18 percent at 
stores open at least a year known in the industry as samestore or 
comparablestore sales 
retailers and analysts consider samestore sales a more accurate 
reflection of a companys performance than totals that include 
sales at recently opened stores 
sears the nations largest retailer has been unable to 
overcome a severe sales slump despite a new everydaylowprice 
and merchandising strategy 
other mass merchandisers and discount retailers fared better 
k mart corp said its overall september sales increased 61 
percent while samestore sales were up 3 percent 
walmart stores inc said its overall sales were up 31 percent 
in september and samestore sales rose 16 percent 
jc penney co said its overall september sales rose 117 
percent while samestore sales increased 107 percent 
may department stores inc whose department store chains are 
heavily dependent on apparel sales said its overall results rose 
89 percent last month as samestore sales rose 65 percent 
limited inc the nations largest specialty apparel retailer 
said its september sales increased 10 percent overall and 6 percent 
on a samestore basis 
feiner the merrill lynch analyst described consumers as 
muddling along but drexels edelman was more upbeat 
the consumers willing to spend he said spending will be 
maintained at a fairly decent pace 
the retailers are moving into the most critical part of the 
year in the fourth quarter which includes the holiday shopping 
season they typically make half their annual profits 
economists also will be watching sales in the final quarter of 
the year as a barometer of how the economy is faring consumer 
spending which includes retail sales accounts for twothirds of 
the gross national product 
analysts warned that when octobers sales figures are in they 
may not look as rosy because they will be compared with the strong 
performance of october 1988 when the apparel industry began its 
recovery from a yearlong slide 
the figures reported thursday were from major general 
merchandise chains and apparel retailers the governments monthly 
retail sales report is more comprehensive including sales at auto 
dealers supermarkets restaurants and elsewhere 
in other reports 
dayton hudson corp said its overall sales were up 164 percent 
in september while samestore sales increased 86 percent 
woolworth corp said overall sales rose 85 percent last month 
and samestore sales were up 39 percent 
montgomery ward amp co reported its sales rose 1 percent in 
september the company did not release samestore results

robert l crandall sits at the top of the nations 
largest airline a toughminded executive whose goal is to make amr 
corp a survivor in deregulated skies 
some people see him as the kind of man who might step over his 
grandmother to get to a business deal that will be good for 
american airlines one unnamed former executive told the dallas 
times herald in a 1982 interview 
but hes honest and thats what make him the most respected 
man in the business said the executive 
crandall also is usually included on lists of the airline 
industrys top executives 
the 53yearold chairman president and chief executive of amr 
is in many ways the antithesis of donald trump the flashy new 
york billionaire who has proposed a 7 billion buyout of amr 
trump is an active member of new york society and attaches his 
name to most of his holdings from the trump shuttle the airline 
he bought from eastern airlines to the trump princess his private 
yacht 
crandall is a much more private man unaccustomed to giving 
interviews he is however blunt 
you must remember that bob crandall doesnt bluff says one 
industry analyst he threatens but he doesnt bluff 
trump himself has high praise for crandall saying the buyout 
proposal reflects the enormous respect that i have for the 
company its management team and the companys employees 
the bid comes at a time when crandall has been anticipating 
expanding americans 218 percent share of the domestic market 
crandall is licking his chops to get at united and some of his 
more leveraged competitors said kevin burke an analyst for 
first union corp a bank holding company in charlotte nc 
ual corp parent of former number one carrier united airlines 
is undergoing a 675 billion buyout by employees and management 
hes an airline builder burke said of crandall by 
building the best and largest airline in the us he wants to be 
one of the global survivors in what has been a cutthroat 
industry 
crandall took over as chairman and chief executive of amr and 
american airlines inc on march 1 1985 adding to his duties as 
president which he had held since 1980 he has been on americans 
board since 1976 
he joined american in 1973 as senior vice presidentfinance and

as head of marketing crandall helped institute americans super 
saver and frequent flier fare structures its shift to hub 
operations and creation of sabre the computerized reservation 
system now considered one of the airlines key assets

like a highstakes baccarat player at one of his 
atlantic city casinos real estate tycoon donald trump has made 
some profitable bluffs to help bankroll his ambitious and splashy 
acquisitions 
i keep a lot of balls in the air because most deals fall out 
no matter how promising they seem at first trump says in his 
bestselling book the art of the deal 
his shrewd acquisitions have expanded his empire of 
hotelcasinos and prime manhattan real estate most recently trump 
purchased eastern airlines lucrative northeast shuttle service for 
365 million in early june pledging to turn it into an absolute 
diamond 
in july 1987 trump took control of resorts international inc 
a new jersey gaming and real estate company he won in a takeover 
battle he sold resorts last year to entertainer merv griffin 
trump has added other jewels to his crown new yorks landmark 
plaza hotel and the trump tower apartmentretailoffice complex 
the trump plaza apartment tower several casinos in atlantic city 
nj and the bahamas buildings in west palm beach flam and 
undeveloped land holdings 
but not all his deals have ended up by putting properties in his 
hands trump also has made takeover feints at golden nugget inc 
pan am corp and united airlines parent allegis corp now called 
ual corp 
in each case he accumulated shares in the company sometimes 
indicating he might be interested in mounting a buyout and later 
sold all or some of his shares at a profit after the price rose on 
the ensuing takeover speculation or when another bidder emerged 
with allegis for example trump is believed to have paid about 
50 a share for his 49 percent stake which exceeded 25 million 
shares he later reportedly sold them at nearly 74 netting around 
80 million on the deal 
trump also sought and received federal antitrust clearance to 
buy up to 15 percent of federated department stores incs shares 
in 1988 although he never made a buyout offer he is estimated to 
have netted 100 million on his investment in federated which he 
made two weeks before canadian retailer campeau corp launched a 
hostile and ultimately successful bid 
in trumps latest move a 7 billion buyout proposal for amr 
corp parent of american airlines his strategy is different he 
came out openly with an outright buyout proposal in a letter to amr 
chairman robert l crandall offering to pay 120 a share in cash 
in a deal that would be the biggest airline buyout ever 
trumps track record of making runs at companies has made some 
financial analysts wary of his intentions concerning amr 
im very skeptical of everything this man does said andrew 
geller an airline analyst at provident national bank in 
philadelphia he wants to put amr in play and make profits from 
it 
wall street showed its skepticism amr stock closed thursday at 
9987 a share in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange up 
sharply from 83 on wednesday but well below trumps bid of 120 
trump is believed to have discreetly snapped up amr shares in 
recent weeks keeping his holding below 5 percent of amrs total 
outstanding shares the level at which a stake must be reported to 
the securities and exchange commission observers speculated 
thursday that the developer paid 70 to 80 a share allowing him 
a tidy profit if he sells out 
still his reputation could be on the line because hes made 
his buyout intentions official this time trump has to be prepared 
to have his bluff called by amr or this could be his last deal 
geller suggested 
trump insists hes not in it for the money except as a way to 
keep score 
the real excitement is playing the game he says

a senate committee has approved legislation 
that would broaden the authority of the secretary of transportation 
over debtfinanced buyouts of airlines 
the legislation approved thursday by the senate commerce 
science and transportation committee will prevent any buyer from 
acquiring 25 percent or more of an airline without prior approval 
of the secretary 
the bill would require the secretary to certify that the deal 
would not damage the airlines ability to operate or to expand its 
business 
the congress must send a strong message that highly leveraged 
buyouts are not tolerable said sen wendell ford dky who 
with sen john mccain rariz sponsored the legislation the 
safety and efficiency of our aviation system is a public trust 
i dont want to wake up when all us carriers have been 
leveraged and bought out when foreign interests are manipulating 
our markets to decide that something should be done to regulate 
the buying and selling of major parts of our transportation 
network 
the bill now goes to the full senate a house aviation 
subcommittee is examining different legislation to address the 
issue 
on wednesday transportation secretary samuel skinner told 
fords aviation subcommittee that his work in the proposed 
northwest airlines takeover would have been easier had be been 
given the opportunity to approve the transaction in advance 
the department forced a modification of the takeover last week 
getting the dutch airline klm to reduce its investment in and 
influence over the new company the transaction had been announced 
in june 
but skinner said he didnt necessarily favor new legislation to 
deal with acquisitions in the airline 
current law restricts foreign ownership of airlines to 25 
percent of the stock although it requires the department to 
approve changes of ownership advance approval is not required

commerce secretary robert mosbacher says the 
us trade deficit is likely to shrink to between 100 billion and 
110 billion this year with japan accounting for about half of 
that imbalance 
through the first seven months of the year the trade deficit 
has been running at an annual rate of 1058 billion down 11 
percent from the 1988 deficit of 1185 billion 
the trade deficit for this year is improving at exactly half the 
pace of last year when the gap between imports and exports fell by 
22 percent down from a record 15212 billion in 1987 
mosbacher predicted thursday that the deficit with japan would 
total 50 billion this year meaning that one country will account 
for about half of the total deficit 
the huge imbalance in japanese trade makes that country our 
prime target in administration efforts to lower the imbalance 
mosbacher said in testimony before the house foreign affairs 
committee 
in a separate congressional appearance us trade 
representative carla hills was also blunt about the need for japan 
to do more to open its markets 
japan is an economic superpower but they must contribute to 
the system and not just take from it hills said she said this 
is the message she will convey next week during a round of trade 
discussions in tokyo

japanese and european corporations know better 
than american ones how to take advantage of what is being produced 
in us governmentfunded laboratories witnesses told a house 
subcommittee 
the japanese are not picking our pockets the europeans are 
not picking our pockets theyre picking it off the table said 
attorney robert h brumley former general counsel in the commerce 
department 
brumley testified at a hearing thursday of the house small 
business subcommittee on regulation business opportunities and 
energy the washingtonbased attorney said government officials are 
ignorant of the laws encouraging the private use of 
governmentdeveloped technology 
its not understood as a matter of public policy he said 
its that simple 
he said that ignorance had to be overcome before his office 
could make sure the international agreement on the space station 
protected the rights of us contractors and subcontractors when 
foreign partners begin to take commercial advantage of developments 
from the project 
in the meantime witnesses said the information is caught up in 
red tape or inertia too often classified in the united states but 
available abroad or just the opposite reports on inventions are 
disseminated before companies can bid on them 
the subcommittee staff is exploring the effectiveness of the 
federal technology transfer act of 1986 and previous legislation in 
encouraging the private use of governmentdeveloped technology 
the act combined with an executive order in 1987 allows 
federal laboratories to enter into cooperative research and 
development agreements with the private sector and provides for 
royalty sharing by government scientists 
white house adviser d allan bromley said there were 200 such 
agreements now 
critics say the act is too soft in its language doing too 
little to encourage active leadership all witnesses said that 
leadership was necessary for technology transfer to get anywhere 
the government spends more than 60 billion a year on research 
in 700 laboratories 47 percent of the research and development 
expenditures in this country according to the subcommittee 
research 
from the army corps of engineers to the department of energy to 
nasa the national institutes of health and the agriculture 
department the governmentfinanced laboratory produces a weath of 
materials that can be used in medicine construction and 
manufacturing 
however licensing payments to federal researchers and 
institutions totaled less than 4 million last year said rep ron 
wyden dore chairman of the subcommittee 
bromley told the subcommittee he was committed to improving 
technology transfer and under prodding by wyden said his 
technology blueprint for the nation to be released early this 
year would contain a section on the subject 
he also said he was creating an industrial technology section in 
his office of science and technology policy he said he has 
selected a person for that position and president bush would be 
announcing the appointment 
the office would be in charge of competitiveness issues 
including technology transfers he said 
there are some very bright spots in the system he said 
but i certainly agree with you that we have a long way to go

investor carl icahn says he is studying the 
feasibility of making a bid for usx corp after buying an 
additional 425 million shares of the steel and oil giant 
his purchase of 155 million worth of shares this week raised 
his stake in the pittsburghbased company to 1306 percent from 
1141 percent 
icahn said in a filing with the securities and exchange 
commission on thursday that a group led by him wants to explore a 
meaningful restructuring that would substantially enhance 
shareholder value 
icahn who owns trans world airlines inc said his group was 
considering making proposals for business combinations with 
usx a phrase that a source close to icahn said meant the investor 
was considering a friendly takeover offer 
icahns filing said he was discussing the feasibility of a deal 
with usx in combination with other possible participants and 
sources of financing he said he also was considering asking other 
shareholders to elect nominees proposed by icahn to the usx board 
of directors 
icahn reserved the right to sell his usx shares but said he was 
not interested in selling them back to the company at a premium a 
practice known as accepting greenmail 
the relevant pages of icahns filing with the sec were supplied 
to some reporters late thursday after the stock market closed by 
steven rubin a lawyer for icahn in new york 
usx shares fell 37 cents to close at 3837 thursday in new 
york stock exchange trading after surging over the last several 
days on rumors that icahn might be making another move with his 
stake in the company 
the stock rose 175 to 3487 on monday when usx announced it 
is offering to sell natural gas and oil reserves that analysts say 
could bring about 15 billion 
the stock rose 137 to 3625 the next day amid talk that 
icahn was buying additional shares and it surged 275 wednesday 
to 3875 he acquired his additional shares tuesday and wednesday 
icahn who won a takeover battle for twa and sold a stake in 
texaco inc for 2 billion bought his usx stock at prices believed 
to average in the low 20s he once suggested a buyout at 31 a 
share or around 7 billion but never made a tender offer 
the united steelworkers union meanwhile requested thursday 
that usx reopen its existing labor agreement to restore sacrifices 
granted by members in the 198283 and 198687 rounds of bargaining 
usw local presidents met in pittsburgh on wednesday and thursday 
to discuss the proposal which was overwhelmingly approved the 
presidents represent about 18500 steelworkers 
the steelworkers current master agreement expires jan 31 1991 
a new and improved pattern of compensation now prevails in the 
steel industry as a result of the current round of collective 
bargaining usw president lynn williams wrote in a letter to usx 
chief executive officer charles corry similar improvements have 
been made throughout american industry during recent months 
usx employees and retirees are certainly no less deserving 
than other steelworkers and those who work in other industries 
he said 
also thursday usx said it filed a lawsuit accusing drexel 
burnham lambert inc of deception when it sold the steelmaker 24 
million in shortterm commercial paper issued by financially 
troubled integrated resources inc 
usx contends in the civil complaint filed tuesday in us 
district court that as underwriter of the paper drexel withheld 
information about problems at integrated which defaulted on its 
debt shortly after the usx purchases 
integrated a former highflying real estate and insurance 
concern on june 9 defaulted on 955 million in shortterm 
obligations and declared a moratorium on all debt payments while it 
restructured 
we have not yet seen the complaint we believe we have 
fulfilled our obligation to purchasers of integrateds commercial 
paper drexel spokesman steven anreder said thursday

europes interest rate increases were greater than 
the financial markets expected and some critics warned they might 
do the job too well slowing economic growth too much 
britain is the most vulnerable nation to economic and political 
repercussions from the decision thursday by european governments to 
raise their interest rates to combat inflation and stabilize their 
currencies 
the upward move was led by west germany which raised its key 
rates an unexpected full percentage point 
the british government responded by raising rates a full point 
as well to 15 percent their highest in nearly eight years it was 
a politically risky move to defend the pound 
other european central banks including those of france 
switzerland and austria moved their rates up as well to ease 
downward pressure on their currencies and keep them within trading 
ranges imposed by the european monetary system which links the 
currencies of most common market nations in order to minimize rate 
swings britain doesnt participate 
the dollar finished higher anyway on thursday but european 
stock markets were unsettled 
the dollar closed at 18845 west german marks up from 18770 
marks on wednesday and the financial timesstock exchange 
100share index of the british exchange fell 305 points or 13 
percent to close at 22816 
the previous tandem interest rate increase took place in late 
june the markets had been watching a thursday meeting of the west 
german central banks council for a possible rise but many were 
stunned by its size 
the increases could be dangerous to the economy and could be 
too high said peter pietsch an economist with commerzbank in 
frankfurt 
john banham directorgeneral of the confederation of british 
industry called them wholly unnecessary 
high interest rates have done their job by curbing overheating 
in the economy and this further rise will be counterproductive 
he said 
british lawmaker john smith the opposition labor partys 
spokesman on trade said this is appalling news for millions of 
mortgage payers and for businesses all over britain living costs 
will rise and investment will become even more expensive 
the bundesbank raised its discount rate the rate at which a 
commercial bank can borrow funds from the central bank from 5 
percent to 6 percent and pushed up its lombard rate from 7 percent 
to 8 percent 
the lombard rate is the rate at which the central bank lends 
funds using securities as collateral 
the last time the bundesbank raised key rates by more than half 
a point was in february 1980 
the west german government bank said the increases were designed 
to combat continued inflationary danger resulting from an 
exuberant economy it also said they were aimed at stabilizing 
the mark 
west germanys economy is growing at a rate of 45 percent 
compared with the previous 2 percent and inflation is at 3 
percent said david morrison an economist at goldman sachs 
international corp in london 
he speculated that west germany wanted to get interest rate 
increases out of the way well before a 1990 national election 
this probably reflects a peak for interest rates he said 
but british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson the 
cabinet member responsible for national finances said on british 
broadcasting corp television that he couldnt promise that 
britains rates wouldnt go even higher 
soon after the german move the bank of england signaled the 
full percentage point increase in the british commercial banks 
base rates to the 15 percent level the 11th increase since june 
1988 when rates stood at a decade low of 75 percent 
britain has the highest interest rates among the major western 
democracies 
britains treasury said the european rate hikes reflected a 
general concern to take no risks on inflation 
lawson told bbc radio that with his conservative party opening 
its annual convention monday the increase was extremely 
awkward but he said its necessary to do the right thing 
british markets had expected a rate increase since poor trade 
figures were announced last week pressuring the pound the bank of 
england has since intervened in currency trading repeatedly to 
support the pound 
lawson has maintained that a strong pound is essential to the 
governments fight against inflation whose annual rate stood at 
73 percent in august down from 82 percent in july but more than 
double the 33 percent in january 1988

in overseas markets thursday despite interest rate hikes by west 
european central banks higher interest rates are supposed to 
support a currency against other currencies 
earlier thursday the bundesbank west germanys central bank 
raised its key lending rates by 1 percentage point including the 
official discount rate to 6 percent annually the measure was 
aimed at curbing the dollars strength in order to help stem 
inflationary pressures in west germany 
central banks in britain france and other european nations 
followed with similar measures thursday 
masaaki tanahashi a dealer with mitsui bank said japans 
central bank intervened selling many millions of dollars but said 
the intervention helped little to stop the dollars upward

for september due out later today in washington as a factor in 
finding the dollars direction 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto meanwhile told a news 
conference today japan will watch carefully for any impact from the 
raise in west european interest rates he added however we are 
not considering any change in our monetary policy for now

european interest rates

one antitrust expert said the deal which must be approved by 
the federal trade commission or the us justice department may 
face close scrutiny 
i am certain the companies will argue that it is a very 
limited arrangement said law professor martin adelman of wayne 
state university in detroit but if they start with a small joint 
venture how do you know the companies wont talk about other 
arrangements 
ford motor co spokesman tom foote said his company did not have 
immediate comment on the deal we have to learn more about it 
he said 
gm spokesman john hartnett said he expects the federal 
government to consider the antitrust implications of the deal later 
this year he said he did not anticipate any problems 
hartnett and chrysler spokesman james kenyon said gms muncie 
plant was not being used to its capacity while chryslers syracuse 
plant had too much work 
neither company would give the production levels of either 
plant the 2700 workers at the syracuse plant and the 1400 at 
muncie factory should be unaffected hartnett and kenyon said 
muncie is underutilized to a degree and this could add 
employment hartnett said 
transmissions from the two plants will go to a variety of gm and 
chrysler cars trucks minivans and jeeps with manual 
transmissions profits or losses generated by the plants will be 
shared in the same proportion as the ownership 
gm president robert stempel said the venture would enhance 
efficiency at both plants 
this alliance is a winwin situation that means greater 
job security for both facilities chrysler vice chairman gerald 
greenwald said 
engineers from gm ford and chrysler are involved in a joint 
project looking into uses of plastics for cars and trucks of the 
future

boeing co apologized to defense secretary 
richard cheney for any delays stemming from the strike by 57800 
machinists and supervisors worked to complete jetliners nearly 
ready for delivery 
striking machinists the biggest group of production workers at 
the worlds largest aerospace company continued to press their 
claim for a larger share of the companys profits on the picket 
lines 
i would just like to see things a little more fair fred 
mayo a mechanic at boeings everett plant said thursday night on 
the picket line the company did have a record year last year 
boeing the worlds largest commercial jet builder with 65 
percent of the free worlds market is in its fifth consecutive 
year of record jetliner orders with a backlog worth 80 billion 
the strike went into its third day today with no new 
negotiations scheduled 
boeing spokesman harold carr said company officials met 
wednesday to discuss the strike but he knew of no further meetings 
thursday 
the company is mute said union spokesman jack daniels 
theyre doing their aristocratic aloof act 
the machinists union is seeking a larger share of boeings 
prosperity and fewer hours of mandatory overtime union members 
current wages range from 888 to 1842 an hour wage rates 
havent been increased for six years although boeing has paid 
bonuses 
the union rejected an offer of an immediate raise of 4 percent 
with 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991 annual bonuses of 8 
percent of a workers gross earnings this year and 3 percent the 
next plus a reduction in mandatory overtime to 160 hours a quarter 
from 200 hours 
i have a family and on the average i work 12hour days 
usually six or seven days a week mayo said i dont want to 
wake up one day and discover that ive missed seeing my 2yearold 
son grow up 
chairman frank shrontz sent cheney a telegram thursday 
apologizing for any delays in delivery because of the strike and 
assuring that boeing will do all it can to resolve this issue at 
the earliest possible time 
boeing receives billions of dollars of defense contracts a year 
that range from work on the b2 stealth bomber to guided missile 
systems and avionic research 
we hope the strike will be shortlived the telegram said 
company spokesman jack gamble said about 40 planes were in the 
final assembly or test stages at everett and renton that probably 
could be completed during the strike before the strike boeing was 
producing about 30 planes a month 
weve been working on a couple of airplanes and thats it so 
far gamble said the first couple of days are spent figuring 
out who youve got available in what discipline 
many of the replacement workers do not have the airframe and 
power plant licenses required for many assembly tasks he said 
members of other boeing unions which have nostrike clauses in 
their contracts have been reporting to work worldwide boeing 
employs 164000 people including 106000 in western washington 
bret bertolin a specialist with the state office of the 
forecast council said the state agency estimated a monthlong 
strike would mean 160 million in lost payroll and 15 million in 
lost state revenues 
if it drags on other industries would be affected and the 
payroll loss would rise to 240 million in a second month 320 
million in a third and 400 million in a fourth he estimated 
industry analysts said the strikes outcome could set a trend 
for contracts at other aerospace companies 
talks have been extended after a machinists contract expired 
sunday at lockheed corp in marietta ga and the unions contract 
with mcdonnell douglas boeings only us competitor for 
jetliners is up oct 22

the nations civilian unemployment rate edged 
up onetenth of a percentage point to 53 percent in september as 
manufacturing payrolls shrank by more than 100000 jobs the 
government said today 
the unemployment rate was up from 52 percent in both july and 
august the labor department said in the first comprehensive look 
at the economy last month 
the report was weaker than many analysts had expected even 
though payroll declines at factories were offset by gains from 
teachers returning to their classrooms and telephone workers ending 
a strike 
this report is the first in quite a while that suggests the 
economy could be heading for a tailspin said economist allen 
sinai of the boston co the report was quite soft with meager 
employment gains where there were big gains they are explained 
away by special factors 
reacting to the data the stock market rallied in early trading 
brokers took sluggish job growth as a sign that the federal reserve 
board has more leeway to lower interest rates the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials rose 1196 to 278552 in the first 
halfhour of trading 
the federal reserve board has put more than 100000 americans 
out of work since march charged economist richard rahn of the 
us chamber of commerce the september rise in unemployment is 
the direct result of the fedinduced economic slowdown 
the unemployment rate for adult men jumped to 48 percent last 
month from 44 percent in august while the rate for women fell to 
45 percent from 47 percent a month earlier 
the jobless rate is derived from a survey of american 
households a separate survey of employers showed that the economy 
added 209000 nonfarm payroll jobs in september bringing the 
total to a seasonally adjusted 1091 million august job growth was 
only 88000 revised down from a previous estimate of 110000 
september growth was artificially bolstered by the return of 
75000 striking telephone workers in the household survey 
strikers are counted as employed so their return did not affect 
the unemployment rate 
the department said more industries lost than gained jobs in 
september goodsproducing industries representing about 
onefourth of the economy was particularly hard hit losing 
108000 jobs 
most of the loss was to manufacturing payrolls which have been 
declining since the spring and lost 103000 workers in september 
33000 of them in the auto industry thirty of 31 manufacturing 
industries showed declines or were unchanged 
construction payrolls were unchanged last month while mining 
which includes oil drilling lost 5000 jobs 
service industries added 317000 jobs bolstered by the 
returning telephone workers and by a gain of 95000 government 
jobs most of those in local government the likely result of the 
start of a new school year 
economists said the distribution of gains and losses follow the 
pattern set this year in which workers in housing and at factories 
producing bigticket items such as automobiles have suffered most 
from an earlier campaign by the fed to fight inflation with higher 
interest rates 
the central bank began easing rates in june and since then 
statistics have shown a slower but still growing economy in no 
danger of toppling into a recession 
the unemployment rate hit a 15year low of 50 percent in march 
and since then has fluctuated narrowly between 51 percent and 53 
percent 
the most disturbing feature of septembers business survey 
data was the large decline in manufacturing employment 
commissioner of labor statistics janet l norwood said in testimony 
prepared for congress joint economic committee real growth in 
overall factory employment ended last march since then we have 
lost 135000 factory jobs 
nevertheless 1175 million americans held jobs and 66 million 
were looking for work in september essentially unchanged from 
august 
the government said average hourly earnings rose 05 percent to 
973 last month after holding steady in august for the year 
ending in september average hourly earnings increased 38 percent 
well behind the rate of consumer price inflation 
the average manufacturing work week and factory overtime edged 
up 01 hour to 410 and 38 hours respectively offsetting small 
declines in august 
other than the swings in the unemployment rates for adult men 
and women there were no dramatic shift in rates among other 
demographic groups last month although the rate for black 
teenagers rose 
here are the september unemployment rates for the groups listed 
in the labor departments report compared with august 
adult white men 42 percent up from 38 percent in august 
adult white women 38 percent down from 41 percent 
white teenagers 121 percent down from 128 percent 
blacks 116 percent up from 111 percent 
adult black men 100 percent up from 98 percent 
adult black women 96 percent up from 94 percent 
black teenagers 373 percent up from 316 percent 
hispanics 83 percent down from 90 percent 
in a separate calculation that includes military personnel 
stationed in the united states the labor department said the 
unemployment rate was 52 percent up from augusts 51 percent

ask the operator of a small business what he or 
she thinks about a local banker and youre likely to get a very 
direct and intense response 
but it isnt true the response will always be negative 
no mystery there millions of small companies wouldnt exist 
without banks which usually control the wherewithal for starting a 
business one study found 45 percent of all smallbusiness founders 
used money from commercial lenders 
that said those intense feelings often are critical among 
other reasons because of what are perceived to be high rates fees 
collateral requirements that involve personal guarantees and 
cookiecutter bank products 
sampling small business is a frustrating task partly because it 
as a whole is so large and diverse more than 17 million federal 
tax returns in 1985 contained business income and about 99 percent 
of all businesses are considered small 
even that doesnt tell the whole story most small businesses 
are very small with nearly 60 percent of them employing only one 
to four people no less than 90 percent of small businesses have 
fewer than 20 employees 
economists working for the national federation of independent 
business foundation did manage to get a fair sampling of opinion 
however but only after soliciting and examining responses from 
7970 smallbusiness owners 
summarizing them the economists concluded that no business 
relationship seems to draw more strong and divergent opinion from 
smallbusiness men and women than the relationship with bankers 
respondents were very concerned about those interest rates 
they feel the rates charged them are excessive particularly 
compared to the rates charged the best corporate customers 
the nfib economists say the small guys have a point many 
smallbusiness customers after all are the best corporate customers 
in everything but size but when banks think of best the 
economists say they often mean big 
those high rates might also be even higher through the use of 
fees and service charges which appear to be on the increase 
sometimes say the smallbusiness customers they dont even know 
what the fees are for 
thus the authors conclude the capacity of banks to readily 
obfuscate basic fee questions purposefully or not leaves uneasy 
feelings and greatly limit the customers ability to make 
banking comparisons 
healthy earnings the authors say have muted this problem 
temporarily but should inflation return or earnings dissipate 
smallbusiness demands for lower interest rates and schemes to 
obtain them will be enormous 
concern over collateral requirements most of which involved 
assignment of the borrowers home was second only to interest 
rates the high level of concern perplexed the economists because 
personalresource assignment isnt new 
seeking an answer the economists found the greatest concern 
seemed to be in urban areas leading them to surmise that rural 
lenders based decisions on direct local personal knowledge not as 
easily available to city lenders 
the irritation over cookiecutter banking is more understandable 
great diversity within the smallbusiness population implies 
that they also need a diversity of borrowing conditions infinite 
combinations of interest charges fees collateral requirements and 
maturity dates for example 
alas it isnt so the study found that with authority often 
removed from the local branch office the only thing available to 
the local borrower is a sort of a care package from the main 
office with no exceptions tolerated 
the result it concludes is an added area of tension this one 
between the smallbusiness need for individualized borrowing and 
the banks insistence on greater uniformity

ford motor co has received us regulatory 
clearance to buy up to 15 percent of jaguar plc a spokesman for 
fords british unit said friday 
ford received early clearance by the federal trade commission 
which must approve major share acquisitions under the 
hartscottrodino act said the ford uk spokesman who was not 
identified in accordance with british practice 
were pleased because we believe an association between ford 
and jaguar would be beneficial to both companies and we further 
believe that ford because of its commitment to great britain would 
be the most natural partner for jaguar ford spokesman rex 
greenslade in detroit said 
jaguar shares closed 1 higher at 1177 on londons stock 
exchange volume was a heavy 13 million shares 
it was not immediately clear whether ford had purchased any 
jaguar shares friday it previously owned about 1 percent of the 
british luxury auto maker 
ford announced sept 19 that it wanted to buy up to 15 percent 
of jaguar and left open the option of making a full bid for the 
british company 
jaguars rules of association prohibit any shareholder from 
taking more than a 15 percent stake before the end of 1990 and give 
the british government a golden share with which it may block 
any bid for the formerly stateowned company 
jaguar has characterized fords stakebuying as unwelcome and 
says it wants to remain independent 
the company however has indicated it might be interested in 
building ties with a major auto company as a means of acquiring 
greater financial resources jaguar has been losing money

president bush pushed anew today for senate 
approval of his capital gains tax cut saying the tax relief was 
not an extraneous matter with me 
leaving a capitol hill meeting with republican senators bush 
said he told the lawmakers the house had acted decisively in 
approving a capital gains tax cut last week and he wanted them to 
follow suit 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
opposes a proposal to remove the capital gains tax cut from a major 
deficitreduction bill to consider it separately 
we believe capital gains reduction is important its been 
part of the process from the very beginning its already passed 
the house and we believe now is the time to include it in the 
bill he said 
asked if bush would veto the overall measure needed to reduce 
the budget deficit for this year to below 110 billion and thus 
avoid acrosstheboard spending cuts fitzwater said we want the 
capital gains tax cut in there 
fitzwater said bush stands ready to veto the overall measure if 
it contains items that he finds onerous or inappropriate the 
adminstration can live with the automatic spending cuts that 
likely would be triggered later this month by such a veto if we 
have to the spokesman said 
earlier sen bob packwood rore told a reporter he sensed 
the white house wanted a promise from democrats for clear shot at a 
vote on capital gains if they get that promise i think they 
will be happy to strip this bill he said 
sen pete v domenici rnm said republicans wont drop the 
capital gains tax cut from the bill if the only thing democrats are 
willing to do in return is to drop their proposal for a restoration 
of ira deductions 
were not going to do that kind of business domenici said 
upon emerging from the meeting with darman and brady 
sen bob packwood rore said he personally was willing to 
settle for a promise by democrats that the capital gains issue 
would be considered as an amendment to another bill possibly must 
legislation to raise the ceiling on the federal debt 
however packwood who attended the meeting with darman and 
brady added that doesnt reflect the views of the 
administration 
as an amendment on the debt ceiling bill republicans would only 
have to muster 50 votes instead of the 60 that might be needed to 
shut off a possible filibuster delaying its consideration on the 
budget reduction bill 
asked about criticism from some democrats that the 
budgetreconciliation bill is weighted down with the issues not 
related to cutting the deficit bush told reporters that the 
capital gains cut was not an extraneous matter with me 
the president thanked the lawmakers for extraordinary 
cooperation and leadership but added that there are bound to be 
differences between the white house and senate on how to approach 
the taxandspend issues 
capital gains which are profits from the sale of investments 
now are fully taxed at the same rates as other income under the 
housepassed bill the top rate of 33 percent would be cut to 196 
percent until 1992 when it would be raised to 28 percent and 
indexed to avoid taxing gains arising solely from inflation 
republicans have supported bush on the tax cut while most 
democrats have opposed the idea 
bush said that capital gains was not an extraneous matter with 
me and that he wants quick senate action on the proposal 
the president also met with senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine 
after the meeting with mitchell bush walked onto the senate 
floor briefly shaking hands with a few of the lawmakers there he 
left just a few seconds later presidents normally appear only in 
the house chamber for state of the union speeches or other formal 
addesses to joint sessions of congress 
associate senate historian don ritchie said he had no record of 
any previous chief executive casually strolling onto the floor 
bushs appearance on capitol hill came as republican senators 
worked with the administration to devise a capital gains tax cut 
that could win enough democratic support to pass the senate this 
weekend 
packwood already had begun soliciting support for his own 
capital gains plan that proposal which failed in the senate 
finance committee on a 1010 vote earlier this week is expected to 
be the starting point for whatever plan the senate considers 
under packwoods proposal the longer an investment was held 
the less of its profits would be taxed when sold packwood seeks to 
add the plan to a giant deficitreduction bill as a substitute for 
a democratic saving incentive that would expand taxdeductible 
individual retirement accounts 
the house on thursday passed its version of the deficit bill 
that included the capital gains reduction 
a surprise new element into the capital gains issue was 
introduced in the senate on thursday night 
senate leaders expressed hope that the budget bill could be 
stripped of the hundreds of provisions attached to it that have 
nothing to do with reducing the deficit should that come about and 
if the house went along it could prevent approval this year of 
either a capital gains cut or an ira expansion 
mitchell said so much has been tacked onto the budget bill that 
it will be impossible to complete congressional action on it in 
time to prevent automatic acrosstheboard spending cuts from being 
triggered on oct 16 
those cuts are required by the grammrudman balancedbudget law 
when congress cannot agree on revenue increases and spending 
reductions

dutch police are doing brisk 
business with an antidote against a computer virus that is set to 
attack on or after oct 13 on both sides of the atlantic police 
said friday 
the harmful but relatively rare datacrime virus is also called 
the columbus day virus because it attacks the day after the 
traditional date for columbus day 
the virus is apparently more common in the netherlands than in 
the united states american computer security experts have said 
dutch newspapers said earlier this week that the datacrime virus 
has reportedly spread to 10 percent of the netherlands personal 
computers but hague police spokesman rob brons said friday that 
those figures are possibly inflated 
in the united states there have been fewer than a dozen 
confirmed sightings of the dormant virus by experts who dismantled 
it to figure out how it works however other computer owners could 
have it without knowing 
us government officials have no solid idea of how prevalent 
the virus is but believe it is fairly uncommon spokesman stewart 
katzke of the national institute of standards and technology said 
friday 
brons said his force had sold hundreds of 235 floppy disks 
with a program that purportedly detects and destroys the virus 
the virus which some say was created by an unidentified 
austrian computer expert is expected to be activated when an 
infected program is run anytime after oct 12 through dec 31 
according to joe hirst a british expert on viruses 
the virus wipes out the tables on the computers hard disk so 
the data and programs become inaccessible 
theres not much you can do about it the only remedy is to 
find it and get rid of it said hirst in a telephone interview 
from brighton england 
the virus spreads through contaminated floppy disks or through 
contact with other computers in networks or over phone lines a 
virus is a computer program that attaches to other programs and 
makes copies of itself 
hirst said that as far as he knew the netherlands was the only 
european country in which the virus had been spotted

lower friday on the chicago board of trade in anticipation of heavy 
harvesting activity this weekend in the midwest 
wheat futures firmed slightly amid rumors that the soviet union 
is seeking to buy an unknown quantity of us wheat 
forecasts for clear cool weather in most growing areas favor 
farmers who are busy bringing in the new crops 
the market acted about the way you would think with a big 
harvest weekend coming up said victor lespinasse a trader with 
dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
the rumors in the wheat market reflected a general increase in 
export activity similar rumors supported the corn market all week 
and the agriculture department has confirmed more than 25 million 
metric tons of corn sold to the soviets since last weekend 
the estimates now range from 3 million all the way up to 7 
million said grain specialist ted mao of shearson lehman hutton 
inc

the walkout by boeing co production workers 
shows that unions believe strikes remain a potent bargaining tool 
despite a general decline in confrontational labor tactics over the 
past several years 
theres a bit of a popular notion that labor unions are waning 
and that strikes are no longer useful nothing could be farther 
from the truth said gary hubbard communications director for 
the united steelworkers of america 
in a company where you havent had a strike for awhile 
theres nothing to strengthen the union like a good oldfashioned 
donneybrook hubbard said in a telephone interview from 
washington 
an estimated 57800 members of the international association of 
machinists struck boeing despite a contract offer that exceeds or 
equals many recent settlements nationwide 
boeing which has seen five years of record jetliner orders 
offered what it called a reasonable package of raises bonuses and 
costofliving adjustments that was rejected by a 70 percent vote 
william whitlow an aerospace industry analyst with the dain 
bosworth investment firm in seattle said the boeing strike could 
mark a labor turnaround in the industry where unionism has been 
struggling since president reagan crushed an air traffic 
controllers strike eight years ago 
you might even make the argument it could go beyond the 
aerospace industry whitlow said 
i think there is a greater militance within the labor movement 
generally said arnie winemeister president of the western 
council of teamsters 
dan bickford president of the seattle areas king county labor 
council said his aflcioaffiliated organization had gained 23 
unions with 12000 members in the last three years 
i think labor is on the upsurge bickford said id also 
say we have more union activism now than we did three or four years 
ago 
he and others said the strike the first in 12 years against the 
worlds largest commercial airplane builder reflects growing union 
militance that cuts across georgraphic areas and age groups 
i think what we are seeing is a period in which unions are 
emerging from a period of freezes givebacks and concessions 
said robert bonitati an air line pilots association veteran who 
once advised reagan on labor questions 
with an economy that remains resilient after years of 
uninterrupted growth people are coming back and saying hey we 
want our piece of the pie bonitati said i hate to say it 
but this is somewhat a return to normalcy although i dont think 
you will ever see the level of strikes you once saw 
it was the second major walkout by machinists this year 
following a strike that resulted in a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing 
by eastern airlines 
boeing has turned to supervisors to complete work on some jets 
while the assembly lines make do without 43300 union members in 
the seattle area 12000 in wichita kan 1700 in portland ore 
and a few hundred at scattered sites in california hawaii 
montana utah and other states 
larry kenney president of the washington state labor council 
said he generally found more of a willingness among union 
members to take a hard position but was still surprised at the 
strength of the vote 
more than half of those voting had been hired since the last 
walkout by boeing machinists a 45day strike in 1977 in wichita 
union officials estimated the figure ran to 95 percent 
of course many of them recent hires come from good union 
families said tom baker president of machinists district lodge 
751 in seattle 
victor kamber head of the kamber group a public affairs 
consultant for 30 unions in washington attributed a resurgence in 
strike sentiment to what he called a greater militancy among the 
younger workers 
kamber whose clients do not include the machinists said that 
although the number of strikes affected workers and lost hours 
continued to decline we have had a more visible year with 
major walkouts against pittston coal eastern airlines and several 
telephone companies 
striking is still a valid tactic even if it is no longer 
labors primary weapon he said 
strikes are only going to take place and be successful where 
you can really shut down the company kamber said 
it runs counter to the direction of the overall labor movement 
these days but i have tremendous respect for the ability of the 
machinists union to choose the right time and place to use that 
weapon he said 
bonitati a kamber vice president said he expected strikes to 
continue to decline 
i think you see labor leaders looking at it with a great deal 
of caution bonitati said i think they will pick more 
carefully if they have control and attempt to use strikes in 
a very symbolic way and for very strategic purposes 
hubbard said the steelworkers negotiated contracts for more than 
125000 workers this year without any major strikes as the metals 
industry recovers from a severe slump earlier in the decade at 
steelmakers alone the unions bargaining jurisdiction fell from 
400000 jobs in 1980 to 180000 today 
the healthier the industry the easier it is to resolve 
contract disputes hubbard said 
noting the record airplane sales profits and backlog of orders 
at boeing he said its tragic that a strike would have to occur 
in such a welloff industry 
bonitati said most recent major strikes had been unsuccessful 
the coal strike is inflicting serious serious damage on that 
union the united mine workers bonitati said from all 
indications its going to last for a long long time its going 
to be a constant drain upon that unions treasury

an investment group that bid 19 
billion for american medical international inc in july said it has 
lowered its offer for the hospital management company by 230 
million 
the new 167 billion cash offer by ima acquisition corp 
announced thursday represents the investment groups concern over 
a tax bill that would make the acquisition more costly according 
to an analyst 
ami based in beverly hills was reviewing the offer early 
friday and could not say when it would comment on the lower bid 
the offer was given to a special committee of the board of 
directors and they have not responded said suzanne hovdey 
spokeswoman for ami 
the investment group financed by chicagos pritzker family and 
first boston corp said it would not be able to arrange financing 
for the offer before it expired oct 11 and therefore could not 
pay the original 28 per share the new ima offer would pay 
shareholders 2650 per share 
the group initially planned to finance about 250 million of the 
offer with paymentinkind bonds but the proposed tax change would 
take away the tax deduction for the interest payments on those 
bonds the group has applied for an exemption to the new tax bill 
submitted after imas july 7 offer 
the bill has passed the house and has not been acted on by the 
senate 
by submitting the lower bid the group has given ami executives 
a new opportunity to put the hospital chain on the auction block 
according to kenneth abramowitz an analyst at sanford c bernstein 
amp co in new york 
if no one offers more money it the amended bid is a fair 
offer he said 
abramowitz said the partnership is citing uncertainty about the 
new tax law to gain leverage with ami they used the irs issue as 
an excuse he said they reduced the price because they thought 
they could get away with it 
another analyst seth shaw of prudential bache securities in new 
york predicted ami would accept the new bid 
i still think its a good offer for shareholders he said 
anything over 18 is good 
first boston was to have financed part of the deal with about 
700 million in junk bond sales and several analysts pointed out 
that ima would have to pay millions of dollars more in interest to 
attract bond buyers now that the junk bond market has softened 
the conditions in the junk bond market have changed 
dramatically since the original agreement said john hindelong 
an analyst at donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp in new 
york 
the change is reflected in this offer i think ami 
shareholders given the changes in the junk bond market will be 
pleased with the offer

us currency despite ongoing efforts by central banks to squelch 
demand 
gold finished higher in new york after falling in europe and 
asia republic national bank of new york said gold was bid late in 
the day at 36325 an ounce up from 36310 late thursday 
dollar traders mostly ignored efforts by central banks from the 
united states west germany and japan to push the currency lower 
raising more questions about the group of seven industrial nations

harriman amp co unless the central banks show a sign of getting 
their act together we will see a stronger dollar

department report suggested the economy is softer than expected 
but quickly resumed its climb 
the government reported that the nations civilian unemployment

august and that the economy added 209000 nonfarm payroll jobs in 
september fewer than expected analysts said the markets had 
expected a sharper gain of up to 300000 nonfarm payroll jobs 
a softer economy could prompt the fed to lower interest rates to 
avoid a serious slowdown making the dollar less appealing to 
foreign investors however without evidence that the fed was 
moving to ease monetary policy the dollar resumed its upward climb 
the shortterm employment numbers were overridden by 
longerterm bullishness on the dollar said david johnson 
currency broker at first national bank of chicago 
analysts said the fed probably would wait for more confirmation 
to see if indeed the economy is slowing down before altering its 
credit policy 
theyre not going to ease rates because of a single set of 
employment numbers johnson said

since the summer of 1975 
the selloff coincided with the close of the international 
coffee organizations twoweek semiannual meeting in london a 
session that produced only a vague resolution interpreted by 
analysts as an attempt to keep the bottom from falling out of the 
world coffee market

the future when conditions are right said bert ruiz a vice 
president with balfour maclaine corp the big news from the 
meeting was no news

months

by 38 percent since early july when ico producers led by brazil 
balked at demands by the consumers led by the united states for 
increased availability of topquality coffees and a halt to sales 
of coffee at discount prices to nonmembers the disagreement led to 
a suspension of the export quotas that had supported coffee prices 
few observers expected the differences to be ironed out at the 
london meeting but pessimism about the organizations future 
multiplied following statements made tuesday by jorio dauster 
president of the brazilian coffee institute that he saw no chance 
for a return to international price supports for at least six 
months

having written the book on the art of the deal 
in real estate casinos and the airline business donald trump is a 
good bet to secure the financing he needs to pull off his 7 
billion offer for american airlines parent amr corp experts 
believe 
his chances for success were viewed positively friday despite 
recent turmoil in the credit markets 
hes borrowed in the past and paid back and hes viewed as a 
good customer said lawrence cohn a banking analyst at 
investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc 
trump who promised to put up a staggering 1 billion of his own 
money for the deal seems to have a winning combination a string 
of bluechip real estate and casino properties he could borrow 
against and the highly regarded amr itself whose assets could be 
considered as collateral 
dallasbased amr includes american the nations largest 
airline sabre the leading computer reservations system valued at 
around 15 billion and a modernized jet fleet more than half of 
which is owned by the carrier rather than leased 
trumps relations with bankers have been warm and he appears 
capable of surmounting a less than hospitable investment climate 
anxiety in washington and some skepticism about his intentions 
i think it will be difficult seven billion dollars is a lot 
even for donald trump said marilyn cohen president of capital 
insight inc an investment firm in beverly hills calif thats 
not to say the man cant pull it off 
big corporate borrowing is a lot more difficult these days in 
the wake of recent trouble in the junkbond market ms cohen 
noted 
prices of the highrisk highyield bonds plunged in 
midseptember after campeau corp a major retailer and junkbond 
issuer said it would have trouble paying its bills the campeau 
crisis mushroomed throughout the junkbond market and spilled over 
into bank lending since many of the big banks also finance 
mergers and acquisitions including some junkbond deals 
nevertheless really good deals do continue to get done 
said drexels cohn if its a solid deal then the banks are 
going to lend on it 
mark daugherty an airline analyst at dean witter reynolds inc 
said it would take at least 3 billion of equity for trumps offer 
to be a healthy one thats assuming trump would assume amrs 15 
billion in debt putting the real value of the deal at around 85 
billion and figuring a desirable ratio of twothirds debt to 
onethird equity 
but louis marckesano who follows the industry for the 
philadelphia brokerage of janney montgomery scott inc said 1 
billion in equity was sufficient for the deal to fly 
in addition to the dampened borrowing climate trump faces 
observers also note the rumbling drumbeat of anxiety coming from 
the bush administration and congress about high levels of debt 
being created by the wave of takeovers and proposed buyouts in the 
airline industry 
transportation secretary samuel skinner has recently expressed 
concern about the debt piled up by big airline buyouts and the 
participation of foreign carriers in the deals his department has 
intervened in two airline deals the 365 billion takeover of nwa 
inc northwest airlines parent and the proposed 675 billion 
buyout of united airlines owner ual corp 
congress also has grabbed on to the issue scheduling committee 
hearings and studying legislation on airline takeovers 
trumps offer for amr is another instance of quickprofit 
speculation in the airline industry that is endangering the 
nations air transportation system said rep byron l dorgan 
dnd none of this makes any economic sense he said in a 
telephone interview from washington 
some analysts question trumps sincerity in the bid in light of 
his track record of making takeover runs at companies and then 
turning a quick profit by selling his stock 
but others jump to his defense i think he is extremely 
serious about this and its a mistake to think otherwise said 
helane becker an airline analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc

bond prices soared friday on expectations the 
federal reserve might soon lower interest rates following a 
government report showing a sharp decline in manufacturing jobs in 
september 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond was up 2132 point or 
about 656 for every 1000 in face value its yield which falls 
when prices rise dropped to 801 percent from 807 percent late 
thursday 
the labor department reported friday that the nations civilian 
unemployment rate rose a notch to 53 percent in september from 52 
percent in july and august 
a separate survey of employers showed that the economy added 
209000 nonfarm payroll jobs in september despite an artificial 
increase reflecting the return of some 75000 striking telephone 
workers analysts said the markets had expected a sharper gain of 
up to 300000 nonfarm payroll jobs 
more important economists said was a loss of 103000 
manufacturing jobs including 33000 at auto plants payrolls 
either declined or were flat within all manufacturing industries 
except food processing 
thats going to get peoples attention and raise some concerns 
since its not just a special factor such as autos said jean 
buckley money market economist at bankamerica capital markets 
group in san francisco 
the concern will be that the manufacturing sector is much 
weaker than people have been expecting she said 
buckley said analysts are estimating that industrial production 
will be 04 percent lower and capacity utilization 06 percent 
lower following the employment report 
a weakening economy is bullish for fixedincome instruments such 
as bonds because longterm investments more attractive during an 
economic slowdown 
the jobs report could encourage the federal reserve to ease 
interests rates in the near term to reinvigorate the economy but 
on friday the central banks action in draining some bank reserves 
was perceived as a signal that fed policy had not changed 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm

if the machinists union strike against boeing co 
drags out one consequence could be a deeper us trade deficit 
analysts say 
boeing which has 65 percent of the free worlds commercial 
jetliner market is the nations thirdlargest exporter if the 
machinists strike that began wednesday morning slows aircraft 
deliveries the delayed sales would start showing up in trade 
figures 
they do something like a billion dollars a month in exports 
said gene kingsbury an aerospace analyst at the us department of 
commerce a slowdown in shipments is going to affect it trade 
directly 
of the 12 billion worth of aircraft boeing delivered in the 
first nine months of this year 84 billion in planes went 
overseas said tom cole a boeing commercial airplanes spokesman 
if those planes had not been shipped the us merchandise trade 
deficit for the same period would have been close to 92 billion 
instead of the 80 billion economists are forecasting 
boeing has about 40 planes that are close to delivery among 
them are 747400 jumbo jets for malaysia airlines singapore 
airlines and british airways 
analysts say boeing should be able to make up a two or 
threeweek gap in production even if the strike drags on for 
several months the effects of a slowdown in deliveries probably 
would not be felt until early next year because december normally 
is a slow month said analyst wolfgang demisch at ubs securities in 
new york 
the damage of the strike will grow exponentially as it 
continues demisch said the longer workers are away the longer 
it will take for the production line to return to normal 
about 53 percent of boeings orders come from overseas but the 
value of those orders is far higher because it includes a number of 
longrange 747400s boeings largest aircraft which sell for 
about 125 million each 
future deliveries are expected to continue to be weighted in 
favor of overseas sales since the size of the foreign jet fleet at 
about 8600 planes has overtaken the size of the us fleet which 
has about 3900

production continued slowly at boeing co plants 
friday as a strike by 57800 machinists stretched into its third 
day without the company or union scheduling new talks to end the 
walkout 
separately boeing announced it had gained another 
multibilliondollar aircraft order from evergreen airways corp of 
taiwan further adding to the companys huge backlog of airliner 
orders 
federal mediator douglas hammond said no new talks had been 
scheduled 
union officials have said they would resume talks whenever 
boeing indicated it was ready although boeing spokesman harold 
carr said the machinists had made no specific offer and had not set 
a date for when they would be willing to return to negotiations 
the union went on strike wednesday after its threeyear contract 
with boeing expired and the parties were unable to reach agreement 
on a new pact 
boeing is offering costofliving raises bonuses a reduction in 
mandatory overtime and other improvements 
the machinists who represent the bulk of boeing production 
workers want a larger than offered share of boeings financial 
prosperity and a bigger reduction in hours of mandatory overtime at 
the company which is pressing hard to increase aircraft production 
because of record aircraft orders 
work was still far from normal friday at many boeing plants a 
company spokesman said and members of another boeing union said 
they were getting some harassment from striking machinists 
strikers include 43300 in the seattle area 12000 in wichita 
kan 1700 in portland ore and others at several locations 
nationwide 
all boeing plants are open though boeing commercial airplanes 
spokesman jack gamble said things were going very slowly at 
aircraft production plants where supervisors were manning 
production lines 
a malaysian airlines 747400 should be delivered this week 
gamble said but he was not aware of any other planes that had been 
scheduled for delivery in the past few days the malaysian plane 
has been awaiting only final faa certification for delivery he 
said 
boeing has 93 planes scheduled for delivery between now and the 
end of the year and gamble said about 40 of those were near 
completion 
before the strike boeing was producing about 30 planes a month 
and was running near capacity 
boeing the worlds largest commercial jet builder with 65 
percent of the free worlds market is in its fifth consecutive 
year of record jetliner orders 
evergreen airways ordered 26 jets from boeing and mcdonnell 
douglas corp boeings share includes firm orders for four 747400s 
and two extendedrange 767300ers plus options for four 747400s 
and two 767300ers boeing spokesman craig martin said the total 
boeing order including options eventually would be worth 193 
billion 
charles bofferding president of the seattle professional 
engineering employees association the secondlargest union at 
boeing after the machinists sent his 27000 members letters saying 
that some speea members are meeting with resistance and mild 
harassment when going to work 
bofferding urged his members to wear union identification and to 
decline to do machinists work 
on thursday night a picket outside boeings everett plant that 
builds widebody 747 and 767 jetliners received a broken arm when 
struck by a pickup truck at the plants west gate according to 
everett police spokesman ken murray a friend of the injured man 
then struck the driver with his fist and was arrested for 
investigation of assault murray said 
the driver of the truck was not cited murray said witnesses 
said he attempted to stop and couldnt swerve because of other 
pickets in the street

the head of american airlines 
secondlargest union met with advisers friday to discuss possible 
ways to help management fend off developer donald trumps 7 
billion buyout proposal 
michael kelleher president of the 16000member association of 
professional flight attendants was notified of the offer by 
management early thursday he traveled to new york friday to meet 
with legal and labor advisers to prepare contingency plans in 
light of any events that may transpire said alan fahringer a 
spokesman for the independent union 
also friday sen lloyd bentsen dtexas exchanged letters with 
trump expressing concern over the wave of airline takeovers 
bentsen is a member of the senate committee on commerce science 
and transportation which thursday recommended legislation that 
would require federal approval of takeovers 
in a letter to bentsen trump said he was sensitive to the 
concerns especially regarding excessive leverage as evidenced 
by my stated intention to commit at least 1 billion of equity to 
an acquisition of the company 
airlines must be financially fit enough to meet rigorous 
safety standards replace aging aircraft contribute their fair 
share to improve airport facilities as well as maintain an 
adequate and welltrained labor force replied bentsen who is 
working on having legislation retroactive to cover trumps proposal 
other local and national politicians also began lining up 
against trump criticizing the real estate tycoons lack of 
experience in running an airline plus the amount of debt expected 
to be included in the deal 
trump who is based in new york bought eastern airlines 
lucrative northeast shuttle service for 365 million in early june 
trumps offer of 120 for each of the 589 million outstanding 
shares of americans parent amr corp was revealed thursday by the 
airline 
amr remained silent on trumps offer friday declining all 
comment on thursday the company said the offer would be 
considered in due course but refused to say when the board of 
directors would meet trump officials said no meeting between the 
two sides had been scheduled 
trading in amr stock slacked off friday on the new york stock 
exchange as 34 million shares changed hands the stock closed at 
10337 a share up 350 on thursday more than 83 million 
shares were traded as the stock opened at 10650 a share but fell 
back to close at 9987 
analysts have suggested one possible defense against trump would 
be a competing offer from a managementemployee group similar to 
the 675 billion offer currently pending for united airlines 
parent ual corp to block investor marvin davis 
fahringer said it is too early to say if the flight attendants 
would participate in such a deal everybodys talking and 
everybodys trying to keep their options open he said 
officials of the other unions at american were unavailable to 
discuss the matter the airline is widely considered to have good 
labor relations 
employees at americans biggest hub at dallasfort worth 
international airport were cheering for management to win the 
battle 
bobby crandalls got everybody in the company behind him 
said sollie pearson referring to amr chairman robert l crandall 
theres a big difference between american and trumps little 
shuttle said bryan atkins a member of a ground support crew 
in his letter trump told crandall that through the eastern 
shuttle purchase he gained substantial insight into the 
competitive airline business 
i think thats a silly statement said tom luce a candidate 
for the republican gubernatorial nomination in texas and former 
attorney for billionaire h ross perot i dont think they need 
the advice of donald trump and i think american is crucial to the 
economy not only of the region of the state and i think and hope 
that they will remain an independent company 
in washington rep byron dorgan dnd called trumps 
proposal another instance of quickprofit speculation in the 
airline industry that is endangering the nations air 
transportation system 
dorgan a member of the house ways and means committee has 
introduced legislation to disallow interest deductions on debt used 
for hostile acquisition of an airline 
loading the halfdozen healthy airline companies up with debt 
is placing them in serious jeopardy when we suffer another economic 
downturn dorgan said

usx corp edged higher friday in active 
trading as the disclosure that investor carl icahn has increased 
his stake in the company revived speculation that usx may be headed 
for a takeover or a restructuring including the possible sale of 
its steel interests 
usx was the most actively traded issue on the new york stock 
exchange friday closing up 12 cents at 3850 after more than 48 
million shares changed hands 
late thursday icahn disclosed that he had raised his stake in 
usx to 1306 percent from 1141 percent confirming recent rumors 
that he was intensifying pressure on the company 
icahns sale of a record 42million share block of texaco inc 
stock for 2 billion last june led to reports he again was eyeing 
usx 
the investor made a 719 billion or 31ashare bid offer for 
usx in early 1987 but dropped the bid after the usx board rejected 
it when he made his bid there were charges he only wanted to 
drive up the stock price and profit from it but he did not sell 
his shares when he abandoned the offer 
in a filing thursday with the securities and exchange 
commission icahn who owns trans world airlines inc said a group 
he leads wants to explore a meaningful restructuring that would 
substantially enhance shareholder value 
icahns purchase of 155 million worth of shares in the steel 
and energy company this week has raised his stake in usx to 1306 
percent or 336 million shares from 1141 percent 
he obviously wants to force the company into doing something 
but whether he just wants to move the price of the stock we 
dont know thats the 64 question said greg drahuschak an 
analyst for butcher amp singer of pittsburgh whatever it is its 
a little more than saber rattling 
icahn and usx declined to comment on his latest move in his sec 
filing icahn said usxs market price doesnt reflect the value of 
its assets and businesses and he is studying a buyout financed by 
a business combination 
there are some interesting phrases in the filing is he 
making political statements or are they fair warning of things to 
come drahuschak said its very improbable that icahn alone 
would be willing to move on usx but the business combination 
is that a political game or a statement of reality 
usx stock surged early this week on speculation icahn was 
increasing his stake and usxs announcement it would sell its 
shares of texas oil amp gas valued by analysts at 15 billion 
rather than make a renewed bid for a fullscale takover icahn 
could be prodding usxs new chairman charles a corry to speed up 
a restructuring or to sell major assets analysts said icahn has 
long advocated a spinoff of usxs steel division formerly known as 
united states steel 
some analysts including andy gray of donaldson lufkin and 
jenrette securities corp of new york say usx stock is undervalued 
and might be worth 60 a share if assets are sold 
others consider it fully valued at 35 to 40 a share citing 
debt liabilities estimated at nearly 6 billion and a softening 
steel market 
he could be acquiring just enough to speed up the 
restructuring gray said the bottom line scenario is he was 
getting impatient usx hasnt had a major restructuring 
involving billions of dollars in assets in quite a few years 
corry said proceeds from the texas oil amp gas sale would be used 
to decrease usxs debt and buy back shares thus increasing 
shareholder value gray speculates usx may use the 15 
billionplus revenues to buy back icahns shares icahn has said he 
is not seeking a better deal than other shareholders 
no matter what icahns ultimate objective is his latest move 
likely will accelerate action by usx drahuschak said 
corry reportedly was in new york on friday possibly to meet 
with icahn steel industry sources said 
usx has been one of the weakestperforming dow jones stocks 
for years and its institutional holders have not been 
compensated drahuschak said 
theyre at the point in time where they want their due 
theyve been patient enough he said

the advertising executives who caused an 
industry uproar 19 months ago when they defected from the lord 
geller federico einstein agency to set up their own shop agreed 
friday to settle a legal dispute arising from the walkout by paying 
their former employer 7 million 
the agreement brings to an abrupt and inconclusive end a series 
of legal claims and counterclaims including accusations of 
business sabotage that had been closely watched by leaders in the 
advertising business 
the settlement does not suggest admission of wrongdoing by any 
of the parties and is intended to avoid the expense and distraction 
that would accompany continued litigation the four firms 
involved in the case said in a brief statement announcing the 
settlement 
those involved in the settlement are lord geller and its owner 
wpp group plc of london the new agency lord einstein oneill amp 
partners and its 49 percent partner the ad agency young amp rubicam 
under terms of the settlement lord einstein oneill amp partners 
will pay 7 million to wpp group the announcement said 
the disclosure of the settlement came late friday afternoon and 
efforts to reach officials of the various firms were unavailing 
six top lord geller executives including agency founders 
richard lord and arthur w einstein jr walked off the job 
unexpectedly on march 18 1988 and promptly announced the creation 
of the new agency lord einstein oneill amp partners young amp 
rubicam a privatelyheld agency was their partner 
the defectors had been chafing under the management of wpp 
group which acquired lord geller only eight months earlier as part 
of its 566 million buyout of the advertising holding company jwt 
group in july 1987 
after the walkout wpp filed suit against the defectors and 
their new agency accusing them of trying to steal clients and 
employees from their old agency a new york state court judge 
issued an order prohibiting such activity 
but lord geller lost a huge amount of business as its billings 
shrank to 50 million from a prebreakaway level of 212 million 
it lost several important clients the biggest of which was the 
computer giant international business machines corp lord geller 
had established a reputation as a creative powerhouse largely 
because its work for ibm including the campaign that used a 
charlie chaplinlike character using ibm office equipment to bring 
order to a chaotic business environmnet 
as of last march lord geller executives insisted they had 
stabilized the agency which employed about 100 people down from 
320 before the breakup 
lord einstein on the other hand had grown from nothing to an 
agency with about 75 million in billings and 82 employees after 
the first year

federal futures regulators have decided not to 
recommend to congress a proposal that would have allowed them to 
make crooked brokers and traders pay restitution to the customers 
they cheated 
the commodity futures trading commission rejected a proposal 
32 friday to recommend the plan to the senate for inclusion in 
the cftcs reauthorization bill 
chairwoman wendy gramm and commissioners kalo hineman and robert 
davis voted against the proposal noting that there already were 
avenues for victims to seek restitution on their own 
commissioners fowler c west and william albrecht voted for the 
measure 
the proposal would have given administrative law judges who 
preside at cftc disciplinary actions the option of including 
restitution of customer losses as a sanction against lawbreakers 
currently administrative law judges can issue cease and desist 
orders prohibit trading suspend or revoke registration or impose 
fines up to 100000 per violation 
but west who proposed the restitution plan noted that none of 
those actions can bring about reimbursement of losses sustained 
by defrauded customers 
the proposal also would have directed the cftc to take customer 
losses into account when setting civil penalties 
west conceded that often violators are put out of business and 
there is no money left for anybody 
the new sanctioning weapon i propose today should not be 
viewed as sure help to defrauded customers no matter how much 
they need help he said however in some cases in which there 
are funds in the hands of wrongdoers such a change in the law 
might assist customers to recoup at least something

the five commodities futures exchanges in new 
york are considering moving to new jersey from lower manhattan a 
relocation that could affect up to 20000 jobs exchange officials 
say 
a decision is expected by the end of the year and groundbreaking 
could begin next year with occupancy expected in 1994 a spokesman 
for the five exchanges said friday 
the five exchanges in new york are the new york mercantile 
exchange the commodity exchange the coffee sugar and cocoa 
exchange the cotton exchange and the new york futures exchange 
between 4000 and 5000 people work at the exchanges but a 
relocation could affect up to 20000 people overall affiliated with 
the new york futures markets 
they trade a variety of contracts on the future prices of 
commodities from oil to orange juice a futures contract is an 
agreement to buy or sell a a fixed amount of a commodity or 
instrument at a set price on a future date 
the exchanges now share a 24000squarefoot trading floor in 
the world trade center in lower manhattan and have offices on 
several floors but officials say the space and technological 
capabilities are inadequate 
in 1985 the five exchanges announced plans to build a new 
facility over the brooklyn battery tunnel in lower manhattan but 
the plan was scrapped two years later officials began considering 
a new site again this year because of crowding 
the spokesman for the five exchanges who asked not to be named 
said three sites are under final consideration two in lower 
manhattan and one in new jersey but he declined to specify the 
locations a new building would be constructed on a site between 
55000 square feet and 60000 square feet 
the plans were disclosed friday at a joint news conference by 
new york mercantile exchange chairman z lou guttman and new nymex 
president patrick thompson 
the spokesman said the exchanges are working with new york city 
officials in developing financial design and other plans and the 
city officials are seeking to keep the industry in manhattan 
earlier this year merrill lynch amp co announced it was moving 
2600 backoffice jobs from manhattan to a 43story office tower in 
jersey city nj after rejecting offers from new york to remain 
the new york exchanges last year accounted for about 23 percent 
of all futures contracts traded dwarfed by the market shares of 
chicagos board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange the 
worlds largest futures markets
