iran has broken a network of spies who provided 
the central intelligence agency with intimate details and documents 
about iranian military planning the new york times said in 
tuesdays editions 
citing unnamed us officials the times said the iranians had 
detected the network months before it actually collapsed and had 
used the spies to give the cia false information 
but some officials told the times that before the network was 
compromised it yielded valuable military intelligence 
particularly about the iranian navys operations in the persian 
gulf at a time when american naval forces were confronting the 
iranians 
the network did not supply intelligence on hostage cases or 
political developments 
the times sources confirmed for the first time iranian claims 
that spies had been arrested 
the sources said the iranian military many of whose members 
were trained in the united states was considered one of the less 
difficult groups in the country from which to recruit agents the 
cia had more difficulty recruiting agents from among proiranian 
militants or officials in the iranian government who deal with 
lebanon 
all of those in the dismantled intelligence ring were believed 
to be iranians the times said 
it was not known how iran uncovered the operation or how long 
iran used it to feed false information to the united states 
cia spokesman bill devine in washington when informed of the 
times report said we do not comment on allegations of 
intelligence activity 
iran first disclosed the existence of the cia operation on april 
21 when hashemi rafsanjani who was then speaker of the iranian 
parliament told a friday prayer meeting in teheran about several 
dens of espionage 
over the next few months iranian television broadcast a 
succession of programs in which purported spies confessed to their 
roles 
us officials told the times that the broadcasts which 
described everything from secret writing techniques to the cia 
recruitment of agents through greed entrapment and blackmail 
were a mixture of fact and fiction 
several officials told the times that most of those identified 
were double agents controlled by iran

deflated at 3000 feet as thousands of spectators watched should 
have noticed rips in the balloons fabric during inflation said 
armond edwards an investigator for the national transportation 
safety board 
if the pilot had looked closely at the balloon he would have 
noticed the separations i showed you edwards said at news 
conference where the balloon was displayed 
edwards said he also was unable to locate a large thermometer 
required for the balloon by federal law the device warns pilots 
about overheating 
the balloon was 12 years old although registration records

investigated that involved the fabric accidents involving power 
lines are the most common he said

troy thein gets some funny looks from 
motorists when he rides his bike to work 
it could be his unusual posture leaning back with his feet 
pedaling in the air or the fact that he keeps up with traffic 
going 50 mph 
people right here in town still look at me funny they say 
whats that where did you get that said thein the other 
day i was coming down the river road hill and was going 52 miles 
per hour 
thein is one of three workers at kann manufacturing the 
guttenberg company that makes the linear brand of recumbent 
bicycles the company also makes aluminum semitrailers commercial 
work boats and grainhauling bodies for trucks 
instead of the standard bicycle seat the recumbent bicycle has 
a cushioned chair that supports a riders back making it easier to 
generate pedal power the upright position of a rider also puts 
less pressure on the diaphragm for easier breathing and the 
position allows for an unrestricted view without neck cramping 
the linear bike has an aluminum frame and undertheseat 
steering so that a riders arms hang down in their natural 
position its 18 gears are shifted by a flick of the thumb 
the linear designed by company president dirk kann is the only 
recumbent on the market that can be folded that enables the 7foot 
bike to fit in a car trunk hansel said 
you have to get used to it but once you do its extremely 
comfortable its much more efficient than the traditional 10speed 
or 12speed said steve hansel director of production and 
marketing at kann 
recumbent bicycles have been around since the 1920s hansel 
said and kann has been making them for five years the company 
hopes within two years to be making 1200 recumbents annually 
hansel said the linear which retails for about 850 is faster 
than conventional bicycles 
a recumbent would just walk away with it in a race he said 
the world record speed for bicycles 65 mph was set in the 
mid1960s by an aerodynamic recumbent 
however john kukoda a senior editor who roadtests bicycles 
for bicycling magazine said the recumbent has its disadvantages 
i think theyre inferior going up hills because theres no way 
to stand up youre not able to use the biggest muscles in the 
body the rearend and lower back i found it takes a lot more 
power and energy to climb hills kukoda said in a telephone 
interview from the monthlys headquarters in emmaus pa 
james finney of iowa city disagrees finney and a companion 
melanie pot plan on aug 2 to embark on a 44000mile journey 
around the world riding linear recumbents 
when im going up a hill i find im breathing easier and am 
not as tired when i get to the top than if i were hunched over a 
traditional bike im able to recover a lot faster finney said

of one foot and the toes on the other foot 
she was critically ill when she was taken to childrens hospital 
in washington on may 11 she was in fair condition monday a 
hospital spokeswoman said 
antibiotics used to treat the bacteria had caused blood clots 
which reduced the flow of blood to her legs resulting in the 
rotting of the skin on her lower legs said the girls father 
thomas dillingham 
her left foot and ankle and her toes on the right foot had to be 
amputated then doctors pondered how to clean the remaining skin 
antibiotics did not work fast enough 
so on july 21 more than 1500 fly larvae were scooped onto her 
legs with tongue depressors and secured with tape 
maggots eat only dead flesh leaving healthy skin intact said 
dr alan fields 
after 36 hours doctors used a highpressure hose to wash them 
from her legs 
the skin grafts are taking and she will soon be fitted with 
prostheses and learn to walk again her family said

the bush administration is poised to begin 
pumping money into the nations failed savings and loan 
institutions as soon as possible after the president signs the bill 
on wednesday 
president bush intends to enact the historic legislation in a 
white house ceremony on wednesday said administration and 
congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity the 
treasury department said it will borrow the first 5 billion 
installment of the bailout on thursday 
the legislation passed by congress on saturday authorizes 50 
billion in borrowing over the next 26 months to close or merge 500 
insolvent sampls of that 20 billion must be borrowed in the next 
eight weeks before the end of the 1989 fiscal year 
treasury officials said 15 billion of this years borrowing 
will be used to replace highrate certificates of deposit at some 
of the 262 failed thrifts already under government control the 
goal is to reduce operating losses until regulators can rescue the 
thrifts permanently 
the effect may be quite significant said richard 
breeden bushs chief adviser on savings and loans youre taking 
some of the institutions that have been rate leaders out of the 
marketplace that will reduce pressure on all other institutions 
both banks and thrifts that have had to pay a premium to compete 
against these unhealthy firms 
the remaining 5 billion raised this year will be used to either 
shut down or attract new owners to the thrifts in the worst 
financial trouble the first of these deals could be announced as 
soon as this week 
i think the process will begin very quickly said spokesman 
alan whitney of the federal deposit insurance corp which is 
getting the job of managing the bailout 
however he said the frequency of rescues will be more 
measured than the frantic pace struck at the end of last year 
when the federal home loan bank board committed 16 billion in a 
twoday spending spree to rescue 75 institutions 
the legislation in addition to funding the bailout imposes 
tough new financial standards on savings and loans and triggers the 
most sweeping overall changes in the regulatory bureaucracy in 50 
years 
among many changes the resolution trust corp a new agency 
headed by treasury secretary nicholas f brady will be created to 
oversee the fdics management of the bailout 
whitney said an organizational meeting of the rtc board is 
planned on the same day as the white house signing ceremony and 
that the board will appoint an executive director officials said 
the board likely will choose someone already within the government 
as a temporary director until a permanent appointment is made 
the administration originally planned to borrow only 10 billion 
in fiscal year 1989 which ends sept 30 however as part of a 
deal struck with congress just before final passage of the 
legislation it agreed to raise 20 billion this year 
that will balloon the 1989 deficit to near 170 billion the 
highest in three years 
the government will raise another 30 billion for rescues in 
1990 and 1991 but as part of the compromise the administration 
will borrow that money through a new quasiprivate agency and the 
spending will not be counted in the deficit 
the treasury department said it will borrow the first 5 billion 
on thursday by auctioning 247day cash management bills which the 
government must be repay on april 19 
in a related development the fdic said it is taking over nine 
insolvent sampls in louisiana bring the total under government 
control to 262 in 33 states 
meanwhile one of the first institutions taken over by 
regulators this year cartersville federal savings bank of georgia 
was sold to the prudential insurance co of america prudential is 
investing 20 million for 569 million in assets no government 
assistance is involved

agriculture secretary clayton k yeutter is 
stepping up his call for a global agreement to end export subsidies 
for farm goods as the end of the current round of international 
trade talks looms 
the economic case for reform can hardly be more compelling 
yeutter told the us feed grains council on monday the 
resistance is political 
us negotiators have been pushing the european community in the 
current uruguay round of trade talks to set a deadline for ending 
all practices that distort agricultural markets thus far the 
europeans have declined 
the negotiations aimed at updating the 97nation general 
agreement on tariffs and trade have 18 months to run 
the ec view seemingly is that such distortions should continue 
forever a most discouraging outlook indeed for the developing 
countries and for european consumers yeutter said 
yeutter us trade representative before taking over at the 
agriculture department this year is a longstanding critic of 
export subsidies his remarks in chicago contained a new barrage of 
choice rhetoric on the issue 
he described the current system of subsidies under which 
governments pay farmers and exporters to slash prices and thus 
stimulate overseas sales as a game of fools monopoly and said 
the place to put an end to this madness is the uruguay round of 
multilateral trade negotiations 
yeutter also acknowledged in effect that the united states is 
often an active player in the subsidy game our european 
colleagues have said repeatedly that there are no angels in 
agriculture trade he said the question is how do we get 
closer to heaven 
he took aim at two lingering criticisms of the american position 
in the talks there are some who say that the us proposal is 
unrealistic that governments cannot and should not get completely 
out of agriculture he said but that is not the us 
proposal 
yeutter reiterated that the united states has no complaint about 
financial supports for agriculture as long as they avoid distortion 
of global markets we have called only for the elimination of 
tradedistorting measures over a period of time sufficient to allow 
farmers to adapt to the new environment 
he also scoffed at the complaint that the negotiators have never 
agreed on a definition of which practices are trade distorting 
we have 18 months the final stage of the uruguay round to 
decide that he said 
yeutter however left no doubt as to his view perhaps the 
most vivid example is grain he said ten years ago the ec had 
net imports of nearly 20 million tons now the ec has net annual 
exports of about 30 million tons their stated goal was self 
sufficiency but that goal was reached long ago 
the community now uses billions of european currency units to 
unload its surplus production on the world market undercutting 
lower cost competitors 
in contrast the us most unwisely has unilaterally disarmed 
itself by taking vast amounts of land out of production that 
action has helped support prices everywhere but the result has 
been a loss in market share

grants targeted for water and sewer projects in colonias in texas

the uss iowas test firing of its 16inch guns 
marks their first use since an explosion killed 47 sailors in 
april but a navy spokesman says the turret involved in the blast 
was not used 
the test took place friday without incident while the ship was 
deployed for the mideastern hostage crisis navy spokesman lt greg 
smith said monday 
chief of naval operations adm carlyle trost had ordered a 
moratorium on the use of the weapons in all ships shortly after the 
incident april 19 in which 47 sailors were killed but that 
decision was modified in june 
because fleet commanders need to respond to the possibility of 
war attack or other contingencies the socalled livefire 
training was permitted 
the test was successful and without incident smith said 
smith said guns from two of the iowas three turrets were used 
in the exercise the no 2 turret the one involved in the april 
explosion was not used he said 
the navy has yet to release the results of its investigation 
into the explosion in the iowas no 2 gun turret one of the worst 
naval disasters since the vietnam war 
the report has been submitted to the commander of surface forces 
for the atlantic fleet in norfolk va and will eventually land on 
defense secretary dick cheneys desk after being passed up the 
chain of command 
the iowa was one of several ships dispatched to the eastern 
mediterranean as part of the us show of military force ordered in 
response to the ongoing hostage crisis 
the iowa was in the mediterranean to make a port call in 
marseilles france but cut short its visit to head closer to 
lebanon last week 
smith said the commander for the 6th fleet in the mediterranean 
vice adm james d williams authorized the test firing 
williams aboard the guided missile cruiser uss belknap 
canceled a fourday call at the soviet port of sevastopol last week 
in order to oversee the us navy movements in the area 
smith refused to discuss the number of guns used in the exercise 
or the amount of explosives used to pack them there are three guns 
on each of the iowas gun turrets 
each gun can fire projectiles weighing up to 2700 pounds at a 
maximum range of 23 miles it also has 12 5inch guns 
the battleship is also equipped with a variety of other weapons 
including tomahawk and harpoon cruise missiles 
the only us aircraft carrier in the 6th fleet the uss coral 
sea also is in the eastern mediterranean said a defense 
department official 
the aircraft carrier uss america ordered from singapore to the 
north arabia sea as part of the showtheflag exercise was 
scheduled to be on station today the official added 
defense secretary dick cheney in remarks to reporters on 
monday confirmed the positioning of the two carriers 
although the america was required to cross thousands of miles of 
ocean to reach its station cheney called the deployment not that 
unusual for us 
we always have at least one carrier group in the med there 
are various and sundry other forces available in that part of the 
world as is normally the case he added

the government says it still plans to bring a 
new generation of landing systems to the nations airports by the 
end of the century despite falling three years behind schedule and 
canceling the main contract 
the federal aviation administration on monday ended a 79 
million contract with the hazeltine corp to build 178 microwave 
landing systems and said it will ask for new contractors proposals 
later this year 
the company was chosen in 1984 to build systems that are to 
replace the instrument landing systems used for years at most 
airports 
in a prepared statement the faa said engineering and production 
problems at the commack nybased company have delayed the 
program by three years 
but the faa said it remains committed to putting the new 
microwave landing systems at major us airports in 1998 and at all 
airports around 2000 
hazeltine has delivered two of the systems sought in the 
contract one has been installed at the lebanon nh airport 
the faa said it will buy 26 systems from other sources test 
that equipment and then decide whether to move ahead the faa said 
it plans to award a new contract in 1991 
hazeltine through its parent emerson electric co of st louis 
said it will sue over the faa decision 
the microwave landing system is intended to give pilots greater 
flexibility in their landing approaches at airports and help 
airports increase their flight capacity 
the system uses highfrequency microwaves to direct planes to 
landings allowing them to make curved and steeper approaches 
outside the strict paths necessary under the current system the 
system is virtually immune to weather hazards 
in its letter to hazeltine the faa said the company has 
failed to perform and deliver in accordance with the schedule of 
the subject contract 
but hazeltine blamed the government for production delays 
saying problems involving payments and timing of deliveries were 
the result of changes the faa made in the contract after it was 
awarded 
the agency had planned on putting new microwave systems at the 
laconia and manchester airports in new hampshire but faa spokesman 
john leyden said that because of the delays it may put early 
systems at highprofile highvolume airports such as john f 
kennedy international in new york 
the faa plans to buy 750 of the new systems if congress 
approves

reagan in a paradoxical rage induced by the constant use of 
valium 
in papers filed in us district court hinckley also sought 
permission to be interviewed on rare occasions by other 
responsible members of the news media including the washington

questions about the gun laws hinckley said in the papers 
hinckley said that on two occasions he was arrested while in 
possession of weapons in the same city where president carter was 
appearing 
the fact that no action was taken by the united states

a former army intelligence officer is under a 
judges order not to discuss his complaints of waste and fraud in a 
secret plan for maintaining the government after a nuclear attack 
us district court judge norma johnson issued the gag order 
against fred westerman and his lawyer frank mroz after their 
names appeared in a magazine article about the continuity of 
government program according to government sources 
the program is aimed at enabling the government to regroup in 
the event of a nuclear attack westerman owns a small firm that 
provided security services related to the program to the federal 
emergency management agency 
a senate committee investigator attempted to interview westerman 
as a result of the article in us news amp world report but was 
told the judges order extended to conversations with congress 
said the sources who spoke monday on condition of anonymity 
johnson issued the order a week ago today 
westerman in march 1987 began alleging there were irregularities 
in the program according to papers on file in the us court of 
claims westerman has since been made a target of the 
investigation which he claims is an effort at retaliation 
details of westermans allegations are contained in a federal 
court suit that was placed under seal early this year because of 
the highly classified nature of the project 
the project includes mobile communications systems and 
commandpost bunkers around the country according to the magazine 
after johnsons gag order last week a computerized docket sheet 
at the federal courthouse was altered so that case now is entitled 
merely sealed v sealed 
the docket previously had said that westerman and his firm 
systems evaluation inc are suing the army three federal 
agencies a private corporation and an army corps of engineers 
officer who oversaw his contract 
us news reported that the pentagon the justice department 
the house armed services committee and a federal grand jury are 
looking into the continuity of government program 
the investigations reportedly focus on allegations that 
contracts were awarded improperly or that payments were made for 
work not properly done resulting in millions of dollars in costs 
that may not be justified 
on christmas eve 1987 after westerman continued to make 
allegations to superiors the army told him that his contract was 
not being renewed despite earlier assurances that it would be 
according to papers he filed in the us court of claims he says 
he is still owed 500000 in unreimbursed costs 
westerman a retired major who spent 20 years as an army 
counterintelligence officer took his allegations to the fbi the 
justice department and the inspector generals office at the 
emergency management agency 
in january two months after filing his case with the claims 
court he was informed that his contract was the focus of a 
criminal investigation by the justice department for possible 
fraud he recently received a target letter from the us 
attorneys office in baltimore informing him he is the focus of 
that probe 
his claims court case is suspended pending the outcome of the 
criminal investigation 
i think there are certain individuals in the government who 
are using this process to ruin my client financially mroz said 
monday after a hearing on the claims court case 
mroz said the individuals whom he did not identify are 
engaging in retribution in connection with certain 
allegations by my client about waste and fraud as well as their 
attempted coverup of their own wrongdoing in the operation of his 
contract 
army spokesman lt col john chapla said regarding the 
allegations of irregularities in the secret program the 
appropriate authorities within the congress and the executive 
branch review the program regularly

japans troubled governing party on tuesday 
overwhelmingly elected toshiki kaifu to become party president and 
succeed prime minister sousuke uno in a vote likely to influence 
the nations future political balance 
the 58yearold kaifu a twotime former education minister is 
the partys second new leader in two months like uno he has 
little power base of his own and hopes to overcome scandals and a 
tax policy that loosened the governing liberal democrats grip on 
power for the first time since 1955 
party officials said kaifu received 279 votes yoshiro hayashi 
a former health and welfare minister received 120 votes while 
shintaro ishihara a novelist and former transportation minister 
from the partys nationalist wing received 48 with four invalid 
votes out of the total of 451 
party members watched silently as six officials counted the 
ballots and placed them in separate black lacquer trays but broke 
into applause when the winner was announced kaifu rose from his 
seat and bowed 
in an attempt at greater democracy the liberal democrats 
decided for the first time in 17 years to select the president by a 
vote of their parliament members and 47 delegates from prefectural 
party organizations 
the party president is expected to be confirmed as prime 
minister on wednesday by the lower house of parliament where the 
governing party has a large majority 
in elections july 23 the liberal democrats lost their majority 
in the upper house for the first time since the party was formed 34 
years ago 
meanwhile emperor akihito officially opened a new session of 
parliament on tuesday and called for the lawmakers to promote 
world peace and the nations prosperity kyodo news service 
reported 
noboru takeshita stepped down as prime minister june 2 to take 
responsibility for the recruit influencebuying scandal which 
reached the top ranks of the governing party bureaucracy and 
business 
his successor sousuke uno was plagued by reports that he kept 
paid mistresses and announced his resignation july 24 to take 
responsibility for the loss in upperhouse elections 
all three candidates to replace uno agreed in speeches to party 
members monday that the liberal democrats should revise an 
unpopular 3 percent sales tax that outraged japanese housewives and 
contributed to the loss of the upper house general elections for 
the lower house are expected before spring 
the situation the liberal democratic party now faces is the 
worst since its founding in 1955 kaifu said in his speech and 
declared i believe the ldps resurrection is the only way for 
japan to maintain freedom democracy peace and affluence 
he said japan also should play a greater role in the world 
it is not enough for japan to simply maintain the security 
treaty with the united states and not to play a more responsible 
role now that japan has grown so powerful and economically 
affluent he said we are responsible for fulfilling the 
worlds expectations of japan 
kaifu said japan might be able to help president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reform efforts in the soviet union and contribute to 
the opening of eastern european countries 
ishihara 56 said in his speech any further decline in the 
liberal democratic partys strength threatens japans free 
enterprise system which has enabled the people through their 
efforts to create the most dynamic economy in the world 
stressing the image problem hayashi 62 said public anger 
toward the party has not calmed down even after our election 
defeat there seem to be persistent distrust and anger among the 
people

in 1960 a cocky 29yearold politician predicted 
that in another 29 years he would be prime minister of japan 
toshiki kaifu made that prophecy reality tuesday as he was voted 
to head the liberal democratic party assuring him of becoming 
japans 19th postwar premier 
a few weeks ago it seemed most unlikely kaifu didnt figure in 
the early race to succeed sousuke uno who is stepping down after 
less than two months in the wake of his partys thrashing in recent 
parliamentary elections 
but with senior party leaders virtually eliminated from serving 
in the nations highest office because of their own links to an 
influencepeddling scandal kaifu was called on as an experienced 
politician with a clean image to lead the party out of its current 
crisis 
the head of the liberal democrats becomes prime minister because 
of the partys majority in the lower house of parliament kaifu is 
expected to be formally named on wednesday 
the party lost its majority in the upper house in an election 
last month forcing uno already besieged by charges that he kept 
paid mistresses to take responsibility for the setback and resign 
we must overcome the obstacles which i deeply regret kaifu 
told party members in a speech monday we must seriously consider 
the harsh reality of the election results 
a veteran politician who served as education minister in the 
cabinets of two prime ministers kaifu is japans secondyoungest 
postwar leader only kakuei tanaka premier in 197274 was 
younger taking office at age 54 
an eloquent speaker who studied debating in college kaifu 
learned his political ropes as a protege of the late prime minister 
takeo miki and was once considered a future party heavyweight 
his influence waned however as the small intraparty faction 
to which he belonged became overshadowed by larger groupings within 
the party 
the liberal democrats turned to him amid calls for a younger 
leadership and because of his support for political reform which 
he inherited from miki 
he was also a compromise candidate between the main rival 
factions whose leaders were tainted by the socalled recruit co 
scandal kaifu himself has acknowledged receiving 108000 in 
donations from recruit but has claimed they were all legitimate 
political contributions 
he moved quickly to repair damage to the liberal democrats since 
formally declaring his candidacy on friday appealing particularly 
to women who felt estranged by allegations about unos affairs and 
a new consumption tax forced into law by the party earlier this 
year 
we must think of constructing a social balance between men and 
women that respects womens place in society and makes use of their 
abilities he said in his monday speech 
kaifus drawbacks are a lack of experience in foreign and 
financial affairs not heading his own faction and never having 
served a top party post some political analysts therefore believe 
his administration will end in october when the liberal democrats 
elect a new party president for a twoyear term 
others however believe kaifu could last longer depending on 
how he fares in the coming three months 
if he succeeds in hammering out his own color and philosophy 
there is a possibility his administration could last an 
unexpectedly long time gakushuin university law professor 
hidekazu kawai told the newspaper nihon keizai shimbun 
kaifu considers the number 29 particularly significant aside 
from his vow at age 29 he graduated from prestigious waseda 
university in the 29th year of the reign of the late emperor 
hirohito and was first elected to parliament in japans 29th 
general election

environmentalists are threatening to take the 
commerce department back to court over secretary robert mosbachers 
decision allowing shrimpers to abandon devices that protect 
endangered sea turtles in favor of regimented trawl times 
the national wildlife federation and other conservation groups 
argue that the commerce department must uphold the law requiring 
shrimpers to equip their nets with turtle excluder devices and 
that limited trawling is ineffective in protecting sea turtles such 
as the kemps ridley 
under a rule that took effect at 1201 am edt today shrimpers 
were to begin pulling their nets every 105 minutes to check for 
entangled sea turtles 
mosbacher predicted compliance with the limiting trawling times 
would be far better than with the turtle excluder devices that 
shrimpers loathe but conservationists said only teds can save the 
kemps ridley from extinction before the end of the century

chief who ignored orders to deport nicaraguans but sent home 
haitian boat people announced his resignation 
rivkind district ins director since 1983 said monday he would 
resign aug 21 to teach criminal justice at a small college in 
virginia 
three years ago rivkind refused to send back a group of 
nicaraguan refugees and announed he was flouting us policies that 
treated the nicaraguans the same as other central americans who 
have no special immigration status 
the more than 800000 cubans in south florida the largest 
cuban community anywhere except the city of havana admired 
rivkinds anticommunism and enforcement of an opendoor policy for 
cuban refugees thousands of nicaraguan refugees also live in the 
region

haitians in miami that his adherence to the federal order to send 
haitian boat people back home while allowing nicaraguans to stay 
was racist 
he said it was simply not true that under his term haitians 
were discriminated against i think its dangerous and 
irresponsible to make statements about discrimination in a 
community as volatile as this 
its true that my relationship with mr rivkind has been up 
and down some days sometimes we are friends another time we are 
enemies said the rev gerard jeanjuste a leader of the 
100000member haitian community here i hope that the next 
district director to come will provide equal justice equal 
treatment to the haitian refugees as is given to the cubans

positions 
i am one who likes to speak out on social issues and 
government sometimes says dont speak out said rivkind who will

a chemical companys chief executive will answer 
questions about a toxic spill this week in a court case that 
environmentalists and legal experts say could set a precedent for 
punishing corporate negligence 
us district judge jack tanner twice has refused to accept 
pleas from officials representing pennwalt corp a 
philadelphiabased chemical company charged with polluting a tacoma 
waterway in a 1985 toxic bleach spill and requested the appearance 
of chief executive and board chairman edwin e tuttle 
who is this corporation tanner asked in a hearing earlier 
this year i think the public is entitled to know who is 
responsible 
tuttle was to appear in court wednesday a company spokesman 
said tuttle has declined to comment on his appearance 
the case is the first in which the us government based its 
criminal investigation solely on corporate negligence said 
prosecutor david marshall 
to my knowledge this is the first case of a federal judges 
ordering a particular individual from a corporate body to appear to 
plead the guilt of the corporate entity said david skover 
professor of civil procedure and constitutional law at the 
university of puget sound law school 
skover predicted tanners tactic will be used again possibly in 
lawsuits against exxon over the 11 million gallons of oil spilled 
in alaskas prince william sound 
us attorney general dick thornburgh has said that exxon is the 
subject of a criminal investigation because of the march spill the 
nations largest 
the device used by tanner may prove very effective in alerting 
all corporations that the top executive will not be allowed to pass 
the buck skover said 
environmentalists agreed that corporate executives will take 
notice of the pennwalt case 
how can you be a corporate executive and not take 
responsibility for your corporation said david ortman of the 
northwest office of friends of the earth we no longer accept the 
notion that corporations are faceless letterheads that cant be 
threatened or held accountable 
the negligence charges in the case were aimed at corporate 
officers and employees as well as the company marshall said 
corporations are run by people who are responsible for what 
happens he said 
the only pennwalt employee to admit wrongdoing was tacoma plant 
manager orval j high he received two years probation and a 
5000 fine for negligently discharging pollutants and failing to 
notify the coast guard 
the case involved a spill of at least 75000 gallons of a 
chemical containing sodium dichromate into tacomas hylebos 
waterway which flows into puget sound the spill occurred when a 
180000gallon storage tank ruptured 
sodium dichromate is a toxic compound used as a bleach in the 
paper industry it contains hexavalent chromium a cancercausing 
agent 
last year a federal grand jury in seattle indicted the company 
and four company officers 
on may 2 prosecutors and pennwalt lawyers reached a plea 
agreement which called for the company to plead guilty to five 
misdemeanor counts and pay a 11 million fine 
the agreement covered two counts of negligently failing to 
maintain adequate storage tanks at its tacoma plant two counts of 
discharging pollutants and one count of failing to promptly report 
the spill to the coast guard 
charges against the company officials including three 
executives were dropped tuttle was not charged 
in may pennwalts attorneys appeared at tacomas federal 
courthouse to plead guilty to the reduced charges but tanner 
refused to accept their pleas and asked that corporate officers 
appear instead 
in june pennwalt sent three corporate officers but tanner 
changed his mind he asked to see tuttle 
pennwalt spokesman peter mccarthy declined to comment on the 
companys reaction to tanners order except to say there was 
surprise 
in the northwest pennwalt employs 135 people in tacoma and 170 
at a portland ore plant the tacoma operation produces chemicals 
used in paper adhesives and bleach the company reported 
firstquarter earnings of 285 million this year on sales of 
2799 million

a threestage rocket carrying a weather satellite 
failed to lift off today when one of its three engines misfired 
during countdown at a space center in southern japan officials 
said 
the 81 million h1 rocket capable of sending a 1200pound 
satellite into geostationary orbit failed to lift off at the 
national space development agency on tanegashima island 616 miles 
southwest of tokyo said nasda spokesman junji oda 
it was the space agencys first failure in 20 rocket launchings 
since the agency successfully sent up the n1 type rocket in 1975 
oda said 
he said the reason for the mishap was unknown 
we fired the first stage but something happened before it 
reached the second stage and it was automatically stopped at 
present we dont know what it was oda said 
kishiro nakamura head of the science and technology agency 
said he will seek a prompt report on the cause of the failure 
the accident happened at a time when we have just started to 
put more effort into space development we have to be able to earn 
the publics understanding and trust in space development 
nakamura said 
before starting an investigation into the causes of the failure 
the agency has to extract fuel and other materials from the rocket 
to avoid an explosion oda said 
if the trouble is not too serious and can be fixed without too 
much effort another trial could be possible by the end of 
september he said 
the h1 rocket carries the no 4 weather satellite which will 
replace the current weather satellite known as himawari no 3 
or sunflower no 3 the present satellite is capable of 
pursuing its mission for another year or so according to oda

a man battling his wife for custody of 
their fertilized eggs says he would rather leave the seven 
preembryos in cold storage than let them be born to a single 
parent 
junior lewis davis said after the first day of his unprecedented 
divorce trial monday that he comes from a broken home and knows the 
hardships it can cause 
i just simply do not wish to have any children out there for 
the fact it would be in a singleparent situation he said i 
dont think it would be fair to me or the child 
mary sue davis who is fighting to have the seven preembryos 
implanted in her womb said they represent her best chance at 
motherhood 
im quite capable of raising a child by myself she said 
i dont think he has to worry about that 
both davises were to testify today in blount county circuit 
court before judge w dale young 
junior davis 30 sued for divorce in february and asked the 
court to prevent his wife from having any of the eggs implanted 
mary sue davis 28 says she has the greater claim to the eggs 
because she went to more trouble to produce them and potentially 
can do more for them 
the davises were married nine years ago and entered the in vitro 
fertilization program at a knoxville hospital three years later 
after mrs davis had four tubal pregnancies 
in vitro fertilization first was used successfully in england in 
1978 it involves fertilization of eggs in a laboratory dish the 
fertilized eggs can be implanted in a womb and brought to term 
naturally the success rate according to testimony monday is 
about 18 percent nationwide 
there originally were nine fertilized eggs two were 
unsuccessfully implanted before the couples marriage broke down 
dr i ray king who runs the in vitro fertilization program 
testified monday the seven preembryos are between four and eight 
cells a preembryo is an egg that has been fertilized for less 
then 12 to 14 days 
other testimony monday described preembryos as a mass of 
undifferentiated cells with no human characteristics 
but king testified the preembryos represent potential life he 
said they should not be destroyed whatever the outcome of the 
divorce suit but provided to some other infertile couple 
jay christenberry mrs davis attorney said in his opening 
statement the question of how we classify the embryos is vital 
i think its important we recognize these are living cells 
he said they may or may not develop but we believe they 
deserve protection 
junior davis attorney charles clifford said davis wants to 
leave the status quo in effect he doesnt plan to alter the 
preembryos but he does ask that any use of them require his 
consent 
christenberry has tried to show that mrs davis might not have 
another chance to go through in vitro fertilization which produces 
socalled testtube babies because the actual fertilization 
takes place outside the womb in a laboratory dish 
but both king and john a robertson a university of texas law 
professor called by clifford as an expert witness said she 
probably could go through the process again 
robertson said he believes there are some in vitro programs that 
would accept a single woman as a client or he said she might 
remarry

kelly mother of seven litters and 
beloved golden retriever of town council president sandra johanson 
is missing the victim of what looks like a political dognapping 
it started as nothing more than a lost dog story 
but kellys disappearance turned sinister after 12 hours when a 
man telephoned mrs johansons home and said 
get off the council and youll get your dog 
monday one week after kellys disappearance mrs johanson 
calmly retold the mysterious story weary from griefstricken 
appeals on radio and television and a week of sleepless nights 
ginger and chris kellys daughter and former mate 
respectively are upset mrs johanson said 
the entire family is devastated we havent been right for a 
week she said 
it all began the night of july 31 that was the last time 
anybody saw kelly the 7yearold canine had been let out for her 
nightly cavort with ginger to range over the johansons 64 acres in 
this community of chicken and dairy farms and plantations of sod 
for suburban lawns 
at 915 pm ginger came home alone 
mrs johanson a republican housewife and lifelong resident of 
this town of 6700 45 miles south of providence said the apparent 
dognapping is the work of a sick mind rather than a political foe 
rumors have sprung up nevertheless 
the 48yearold mrs johanson entered politics five years ago by 
running for the fivemember town council she quickly moved to the 
top to become the first woman chief executive in this town 
incorporated in 1757 
i shouldnt have any enemies mrs johanson said cradling 
one of kellys latest puppies from a litter of nine 
but it has been widely speculated that mrs johansons missing 
dog is somehow related to the controversial firing last november of 
the town dump custodian and the highway supervisor the latter was 
later reinstated then resigned 
mrs johanson refused to comment about this saying only that 
her vote for dismissal was just one of five unanimous votes and 
that the matter is the subject of a court suit over alleged 
mismanagement of town property 
im not pointing the finger at anybody she said 
others disagreed 
the general feeling around town said lorraine russo temporary 
town clerk is its a personal vendetta against this woman 
and police chief george weeden has speculated the apparent 
dognapping had something to do with hard feelings from somewhere 
in the past 
weeden said monday that he has no suspects but lots of tips 
its an important case to us he said its sensitive its a 
family pet 
mrs johansons fondness for her dogs is well known 
a framed family portrait of kelly ginger and christopher adorns 
the kitchen of the johansons 18thcentury farmhouse 
the dogs regularly play ball on the beach mrs johanson said 
they go get the newspapers on sunday mornings they go shopping 
they go visiting with us 
there is a reward for kellys return but mrs johanson wont 
say how much how can you put a price tag on someone who is part 
of your family 
the johansons held a family powwow to decide whether mrs 
johanson should quit for the sake of kellys return for now at 
least they decided against abdicating dog or no dog 
if i resign if somebody gets their way on one thing whats 
next i am not leaving the council at this time she said

here are excerpts from the declaration 
of tela signed monday in honduras which calls for the disbanding 
of the usbacked nicaraguan rebels as translated from spanish by 
the associated press 
the five central american presidents declared that it is 
necessary to complete the steps agreed upon in esquipulas ii 
guatemala 1987 to reach a strong and lasting peace such as 
putting into effect the compliance of the promises made by the 
presidents in the declarations and agreements that have been 
achieved successively in alajuela costa rica 1988 and costa del 
sol el salvador 1989 
as a result the presidents pledged to prevent the use of each 
countrys territory to destabilize governments in other central 
american countries 
they agreed to demobilize repatriate or voluntarily relocate 
to nicaragua or third countries members of the nicaraguan 
resistance and their families 
similarly they supported an accord reached monday by honduras 
and nicaragua under which nicargua agreed to withdraw a lawsuit 
before the international court of justice accusing honduras of 
supporting the contra rebels 
the presidents of guatemala el salvador and costa rica declared 
their moral support of this agreement 
the presidents then agreed to ratify the demand of armed 
groups in the region especially the fmln the leftist farabundo 
marti liberation front guerrillas fighting the government of el 
salvador currently in conflict to desist from these actions 
cease hostilities immediately and engage in a dialogue to abandon 
their armed struggle 
the presidents called for the incorporation of the fmln into 
the democratic life of el salvador 
the presidents recognize the efforts of the guatemalan 
government to strengthen its process of national reconciliation 
through dialogue in which the national reconciliation commission 
has a strong presence 
the presidents added 
we reiterate the call for armed groups to abandon their 
hostile actions within the spirit of this agreeement and 
incorporate themselves into institutional politics through the 
process of national reconciliation 
the presidents also agreed to solicit the united nations to 
adopt the necessary measures to put into effect the mechanism of 
verification in terms of security in that honduras and nicaragua 
have arrived at an agreement that includes the withdrawal of the 
contras from honduras and reiterate our request for the 
establishment of an international peace keeping force 
the presidents finally declared they condemn energetically the 
trafficking and use of drugs

the man elected today to succeed 
outgoing prime minister david lange said he intends to maintain a 
tough antinuclear decree that bans us warships from new zealand 
ports 
our nuclear policy wont be changed deputy prime minister 
geoffrey palmer told a news conference after being named head of 
the governing labor party today lange 47 resigned monday amid 
party wrangling over economic policy citing health reasons 
we want to have dialogue with the americans we want to have 
discussions but i wouldnt want to suggest that there is going to 
be any prospect of immediate change in that respect at all 
palmer said 
the us state department said monday that it hoped the next 
prime minister would reassess the policy that led to the the 
collapse of the anzus military alliance with america and australia 
lange arranged to visit govgeneral sir paul reeves today to 
formally submit his resignation upon acceptance of the 
resignation palmer was to formally become prime minister 
helen clark 40 who was health minister will become deputy 
prime minister 
palmer 47 former attorneygeneral and justice minister was 
elected leader of the traditionally leftleaning labor party at a 
meeting of the partys caucus following langes sudden announcement 
that he was resigning after five years 
lange said he wanted to step down while he was still on top he 
suffered a heart attack a year ago 
he noted recent opinion polls show his personal popularity and 
that of his labor party government are increasing 
but observers pointed to party infighting over the economy and 
last weeks reappointment to the cabinet of roger douglas a 
conservative archrival of lange who lange dismissed as finance 
minister last year 
langes government denied permission for us warships to enter 
new zealand ports in 1984 because washington refused to confirm or 
deny whether specific ships carried atomic weapons 
the united states in 1986 retaliated by suspending all military 
cooperation with the government in wellington making it impossible 
to operate the australiannew zealandus anzus defense alliance 
state department spokesman richard boucher said monday we are 
hopeful that prime minister langes successor will reassess new 
zealands antinuclear policy 
we hope he will address with us the differences between our 
two countries on securityrelated issues he said 
there was no immediate reaction to langes resignation from 
france which was embroiled in a major diplomatic row with new 
zealand after french agents in 1985 bombed the environmentalist 
ship rainbow warrior in wellington harbor causing the death of a 
dutch photographer 
last year lange allowed douglas to deregulate industries remove 
subsidies and privatize government departments but he opposed 
douglas proposed flat tax among other ideas saying it would hit 
the poor hardest 
there is no place in new zealand for deregulated labor 
markets there is no place in new zealand for doing away with a 
minimum wage lange said there is no place in new zealand for 
policies which would reduce women to some convenient chattels of 
the marketplace

authorities shut down a day care 
service while they investigate the death of a 3yearold girl who 
was left in a closed car for more than three hours on a sweltering 
afternoon 
ebony skinner was left alone in a latemodel cadillac with its 
windows rolled up from 1230 pm to 4 pm friday police capt 
richard mulhall said the car was parked in the driveway of the day 
care operators home which is where the business is located 
the girl was one of seven children between the ages of 3 and 6 
who had returned from a brief shopping trip with the day care 
operator carrie allison 
its possible she fell asleep and was quiet in the back 
mulhall said the other children and their parents were being 
questioned 
temperatures were as high as 94 on friday while the humidity 
was oppressive medical experts said under those conditions a child 
can begin dehydrating in 30 minutes 
the state medical examiners office said ebony died of 
hyperthermia a condition in which a person loses the ability to 
sweat and thereby control body temperature 
mulhall said the cars windows were closed because its air 
conditioning had been used during the trip to a nearby shopping 
plaza

statelicensed day care business from her home mulhall said he 
expected charges to be filed once the police investigation was

shock on monday

resources said the state temporarily suspended the license of the 
day care service pending the investigation no decision had been

spending on prisons and medicaid are the 
fastest growing items in state budgets across the country while 
increases for education and welfare are lagging a study shows 
education still gets the lions share of state funds but the 
percentage increase in 1989 was far below that of corrections and 
medicaid according to a survey by the fiscal staff of the national 
conference of state legislatures 
the survey also found that 30 states increased taxes this year 
and that states built their reserves to the highest level in nine 
years 
the survey was released monday at the conferences summer 
meeting in tulsa which is being attended by more than 5000 
people mainly legislators and state officials and staff 
spending on prisons rose by 141 percent among the states as a 
whole while the increase in medicaid costs was 104 percent 
education considered the no 1 issue in most states got little 
more than the average increase in overall spending 
elementarysecondary education spending rose by 78 percent 
while funding for colleges and universities jumped 73 percent 
the overall increase in spending was 72 percent up from 66 
percent a year ago 
spending on aid to families with dependent children the basic 
welfare program rose just 44 percent 
education makes up more than 50 percent of state budgets across 
the country 
west virginia which had to pump money into teacher retirement 
and health insurance led the states with a 257 percent increase 
in education funding 
next were illinois with a 177 percent increase followed by 
nevada and new hampshire with 168 percent ohio with 152 percent 
and georgia with 147 percent 
the report showed states have an estimated 109 billion in 
reserves or 44 percent of general funds thats the highest 
level since 1980 when reserves totaled 118 billion 
steven gold director of fiscal affairs for the conference said 
most states are comfortable from a financial standpoint but he 
added that the margin that is protecting them from being 
uncomfortable is not so large 
the organizations president louisiana senate president pro 
tempore samuel nunez jr said experience has shown that states 
financial conditions can change rapidly and often are tied to the 
national economy 
the greatest concentration of fiscal problems this year was in 
the new england states and in new york and new jersey places that 
just two years ago were faring better than most states 
lee daniels the groups presidentelect and minority leader of 
the illinois house noted that the recession of the early 1980s put 
many states in financial difficulties 
the current fiscal health is certainly not a cause for 
complacency he said 
nunez said 1989 was an active year for state tax policy 
with tax increases totaling 35 billion in 30 states 
spending on prisons has jumped at a time when crime rates are 
dropping in many areas gold attributed the increase to 
courtordered prison improvements and tougher sentencing guidelines 
nunez said the economic future of states is clouded by large 
trade and federal budget deficits and uncertainty about federal aid 
and federal mandates on various programs 
he said federal initiatives in welfare reform catastrophic 
health care and nursing home legislation will raise state costs by 
more than 2 billion a year

family and friends of us rep mickey leland 
awaited word today on the fate of the congressman who was on a 
plane that failed to arrive as expected at a refugee camp near the 
ethiopiansudanese border 
i think that hes going to be all right really i do 
lelands mother alice rains said monday night and i know i have 
to have courage because i want to give courage to the children 
the plane carried nine americans and five ethiopians the 
americans included members of lelands staff and us embassy 
personnel 
alma newsom a spokeswoman in lelands washington office said 
monday it was too early to raise alarms despite information 
from the state department that the plane was reported overdue on a 
flight from the ethiopian capitol of addis ababa to the refugee 
camp fugnido about 300 miles to the southwest 
state department spokesman adam shub said however we are 
concerned about the welfare of mr leland and his group 
ms newsom said she is not overly concerned because 
communications are poor and the travelers would not be able to 
notify anyone of a change in plans 
my guess is once en route the camp that was the original 
destination was too far and they opted to go to a different camp 
ms newsom said 
she said the plane was late in departing monday from addis ababa 
because of bad weather 
ms newsom said pilots were strict about adhering to a 5 pm 
curfew to return to addis ababa 
if they feel they cant get back by that time then you stay 
where you are overnight she said 
the 44yearold leland is chairman of the house select committee 
on hunger he has taken a strong interest in africas refugees and 
visited the same area in march officials said 
the sixterm congressman is married and has a son 
leland who also serves on the house committee on energy and 
commerce and the committee on post office and civil service and was 
twice chairman of the congressional black caucus often has served 
as a mediator in matters of international or interracial 
consequence 
for 10 years he has overseen a program in which black youths 
from his urban district were sent to israel for sixweek stays 
he joined two other congressmen last october in a trip to cuba 
in efforts to negotiate the release of five political prisoners and 
their families 
when members of the veterans peace convoy to nicaragua were 
stopped at their approach to the international bridge in laredo in 
june 1988 leland negotiated with us treasury officials in an 
effort to allow the groups passage across the border

a grand jury investigation into former drexel 
burnham lambert inc bond financier michael milken is expected to 
deliver a new indictment by october the government said 
milken already has been charged with 98 counts of racketeering 
and fraud but a longawaited superseding indictment in the landmark 
wall street corruption case could contain new charges 
at a hearing monday in federal court assistant us attorney 
john k carroll said the government has an ongoing investigation 
of many transactions 
carroll told us district judge kimba wood the government was 
targeting oct 1 to file an indictment against milken his brother 
lowell and former drexel trader bruce lee newberg 
the government disclosed its intent to file a new indictment 
superceding one handed up march 29 after milken lawyer arthur 
liman accused prosecutors of issuing an indictment in 
installments that had hamstrung defense work 
we cannot really prepare this case when we only have part of 
an indictment liman said before requesting a timetable for the 
indictment we will go to trial on 
the standing indictment charges the three defendants with 
racketeering mail wire and securities fraud in the broadest use 
yet of federal racketeering laws they face lengthy jail terms and 
billions of dollars in fines and forfeitures if convicted a jury 
trial tentatively is set for march 1 1990 
an indictment replacing the original one has been anticipated 
for about two months by defense lawyers who are anxious to see what 
if any new charges the government brings against milken pressing 
for and getting the target date should allow defense lawyers to 
focus their preparations 
wood on monday also ordered the government to be more specific 
about charges and statements made in the original 110page 
indictment the move came after defense lawyers charged the 
government with refusing to answer more than 130 requests for more 
information 
wood ordered the government to identify unindicted 
coconspirators named in the charges identify unnamed people who 
allegedly participated in some of the cited transactions and 
identify by category alleged victims and kinds of property 
allegedly defrauded 
prosecutors said they would produce within one month the bulk of 
the thousands of documents about transactions in the case that 
defense lawyers have demanded martin flumenbaum another milken 
lawyer accused the government of delaying release of critical 
documents 
the milkens and newberg have pleaded innocent newberg was one 
of six defendants recently convicted in the princetonnewport 
securities fraud trial and many of the transactions in that case 
are included in the milken indictment 
milken 42 has set aside about 700 million in assets as part 
of a bond package and is free pending trial milken widely 
credited with reshaping american finance through the use of 
highyield highrisk bonds resigned from drexel earlier this year 
to form an investment consulting firm

the tokyo stock exchanges key index rebounded 
today after four days of decline while the us dollar edged down 
against the japanese yen after a threeday climb 
the dollar closed at 13925 yen down 053 yen from mondays 
13978yen finish it opened at 13955 yen and moved between 13895 
yen and 13965 yen 
the dollar had gained 358 yen in three trading days before 
todays decline 
currency trading today was marked mainly by participants 
position adjustments said shinzo yamamoto a trader with daiwa 
bank in tokyo 
news last friday of a lowerthanexpected us jobless rate in 
july had contributed to the dollars rise 
but yamamoto said most market players were wary about buying too 
many dollars because the jobless rate which is only one of many 
indicators is not enough to determine the us economy has started 
to grow again 
a trader with the bank of tokyo said the dollar edged down 
against the yen as the us currrency was sold in dealings between 
the dollar and the west german mark 
most of todays dealings were among banks with individual 
investors remaining on the sidelines said the trader speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
on the stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average 
climbed 12910 points or 037 percent and closed at 3475948 
the index had lost 11161 points the previous day 
genjiro sasaki a dealer with new japan securities co said 
that after losing nearly 270 points since last thursday the nikkei 
rebounded because of speculative investors buying spot issues and 
selling futures issues to make profits from price gaps between the 
two markets 
the new prime minister was finally chosen and it reassured 
the market that there is less political uncertainty he added 
today the governing liberal democratic party chose toshiki 
kaifu a former education minister as the partys new president 
he thus will become prime minister succeeding sousuke uno who 
resigned to take responsibility for the partys losses in the july 
23 parliamentary election 
many participants were still reluctant to buy because they 
dont want to lose money in case the index plunges due to a 
possible major political change sasaki said 
he noted first section volume was still small estimated at 450 
million shares up from the previous days 300 million 
traders reported many buy orders for nintendo stock which 
closed at a limit high of 16400 yen 118 after the company 
announced a gratis share offering today 
the interest in nintendo also triggered buying of fanac and sony 
issues sasaki added

nations busiest highway interchanges and officials tried to 
persuade motorists to take mass transit instead of their vehicles 
to work 
the rest of the week is going to be a disaster said debbie 
lawler spokeswoman for the department of transportation its 
going to take a while for people to find the best alternative route 
for them and its going to take a while for them to be convinced 
to take mass transit 
the fire that closed interstate 78 started at about 130 am 
monday at a garbage dump owned by hub recycling co underneath the 
12lane elevated roadway buckling steel beams late monday the 
fire was contained but continued to smolder 
a 1mile portion of the 622mile roadway which handles about 
100000 vehicles a day will probably be closed for months 
authorities said 
alternate routes linking the busy new york metropolitan area 
with new jersey suburbs and parts of pennsylvania are limited new 
jersey gov thomas h kean said a special panel has been convened 
to study other routes 
kean said the state was preparing to go to court to press for a 
cleanup of the site a superior court clerk said a hearing could be 
held today 
the state has been trying for two years to get the court to 
force hub recycling to remove rubbish stored under the interstate 
an essex judge last may ordered the removal of the garbage but 
stayed the decision on appeal from the company 
two of hub recyclings owners michael harvan and richard bassi 
were convicted recently of illegal waste handling in north bergen 
the state said 
harvan of clifton and bassi of morristown were partners in 
big m trucking co of clifton which authorities said took part in 
a conspiracy to dump thousands of tons of construction debris at 
several north bergen sites 
attempts to reach the two men were unsuccessful monday their 
home telephone numbers could not be obtained 
their lawyer richard roberts of orange did not respond to 
messages left with his office 
no injuries were reported in the blaze which occurred about two 
miles from downtown newarkofficials were uncertain how the fire 
started 
some businesses in the area evacuated workers when smoke poured 
through cracks of up to eight inches in the highway environmental 
officials tested for toxic materials in the plume 
peter baish area director of the us customs service office in 
newark said he evacuated his workers about midday after smoke 
filled several floors housing his agency 
he said some workers were coughing and complained of eye 
irritations 
the associated press also closed its newark office and moved 
operations to its trenton bureau as a precaution said new jersey 
chief of bureau jerry gray

the dialogue of the deaf that has at 
times afflicted mexico and the united states appears to be giving 
way to a new era of understanding on issues from drug trafficking 
to debt 
the relationship between the united states and mexico has 
changed a lot in the last year attorney general enrique alvarez 
del castillo said monday it is a new relationship of 
coordination of collaboration 
castillo who pledged to eradicate drug production in mexico 
spoke at the end of a day of talks that featured an unusually 
highlevel us delegation headed by secretary of state james a 
baker iii and four other cabinet members 
the talks produced no major accords but served to lay the 
groundwork for a salinas visit to washington at the beginning of 
october and the new mood of cooperation 
the united states has no more important relationship than with 
its neighbor and friend the republic of mexico these are not mere 
words they represent the solemn commitment of the united 
states baker said 
baker praised the new mexican administrations vigor in the war 
on drugs saying it had made clear it wants to tear the roots of 
the opium poppy and marijuana plant from its soil 
mexicos success over the past six months in capturing and 
prosecuting drug traffickers has seized the worlds attention 
baker said 
mexico has been a principal source of heroin and marijuana and a 
transit point for usbound cocaine us officials have said 
corruption in the mexican government prevented aggressive pursuit 
of traffickers 
a former mexican police officer was convicted in the united 
states last year in the 1985 tortureslaying of us drug agent 
enrique camarena another mexican policeman was indicted in the 
case last month 
mexican officials have long insisted that cutting us demand is 
the key to the problem 
the bush administration knows all too well that 60 percent of 
the worlds illegal drug supply is consumed in the united states 
baker said this senseless demand must be cut through the efforts 
of all americans 
the us recognition that it must cut the demand for drugs is 
vital to the new spirit of cooperation foreign minister fernando 
solana said 
officials on both sides noted the positive new tone after years 
of misunderstanding disagreement and mutual recrimination that a 
highranking salinas administration official described as at times 
having been a dialogue of the deaf 
baker and treasury secretary nicolas brady praised the economic 
policies of president carlos salinas de gortari whose 
administration has been in office eight months 
brady hailed the debt reduction agreement mexico reached with 
commercial banks two weeks ago and the steps it has taken to 
encourage foreign investment and lower trade barriers payments on 
the countrys 107 billion foreign debt have contributed to a sharp 
decline in living standards the past seven years 
baker said mexico has become an economic model for other debtor 
nations because of salinas bold farsighted policies 
after two decades of 6 percent growth the economy completely 
stagnated under salinas predecessor president miguel de la 
madrid in part due to an austerity program put into effect to keep 
up with debt payments 
but despite efforts to encourage nonpetroleum exports reduce 
government deficit spending and cut inflation the economy has 
remained in the doldrums combined unemployment and underemployment 
is estimated at 40 percent 
other us officials joining baker and brady for the talks under 
the auspices of the usmexico binational commission included 
attorney general richard thornburgh commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher us trade representative carla hills and fbi director 
william session 
also on the agenda were issues relating to the usmexican 
border the environment fisheries trade and investment and 
cultural ties

cubas communist party newspaper says the 
us government is refusing to work with the havana government in 
fighting drug trafficking 
the newspaper granma said in an editorial monday that the 
united states wants fidel castros communist government to change 
before there is talk of cooperation 
washington cannot pretend that cuba stop being what it is as a 
condition for any progress in their relations even to agree on 
mechanisms for cooperation in the antidrug struggle granma said 
the editorial headlined cuba must be treated as it is a 
socialist and sovereign country was carried in full by the cuban 
government news agency prensa latina and monitored in mexico city 
as long as there isnt a us government with common sense and 
political courage to understand that it cannot aspire to change us 
there will not be bilateral progress the editorial said 
during the trials in recent weeks of 14 military officers 
accused of shipping colombian cocaine and other drugs through cuba 
to the united states cuban officials and granma articles accused 
the us government of failing to share intelligence it had on drug 
trafficking 
what is certain is that by denying that cooperation on 
information six tons of cocaine entered us territory the 
equivalent of 4 million doses although this represents less than 1 
percent of annual consumption in the united states the editorial 
said 
but it said cuba set an example in its prosecution of the 
officers four of whom were executed by firing squad in july 
the reality is that no country in this hemisphere has fought 
as energetically against drugs as ours it said for many years 
cuba has fought by itself against the traffickers marauding its 
coasts 
the editorial compared cubas punishment of the 14 officers with 
the scandalously benign sentence imposed on oliver north 
north a national security council aide during the reagan 
administration was fined 150000 and sentenced to two years 
probation and 1200 hours of community service for his role in the 
the irancontra affair he was convicted of accepting an illegal 
gift abetting in the obstruction of congress and shredding 
official documents 
we have lived 30 years without relations with the united 
states the editorial said if theres anyone who isnt desperate 
to normalize relations its cuba 
castro came to power after the rightist government of fulgencio 
batista was overthrown in 1959

five military astronauts boarded the 
space shuttle columbia today and prepared to fly on a secret 
mission to deploy a hightech satellite to spy on the soviet union 
the weather was perfect and there were no technical problems as 
a blackedout countdown advanced toward a liftoff expected about 8 
am 
because most details about the flight are classified the 
pentagon would allow nasa to announce only that liftoff would occur 
between 730 am and 1130 am the countdown was to be made 
public just nine minutes before the planned liftoff 
a van carrying the astronauts accompanied by security cars and 
a hovering helicopter arrived at the launch pad shortly after 5 
am 
the flight will be the first for columbia in 3 years during 
the hiatus the craft has received 258 safety modifications 
dictated by the 1986 challenger explosion 
the ships return to space will give the space agency a fleet of 
three orbiters to handle an increasing flight schedule three more 
flights are planned this year and nine in 1990 
the commander is air force col brewster shaw a veteran of two 
earlier missions the others are navy cmdr richard richards army 
lt col james adamson air force maj mark brown and navy cmdr 
david leestma who flew once previously on a shuttle 
although mission details are classified sources close to the 
program said the astronauts will deploy a sophisticated 10ton 
reconnaissance satellite to gather intelligence information over a 
wide area of the globe including much of the soviet union china 
and the middle east 
the satellite is designed to take highly detailed photographs of 
troop movements military installations and other targets of 
interest 
the sources said that in the shuttles cargo bay was a package 
of scientific instruments for military research possibly for the 
star wars missile defense project 
what the astronauts do will not be reported by the national 
aeronautics and space administration or the pentagon 
a blackout was to be imposed throughout the flight and only 
three brief announcements were planned to report on the health of 
the shuttle and to reveal when it will land at edwards air force 
base calif 
the mission is expected to last five days 
the flight is the eighth for columbia the oldest of the 
shuttles but its first since it flew the last mission before the 
jan 28 1986 challenger explosion 
after the accident nasa concentrated on modifying the newer 
orbiters discovery and atlantis and columbia spent much of the 
past few years as a hangar queen stripped to provide spare 
parts for its sister ships 
discovery and atlantis each have made two trips into space since 
postchallenger flights resumed last september 
during the flight the astronauts were to check out 258 
modifications made to columbia to improve safety and reliability as 
a result of the accident 
the flight is the 30th for the shuttle program and the fourth 
dedicated solely to a defense department mission 
the defense department had planned at least 13 more military 
launches from the shuttle through the 1990s but in the wake of 
the challenger accident cut that number to seven shifting several 
payloads to unmanned rockets to get away from reliance on a single 
launch vehicle 
the pentagon contends the secrecy of the shuttle military 
flights is necessary to make it more difficult for soviet 
satellites and spy ships off the florida coast to monitor the 
flight and know its purpose 
critics argue that the secrecy is unnecessary because the 
soviets with their intelligence capabilities undoubtedly already 
know a great deal about columbias mission and that once the 
satellite is in orbit the russians will be able to track them 
precisely and know what they are doing

in all of 1985 a single cuban refugee was picked 
up in the sea passage separating the island nation from the florida 
keys 
so far this year 117 refugees have made the perilous journey to 
florida shores and several officials see no signs the latest wave 
will abate as economic problems and political turmoil rattle cuba 
thousands of other cubans arrive each year at miami 
international airport with forged passports or travel documents 
obtained in other latin countries such as panama or ecuador 
its been the year of the cuban refugee in miami said perry 
rivkind immigration and naturalization service director in 
miamithis is the most weve seen in at least the past five 
years 
the us coast guard in miami reports that 59 cubans were found 
at sea last year and 44 were picked up in 1987 
many of the cubans make the journey across the florida straits 
in small boats or makeshift vessels such as inner tubes or rafts 
rivkind said some are washed overboard in rough seas or die of 
dehydration or hunger 
three cubans who were picked up by a soviet spy ship about 26 
miles southeast of miami last month said they survived by catching 
a sea bird and eating it raw they said a fourth companion became 
delirious during the sixday voyage and plunged overboard 
there is no telling now many die trying to reach florida 
said rivkind who announced his resignation on monday after six 
years on the job 
under federal immigration law cuban refugees with close 
relatives in the united states are released in their custody 
following interviews with ins officials cubans with no ties are 
placed in ins custody while asylum applications are processed said 
rivkind 
since cubans cannot be deported to their homeland under us 
law most are granted legal status said rivkind 
in 1980 nearly 125000 cubans entered south florida in the 
mariel boatlift many of the newcomers were forced to camp under 
highways and in vacant lots because few shelters were available 
the latest surge of cuban refugees began only weeks after the 
coast guard responded to a record influx of haitians traveling to 
south florida shores in overcrowded boats 
in march nearly 1500 haitians were stopped at sea more than 
any other month in an eightyear interdiction program which permits 
the coast guard to return haitians to their homeland after ins 
interviews at sea so far this year the coast guard has returned 
more than 2600 haitians 
only five of the more than 20000 haitians interviewed at sea 
since 1981 have been brought into the country for political asylum 
hearings the coast guard reports the others were deemed economic 
refugees and returned to portauprince

the states high court disbarred a woman 
who impersonated her husband and passed the california bar exam in 
his name 
in a 61 unsigned ruling monday the state supreme court said it 
held sympathetic feelings for laura beth lamb who was pregnant 
when she took the test for her husband and said she took it out of 
fear he would abuse her 
dissenting justice marcus kaufman said the court had overreacted 
and imposed a punishment far harsher than the penalties it has 
given to several lawyers convicted of dealing drugs and misusing 
clients money 
mrs lamb was on the verge of complete physical mental and 
emotional collapse when she took the test kaufman said 
kaufman said a period of suspension would be enough to protect 
the public 
the ruling allows mrs lamb now 33 and a legal secretary in los 
angeles to reapply for admission to the bar in 1993 five years 
after she voluntarily went on inactive status 
her attorney tom low said he would urge her to ask the bars 
board of governors for permission to reapply two years earlier 
mrs lamb passed the california bar in 1983 and became a lawyer 
for the securities and exchange commission her husband morgan 
lamb failed the exam in february 1985 
for the july 1985 exam the bar said mrs lamb cut her hair 
dressed in mens clothes had a bar identification photo taken 
signed her husbands name and deliberately smudged her thumbprint 
she took the exam a month later and passed with the ninth highest 
score in the state 
after an anonymous tip to the bar led to an investigation mrs 
lamb pleaded no contest to charges involving deception and 
impersonation and was fined 2500 ordered to perform 200 hours 
of community service and placed on probation 
at the time mrs lamb a diabetic was in the late stages of a 
difficult pregnancy she said her husband had become violent 
smashing lamps screaming at her and pushing her and threatening 
to kill her and the fetus 
low said lamb left his wife after the baby was born and they 
have since divorced

the governing liberal democrats today elected 
toshiki kaifu party president and successor to prime minister 
sousuke uno in the hopes of putting behind it a bribery and sex 
scandal and an unpopular sales tax 
the next prime minister called on fellow japanese to give his 
scandalplagued party a chance to carry out political reforms and 
shed our old skin 
as expected kaifu 58 was elected to head the liberal 
democratic party defeating late challenges by yoshiro hayashi a 
former welfare minister and shintaro ishihara a novelist and 
former transport minister 
a secret ballot by the conservative partys 404 members of 
parliament and one delegate from each of the partys 47 state 
branches resulted in 279 votes for kaifu 120 for hayashi and 48 
for ishihara easily giving kaifu the party presidency on the first 
ballot there were four invalid ballots 
this is a crucial time for our party so it will be a great 
responsibility kaifu a former education minister with little 
personal clout told a news conference shortly after the vote 
as japans second new prime minister in two months he will face 
the challenge of fending off a surging opposition socialist party 
and recovering the popularity the liberal democrats have lost in a 
succession of scandals and a disliked tax policy 
i want to carry out reforms and pass reform legislation based 
on our deep selfreflection he said replying to a question 
about his plan to regain public trust 
he rejected the idea of holding elections immediately as the 
opposition demands 
through debate we hope to gain the peoples understanding of 
our policies before a general election he said 
kaifu will be elected wednesday to succeed uno on the strength 
of his partys large majority in the lower house of parliament he 
also will face the first test of the new political situation in 
japan created by the partys loss of control in the upper house in 
the july 23 elections 
it is likely that the upper house will refuse to confirm him as 
prime minister and vote instead for socialist party chairwoman 
takako doi but under the constitution the lower house chooses the 
head of government so the main effect will be to embarrass the 
liberal democrats 
uno resigned to take responsibility for the july election loss 
leaving the liberal democrats in their worst crisis since the party 
was formed in 1955 and began enjoying uninterrupted rule 
the partys major figures were all ruled out of contention for 
the premiership by involvement in the recruit influencebuying 
scandal in june prime minister noboru takeshita stepped down 
because of links to the recruit co conglomerate but takeshita 
handpicked uno as his successor 
backing from takeshitas faction was a key to kaifus successful 
bid for party leadership 
uno resigned last month amid allegations he kept paid mistresses 
one of kaifus first duties was a round of courtesy calls on 
faction leaders whose opinions will count as kaifu names a cabinet 
and party leadership 
he said the partys reform plans try to tackle the problem of 
the high cost of politics which results in part from the present 
system of multiseat constituencies where liberal democratic 
factions finance candidates who run against each other 
to get away from the problem of huge corporate donations he 
said politicians should seek money from a wide range of individuals 
instead 
large donations from recruit angered the japanese public and 
helped send the liberal democrats popularity skidding kaifu has 
acknowledged that recruit gave him about 110000 over five years 
the donations were legal he said but he regretted having received 
money from a company now accused of attempting to bribe 
politicians bureaucrats and business leaders 
recruit a publishing and information services conglomerate 
sold stock at bargain prices to officials who turned around and 
sold the shares at a handsome profit 
kaifu indicated he will try to persuade the public to accept a 
disliked 3 percent sales tax by earmarking the revenues for social 
welfare purposes 
on foreign affairs an area where he has little experience 
kaifu pledged to maintain close security ties with the united 
states and said he would deal with problems in relations with 
washington as they emerged 
but at the same time japan is also a part of asia we should 
do whatever we can to cooperate in economic development with 
asian nations he said 
he also said japan should work with moscow to help president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reform plans japan because of a longtime 
territorial dispute with the soviets has had cool relations with 
moscow

an oregon mental patient found 
outside a church in this eastern canadian city has wandered off 
before acting as another person and her father says it is her way 
of dealing with mental anguish 
the woman who called herself christina has been identified as 
rochelle scholl of portland ore ed hallett a spokesman for 
newfoundland premier clyde wells said monday 
hallet said the brownhaired woman about 19 was identified by 
portland psychologist susan beattie who arrived monday in st 
johns where ms scholl has been hospitalized for treatment 
officials said ms scholl on monday night insisted she was 
christina 
her positive identification came one month after she was found 
wrapped in a blanket at a church clinging to a doll doctors in 
the newfoundland capital said the woman indicated she was a 
severely handicapped 14yearold with a lifethreatening muscle 
disease that left her unable to walk or talk though she could 
communicate through sign language 
rochelle has misled authorities on at least two other occasions 
officials said although seemingly mute and handicapped scholl was 
later found to be ablebodied and able to speak 
her father rodney scholl said monday in a telephone interview 
from his home in selma ore that he is sure his daughter left 
oregon as rochelle scholl but in her own mind she isnt rochelle 
now 
she has a mental diagnosis of a hysterical disassociation with 
regression and amnesia he said my intentions are to bring her 
home 
scholl said he believes his daughters adopting the persona of 
christina was her way of dealing with mental anguish he said the 
episodes are brought on by stress but he could not think of any 
specific incidents other than the stress of adolescence 
she disassociates from it she thinks she is who she is he 
said 
rochelle was living on her own in a lowincome housing project 
after being discharged from a mental hospital last spring he said 
she was being seen on an outpatient basis and did a lot of 
volunteer work with nursing homes and with handicapped people he 
said 
the father said ms scholl left july 2 telling a neighbor she 
was heading for california or arizona with 1000 in her pocket 
ms scholl had been living in mesa ariz with her mother and 
stepfather from the age of five scholl said at 18 she moved to 
oregon to be with her father 
the discovery of ms scholl on july 7 triggered an intense 
investigation that involved canadian police social and medical 
workers customs officials scotland yard and interpol 
she used sign language to tell doctors she came to canada on a 
yacht with her mother three men and a nanny she was thought to 
understand english german and a yugoslavian dialect 
news reports from january 1988 said she turned up at an airport 
in des moines iowa clutching a baby bottle and a handwritten 
letter authorities originally believed was written by her mother 
said len power of the royal newfoundland constabulary 
three months earlier she was found in an airport bathroom in 
springfield mo with a baby bottle and a similar letter that 
quoted from the bible and blamed her apparent disabilities on 
falling short of the lords blessing 
lt freeman twine of the royal newfoundland constabulary said 
police are satisfied christina is rochelle scholl but she had not 
admitted her identity monday night nor had she started to walk or 
talk 
she just doesnt indicate anything twine said 
scholl has been committed to the waterford mental hospital in 
st johns a lawyer has been appointed by the provincial justice 
department to represent her

the official media is portraying chinas new 
communist party chief jiang zemin as a man of the people who does 
not fear getting his hands dirty and is comfortable preaching 
homely socialist virtues 
lets sing a song together he reportedly told workers at a 
shanghai steelworks well sing we workers have strength ok 
under comrade jiang zemins direction the song rose loud and 
clear the party newspaper the peoples daily reported today in 
a frontpage article titled general secretary among the people of 
shanghai 
jiang returned sunday from a fiveday visit to the city where he 
was local party secretary until his june 24 appointment to the 
national post he succeeded zhao ziyang 
early in his twoyear tenure zhao also was portrayed as a warm 
and personable man who enjoyed visits outside the capital to mingle 
with ordinary people but since his ouster for allegedly supporting 
student prodemocracy protesters the media has printed only harsh 
criticism of him and blamed him for virtually every problem china 
faces from an unbalanced budget to corruption to poor worker 
morale 
jiang on the other hand repeatedly stressed that we must 
rely entirely on the working class shanghais xinmen evening 
news said in a report on the party leaders visit 
it said that while touring the no 2 textile equipment factory 
jiang stopped to ask a young worker his age and what school he had 
attended he then stuck out his hand causing the youth to blush 
and try to wipe off his oilcovered hand 
never mind jiang said grabbing the hand and pumping it 
from now on we must rely on you workers 
these words sank into peoples ears the report said for 
a while people had become hazy about the leading role of the 
workers and the idea of the workerpeasant alliance as an 
ideological foundation 
at the steelworks the peoples daily said jiang noticed that 
some workers did not know all the words to the song that begins 
we workers have strength we workers have strength every day we 
are busy at work 
we should sing this kind of song often he admonished them 
the paper added watching the scene some comrades said we 
havent seen a scene like this for many years 
jiang also called for large and mediumsized businesses to take 
the lead in economic development giving implicit support to the 
new postzhao emphasis on state ownership rather than 
privatization those sized companies tend to be stateowned and 
most have large work forces with low productivity but guaranteed 
lifetime employment 
chinas most efficient and fastgrowing sector is its tiny 
private sector but most of these companies are small 
the reports said jiang rode about in a van on his tour drank 
only tea and insisted on eating at home all in keeping with the 
governments current campaign to save money and encourage simple 
living 
they also said he listened closely to the problems of local 
officials and often took notes his only advice however appears 
to have been ideological after listening to reports by officials 
in villages around shanghai regarding export production collective 
enterprises and population control the peoples daily said jiang 
jotted down a plan for shanghai and its suburbs 
his plan grasp well the building of party spirit develop 
education in socialism patriotism and hard work and strengthen 
education in the national planning mentality

india to withdraw all its troops by next month but that the new 
delhi government is offering a phased pullout that would finish in 
february 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne briefing parliament today on 
talks he had last week with indian leaders in new delhi said an 
end to indian military operations should be immediate and 
unqualified 
indian troops began arriving two years ago to enforce a new 
delhibrokered peace plan aimed at ending an insurgency by minority 
tamils fighting for autonomy in the north and east about 43000 
are now stationed on the indian ocean island 
the indian position on withdrawal on the basis of three 
shiploads per week of 1500 to 1600 personnel including a three 
week preparatory period will take 28 to 30 weeks and will end in 
february 1990 wijeratne who is also the deputy defense 
minister told parliament 
wijeratne led a sixmember delegation to new delhi on july 29 to 
discuss a time frame for the pullout india has already withdrawn 
2220 troops in phases since july 29 the date initially set by 
president ranasinghe premadasa for completion of the pullout 
sinhalese radicals have stirred up an antiindian campaign to 
protest the presence of indian soldiers deployed in the 
tamildominated north and east 
the july 29 1987 peace accord which granted limited autonomy 
to those areas failed when the dominant tamil group the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam rejected it saying it did not meet their 
aspirations for a homeland 
on indian troops halting military operations in the north and 
east wijeratne said the indians wanted the tamil tigers to first 
unilaterally suspend military offensives for a 15day period 
india has linked the troop withdrawal with the devolution of 
powers to the northeastern council formed under the peace accord 
which gave tamils limited autonomy in exchange for an arms 
surrender 
our position is the implementation of the agreement was not 
connected with the indian troop withdrawal wijeratne said 
wijeratnes statement will be debated in parliament and 
premadasa is expected to chair a meeting of his cabinet friday to 
announce sri lankan position on the issues there will be no voting 
sinhalese extremists claiming the presence of indian troops 
compromised the countrys independence have launched a vicious 
campaign against the government at least 4000 people mainly 
government officials and supporters have been killed in the 
twoyear sinhalese uprising the tamil insurgency has claimed 
11000 lives 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
sinhalese make up 75 percent tamils accuse the sinhalese of 
discriminating against them in jobs education and use of the 
sinhalese language 
about 60 million tamils live in southern india

mostly to seals and wild ponies a permanent weather station there 
remained staffed but no injuries or damages were reported despite 
high winds and heavy rains forecasters said 
hurricane forecasters said deans path also includes st johns 
newfoundlands predominant city but officials there hadnt issued 
any special warnings 
were telling people to keep listening to their radios one

while oceangoing vessels would tend to track around the path of 
the hurricane said jim cormier a spokesman for the search and 
rescue centre in halifax

a former soviet cosmonaut reveals in a new book 
that he was slated to beat the americans to the moon but that a top 
rocket designers sudden death kept him grounded the official tass 
news agency reported today 
the book about soviet spaceman valery bykovsky titled 
cosmonaut no 5 contradicts the kremlins past denials that it 
ever intended to send a man to the moon 
bykovsky in one of several frank reports on soviet space 
failures to come out recently describes how he began training for 
the lunar flight expected as early as 1968 tass said 
but the premature death of sergei korolev the visionary chief 
designer of the soviet space program hampered and retarded the 
lunar program the news agency said the united states got 
ahead 
tass said design of the spaceship that was to take bykovsky on a 
preliminary orbit around the moon began soon after the soviet union 
shocked the world by launching sputnik the first satellite in 
1957 the new craft was named zond which means probe 
tass did not specify why the soviet union never sent people to 
the moon soviet officials have said they considered it too risky 
too wasteful and not as productive as sending robot probes 
american astronaut neil armstrong became the first human to set 
foot on the moon in 1969 this past july 20 the 20th anniversary 
of the moonwalk soviet television finally showed film clips of the 
event 
american space expert james oberg says in a 1981 book the 
soviets may have been planning a manned flight around the moon for 
the 50th anniversary of the bolshevik revolution in 1967 
oberg in red star in orbit says korolevs premature death 
may have been the single most important contributing factor which 
prevented this cosmonaut lunar flight from occurring 
korolev died in 1966 from a botched operation according to 
unofficial soviet sources the official pravda obituary said he 
died of cardiac insufficiency after a cancer operation and 
tass referred today only to his sudden death 
recent soviet revelations on space failures included an article 
this summer in the daring weekly ogonyok on what western 
researchers believe to be the countrys deadliest spacerelated 
disaster a fullyfueled icbm blew up on the launchpad in 1960 
killing the head of the soviet rocket forces and literally 
incinerating many others nearby 
bykovsky a muchdecorated cosmonaut set a space endurance 
record of five days in 1963 he is chief of the soviet research and 
engineering center in berlin east germany tass said 
cosmonaut no 5 is not yet available in moscow but an 
official at its publisher politizdat said the book about bykovsky 
by author grigory reznichenko would be out soon

video store owners say they are being unfairly 
singled out by legislators who want to curb the rental of violent 
films such as ninja brothers of blood and night of the 
demons 
video retailers attending the eighth annual video software 
dealers association convention which entered its third day today 
expressed concern that they soon might be prosecuted if they rent 
violencefilled features even those rated pg13 to children 
the booming home video market is dominated by massappeal 
blockbusters like et the extraterrestial and howto tapes 
but the strong presence of lowbudget violencefilled features 
in thousands of rental stores has led to a number of bills aimed at 
limiting the availability of such cassettes to minors 
a missouri bill that becomes law on aug 28 in fact prohibits 
the rental to minors of tapes that have either a tendency to appeal 
to morbid interests or depict violence in a patently offensive way 
as judged by local community standards 
we think it has a lot to do with the meese commission said 
pam horovitz executive vice president of the video association 
referring to the president reaganappointed commission on 
pornography and violence 
we really believe that it is the fundamental responsibility of 
the parent to decide what their children can and cannot watch 
thats the only place where the decision can be made in the best 
interests of the child she said 
horovitz said some of the films that could be covered by the 
missouri bill are available to children on television or in 
theaters 
a paramount home video spokesman said the marketplace not the 
government should decide whats acceptable 
we are committed to making the highest quality motion pictures 
and television shows that audiences want said deborah rosen 
the audience should decide what they want and what they dont 
want 
we believe selfregulation is the best idea said ron 
castell senior vice president of blockbuster video the nations 
largest chain with more than 820 stores we are concerned 
however about box art as an industry we have to police ourselves 
on that 
program suppliers frequently redesign movie package art to boost 
sales a number of the socalled b titles are driven by lurid 
packaging the more graphic the cassette cover design the better 
the cassette is expected to sell 
but video retailers now find themselves under increased pressure 
to submit new art to the motion picture association of america the 
mpaa which hands out movie ratings demands that illustrations for 
mpaarated films be approved separately 
home video sales are expected to hit 10 billion this year 
this is not a hard business all you do is rent movies 
americans love movies kastell said and they have an 
insatiable demand 
a record 14000 video retailers distributors producers and 
tape manufacturers have come to the convention to check out videos 
ranging from who framed roger rabbit to balloonacy a 
howto video complete with 50 balloons and tips to create more than 
30 inflated animals

iraqi president saddam hussein called on 
iranian leaders today to sign a peace treaty to end the eghtyear 
persian gulf war halted nearly a year ago by a unbrokered 
ceasefire 
in a television message marking the anniversary of the day iraq 
accepted the un ceasefire resolution saddam said a treaty would 
guarantee both countries legitimate rights 
the ceasefire agreement should not be taken as a talisman for 
peace we are after a comprehensive total and lasting peace 
treaty he said 
today was an official iraqi holiday to mark the anniversary on 
monday night thousands of people poured into a central baghdad 
park for a fireworks display and traditional singing and dancing in 
a governmentorganized celebration 
crowds of teenagers some wearing traditional arab robes waved 
flags and portraits of saddam labeled the maker of peace and 
victory 
on aug 8 1988 un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
announced the ceasefire would take effect aug 20 following 
iraqs decision to drop a demand for direct talks before 
hostilities were suspended 
both sides accepted un security council resolution 598 
calling for immediate withdrawals to prewar borders exchange of 
prisoners formal peace talks and a panel to determine 
responsibility for the conflict that killed an estimated 1 million 
people 
unsponsored talks on a peace treaty started aug 25 in geneva 
but deadlocked immediately three further rounds of discussions 
failed to make any progress 
saddam noted in his speech that iran has made no public 
declaration of its desire for peace saying the iranian leaders 
have been far away from peace in their deeds and maybe in their 
intentions as well 
he said the no peaceno war situation with iran created 
instability and countries in the region fearing the worst will 
remain on guard against iran 
the talks stalled over iranian insistence that the next step in 
the peace process should be iraqs withdrawal from about 380 square 
miles of iranian territory it occupies 
the iraqis however say they do not recognize a 1975 treaty 
drawing part of the iraniraq border down the middle of the 
shattalarab waterway their only outlet to the sea 
baghdad maintains the border should be redrawn to include all 
the waterway as iraqi and that iraq should have the sole right to 
dredge it of mines and other war debris 
he called for an immediate start to a full exchange of nearly 
100000 prisoners of war saying its a patriotic and 
humanitarian responsibility that these prisoners should be 
repatriated without delay 
saddam added that iran should avoid cheap bargaining on the 
pow issue in order to gain leverage at the peace talks 
iraq has proposed that the pows be swapped under an agreement 
separate from the un resolution but iran says they can only be 
freed as part of an overall settlement of the conflict 
so far only 2360 ailing and disabled prisoners have been 
repatriated under exchanges arranged by the international committee 
for the red cross 
saddam said iraq has demonstrated its wish for peace by 
demobilizing about 200000 soldiers almost onequarter of its 
army and freezing its paramilitary forces 
the iraqi leader said that government projects for swift 
reconstruction of the wardamaged southern city of basra and the 
port of faw is a further sign that iraq is seeking lasting peace 
the war began in september 1980 when iraq invaded iran after 
border skirmishes

shiite moslem fundamentalist leaders 
today again rejected talks on exchanging three israeli servicemen 
and western hostages for a kidnapped moslem cleric held in israel 
their statements came amid indications that syria may be 
authorized by iran and hezbollah tehrans main ally in lebanon to 
negotiate the release of us hostage joseph cicippio and 15 others 
held in lebanon 
in iran the englishlanguage tehran times said tehran would be 
willing to use its influence in the hostage crisis if the united 
states agreed to release billions of dollars of iranian assets long 
frozen in new york banks 
they also came as as signs appeared of a rift in irans new 
leadership over the hostage issue pitting hardline interior 
minister ali akbar mohtashemi against pragmatist president hashemi 
rafsanjani 
in a statement distributed in beirut sheik sobhi tofaili a 
senior hezbollah leader said there shall be no contacts and no 
negotiations as long as sheik abdul karim obeid remains in 
captivity 
this is the partys unshakeable conviction and this is what we 
shall do tofaili said adding hezbollah is not concerned with 
the question of the hostages or the negotiations revolving around 
it 
the hostage crisis was triggered when israeli commandos 
kidnapped obeid 33 from his home in south lebanon july 28 and 
whisked him to israel 
israel has offered to trade obeid and all 450 shiite prisoners 
it holds for the three israelis and the western hostages held in 
lebanon but hezbollah insists the cleric should be unconditionally 
freed 
hezbollahs spiritual guide sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
said in a separate statement published by several beirut newspapers 
that obeids abduction left the region poised on a powder keg 
that act of piracy led to the killing of the american officer 
higgins fadlallah said referring to the announcement nine days 
ago by the underground organization of the oppressed on earth that 
it hanged us marine lt col william r higgins 
fadlallah said israels refusal to free obeid and movements of 
us warships in the eastern mediterranean after higgins death 
reminded him of tensions that preceded israels 1982 invasion of 
lebanon 
i do not rule out the possibility of a largescale military 
operation by israel to get itself off the hook in this crisis which 
it created fadlallah said 
but the independent newspaper annahar said today there were 
indications syria and iran would coordinate and intensify efforts 
to resolve the hostage issue and defuse the crisis 
this is expected to take its final shape when iranian foreign 
minister ali akbar velayati arrives in syria soon for talks with 
president hafez assads government annahar said in a report 
from its damascus correspondent 
syria was irans main ally in the 8year gulf war against iraq 
which ended in a unsponsored ceasefire last august 
annida the organ of the promoscow lebanese communist party 
quoted unnamed travelers from the syrian capital as saying the 
government may have been authorized by iran and hezbollah to 
negotiate the release of the western hostages it did not 
elaborate 
higgins who commanded the un peacekeeping force was 
kidnapped near tyre in south lebanon on feb 17 1988 
longest held of the us hostages is terry a anderson chief ap 
middle east correspondent he was kidnapped nearly 4 years ago 
president bush on monday paid tribute to higgins during a 
ceremony at ft myer va to celebrate the 200th anniversary of 
the war department forerunner of the department of defense 
in an emotionfilled voice bush said we cannot leave here 
today without pausing to salute one who stands as the symbol of the 
courage that burns in the breast of every american in uniform one 
marine who has been very much in our thoughts lt col higgins 
william richard higgins 
the videotape released last week in beirut depicted a bound and 
gagged man hanging from a rope around his neck 
israeli government officials have said their sources indicated 
higgins had been killed some time ago higgins was the target of 
past death threats by the terrorists who called him a spy 
annahar said syria was among countries requested by bush to 
intervene after another extremist group threatened to kill cicippio 
in retaliation for obeids abduction 
cicippio 58 was kidnapped sept 12 1986 from the american 
university of beirut where he worked as acting comptroller 
the revolutionary justice organization which claims to be 
holding cicippio has asked syria to negotiate its offer through 
international organizations 
damascus has made no public response and israel rejected the 
offer 
syria is lebanons main power broker with 40000 troops 
stationed there under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate they 
control hezbollahs strongholds in beiruts southern slums and east 
lebanons bekaa valley 
the tehran times quoted a source close to rafsanjani as saying 
the first step should be taken by the us and if tehran gets 
satisfied that its assets will certainly be unfrozen then the 
second step will definitely come from iran 
washington froze more than 2 billion in iranian assets after it 
broke diplomatic relations with tehran over the seizure of the us 
embassy there in 1979 
rafsanjani offered last week to help washington resolve the 
hostage problem 
but mohtashemi appeared to challenge him in a speech sunday 
night at the grave of the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini his 
speech broadcast monday by tehran radio said there are many 
hezbollah cells around the world created by the holy breath of the 
imam khomeini that cry death to the superpowers

housing and urban development secretary jack 
kemp pledged today to get the republican influence peddlers out 
of his troubled department and work for imrpoved opportunities for 
poor people to own their own homes 
kemp addressed the annual conference of the national urban 
league a day after the civil rights organization issued a report 
saying that at the present rate of progress it would take black 
americans 1163 years to catch up with whites in home ownership 
before kemp spoke delegates observed a moment of silence to 
express concern for rep mickey leland dtexas a member of the 
congressional black caucus missing on an airplane flight in africa 
it is typical of mickey that if a plane were missing and 
mickey was on it it would be on its way to northern africa to help 
the poor and those who have been left out kemp said 
turning to the investigations of questionable practices and 
insider profiteering during the reagan administration in the 
department he now heads kemp said were going to take the 
greedy and the consultants and the republican influence peddlers 
out of hud 
i dont want it to work for the democratic national committee 
it shouldnt work for the republican national committee its got 
to work for the people he said 
we want to take publicly assisted housing and publicly owned 
housing and if its possible and if theres some sweat equity 
involved and if people can homestead in this century as we should 
have done more of in the last century we should give people a 
chance to own a home kemp said 
we are going to do our very best to end the disgrace of 
redlining refusal of lenders to provide mortgages in certain 
areas in america to make sure that seed capital is flowing into 
lowincome housing and lowincome commmunities he said 
in its report monday on the economic status of blacks the urban 
league called for new efforts to overhaul the stalled engine of 
racial progress 
the impressive longterm progress of africanamericans has in 
more recent years stalled and in some cases even reversed it 
said 
blacks are gaining on whites so slowly in employment and 
economic development that there appears little chance they will 
catch up before the middle of the next century said the report by 
the leagues research department 
there is a commanding need to overhaul the stalled engine of 
racial progress it said 
one of the bleakest parts of the report was on housing where 
the researchers reported that the black home ownership rate 
increased only from 646 percent of the 1970 rate for whites to 
651 percent in 1985 a gain of half a percentage point in 15 
years 
as a result the report said it would take until the year 3152 
for blacks to catch up with whites 
the impact of legal discrimination was perhaps most 
dramatically manifest in the residential separation of the races 
the report said institutional racism as revealed in the racist 
policies and practices of mortgage lenders housing developers and 
real estate agents has been equally consequential 
combined with the aversion whites have exhibited toward living 
in areas in which africanamericans exceed or might exceed a 
certain number these factors have generated and sustained telling 
levels of residential segregation it said 
in education and health the prospects are a little better said 
the report 
but in some economic and health areas including infant 
mortality the researchers said gains are being made so slowly that 
they are unable to estimate when parity might be reached 
by contrast the number of blacks completing high school 
compared with whites increased so dramatically from 55 percent in 
1967 to 79 percent in 1985 that the league estimated parity should 
be reached in 16 years 
the report said 437 percent as many whites as blacks were 
unemployed in 1985 compared with 459 percent in 1967 
major initiatives are necessary if this trend is to be 
checked the league said 
the report estimated it would take 54 years for blacks to reach 
parity with whites in managerial and professional occupations 73 
years in median earnings for fulltime workers and an undetermined 
amount of time in family income 
it estimated it will be 159 years if present trends continue 
before black poverty rates shrink to equal those of whites 
one area where blacks lost ground was in earnings of their 
businesses as a share of the earnings of all american companies 
in 1972 this figure was nearly 20 percent in 1982 it had shrunk 
to less than 7 percent 
the report estimated it will take 55 years for black college 
enrollment to reach parity with white enrollment 40 years for life 
expectancy three years for voter registration and nine years for 
voting rates in congressional elections 
in its bleak report on infant mortality it said the white rate 
as a percentage of the black rate has declined from 546 percent 
in 1970 to just over 51 percent in 1985

fire early today destroyed a rooming house 
whose landlord had been cited for failing to install sprinklers 
killing at least three people injuring 11 and leaving 13 
unaccounted for authorities said 
several people escaped the 1230 am blaze in the fourstory 
brick tenement by jumping onto lower roofs others lowered 
themselves on ropes that tenants said had been supplied in rooms in 
place of a fire escape 
it was not immediately clear whether local ordinances required 
fire escapes 
one victim was believed to have been shinnying down a rope when 
he fell to the street authorities said police said two more 
bodies were spotted in the ruins firefighters awaited the arrival 
of a crane to clear the debris

allard was at the scene this morning and refused to answer 
reporters questions 
the cause of the fire was under investigation 
people were jumping out of windows hanging on mattresses and 
climbing on ropes that knotted up and never reached bottom 
numberg said

street when the rope in his room proved too short to reach from the 
window to the ground louis clough 43 another tenant said ropes 
were a fixture in some rooms

soviets dont have much to laugh about these days 
but american comedian billy crystal had them in stitches with 
slapstick and standup routines poking fun at long lines and 
superpower politics 
i was raised thinking you were the enemy you were raised 
thinking i was the enemy crystal told an invitationonly 
audience of 600 people about half foreigners and half soviets 
we were both wrong its the french 
the 41yearold native new yorker whose grandmother emigrated 
from russia brought his irreverent humor to the communist 
heartland to tape on location midnight train to moscow for 
broadcast in october on home box office 
he spent a few days taping skits for the special around town 
then put on a 50minute show monday night at moscows pushkin 
theater 
with staples such as meat sugar and toothpaste in short supply 
and ethnic violence strikes and crime on the rise soviets need 
some comic relief a few at least got it from crystal 
a soviet woman who spoke english said she had never heard of him 
but decided to attend the show because we need positive 
emotions she roared throughout but admitted afterward the 
dialogue was hard to understand 
in an interview on red square crystal agreed comedy was sorely 
needed in the soviet union 
here there is a desperate need to be more open and have more 
fun he said 
the comedian known for his imitations of sammy davis jr and 
other celebrities studied with a language coach and opened his 
show with a few minutes in russian 
i wanted to perform in the us embassy because it has the 
best microphones he said referring to the new office building 
the americans say they cant occupy because of kgb bugs 
during the rest of the show crystal did his best to help the 
soviets bridge the language gap and was most successful with 
slapstick and mime his impersonation of jack nicholson reciting a 
russian tonguetwister was a big hit with soviets who are familiar 
with nicholsons softspoken manner from movies available on 
bootleg videotapes 
crystal wearing a gray shirt and white pants that stood out 
against a huge red backdrop of a man and woman holding a hammer and 
sickle also portrayed charlie chaplin scrounging for food in 
moscow when he got some it tasted terrible 
about a dozen of his relatives in the soviet union attended 
mondays show one called crystals comedy a new genre for us 
but very interesting 
in an interview crystal said he had a tough time preparing for 
the special because theres no place to break the show in like 
impravda or catch a rising tsar the improv and catch a rising 
star are comedy clubs in the united states 
standing outside lenins mausoleum on red square crystal 
compared the resting place of the founder of the soviet state to 
graceland the home of the late elvis presley that has become a 
shrine for fans 
crystal who first visited the soviet union in april was asked 
if he had any advice for tourists if you bring laxatives its a 
great place to be he quipped 
the funniest thing he saw during his visit he said was the 
shower curtain in his hotel room its this big he said 
making a tiny square with his hands

the goodyear tire company 
tuesday threatened to fire 1200 striking black workers as strikes 
and lockouts crippled south africas motor vehicle industry 
in all 13000 members of the national union of metalworkers of 
south africa at four automobile plants and two vehicle component 
factories are not working due to strikes or lockouts industry 
officials say the closed plants produce about twothirds of south 
africas motor vehicles 
about 5000 workers are on strike at volkswagens plant in 
uitenhage about 3600 workers from the toyota plant near durban 
have been locked out and fired and about 3000 workers are on 
strike at two plants of the south african motor corp which 
produces fords and mazdas 
on monday britishowned eveready locked out 800 workers at its 
uitenhage plant because of a wage dispute goodyear followed suit 
on tuesday saying the 1200 workers who have been on strike for 
five weeks at its factory in port elizabeth would be fired unless 
they signed an undertaking by friday that they would accept 
employment conditions proposed by the south african management in 
the wake of disinvestment by the us parent company 
the strikes against the three auto manufacturers which began 
last week are linked to the unions ongoing efforts to negotiate a 
wage agreement on a nationwide basis with all major auto companies 
toyota has been the most adamant in resisting such negotiations 
and says its dismissed workers will lose all chance to reclaim 
their jobs unless they reapply by monday 
auto manufacturers not yet affected by the current wave of labor 
disputes include nissan bmw and mercedesbenz

poor visibility hampered rescuers 
searching today for a plane carrying texas rep mickey leland and 
13 other people that vanished en route to a refugee camp near the 
sudanese border 
heavy cloud cover made an aerial search of more than 400 miles 
of rugged terrain from this capital to lelands destination in 
southwestern ethiopia nearly impossible said robert houdek charge 
daffairs at the us embassy 
at a briefing in washington lelands press secretary alma 
newsom said president bush had telephoned lelands wife in houston 
to express his concern and assure her the us government had 
offered full assistance to ethiopia 
she said secretary of state james a baker iii also had called 
mrs leland 
at this point no news is good news said ms newsom who 
recalled being on similar trips with the congressman in the past 
where air travel and communications were disrupted 
houdek said interior ministry officials in contact with police 
and communications points along lelands flight path reported a 
small plane was sighted monday circling a field at dembidolo about 
75 miles from the fugnido refugee camp where the houston democrat 
group was bound 
if it was our plane what we find encouraging is that it would 
have transversed a lot of the more treacherous terrain to 
fugnido houdek said the plane circled but the pilot 
obviously felt that he didnt want to put down at that time 
houdek said dembidolo was in an inaccessible region far from any 
communication points which could provide a benign explanation 
for why we havent heard anything 
but he said the region contained several fields suitable for 
landing that were cleared by the government to airlift food to 
people during the 198485 famine that ravaged much of ethiopia 
light aircraft that left early today to search for leland and 
his party were concentrating their efforts in the dembidolo area 
said houdek however a dense cloud cover and poor visibility was 
hampering their efforts he said 
the missing twin otter plane that leland was traveling in is 
commonly used for bush flying officials with ethiopias civil 
aviation authority coordinating the search said a c130 hercules 
cargo plane was standing by to help in case of an emergency 
us embassy official john guerra said the pilots were following 
the general route the plane would have taken to the fugnido camp 
480 miles southwest of addis ababa 
planes must fly over rough terrain to reach the camp but the 
aircraft would not pass over the area where rebels are battling 
ethiopias government ethiopias separatist movements are based in 
the northern part of the country in the horn of africa 
the missing plane which also carried eight other americans 
including staff members and us embassy personnel was last heard 
from monday morning about 15 minutes after leaving ethiopias bole 
airport in addis ababa guerra said 
it was about 25 miles outside of addis at the time said 
guerra that was the last contact we had 
five ethiopians including three government officials the pilot 
and copilot also were aboard the airplane owned by ethiopias 
relief and rehabilitation commission the government relief agency 
the plane was due back in addis ababa at 5 pm monday 
guerra said lelands departure for fugnido monday had been 
delayed for two hours because of bad weather in addis ababa and it 
was possible the plane was diverted to a remote field or landing 
strip 
we are not discounting the possibility they put down 
someplace said guerra a political and economics officer it 
is very possible because of the nature of the weather 
communications in ethiopia one of the worlds poorest 
countries are minimal outside of the capital and the flight to 
the camp is over rough terrain 
the fugnido camp is run by the un high commissioner for 
refugees and is one of four camps in the region that are home to 
more than 300000 refugees who have fled civil war in neighboring 
sudan 
leland is chairman of the house of representatives select 
committee on hunger he has taken a keen interest in africas 
refugees and visited the same area in march officials said 
leland arrived in ethiopia early monday and was expected to 
spend two to three days in the east african nation after visiting 
fugnido he had been scheduled to meet government officials and 
visit gondar the home of about 10000 falasha jews in northwestern 
ethiopia

firefighters in california contained two large blazes and dozens 
of idaho residents returned home today a week after fires forced 
them out but a red flag went up for the third straight day 
warning of lightning strikes 
spotter planes cruised over western forests in a search for 
lightningsparked fires after thousands of storm bolts struck the 
region fire bosses said they saw no immediate evidence of a new 
round of major blazes 
the next two days should tell said ron smith spokesman for 
the boise interagency fire center the federal fire command post 
there have been some strikes but it takes time until well spot 
whether theyve touched off new fires 
fire center officials today posted a redflag warning of dry 
thunderstorms and gusting wind 
about 23000 firefighters on monday fought the worst of blazes 
on 182000 acres primarily in idaho oregon and california 
according to the fire center 
the fire battles have cost more than 27 million with the bill 
rising sharply each day the center said more than 220000 acres 
have been charred in a bout of mostly lightningcaused fires that 
began july 26 
in idaho the most heavily burned state more than 9000 people 
were committed to extinguishing to the blazes including a 
43000acre series of fires that destroyed a small resort town 70 
miles northeast of boise 
early today dozens of residents who fled their homes more than 
a week ago because of those fires were allowed back on the 
condition they be prepared to leave immediately again boise 
national forest spokesman rick perkins said 
a big wind could change the picture real fast he said 
about 25 people in the long creek summer home area remained 
evacuated because of the fire danger 
nearly 5000 firefighters in southern and central california 
contained two blazes that blackened thousands of acres of forest 
and wilderness for more than a week 
firefighters were mopping up a 7550acre fire in the sierra 
foothills east of fresno and a 15300acre blaze in the cleveland 
national forest east of san diego which was ignited by a target 
shooters bullet nine days ago it torched a house and trailer and 
neared the historic mount palomar observatory earlier in the week 
lightning struck about 700 times monday in six western states 
most of the new fires were small the largest had burned five to 
seven acres in the ochoco national forest in central oregon 
hundreds of federal troops moved through the boise fire center 
for training and eventual deployment but land managers continued 
pressing for more manpower 
before the lightning firefighters in oregon and idaho had 
consolidated gains made during cool weather last week and predicted 
that many of the 100 fires that had burned nearly 89000 acres 
would be contained by midweek 
airplanes sent over national forests monday in washington to 
look for smoke found dozens of lightningcaused fires most of 
which were quickly contained 
near coalville utah about 45 miles east of salt lake city 
firefighters finished digging a circle around a 1700acre blaze 
and authorities hoped to bring it under control tonight 
in northwestern nebraska a fir that blackened 3000 acres of 
brush and timber in canyon country near belmont was largely 
contained

immigration officials say they are just 
following guidelines in trying to deport the children of two 
mexican nationals who have worked in the united states for years 
and may receive amnesty 
the children aged 10 and 11 have no place to go if they are 
sent back to mexico because their grandmother with whom they used 
to stay has moved across the border to yuma relatives say 
ruth anne myers district director the immigration and 
naturalization service said one parent can also return to mexico 
if deportation is ordered 
the family says it wont split up even if it means both parents 
have to return to mexico and forfeit their chance at legalization 
enrique garciaguiverra and francesca guadarramafuentes hold 
insapproved jobs in tucson and are waiting for decision on whether 
they worked in the fields for long enough to qualify for the 
amnesty program that was signed into law in november 1986 
their children israel and francisco javier garciaguadarrrama 
lived with their grandmother in san luis rio colorado at first but 
joined them in the united states in june 1987 
in january when the family was stopped near yuma problems 
arose 
border patrol officers tried to deport the children on the spot 
but agreed to permit a hearing after the parents protested 
according to lawyers 
the parents then turned to southern arizona legal aid and legal 
aid lawyers asked ins to grant the children an exemption under a 
family fairness program designed to keep families together 
but ins officials said the children did not qualify because they 
werent in the united states before november 1986 instead they 
asked a hearing officer for immediate deportation 
the november 1986 cutoff is arbitrary legal aid attorney nadine 
wettstein said they have to draw a line someplace and it just 
happens that its on top of these kids heads she says 
these were guidelines that came from washington ms myers 
said it was a national policy that was accepted or adopted by 
the commissioner of naturalization and immigration 
the parents entered the country illegally in the first place 
and even if they can now benefit from amnesty theres no reason to 
extend that benefit to the children ms myers added 
weve always worked hard garciaguiverra said monday with 
ms wettstein as translator from spanish were not a problem for 
the government 
although ins is pressing for a decision from the hearing 
officer ms myers said monday it might be willing to hold off on 
deportation even if the hearing officer authorizes it 
that type of discretionary authority is there she says 
the statement comes as a surprise to ms wettstein who says ins 
has already refused several proposals to put the issue on hold

a storm during a packed prayer service at 
a 10000seat amphitheater pelted participants with hail and cold 
rain and sent people scrambling for cover at least 130 people were 
taken to hospitals 
two of the injured were taken to a coronary intensive care unit 
while the rest were treated and released monday night said pat 
conroy medical coordinator for the fiveday lutheran national 
youth conference 
most were treated for dizziness and hypothermia or low body 
temperature from getting soaked by the rain which dropped the 
temperature 20 degrees to about 45 
about 9000 teenagers from across the united states were 
participating in the service dubbed fire power when the storm 
broke said gary lane denver director of parks and arenas the 
arena is in a park belonging to the city of denver but is outside 
the city limits 
when you have youths dressed in tshirts and shorts and a 
storm can kick up and drop temperatures 20 degrees you get some 
borderline hypothermia cases lane said 
four helicopters and 35 ambulances were brought in to treat the 
crowd 
the crowd had to leave the amphitheater and there was some 
panic as people were leaving some suffered hyperventilation and 
some had hypothermia as they were getting wet said carolyn 
etter a parks department director 
etter said lee gilling superintendent of denvers mountain 
parks system went to investigate as far as lee can tell there 
was no functional problem with the amphitheater but a storm and 
crowd problem she said

attributed much of the panic to altitude sickness red rocks the 
denver park where the amphitheater is situated is at 6400 feet 
lane said 
as it started to rain there was no covering so people went 
to the wall for cover wagner said the people never had time 
to get rested from the long walk up to red rocks

north korea stepped up demands tuesday 
for the united nations to let a south korean student who visited 
the communist nation return home via the border at panmunjom 
the united states accused north korea of increasing tensions by 
turning the truce village of panmunjom into a political carnval 
with groups from north korea shouting yankee go home and 
making obscene gestures at us guards 
officials in seoul said the communist government in pyongyang 
sent two telephone messages to the south korean government tuesday 
asking for meetings at panmunjom to discuss the return of 
20yearold radical student im sukyong 
south korea which has said it will arrest ms im when she 
returns did not reply immediately 
at the 450th meeting of the military armistice commission held 
tuesday in panmunjom north korea demanded the usled united 
nations command reconsider its refusal to allow ms im to cross the 
border 
maj gen choe ui ung the chief north korean delegate said it 
was quite natural and proper for ms im to return home through 
the border and there is no need for her to make the long way 
around and travel through third countries 
us rear adm larry g vogt leader of the un delegation 
responded that ms ims crossing concerns the two koreas and is 
not armistice business 
vogt said north korea has used ms im and her supporters to 
create a political carnival at the border with demonstrations 
banners and protesters shouting yankee go home 
he said groups visiting the north korean side of the 
demilitarized zone around panmunjom in july shouted slogans and 
swore at and made obscene gestures toward those on the other side 
of the border 
choe said even the us youths and other americans who 
visited panmunjom shouted with indignation towards your gis why 
have the americans came to anothers country to serve as watchmen 
of division 
observers said the demonstrations often included ms im and 
foreigners attending the 13th world festival of youth and students 
july 18 in pyongyang 
the student has said she will cross the border on aug 15 the 
anniversary of koreas liberation from japanese colonial rule in 
1945 in a demonstration for unification of the countries divided 
after world war ii seoul says her illegal visit is a breach of 
national security 
ms im has become a celebrity in pyongyang according to north 
korean military observer lt col yun ki oon he told the meeting 
she is called the flower of unification and is mobbed wherever 
she goes 
north koreas central news agency monitored in tokyo said ms

a group of pirates who stormed a 
boat carrying 84 vietnamese stole valuables raped women and sunk 
the vessel and 71 of the refugees were feared dead officials said 
tuesday 
the attack brought to 271 the number of boat people missing and 
believed dead as a result of piracy off the coast of this southeast 
asian country this year un and malaysian officials said 
the officials quoting the 13 survivors of the latest attack 
said the refugees left vietnam last week they were off the kuala 
trengganu coast 180 miles northeast of kuala lumpur when they 
were attacked saturday night by pirates in two boats 
the pirates took their valuables raped some of the women sank 
the refugees boat and fled the officials said 
the officials did not say how the attackers were armed 
in the past refugee officials have blamed most such attacks on 
thai pirates 
three survivors of the attack were rescued by oil rig workers 
sunday in the south china sea and fishermen picked up the other 10 
refugee officials said the survivors were being put into a 
refugee camp to await screening for settlement in the united states 
or elsewhere 
in one of the worst such attacks in recent years a vietnamese 
refugee boat with 130 people aboard was stormed by thai pirates 
april 16 one refugee survived but the rest are believed dead 
officials say this years death could actually be much higher 
than 271 because some attacks leave no survivors and go unreported 
the refugee officials say they believe most of the pirates were 
thais 
about 23000 vietnamese refugees live in malaysian camps 
malaysia accepts them only for temporary stay before permanent 
settlement elsewhere

first irans new president offered to 
help solve the hostage crisis then the interior minister renewed 
threats against the united states on tuesday a tehran newspaper 
was offering help again 
the events seem to be part of a tug of war between president 
hashemi rafsanjani and his followers called pragmatic by some and 
opportunist by others and the hardliners of interior minister 
ali akbar mohtashemi for control of iran following the death in 
june of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
rafsanjani made the offer of help in his inaugural speech last 
week on monday mohtashemi urged shiite moslems around the world 
to continue fighting the united states which iran cals the great 
satan 
on tuesday the englishlanguage tehran times quoted a source it 
did not identify as saying iran would definitely intercede to 
gain the release of the hostages if washington gave assurances it 
would release frozen iranian assets 
rafsanjani allied with spiritual leader ali khamenei is known 
to seek better ties with the west in the effort to rebuild iran 
after eight years of war with iraq he appears to see freeing the 
hostages as a first step to good relations 
mohtashemis faction including premier hussein musavi and ahmad 
khomeini son of the revolutionary patriarch wants the revolution 
to keep its confrontational edge 
for hardliners diplomatic reliations mean compromise with the 
enemy many radical shiite moslems in lebanon agree with them 
sixteen western hostages are held in lebanon most by shiite 
groups sponsored by iran eight are americans 
about 2 billion in assets including military equipment ordered 
before the revolution were frozen after the us embassy in tehran 
was stormed in february 1979 by militant students who held 52 
americans hostage for 444 days iran claims the assets now are 
worth 12 billion 
according to the source quoted in the tehran times us 
assurances that the assets will be released should be concrete 
and there should be convincing grounds that these proposals will be 
translated into action excerpts of the report were carried by 
the official islamic republic news agency 
repeating irans frequently stated position the source said 
its a wellknown fact that we do not have any direct or indirect 
hand in hostagetaking of course we have spiritual influence in 
lebanon which we can use in our efforts for the release of the 
hostages there 
mohammad javad larijani former deputy foreign minister and a 
rafsanjani ally was quoted in a dispatch from the news agency as 
saying it would be a great achievement for the world of islam 
if iran could secure the release of the hostages 
it will make it clear that iran has always been working for 
the benefit of humanity irna quoted him as saying 
larijani had helped improve diplomatic relations with the west 
but resigned earlier this year when a struggle over the issue began 
in the leadership 
in an editorial tuesday the tehran times called the united 
states an oppresser for freezing the assets and said relations 
between the two countries would be like that of lamb and wolf 
it added however as the officials of the islamic republic 
have said repeatedly the doors are not completely closed and the 
right intentions and thoughts can help resolve the problems

a homeless man accused of not paying 651 
for a meal he had eaten was mistakenly held in jail for 87 days 
after the complaint filed against him was dismissed authorities 
say 
robert j mandt apparently wanted to stay in the waukesha county 
jail to get three meals a day and a roof over his head his 
attorney bradley j bloch said monday 
records showed mandt was held for 48 days on a misdemeanor 
charge of defrauding a restaurant keeper in a march 18 incident 
the charge was dismissed may 5 but officials did not realize 
that until july 29 mandt was taken to a milwaukee intersection and 
released two days later at his request jail administrator william 
h conine said 
the charge was dismissed because of the feeling the defendant 
had been freeloading on the system and already had served enough 
time for the offense said assistant district attorney timothy 
westphal 
its very unfortunate that he was able to manipulate the 
system through a snafu when the paperwork never came through

a sharp earthquake shook the san francisco 
bay area for 10 seconds early today breaking glass causing rock 
slides and apparently prompting a man to jump to his death from a 
fifthstory window authorities said 
the quake measuring 51 on the richter scale occurred at 113 
am and was centered on the san andreas fault about 13 miles south 
of san jose said the us geological survey it was felt as far as 
san luis obispo 230 miles south of here 
no major damage was reported 
the quake struck as state and federal emergency officials were 
about to begin a twoday test of earthquake communications 
procedures the drill involved a mock earthquake in the bay area in 
which 5000 people die 
it felt like i was having my bed rolled around on a 
skateboard i woke up and i was moving said henry j peterson of 
santa clara next to san jose 
two aftershocks measuring 42 and 45 rippled through the area 
later this morning state officials warned there could be more 
quakes in northern california in the next five days with a quake 
up to 62 possible but not likely 
in los gatos 50 miles south of san francisco a 19yearold man 
was apparently startled awake by the earthquake and jumped out of 
his bedroom window police dispatcher lisa douglas said in a 
statement 
the shaking sent rocks tumbling onto highways said a santa cruz 
county sheriffs department emergency dispatcher who declined to 
give her name they cleared the debris by hand and all roads are 
now cleared she said 
there was some damage in the santa cruz mountains said san 
jose police officer jay forbes it was mainly broken windows and 
mirrors nothing serious 
the false ceiling in a vacant los gatos business came down and 
half a dozen businesses reported broken windows police said 
i felt a little rumble and then all the windows started 
shaking real bad said chris soliday a clerk at an allnight 
convenience store in sunnyvale some stuff in the aisles fell 
down theres broken glass dented cans some beer bottles broken 
the epicenter was in almost exactly the same place as a 50 
quake on june 27 1988 said usgs geophysicist dave oppenheimer 
residents shaken awake by the temblor described it as jolting 
and rolling 
it was the strongest ive ever felt said bernie beck 38 
who lives in san franciscos haightashbury district 
i live in an old building that was built after the 1906 quake 
and it really had me going beck said it felt like you were 
sitting on a saw horse rocking back and forth 
san franciscos great quake which occurred in 1906 before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 recent 
estimates say more than 2000 people died in the quake and the fire 
it touched off which burned much of the city 
the openended richter scale is a measure of the energy released 
by an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a 
seisomograph 
each increase of one number as in a jump from magnitude 55 to 
65 means that the ground motion is 10 times greater a quake of 
35 can cause slight damage in populated areas while a quake of 
60 can cause severe damage in march 1964 an earthquake in alaska 
hit 85 on the richter scale killing 114 people

rep mickey leland who earned a reputation in 
the state legislature as a blackpower firebrand in the early 
1970s made his mark in congress as a liberal globetrotting 
advocate for the hungry and downtrodden 
the 44yearold houston democrat who serves as chairman of a 
select house select committee on hunger was aboard a plane 
reported missing in ethiopia today during a tour of refugee camps 
near the border with sudan 
a lubbock native who attended houston public schools leland 
graduated from texas southern university with a pharmacy degree and 
was an instructor of pharmacy at tsu and a practicing pharmacist 
before winning a texas house seat in 1972 
the lawmaker entered the legislature from a povertystricken 
section of houston as a civil rights activist with a militant 
reputation he wore a big afro a leather shoulder bag african 
print shirts and highheeled boots 
as his career grew his attire during the early years of his 
three terms in the legislature gave way to business suits and he 
has since shared a fashionable home in an upscale houston 
neighborhood with his wife alison and son jarrett who was 
baptized by south africas bishop desmond tutu 
his political style also has moderated somewhat since his 
election to the us house in 1978 he replaced the retiring 
democratic rep barbara jordan 
representing an innercity district he faced no republican 
opposition and defeated a socialist workers party candidate with 
more than 96 percent of the vote 
leland won reelection five times with ease but drew a harsh 
1988 primary challenge from elizabeth spates who charged that 
leland had lost touch with constituents while seeking national 
exposure as spokesman for the hungry and homeless 
leland won the primary with 82 percent of the vote but 
acknowledged some truth in ms spates allegation 
theres people ive not touched in a long time this has been 
a great exercise for me leland said i feel very confident 
that my community is very solidly behind me now before there was 
some question i have been on the road quite a bit i have been 
going abroad 
in an article for the houston chronicle earlier this year rep 
henry j hyde of illinois the ranking republican on the house 
select committee on intelligence said lelands personal 
diplomacy with ethiopian and sudanese officials opened up 
lifesustaining corridors in the border region between the two 
countries a peaceful relief supply route 
leland who also serves on the house committee on energy and 
commerce and the committee on post office and civil service and was 
twice chairman of the congressional black caucus often has thrust 
himself into the position of mediator in matters of international 
or interracial consequence 
for 10 years he has overseen a program in which black youths 
from his district were sent to israel for sixweek stays he was 
honored in april by the union of american hebrew congregations for 
his work in uniting blacks and jews 
he is one of several congressmen investigating colonias along 
the mexican border where thousands live in communities witout 
running water electricity and sewage systems 
he joined two other congressmen last october in a trip to cuba 
in an effort to negotiate the release of five political prisoners 
and their families the delegation got three prisoners freed a 
fourth decided to remain in cuba 
the rev jesse jackson who chose leland as one of the top four 
fundraisers in his 1988 presidential campaign praised the 
consistent streak of humanity in mickey leland during an 
election year trip to houston 
his name has often been circulated as a possible mayoral 
candidate in houston although he has indicated greater interest in 
a us senate race 
despite his political roots leland has maintained a close 
relationship with the business establishment in downtown houston 
which is in his district he said in a 1988 interview that success 
has not changed his views 
i certainly dont apologize for making myself better leland 
said but he added it would be a profound contradiction if i was 
getting rich and forgetting my constituents

up to 14 million american families are 
living on the knife edge of homelessness and may be forced onto 
the streets by a mild recession a private study concluded tuesday 
the report by the american affordable housing institute said 
that public efforts to help the homeless rely too little on 
prevention are badly underfinanced and uncoordinated and are 
conducted by officials often unaware of the resources available to 
them 
people are falling through americas too loosely meshed safety 
net david c schwartz director of the institute said at a news 
conference people arent getting the services governments say 
they want to provide 
the report by the institute a research center at rutgers 
university in new brunswick nj estimated that there are 4 
million to 14 million american families living on the knife edge 
of homelessness who could face life on the streets should a mild 
recession occur 
they are one pay check one domestic argument from the 
streets the report said in a mild recession homelessness in 
america is likely to double and triple almost overnight 
estimates on the current number of homeless people range between 
655000 to 4 million but the total is growing 20 percent to 40 
percent annually the study said 
the main federal program for the homeless is the stewart 
mckinney homeless assistance act a 1987 law named for the late 
connecticut republican congressman who was active on homelessness 
issues 
the legislation gave the government authority to spend up to 3 
billion over five years for programs for the homeless but through 
this year congress has actually provided only 11 billion 
the report said the laws broad range of programs covering 
temporary and permanent housing drug counseling health care and 
educational services are the right steps to take but it complained 
that the legislation is not even an effective national treatment 
for homelessness for it is still seriously underfunded 
besides studying federal efforts the report surveyed state 
homelessness efforts 
plans submitted by each state indicate in many instances a 
lack of coordination capacity and compassion in addressing the 
needs of their homeless populations it said 
the study singled out new jersey pennsylvania massachusetts 
maryland st louis new york city and allegheny county pa for 
for having programs that effectively help some people avoid living 
on the streets

lawmakers in the republic of estonia on tuesday 
tightened residency requirements for voting and running for office 
in a move to stem the influence of russians 
ina tamet an editor at official estonian radio in tallinn said 
the baltic republics supreme soviet approved the law by a 19436 
margin 
russians make up about a third of the republics 16 million 
people and some russian workers went on strike for several days in 
july to protest the legislation 
ms tamet said there were reports the russian workers would 
strike again after the law was approved but estonian journalists 
had no firm information that a strike would follow 
the law requires that residents live in one place for two years 
or in estonia for five years before they be permitted to vote it 
requires candidates for local offices to live in one place for five 
years or if theyve moved within estonia to be residents of the 
republic for 10 years before they may run ms tamet said 
despite the dispute over provisions of the law she said the 
legislative debate was relatively quiet 
estonians who are at the forefront of the three baltic 
republics drive for greater local control over the economy and 
political system say they are being overrun by russians and other 
soviet ethnic groups imported to work in the republics factories 
ethnic estonians are more stable and therefore would gain from 
the new election law 
in july the national legislature also gave estonia and the two 
other baltic republics lithuania and latvia the goahead to begin 
wideranging economic reforms including the possibility of 
creating their own currencies 
economic reformers say that is essential to help them reform the 
price structure they view the rigid soviet system of statecontrol 
prices as one of the biggest handicaps they must overcome

witchcraft is a legitimate religion and 
its churches or covens are entitled to the same tax breaks as 
those of more established religions the state division of taxation 
has ruled 
with this ruling we witches will definitely be able to come 
out of the closet and take our place in society said joyce 
siegrist 45 high priestess of rosegate coven she said the coven 
has a core group of 11 members and 30 to 40 initiates 
the ruling announced today by tax administrator r gary clark 
overturned an earlier decision that said the coven did not meet 
criteria for being a church 
the coven also known as our lady of the roses wiccan church 
will no longer have to pay state sales tax for supplies 
this decision demonstrates that with a properly presented 
case even unusual or small religious groups can be treated equally 
with more mainstream religions by the state said a gregory 
frazier an american civil liberties union lawyer who announced the 
decision he represented the witches in an administrative hearing 
in may 
hearing officer sandra j murphy who recommended that clark 
grant the exemption ruled july 20 that the coven fulfilled most of 
the state supreme courts criteria for determining the legitimacy 
of a religion 
the wiccans are a nonprofit group not set up for the purpose of 
avoiding taxes and have a litany or system of prayer as well as 
specific doctrines and practices that all members of the coven were 
expected to follow murphy ruled 
last fall when the tax exemption was denied the divisions 
questions indicated that officials were focusing on the apparent 
lack of formal theology schools for training wiccan clergy and 
also on their willingness to allow members to belong to other 
churches frazier said 
the latter argument was rebutted when the rev thomas ahlburn 
senior minister of the first unitarian church of providence 
testified that his church and many eastern religions also permit 
their members to belong to other faiths frazier said

move over teenagers drivers ed isnt 
just for kids any more 
drivers aged 55 and over who took a refresher course had fewer 
traffic convictions and serious accidents than did their cohorts 
who didnt return to the classroom according to a california study 
released tuesday 
the american association of retired persons said the study is 
evidence that proper training can help older people remain safe 
drivers longer 
to lose the ability to drive often traps older people in their 
homes said aarp presidentelect robert maxwell for older 
americans driving a car is more than just transportation it means 
independence and dignity 
drivers over age 65 are second only to those age 15 to 24 in 
traffic accidents and when the number of miles driven is taken 
into account the two groups are almost equal 
the department of transportation says the verdict isnt in yet 
on whether refresher courses actually change driver performance for 
older americans 
but james hedlund of the national highway traffic safety 
administration said the california study certainly gives us more 
positive information than we had before 
the study compared driving records for 40339 graduates of 
californias eighthour mature driver improvement program with 
those of 75064 older drivers who did not take the course all were 
aged 55 or above with ages ranging into the 80s 
factoring out differences between the two groups in gender 
prior driving record age and area of residence the graduates had 
16 percent fewer accidents involving death or injury and 157 
percent fewer traffic convictions 
the report cautioned that drivers who signed up for the 
voluntary training were a highly selfselected group who would be 
expected to have lower subsequent accident rates 
neverthless it said there was suggestive evidence that the 
courses were responsible for at least some of the reduction in 
accident risk 
we feel the results are quite suggestive and promising said 
ray peck director of research for the california department of 
motor vehicles 
despite the positive results neither peck nor the aarp 
advocated mandatory drivers education for older americans saying 
unwilling participants make poor students 
drivers with real bad attitudes and bad records probably would 
be irresponsive to it peck said 
maxwell added age does not determine your driving ability 
there are people who are 80 years old that are much better drivers 
than people who are 50 
state laws in california and 28 other states make older 
americans eligible for reduced auto insurance premiums with 
discounts of up to 10 percent if they take an approved refresher 
course twentysix of those laws have been passed since 1986 
the california study recommended that caution be exercised in 
any promotional efforts to substantially increase the proportion of 
elderly drivers who enroll in a mature driver program because 
that could bring in people who are greater accident risks and 
diminish the rationale for giving insurance discounts

president bush telling a group of civil 
rights leaders your problems are my problems vowed today to 
work toward stopping the decline of inner cities and making the 
90s a decade of urban renaissance 
we must create conditions for urban growth and economic 
revival conditions that leave no one behind bush said in 
remarks to the 79th annual meeting of the national urban league 
bush made no mention of current disputes between his 
administration and civil rights advocates 
but he said at one point before i go on i want to make sure 
everyone in this room knows just where i stand just where our 
administration stands my administration is committed to reaching 
out to minorities to striking down barriers to free and open 
access 
we will not tolerate discrimination bigotry or bias of any 
kind period bush said 
the president did not announce plans to visit subsaharan africa 
this fall despite earlier such speculation by white house 
officials 
although bush reiterated promises to work against poverty and 
racial intolerence civil rights leaders attending the urban league 
conference earlier suggested bushs deeds have not always matched 
his words 
before hearing directly from bush today several prominent civil 
rights advocates said the presidents record thus far has been 
weak though they embraced bushs role in achieving legislation 
extending civil rights protection to disabled americans 
the civil rights community would give the president high marks 
for accessibility and symbolism and rhetoric but low marks on 
substantive civil rights policy said ralph neas executive 
director of the leadership conference on civil rights 
civil rights leaders cited bushs acceptance of supreme court 
rulings limiting affirmative action his veto of minimum wage 
legislation and his choice of black detroit lawyer william lucas to 
be the justice departments top civil rights enforcer lucas was 
rejected by the senate judiciary committee on a 77 tie vote 
separately presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said today 
that the president is still undecided on whether to resubmit lucas 
nomination during the current congressional recess a process that 
would temporarily sidestep the confirmation process 
no decision has been made fitzwater said most civil rights 
groups have voiced opposition to lucas nomination citing his 
alleged inexperience with civil rights law 
fitzwater also suggested the president was not about to reverse 
his position that no new laws are necessary to seek to modify the 
supreme court decisions thats a decision thats already been 
made by the justice department fitzwater said 
civil rights leaders also fault the presidents efforts to win 
senate confirmation to a federal judgeship for vaughn walker a san 
francisco attorney under fire for his membership in a club that 
excludes women and the justice departments decision to undo 
existing school desegregation orders in georgia and its filing of 
a lawsuit challenging a prince georges county md desegregation 
plan 
bush told the urban league conference the challenge for urban 
america is a challenge for all of america and its a challenge 
i take to heart your problems are my problems your hopes are 
the hopes of all americans 
today i offer you my hand i offer you my word together we 
will make america open and equal to all 
together we will find a way to stop the decline of our inner 
cities to restore hope and make the 90s a decade of urban 
renaissance he added 
bush also said he would not rest until i know ive done 
everything in my power to ensure that we succeed that every child 
in our inner cities has a shot at a good job that every kid stays 
in school gets a quality education lives in decent housing in a 
neighborhood free of drugs fear and violence 
frederick mcclure bushs congressional liaison and the highest 
ranking black member of the white house staff said such episodes 
have in no way diminished the presidents commitment on the civil 
rights front 
most of the civil rights movements agenda is george bushs 
agenda he said adding that bushs priority remains one of 
breaking down barriers economic or otherwise 
urban league president john e jacob challenged the president to 
use the speech to present bold new initiatives that help 
americas poor people and put us back on the path of racial 
progress 
civil rights leaders generally praise bush for his offered 
hand approach but fault him on his actions 
symbolism is important but its not enough said neas 
however neas did applaud bushs role in helping to craft a 
bipartisan compromise reached last week on legislation 
extending civil rights laws to the nations 37 million disabled 
people

an arab gunman who infiltrated from jordan 
wounded an american and held an offduty soldier hostage for four 
hours today before being killed by israeli troops the army said 
the siege ended when soldiers stormed a hut on the kibbutz lotan 
collective farm 12 miles north of the israeli resort city of eilat 
and less than a mile from the jordanisrael border 
in jordan a military spokesman was quoted as saying the 
attacker was a jordanian soldier who had abandoned his post the 
israeli army said the gunman who carried an m16 rifle was 
apparently deranged 
hospital officials identified the american as lauren rosen 25 
of englewood nj who was working as a volunteer at the kibbutz 
they said she was slightly wounded by a bullet that passed through 
her neck 
the hostage osnat lev was a member of an army unit made up of 
soldiers who live and work on collective farms 
ms rosen was quoted by israel army radio as saying the attacker 
shouted in english its because of my brother before opening 
fire on her the soldier and a third woman in a date grove near the 
kibbutz the third woman escaped 
soldiers stormed the hut in the date grove where the woman was 
held after attempting to negotiate with the jordanian soldier for 
several hours the radio said it said his only demand during the 
negotiations was for a copy of the koran the moslem holy book 
which he was given 
in amman jordan the military official identified the attacker 
as farid ali mustafa a soldier according to the official petra 
news agency 
the senior official who was not identified said the soldier 
carried out the attack on his own obviously 
the initial attack came at 1130 am and the building was 
stormed about 330 pm the army said 
a man dressed in military dress came out from behind one of 
the trees and shot one shot and that was that ms rosen told 
israel army radio i was very very lucky i feel just fine 
ms lev said the man kept mentioning a dead sister and asked the 
location of israeli army bases that he could attack 
he said all the time that his sister was killed and why was 
she killed and why i killed her so i said i did not kill her at 
all he said that the jews killed her and now he comes to kill 
everybody said the woman 
she said she had worked as a volunteer on the kibbutz since june 
and would not be frightened away by the attack she added she would 
probably stay at the kibbutz several more weeks 
its a very beautiful place even if things like this happen 
she said 
in tel aviv defense minister yitzhak rabin used the incident to 
point to israels efforts to fight terrorism 
i believe it is time that the world will realize what is the 
difference when we talk about terrorism and all the sorts of 
atrocities they have carried out and when the rest of the world 
talks about it either from washington or paris or london he 
said 
for us fighting terrorism is a matter of night and day a 
matter of life and death he told reporters at the defense 
ministry 
when asked if the attack was by a guerrilla group rabin replied 
that it was an act by an individual apparently a jordanian 
soldier 
ms rosen was rushed to eilats yosef tal hospital with a 
gunshot wound in the neck just where it meets the shoulder 
hospital director haim shoham said 
about 60 to 70 people are believed to live at kibbutz lotan 
which grows vegetables and dates 
the last crossborder attack involving hostages was on march 7 
1988 when three plo guerrillas sneaked into southern israel from 
egypt and hijacked a commuter bus in southern israel 
they killed three hostages before being shot dead by police in 
addition nine israelis all workers at a nearby nuclear plant 
were shot and wounded 
the palestine liberation organization claimed responsibility for 
the attack which israeli officials said was aimed at sabotaging an 
american peace initiative by thensecretary of state george shultz 
two shooting incidents took place along the jordanian border 
earlier this year 
on may 27 a jordanian soldier and an israeli patrol exchanged 
fire across the border near beit shean northeast of jerusalem the 
jordanian was killed and two israeli soldiers were wounded 
in that incident jordan radio also reported the jordanian 
soldier had acted on his own after abandoning his post 
on march 17 two gunmen killed an israeli soldier near hazeva 
23 miles south of the dead sea jordan later announced it captured 
several men in the same area 
in damascus syria the fatah uprising group a rebel offshoot 
of yasser arafats mainstream fatah faction of the plo claimed

five central american leaders have signed 
a plan to disband the usbacked nicaraguan rebels by december 
and president daniel ortega called on washington to respect the 
contras death sentence 
in this way the united states can contribute to peace in 
nicaragua and central america the nicaraguan leader said monday 
night upon returning to managua from a threeday summit at this 
honduran beach resort 
the plan was a sharp rebuff to the united states 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
united states was generally supportive of the central american 
leaders agreement however he said any move to disband the 
contras must be accepted by them voluntarily 
asked how the united states would react if honduras tried to 
drive the nicaraguan rebels from its territory fitzwater replied 
its too early and unfair to say that the game is over 
in managua opposition leaders said today the government should 
meet with the rebels to discuss how to carry out the plan they 
called for continued talks with the internal opposition on the 
sandinistas pledge to carry out democratic reforms 
the next step will be very arduous said silviano matamoros 
leader of the opposition national conservative party the 
sandinistas are not exactly known for fulfilling their 
commitments 
the 120day plan laid out in a set of three accords signed 
monday set a 30day deadline for a combined unorganization of 
american states observer mission to organize itself and another 90 
days for the contras to demobilize 
about 11000 contras and their 12000 dependents living in 
honduras along the nicaraguan border are to be resettled in 
nicaragua if they want and in other nations if not guatemala el 
salvador and costa rica volunteered to take some in though most 
would prefer to go to the united states 
in approving the plan the five countries ignored us lobbying 
to keep the contras intact until after february elections in 
nicaragua central to reaching an agreement appeared to be a 
honduran decision that after eight years it wanted the rebels out 
in the past the government had denied the rebels were in the 
country then called for them to leave but allowed them to stay 
ortega accused the united states of trying to block the accord 
but us officials and officials of other central american nations 
denied the charge 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros blamed the outcome on 
political confusion in washington 
this is a disaster for the state department because it tried 
to impose its policy too late said matamoros in an interview 
with costa ricas radio impacto lastminute us pressure had a 
counterproductive effect he added 
the bush administration had been lobbying to keep the contras 
active until februarys scheduled elections in nicaragua as a 
guarantee of the democratization that ortegas leftist 
government has promised 
in mexico city where he met with mexican officials us 
secretary of state james a baker iii said he could not comment 
because he had not seen a text of the pact 
baker noted that the esquipulas agreement a central american 
accord signed two years ago says any contra demobilization must be 
carried out under conditions of safety and democracy in nicaragua 
and must be voluntary 
i dont think the central american democracies would do 
anything to change the terms of the agreement that they have put 
forth baker said 
if the full 120 days from monday were used dec 5 would be the 
deadline for the new plan the accords do not mention the 
consequences of any delay but deadlines in previous central 
american agreements have often been observed more in the breach 
the central american nations must find enough will to go along 
with the accords if they are to stick said costa rican president 
oscar arias who won a nobel peace prize for initiating the 
regional peace process more than two years ago 
it was not immediately clear whether the contras are willing to 
surrender their arms but assuming honduras lives up to its word 
the contras would have no territory from which to operate 
we have signed a death sentence for the contras said 
ortega he called on the united states to support the accords 
cease aggression and lift its economic embargo on nicaragua 
the contras have been reduced to making sporadic attacks since 
last year when the united states cut off military aid nonlethal 
aid continues at a rate of 45 million a month with the 
stipulation that it can be used for disbanding and resettling the 
contras 
this is a very difficult situation for the nicaraguan people 
we have been fighting for 10 years to achieve peace and democracy 
for our country and now we feel abandoned contra spokeswoman 
azucena ferrey said in miami 
the central american presidents agreed to ask the united nations 
to provide observers and verify the demobilization canada west 
germany and spain already have volunteered to send observers under 
un auspices 
the accords also call for a ceasefire in the 9yearold 
salvadoran civil war but have no provisions for enforcement 
the presidents had already agreed to dismantle the nicaraguan 
rebels at a summit in february in el salvador but a 90day 
deadline for working out the details passed without notice 
in the meantime ortega set elections for feb 25 and obtained 
an agreement with his domestic opposition that undermined the 
contras by calling for their dissolution 
el salvadors civil war has left 70000 dead according to 
independent estimates while the nicaraguan government says the 
conflict with the contras has claimed at least 50000 lives

a coven of witches has won tax exempt 
status in rhode island as a legitimate religious group 
with this ruling we witches will definitely be able to come 
out of the closet and take our place in society said the covens 
high priestess joyce siegrist also known as lady genevieve 
tax administrator r gary clark said he overturned the states 
initial ruling that the rosegate coven did not qualify for a sales 
tax exemption because it proved on appeal that it met the 
guidelines for legitimate church groups as set out by a 1986 rhode 
island supreme court ruling 
administrative hearing officer sandra murphy said tuesday that 
she heard about 2 hours of testimony in may and undertook 
extensive research on her own before recommending the action that 
clark took on july 28 
im happy that anyone who is practicing a religion in earnest 
is able to do so without state impediment she said 
the coven also known as our lady of the roses wiccan church 
has 30 to 40 members in rhode island and meets approximately three 
times a month for rituals said siegrist 
the core of the wiccan worship is belief in a diety with male 
and female attributes whose psychic energy can be tapped although 
the power can be used for good or ill will witches do not use it 
for destructive purposes 
when the tax exemption was denied last fall the divisions 
questions indicated tax officials were focusing on the apparent 
lack of formal theology schools for training wiccan clergy said a 
gregory frazier an american civil liberties union attorney who 
represented the witches in the administrative hearing in may 
he said officials also questioned the groups willingness to 
allow members to belong to other churches while claiming coven 
membership 
that argument was rebutted when the rev thomas ahlburn senior 
minister of the first unitarian church of providence testified 
that his church and many eastern religions also permit members to 
belong to other faiths frazier said 
under state laws a religion must be a nonprofit group not set 
up for the purpose of avoiding taxes it must have a litany or 
system of prayer as well as specific doctrines and practices that 
its members are expected to follow 
clark said the connotation of witches may have made it more 
difficult for the state 
if all the facts were identical and they were not called 
witches but were called brothers and sisters for example it 
probably would not have been anywhere nearly so controversial he 
said 
murphy said she didnt think the decision would set a precedent 
this was very logical very straightforward and very 
unemotional she said noting the coven is empowered by the state 
to officiate over marriage and burials

the european community and poland on 
tuesday signed an agreement to expand and strengthen trade and 
economic cooperation in the next five years 
pablo benavides a foreign affairs official of the european 
community traveled to warsaw to sign a letter on an emergency food 
program for the financially strapped nation said a spokesman for 
the 12nation trading bloc 
the spokesman demanding anonymity said benavides agenda 
called for talks with polish authorities including ireneusz 
sekula deputy prime minister and dominik jastrzebski minister of 
foreign economic cooperation as well as officials of the 
solidarity trade union 
negotiators for the community and poland reached agreement late 
last month on the trade and economic cooperation accord which 
gives a fiveyear timetable for gradually lifting quotas and 
tariffs on a range of industrial and farm products 
it also calls for greater cooperation in such fields as 
petrochemicals construction mining energy transportation 
tourism and telecommunications 
the trade agreement was the third between the common market 
trading bloc and an east european country since a thaw in relations 
a little more than a year ago accords also have been worked out 
with hungary and czechoslovakia 
the letter sets out some conditions for receipt of 120 million 
in free food the community will draw out of its surplus stocks and 
deliver soon to poland which has been suffering from serious food 
shortages 
the community wants to link the food shipments to changes in the 
structure of the polish economy such as in the inadequate system 
for getting food from farms to consumers tables 
the idea is to allow the poles to sell the food to consumers and 
use the money for economic improvements the poles have accepted 
the plan and the letter calls for creating a fund that often is 
used in development programs 
president bush and other world leaders attending an economic 
summit in paris urged emergency food shipments to poland they also 
called on the european community to hold a highlevel conference to 
come up with an economic aid plan for both poland and hungary 
western officials held their first meeting on the aid plan last 
week other discussions were expected to be scheduled in the fall

both slagle and day feel voters in the district are strong 
wright supporters and if they cant vote for wright they dont 
want to bother to vote 
the ones that are maddest about it are really disillusioned 
about it slagle said and they might just say to hell with 
it 
all the better say republicans who have been inching into 
texas government and now boast us sen phil gramm and gov bill 
clements among their ranks but republicans arent exactly 
predicting victory 
clearly we have an opportunity but the power of 
incumbency is great said fred meyer state republican party 
chairman whoever turns out their vote on election day is going 
to win 
texas now is represented by nine republicans and 20 democrats in 
congress four democrats three republicans and a libertarian have 
filed for wrights district 12 seat 
the democrats are pete geren jim lane george petrovich jr and 
bill turner laraine bethke jim hunter and bob lanier are the 
republicans robert buckingham jr is the libertarian 
because one candidate must get 51 percent of the vote to win a 
runoff is expected lanier a physician who is host of the 
nationally syndicated television show 60 second housecall and 
geren a fort worth attorney are considered the frontrunners and 
were the two leaders in the recent poll results each has his 
partys endorsement although lane has important endorsements from 
labor and police 
wright who stepped down as speaker in may and later resigned 
his house seat in the face of an ethics investigation that turned 
up 69 instances of alleged rules violations has not endorsed 
anyone 
the district which includes most of fort worth went for ronald 
reagan in 1980 and 1984 and george bush in 1988 
but democrats say the districts traditional blue collar 
conservative voters who first sent wright to washington in 1955 
will continue to support their party they are also counting on a 
backlash against the republicans for the ouster of wright the 
thirdmost powerful politician on capitol hill 
geren has been blasting georgia republican us rep newt 
gingrich and his washington gang as the group responsible for 
wrights political demise gingrich initiated the probe against 
wright 
but steve hollern the tarrant county gop party leader has said 
it was the democrats who threw jim wright out of congress if 
they had been willing to put their neck on the line to save him 
they could have kept him but the democratic congress was not 
willing to do that 
lane considered a distant second as a democratic contender in 
the race calls himself a jim wright democrat and is appearing 
with wrights son on campaign stops 
petrovich is putting up billboards with the slogan to protect 
us aimed at a city that fears losing everything it gained under 
wrights considerable influence 
republican chairman meyer played down the possible effects of 
wrights resignation on republican candidates 
people are going to vote for the candidate that will represent 
them the best in the future meyer said the rest is history 
on the other hand republican lanier has said in the campaign 
if anyone did a good job jim wright did we should all strive 
to emulate him

walk out of a forest and drive to a town for help and a man who 
waded a river to safety after being attacked by a grizzly bear 
asked rescuers if his ears were still on 
i could just hear his teeth grinding against my skull steve 
nordness 39 said at everett general hospital in washington state 
he was released sunday after being treated for wounds on his head 
hands and buttocks that required more than 100 stitches

two parties linked to the ruling 
communists since the 1940s said tuesday they will consider an 
invitation from solidarity leader lech walesa to join a coalition 
government that would exclude the communist party 
but communist leaders in their first comment on the walesa 
proposal said it could lead to destabilizing the country 
walesa taking the political offensive monday four days after 
the election of a communist premier expressed opposition to any 
government formed by prime minister czeslaw kiszczak and said it 
would extend the partys 45year monopoly on power 
instead walesa said he would work for a coalition of 
solidarity the democratic party and the peasant party putting the 
communist party in the position of becoming a parliamentary 
opposition 
in separate statements tuesday the united peasant party and the 
democratic party said their leaders would take the proposal under 
advisement 
the communist politburo discussing the offer at its weekly 
meeting tuesday sharply criticized the proposal according to 
state tv 
politburo members said it was aimed at breaking the traditional 
links between the communists and the peasant and democratic 
parties and could undo the agreements reached between authorities 
and the opposition at talks in april an announcer said on the main 
evening news program 
its another impediment by the opposition according to the 
report of the politburo discussion 
the initiative showed by lech walesa creates the danger of 
opening up a government crisis which certainly does not serve the 
stabilization of the situation in this country 
politburo members also pointed out that it complicates the 
quick formation of a government which the country needs so 
badly state tv said 
walesa press aides in gdansk said behindthescenes negotiations 
on forming a joint government have been going on since thursday 
between solidarity lawmakers and members of the peasant and 
democratic parties 
the statement was an apparent rebuttal to peasant party leader 
roman malinowski who monday had criticized walesa as publicizing 
his coalition proposal before presenting it to the involved parties 
kiszczak candidate of the communist polish united workers 
party was elected aug 3 by the sejm or parliament to form the 
next government members of the democratic and peasant parties 
added their votes to the communists to give him a 237173 majority 
kiszczak a general who was interior minister for eight years 
said it would take up to two weeks to assemble a cabinet which 
must be approved by the sejm 
walesas proposal appears to have opened the road to an 
alternative scenario 
the proposal put forward by walesa requires serious 
examination and decisions by appropriate statutory bodies of the 
democratic party it will be taken into account if the good of the 
national and the state requires this the democratic party said 
in a statement carried on the official pap news agency 
the statement issued by party spokeswoman elzbieta otffinowska 
mildly criticized walesas offer saying it is a pity that the 
proposal was not presented earlier 
the proposal will be taken up wednesday at a meeting of the 
party leadership and its 27 parliament deputies it said 
the peasant party said in a statement that it has stressed 
numerous times that only a grand coalition government can be an 
effective government gain social credibility and carry the burden 
of leading the country out of the deep economic crisis 
the phrase grand coalition has come to mean a coalition of 
solidarity with the communists something that walesa has rejected 
but the peasant partys statement said lech walesas 
statement published in the mass media shall be considered by the 
party presidium 
there has been no public response by kiszczak or the communist 
party so far to the walesa proposition 
kiszczak has been rebuffed so far in trying to enlist solidarity 
members in his cabinet and there is fear among authorities that a 
government formed with no solidarity representation will lack 
public support 
the concern has grown because of sharp increases in food prices 
last week and a series of wage disputes mainly involving rail bus 
and postal workers 
prospects are uncertain for creating a government capable 
through its political and social influence of effectively 
counteracting the dissolution of the economy said a commentary 
monday in the communist daily trybuna ludu 
neither a government only of solidarity or only of the party 
and the ruling coalition will fulful this requirement it said 
as a result of partially democratic elections in june the 
communists hold 173 seats in the 460member sejm solidarity 161 
the peasants 76 the democrats 27 and the remainder are held by 
procommunist christian organizations a 231vote majority is 
needed to form a government 
the peasant and democratic parties used to be rubber stamps for 
the communist party in the changing political environment in 
poland in which all parties expect to compete in four years in 
promised fully free elections the allied parties have started to 
demonstrate greater independence

colleges nationwide are cutting the number of 
high school graduates they will accept from beijing an official 
newspaper said tuesday in a report on another apparent effort to 
prevent more student arrest 
also on tuesday more reports of arrests from the spring student 
prodemocracy protests trickled into the capital 
a report in the hebei daily said seven beijing student leaders 
and other alleged counterrevolutionaries were arrested last month 
in hebei the province surrounds beijing and many students fled 
there after the military crackdown to crush their prodemocracy 
movement 
the china daily said colleges have cut by 1148 the number of 
high school graduates they will accept from beijing 
it quoted li huangguo deputy chief of beijings higher 
education bureau as saying colleges had adjusted their admissions 
to compensate for overenrollment in some majors 
students do not select their majors but are assigned to 
departments regardless of personal preference a more likely 
explanation is that outoftown colleges fear students from beijing 
may cause political unrest on their campuses 
many beijing middle school students joined in the protests led 
by college students that were crushed by the army june 34 
the government already has said that the college freshman class 
nationwide will be cut by 30000 students to 610000 beijing 
colleges that led the student movement will have their freshman 
classes cut in half or more in a move that school officials say is 
a result of the protests 
the china daily also said admission of new students will take 
place 24 days later than usual in early october all students 
except freshmen are scheduled to return to most beijing schools in 
mid or late august for several weeks of political education and to 
finish classwork from the spring term which was cut short by the 
protests 
the hebei daily carried the arrest report july 12 but it only 
was seen in beijing today 
it identified those arrested as leaders of independent student 
unions that organized the protests also detained it said were 
two leaders of worker and citizen support groups five people 
accused of attacking soldiers who put down the protests and an 
unspecified number of other protesters 
nearly 2100 arrests have been reported nationwide but most 
such reports stopped in midjuly and thousands more people are 
believed to have been arrested secretly

could not have intervened without risking his life and the 
investigation 
he cant put himself in a lifethreatening situation walker 
said if it were a lifethreatening situation his cover would 
have been immaterial then 
dallas county district attorney john vance said he did not know 
if state law requires texas officers to intervene in felonies they 
observe i think it would be good if he did but i dont believe 
the law requires it of him vance said 
dallas police spokesman ed spencer said the department does not 
have a written policy requiring undercover officers to try to stop

students enrolled in certain high school english 
classes got credit for never picking up a book except to deliver or 
store it according to a teacher who blew the whistle tuesday 
the daily news reported that ghost classes at adlai e 
stevenson high school in the borough of the bronx had titles such 
as literature and art but consisted mainly of students running 
errands for teachers 
there was no classroom to go to jim fairclough a teacher 
for 18 years told news columnist bob herbert the kids were used 
as gofers 
board of education spokesman frank sobrino acknowledged tuesday 
that allegations of ghost classes at stevenson were under 
investigation and that inspector general michael sofarelli had 
completed a draft report 
until it has been reviewed by the board he said were just 
not going to be making any comment 
herbert quoted from an affidavit that was part of the evidence 
compiled by sofarelli in which a 1988 stevenson graduate said she 
took the literature and art honors course as a senior 
this course consisted of delivering books to english teachers 
and storing books in the book room i also opened up the computer 
room and delivered lessons to the substitute teachers and 
sometimes i delivered messages to the teachers themselves she 
said 
the student now in college received a score of 90 for her work 
in the course 
neill rosenfeld a teachers union spokesman said the 
literature and art class intended to be an independent study 
course was eliminated last october after the united federation of 
teachers filed a grievance 
he said he did not know if the administration or individual 
teachers were to blame for the abuses 
uft president sandra feldman said in a statement that the union 
had been trying to stamp out phantom classes at stevenson for years 
the news said there were similarly phony classes for students 
who needed remedial english 
one of the transcripts shows that a kid who was a couple of 
years behind in his reading got a 90 in both the reading tutor 
class and the advanced literature and art class fairclough said 
why would a kid who was behind in his reading be in an advanced 
literature class 
the school is holding summer school classes now and none of the 
regular staff including principal michael weber will be back 
until late august school officials said

the federal communications commission has 
asked the justice department to investigate a new york professor 
alleged to have applied for more than 100 broadcast licenses using 
false names or forgeries 
outgoing fcc chairman dennis r patrick sent a letter last week 
to the department asking for an investigation of bernard boozer of 
central square ny a professor at state university of new york 
at oswego 
after a yearlong investigation the fcc decided that boozer may 
have violated both commission regulations and federal law 
it appears that on numerous occasions bernard boozer signed 
the names of attorneys and other persons without their knowledge 
patrick said in the letter to assistant attorney general edward 
sg dennis jr 
accordingly i am hereby referring to the department of 
justice the report of the commissions investigation for 
consideration of whether criminal prosecution of the responsible 
individual or individuals is warranted 
patrick who was appointed by thenpresident reagan in february 
1987 left office monday his letter to dennis was dated aug 4 
boozer could not be reached for comment tuesday there was no 
telephone number listed under his name in central square 
michele reed a spokeswoman for oswego state said boozer is an 
assistant professor of health and physical education and used to 
be the schools basketball coach he has been on sabbatical since 
last september she said adding that she did not know where he was 
or when he is slated to return 
reed said she had no comment on the allegations 
boozer first applied for a license for an fm radio station in 
ilion ny but was found in 1985 to be unqualified according to 
fcc spokeswoman patricia chew 
he is accused of then beginning a series of false applications 
for television and radio station construction permits that swamped 
the fcc the commission launched a formal investigation into 
boozers actions aug 4 1988

sen jesse helms trying to bolster his 
campaign against the use of federal money for offensive art has 
sent fellow lawmakers four photographs that he considers obscene 
i suggest you take a look at the enclosed materials helms 
said in the oneparagraph letter accompanying photographs from a 
current art exhibit in washington its your call as to whether 
the taxpayers money should be used to fund this sort of thing 
the photos were taken by the late robert mapplethorpe whose 
work is on display at the washington project for the arts which 
decided to show the exhibition after it was canceled by the 
corcoran gallery of art 
the corcoran wanted to avoid becoming involved in a political 
battle over congressional financing of the national endowment for 
the arts the nea provided one of the grants to underwrite a 
national tour of robert mapplethorpe the perfect moment which 
included homoerotic and sadomasochistic pictures 
the photographs mailed by helms from the mapplethorpe exhibit 
include man in a polyester suit 1980 and mark stevens mr 
10 12 1976 which both show male genitals one of a young girl 
who is partially exposed and one of a young boy standing naked on a 
chair 
the direct object of helms wrath is the national endowment 
which provided 30000 to underwrite part of the mapplethorpe 
exhibition and tour 
the senate recently approved a helms amendment that bans using 
federal funds for material that is considered obscene or 
indecent or denigrates debases or reviles beliefs or people 
on the basis of religion race creed sex handicap age or 
national origin 
members of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on 
the interior will meet in september on the 170 million nea budget 
in advance of that conference helms sent the photographs and 
letter 
a random check with congressional staff found that although the 
washington offices had received the letter and photographs from 
helms most of the senators and members of the house had not seen 
them 
the letter was marked for members eyes only and during the 
monthlong august recess many lawmakers are in their home states 
although personal and urgent mail is forwarded to members most 
congressional aides said the helms package would likely remain on 
their bosses desks until they return 
helms recent actions are not new in april 1988 the north 
carolina senator introduced an amendment to the aids research and 
education bill renewing an expiring 1987 ban on federal money for 
educational materials that promote or encourage homosexual activity 
helms amendment was prompted by a gayoriented aids education 
videotape that he screened for several senators 
theres something wrong when federal tax dollars are used for 
this garbage helms said at the time 
the amendment passed 942 but later senators approved a measure 
saying that nothing in the bill should prevent dissemination of 
accurate information to people at risk the later amendment 
effectively superseded the helms measure

un envoy marrack goulding appealed 
tuesday for israel to free the lebanese shiite cleric it abducted 
but defense minister yitzhak rabin rejected his release except as 
part of a prisoner exchange 
in separate news conferences following an hourlong meeting in 
rabins office rabin and goulding disagreed sharply over the 
wisdom of the abuction of sheik abdul karim obeid from his south 
lebanon home on july 28 
i have to say that the kidnapping of sheik obeid does not 
help said goulding who reiterated un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellars earlier pleas that israel free the clergyman 
rabin said that obeid would be held until israel was able to 
swap him for 16 foreign hostages and three israeli soldiers 
captured in lebanon in 1986 
we believe that after three and a half years of trying to 
bring about an exchange that failed we had to have assets that 
will convince them shiites to bring about an exchange and 
hopefully end the phenomenon of keeping hostage israelis and 
nonisraelis rabin said 
rabin said israel has received no response through the 
international committee of the red cross to its offer to swap obeid 
for the missing israeli soldiers and foreign hostages in lebanon 
he added i will not relate myself to whatever comes on the 
media in the name of fake names of shiite organizations in 
lebanon 
israels swap offer has been rejected in statements issued in 
lebanon in the name of hezbollah or party of god militia and 
various factions of the group 
prime minister yitzhak shamir on tuesday described israels 
efforts to retrieve its missing soldiers as a national moral 
commandment 
he told a graduation ceremony for army officers at the national 
defense college that israel was committed to do everything 
possible in order to bring back the soldiers imprisoned by the 
bands of enemies 
goulding is on the final part of a weeklong tour of the region 
which also took him to syria and lebanon for talks with political 
and militia leaders he was sent to try to determine the fate of 
us marine lt col william higgins 
higgins was serving with the un observer force in southern 
lebanon when he was kidnapped in february 1988 the 
hezbollahaffiliated faction holding higgins released a videotape 
july 31 purporting to show him hanged 
the fbi said monday it believes the body shown in the tape was 
higgins but that there can be no positive identification without 
physical evidence it offered no information about the time or 
cause of death 
rabin told goulding that israel believed higgins died last year 
as a result of mistreatment according to sources who demanded 
anonymity 
goulding said that in his talks in lebanon i was unable to 
establish exactly when he died opinions differ about that 
asked if he was satisfied with findings showing higgins was 
dead goulding said i have seen the findings of the fbi who 
have professional forensic scientists who examined the evidence and 
reached that conclusion 
goulding declined comment when asked if he had relayed a message 
from hezbollah spiritual leader sheik hussein mohammed fadlallah in 
beirut 
after an earlier meeting with us ambassador william brown 
goulding was asked about reports in the jerusalem post that another 
american hostage in lebanon joseph cicippio might be released 
soon as a goodwill gesture goulding said he had no information 
that this was the case 
cicippio who was threatened with death until the us 
intervened with an international diplomatic offensive worked at 
the american university of beirut he has been a captive since 
sept 12 1986 
goulding said he would meet with the un secretarygeneral 
wednesday to report on his trip 
rabin said tuesdays meeting took place at gouldings request 
and that he had given the un official what information israel had 
on higgins 
he said he also described israels moral and practical 
commitment to bringing home soldiers missing in action 
we would like to turn our achievement having sheik obeid in 
our hands to an end of the hostage episode for israelis and 
westerners 
rabin said the next step in the process should be receiving a 
report on the health of the three missing israeli servicemen they 
are soldiers yossi fink and rahamin alsheikh captured feb 17 
1986 in israels security zone in southern lebanon and ron 
arad a navigator whose plane went down over southern lebanon on 
oct 16 1986

the governing body of the leftleaning 
labor party on tuesday decided to stay in israels ruling coalition 
and adopted the principle of trading land for peace to guide peace 
talks with palestinians 
the massive show of hands that concluded the meeting of the 
partys 1350member central committee put an end to the government 
crisis that erupted july 5 over hardline conditions for peace 
talks adopted by the rival rightwing likud bloc 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs party decided on that day the 
governments program for palestinian elections in the occupied 
territories could only be implemented on condition the 20month 
palestinian uprising ends 
the plan calls for negotiating an interim selfrule period with 
elected representatives of the 17 million palestinians in the west 
bank and the gaza strip 
likud also demanded continuation of jewish settlement in the 
occupied territories and said no land would be traded for peace it 
said 140000 arabs living in the annexed east jerusalem would not 
be allowed to vote likud decided 
on july 10 labors leadership bureau voted in favor of leaving 
the government but on july 23 the cabinet reaffirmed the israeli 
peace plan without the likudadopted principles turning tuesdays 
prescheduled labor meeting into a largely ceremonial event 
labor leader and finance minister shimon peres however told 
the delegates the party would leave the governing coalition if the 
peace process stops 
im convinced that we are taking the right path to stay in the 
government as long as the peace process continues and to leave it 
if it ends peres said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin an architect of the peace 
initiative said it was important to prove to the palestinians the 
labor party is not accepting silently likuds conditions 
but others known as labor doves opposed the decision urging 
the hawks such as rabin to reconsider it 
the only thing labor is doing is being a moderate mask for 
the government said legislator chaim ramon 
in what appeared to be a compromise between the labor hawks and 
doves and a move to counter the likud principles the party 
adopted 12 points to guide the peace process including willingness 
to trade territory for peace 
the guiding points also said israel will not annex the lands it 
has occupied since the 1967 middle east war but would not agree to 
the establishment of a palestinian state there either 
we do not want to annex the territories that would mean to 
live with perpetual uprising who knows for how many generations 
peres said 
the labor plan said east jerusalem arabs would be allowed to 
vote but outside jerusalem and stressed that jerusalem would stay 
undivided and united under israeli sovereignty 
another point called for suspension of jewish settlements once 
talks aimed at elections start and said the issue would become part 
of subsequent negotiations 
responding to another likud demand labor said elections should 
start without preconditions negotiations for elections would 
run parallel with efforts to quell the uprising which has claimed 
at least 530 palestinian and 38 israeli lives 
labor also appeared to open a door for some plo participation by 
saying that palestinians from outside can participate in the 
talks on the final status of the occupied lands on condition their 
candidacy is agreed upon by israel egypt and local palestinians 
other labor points seemed aimed at answering some plo demands 
they guaranteed free and democratic elections monitored by foreign 
observers and said that after the balloting palestinians would 
receive political rights 
the palestine liberation organization has rejected the israeli 
program saying free elections were impossible under occupation and 
demanding that elections lead to an independent palestinian state 
with jerusalem as its capital

rich went to lebanon in the service of the united nations 
because he believed he could be useful that he could help and that 
he was needed he always needed to fulfill a destiny a need based 
on a profound sense of duty he wrote in his high school year book 
his goal was to always make my family proud of me he suceeded 
those of us who have known rich higgins count ourselves lucky 
he taught us how to love and enjoy life he taught us tolerance for 
those whose ideas differed from ours he taught us that words such 
as honor reputation integrity and fidelity have real meaning 
to those who would suggest that our concern for rich should 
somehow be mitigated because he was in a dangerous business or 
because his act of volunteering was supposedly foolish rich 
himself would have the appropriate reply when youre out front 
people will shoot at you 
now is not the time for anger or bitterness for recriminations 
and blame now is the time for calm reflection for kind thoughts 
of the man who brought us togther now is the time to tell rich 
higgins that we love him and we miss him 
rich would be proud of the fact that our commandant had the 
courage and the decency to inform me personally of the sad news he 
has been a pillar of support from the beginning i am also mindful 
of the fact that our president has agonized in a very profound and 
personal manner over my husbands fate he has my prayers and my 
support as he tries to save the living and end the suffering 
thank you

the county supervisors have voted not 
to replace courthouse water fountains labeled colored and 
white but to give them a historical plaque 
the decision monday by the jones county board of supervisors 
rejected an offer by the state department of archives and history 
to move the fountains to the state history museum in jackson and 
build replicas that would not remind visitors of past segregation 
laws 
the naacp is not satisfied with the decision that the board of 
supervisors made it was just a sign to let the whole state of 
mississippi know that racism is alive in laurel and jones county 
said manuel jones president of the laureljones county branch of 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
it is a very strong possibility that we will be out marching 
at the ellisville courthouse this week or the first of next week i 
am prepared to wear out three pairs of shoes he said tuesday 
under pressure from the naacp county officials in april daubed 
plaster over the labels but rain quickly rinsed the plaster away 
vandals also sprayed the white fountain with black paint 
county supervisor jerome wyatt the only black member of the 
board was the lone voice monday for accepting the states offer 
this situation has apparently reached an unappropriate level 
of racial overtones it is the wording that makes the difference on 
the fountains wyatt said 
county supervisor calvin holifield proposed instead that the 
fountains be cleaned of the plaster and marked by a plaque 
explaining their historical significance 
the motion passed with only wyatt objecting and county 
supervisor thurmond dykes abstaining 
i dont think this is going to solve it dykes said 
the state department of archives and history must approve any 
alterations to the fountains because the 82yearold courthouse is 
a state historic landmark

a man held in jail for a year and two days 
without a trial or hearing says he found the time enlightening 
clifford bashlor 54 was freed monday when wayne county jail 
officials learned of his illegal detention because jail personnel 
raised questions about his long stay 
bashlors jail time violated state laws requiring arraignment 
within three days and trial within 180 days of arrest district 
court judge daphne means curtis dismissed two misdemeanor charges 
and released him 
it appears there was some kind of breakdown in 
communications sheriffs spokeswoman nancy mouradian said ivie 
shelton named bashlors lawyer said his client just plain got 
overlooked 
bashlor said he had no plans to sue 
i have no grudges against anybody he said they treated 
me all right i had a cell to myself and i read a lot 
you know some people say that everyone should spend a year in 
jail it takes about a year to really get a kind of enlightenment 
bashlor was arrested aug 5 1988 on misdemeanor warrants for 
assault and trespass he was arraigned in 36th district court and 
taken to the jail but due to a mixup wasnt returned to court for 
a scheduled pretrial appearance 
the court thought he had jumped bond and issued an arrest 
warrant with no further hearings scheduled the jail had no court 
order to remove him from his cell without a court appearance no 
lawyer was appointed 
bashlor spent 367 days in the jail never tried or convicted of 
charges that would have carried a maximum penalty of 90 days 
i tried to tell them i shouldnt be there but that doesnt 
really work in jail he said

iran would be willing to help free 
american hostages if washington released 2 billion in frozen 
iranian assets a tehran newspaper said tuesday lebanese news 
reports said syria might try to help gain the release of the 
captives 
hezbollah the iraniansponsored group thought to be an umbrella 
for hostage holders said it would not trade three captured israeli 
soldiers for a kidnapped shiite cleric israel has refused to free 
on other terms 
in tel aviv un envoy marrack goulding appealed to israel to 
release the 33yearold cleric sheik abdul karim obeid but 
defense minister yitzhak rabin refused 
israeli commandos kidnapped obeid who is affiliated with 
hezbollah from his home in southern lebanon on july 28 israel has 
offered to exchange obeid and shiite prisoners it holds estimated 
at about 400 for the three soldiers and the 16 western hostages in 
lebanon eight of whom are americans 
sheik sobhi tofaili a senior hezbollah leader said in a 
statement distributed tuesday in beirut there shall be no 
contacts and no negotiations as long as sheik abdul karim obeid 
remains in captivity 
this is the partys unshakeable conviction and this is what we 
shall do hezbollah is not concerned with the question of the 
hostages or the negotiations revolving around it 
hezbollah or party of god has insisted obeid be freed without 
conditions 
the tehran times quoted a source close to president hashemi 
rafsanjani as saying the first step should be taken by the 
united states and if tehran gets satisified that its assets will 
certainly be unfrozen then the second step will definitely come 
from iran 
in the newspaper report carried by the official islamic 
republic news agency the source said irans influence in lebanon 
was limited and there was no guarantee the hostages would be 
released 
the iranian assets including arms purchased by the late shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi but not delivered were frozen when 
washington broke relations with tehran over the seizure of the us 
embassy in 1979 after the shah was overthrown some of the 
americans in the embassy were held hostage for 444 days 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
there are a lot of ideas being floated a lot of exchanges being 
made we see ideas coming out from iran from syria algeria 
israel the united states everybody 
goulding repeated pleas by un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar that israel free the shiite cleric and told reporters 
after meeting rabin i have to say that the kidnapping of sheik 
obeid does not help 
rabin said at another news conference we believe that after 
3 years of trying to bring about an exchange for the 
soldiers we had to have assets to bring about an exchange and 
hopefully end the phenomenon of keeping hostage israelis and 
nonisraelis 
hezbollahs spiritual adviser sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
said in a statement published by several beirut newspapers tuesday 
that the abduction of obeid left the region poised on a powder 
keg 
that act of piracy led to the killing of american officer 
higgins said fadlallah referring to the announcement by the 
captors of lt col william r higgins that they hanged him july 31 
in retaliation 
a poorquality videotapepe the kidnappers released showed the 
body of a man that appeared to be the us marine hanging from a 
gallows 
mrs higgins said tuesday in washington she considered her 
husband dead and offered president bush her support as he tries 
to save the living and end the suffering 
robin higgins a marine corps major said the time had come to 
tell her husband we love him and miss him 
the fbi said monday it believed the man on the gallows was 
higgins but that when or and how he died could not be determined 
there have been reports that higgins who was on un duty when he 
was seized in february 1988 was killed months ago 
fadlallah said israels refusal to free obeid and us naval 
movements in the eastern mediterranean reminded him of tension 
that preceded israels invasion of lebanon in 1982 
i do not rule out the possibility of a largescale military 
operation by israel to get itself off the hook in this crisis which 
it created he declared 
annahar an independent beirut newspaper said tuesday there 
were indications syria and iran would coordinate and intensify 
efforts to resolve the hostage issue and defuse the crisis it 
generated 
this is expected to take its final shape when iranian foreign 
minister ali akbar velayati arrives in syria soon for talks with 
president hafez assads government said a dispatch from its 
damascus correspondent 
syria supported iran during its 8year war with iraq in which a 
truce was reached in august 1988 but their interests in lebanon 
sometimes conflict syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon and is the 
countrys main power broker 
annahar said syria was among the countries president bush asked 
to intervene after kidnappers holding american hostage joseph 
cicippio threatened to kill him but syria rejected the contents 
of the bush letter because they did not conform with the role it 
had played and is playing now to secure the release of hostages 
this prompted washington to send a flexible explanation of the 
letter to syrian officials after a major crisis was about to arise 
between the two countries over the letters contents it said 
cicippios kidnappers who call themselves the revolutionary 
justice organization said thursday they had suspended the death 
sentence against him he was kidnapped sept 12 1986 
the hostage held longest is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press kidnapped march 16 1985

a united nations team studying the 
feasibility of forming a body to monitor vietnams troop pullout 
from cambodia traveled tuesday over what is expected to be one of 
the major evacuation routes 
after its drive the team met with officials of vietnams 
foreign ministry even though it had been widely expected to work 
only in cambodia team members would not give details of the talks 
the team sent by an international peace conference in paris 
drove six hours over highway no 1 from cambodias capital of phnom 
penh to vietnams major southern city of ho chi minh where the 
talks were held 
vietnam claims to have made annual partial troop pullouts since 
1982 and many of the departing soldiers returned home on highway 
no 1 
the paris conference which opened july 30 is trying to find a 
political settlement to the war that erupted with vietnams 
invasion of cambodia in 1978 
vietnam plans to withdraw its last troops in september leaving 
the government it installed in phnom penh to fight a coalition of 
three guerrilla groups the paris conference agreed that this 
pullout must be internationally verified 
the provietnamese government previously had rejected any un 
role in the cambodian peace process because the world body 
recognizes the guerrillas resistance coalition as the legitimate 
government 
the 15member un team mostly military officers gave few 
details of its mission saying it first has to report to the un 
secretary general 
lt gen martin o vadset of norway the leader of the team 
said it met with a vice minister of defense of the 
vietnameseinstalled government monday when it arrived in phnom 
penh to begin its mission 
we were received extremely well and had short but good 
discussions he told reporters who accompanied the team on the 
flight back from ho chi minh city to phnom penh 
there was no politics involved we merely addressed the 
practical aspects he said 
the team was to meet wednesday with hun sen premier of the 
phnom penh government and four cabinet ministers 
the team from 11 countries includes experts in communications 
aviation and other technical fields

senate minority leader robert dole said 
tuesday he thinks president bush is doing a better job than his two 
predecessors of dealing with a mideast hostage crisis 
but the kansas republican also warned that if terrorists carry 
out their threat to murder hostage joseph cicippio the united 
states will use military retaliation 
if cicippio is murdered all bets are off dole said then 
you would see a military response 
dole at a news conference praised bush for using intensive 
diplomatic pressures from at least 12 nations in an attempt to 
resolve the situation that led to the apparent murder of hostage 
marine lt col william higgins by muslim extremists in lebanon 
the president is using every channel said dole who said he 
was briefed last week by the cia among nations applying diplomatic 
pressure are algeria the soviet union iran and israel he said 
i really believe there is some optimism dole said ive 
talked to the president about this a number of times 
he attributed his optimism to bushs steady approach and the 
more moderate tone adopted by irans new president 
dole earlier had criticized israel for not notifying the united 
states that it planned to abduct a shiite muslim cleric from his 
home in south lebanon he didnt repeat that criticism tuesday 
saying instead he thinks the israelis are under some pressure

attorney general dick thornburgh responding 
to the increasingly international nature of crime announced plans 
tuesday to create an office of international affairs in the justice 
department 
often more than 50 percent of my day is devoted to some matter 
related to our international involvement in fighting drug 
trafficking money laundering international organized crime and 
business fraud environmental depredations terrorism or 
espionage the attorney general said in remarks prepared for 
delivery in honolulu to the american bar association 
thornburgh said he would ask permission from congress to create 
the office to coordinate the departments dealings with foreign 
governments on law enforcement issues 
the attorney general said the plan was based on dramatic 
increase in international law enforcement activities since he 
headed the justice departments criminal division in during the 
ford administration 
upon my return to the department the biggest single change 
that i noticed was the vast increase in the amount of international 
activiity in which we are now engaged thornburgh said 
the office will report directly to the attorney general 
thornburgh has long said he wanted to make the justice 
department more responsive to the increasing international nature 
of crime 
this is an area i believe where we have not kept up with the 
times thornburgh said 
crime is no longer limited by the distance one pony can cover 
in a days time and a businessmans primary market is no longer 
that which is within a wagons ride thornburgh said

operation rescue leader randall terry and 
four other antiabortionists cannot argue during their trespassing 
trial that they were trying to prevent the greater evil of murder 
when they blockaded a clinic a judge ruled tuesday 
there cannot be any way in which it can be shown that the 
abortions were stopped that day this is going to be a case of 
trespassing conspiracy to trespass and obstruction of a 
business municipal judge richard paez said 
defense attorney cyrus zal had asked paez to allow him to use 
the necessity defense arguing a law was broken during the 
march 25 blockade in order to prevent greater harm 
there are hearts that are still beating today because of the 
actions my client took zal said monday 
but the judge said tuesday he wouldnt allow expert testimony on 
the viability of a fetus saying that question was left to the 
legislature 
i think the law at the time and now is that a woman has the 
right to an abortion up to 24 weeks paez said 
terry 29 and michael mcmonagle 36 both from pennsylvania 
don bennette 35 of mission viejo andy eppink 41 of lake los 
angeles and jeff white 31 of santa cruz are each charged with 
two counts of conspiracy and one count each of resisting arrest 
blocking an entrance failing to disperse and violating a court 
order 
terry mcmonagle and white are acting as their own attorneys 
can any prolifer in this country get a fair trial our 
defense is gutted right in the forefront our defense of why we 
were there is that we were saving human lives terry said 
the decision allows jury selection to go forward in what is 
expected to be a monthlong trial 
the five defendants were among 771 demonstrators arrested last 
spring for blocking the entrances of los angelesarea womens 
clinics as part of a crusade against abortion 
the city attorneys office says it is prepared to prosecute 539

military pilots across new england risk losing 
their wings if they bomb a bird sanctuary during aerial target 
practice over nomans land a pristine island three miles off 
marthas vineyard 
the navy has been using the deserted island as a bombing target 
since world war ii nowadays pilots from the air force and 
national guard drop sandfilled dummy bombs and smoke markers on 
the western tip of nomans land 
they no longer use live explosives but some have reportedly 
violated an order to stay away from the rest of the island where 
grassy knolls marshes and unspoiled beaches provide a haven for 
wildlife 
peregrine falcons rest there during their annual migration from 
greenland to south america rare shorteared owls and snowy 
eaglets black crowned night herons and northern harriers better 
known as marsh hawks all flourish where tourists are banned 
and the clear ponds shelter an elusive species of spotted 
turtle said thomas w french director of the states endangered 
species program 
the f111s and a10s have been ordered to keep away from the 
northeast corner of the island where the birds like to nest on a 
rocky point 
but two weeks ago a citizen in the gay head area of marthas 
vineyard spotted a military jet over the sanctuary said augustus 
ben david a biologist who runs the felix neck wildlife sanctuary 
in edgartown and has been inspecting nomans land since 1973 
based on the report and a visit to the island capt john g 
kuchinski jr the new commander of the naval air station in south 
weymouth has again put pilots on notice to stay clear of both the 
sanctuary and the cliffs of gay head which are dotted with 
secluded milliondollar homes navy spokesmen said tuesday 
kuchinski told the patriot ledger of quincy monday that any navy 
pilots found bombing over the sanctuary could be stripped of their 
wings 
these pilots are in combat aircraft and are pretty 
proficient he said the island is big and the pilots know the 
target area im sending a message today to remind everyone we are 
watching 
this is the only target site in the whole new england area 
said cmdr lewis h smalley the secondincharge at the south 
weymouth base 
french who accompanied kuchinski and others on the island tour 
last week said he saw no signs that practice bombs had been 
dropped in the sanctuary the orange bombs which range from 25 
pounds to 500 pounds are clearly visible in the grass around the 
targets on the western side of the island he said 
that doesnt mean there werent any bombs inside the 
sanctuary but it does indicate to me that its not common 
practice french said 
over the years the military use of nomans land has drawn fire 
from some naturalists and drawn antimilitary protesters to fields 
where none but sheep have lived for nearly 80 years 
but french and ben david said the military presence has in fact 
been kinder to the creatures of nomans land than campers and 
picnickers would be 
certainly it sounds bad when you talk about bombing the 
island french said it has a nasty ring to it but frankly 
its protected the island a lot more than the other ways we protect 
open space even passive public use makes a lot of our sites 
unattractive to wildlife 
as long as the pilots obey the rules and use the target areas 
and use the proper approach pattern then the island is alive and 
well ben david said

the deputy premier met with 
cardinal frantisek tomasek who offered to mediate between 
communist authorities and activists seeking political reform it 
was reported tuesday 
the communist party daily rude pravo reported the meeting monday 
between tomasek and deputy premier matej lucan it did not 
however mention tomaseks open letter expressing support for a 
petition for democratic reforms or his offer to mediate amid 
increasing attacks by the authorities on the opposition 
prague officials lashed out again tuesday at activists who 
circulated a petition for democratic reform alleging they are 
trying to stir up unrest 
tomasek 90 made his offer to mediate in an open letter aug 4 
in an apparent attempt to defuse tension over the forthcoming 21st 
anniversary of the sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia emigre 
sources said monday 
today an increasing number of citizens are demanding a share 
in the domestic responsibility for the state of society by signing 
the petition several sentences and to this end are even 
prepared to pay the price of personal sacrifice the cardinals 
letter said 
the petition has been signed by 15000 people including some 
communist party members 
sources close to the cardinal who insisted on anonymity said the 
meeting with lucan took place in a very noble and smooth 
atmosphere but declined to say whether the meeting produced any 
concrete agreements or give other details 
rude pravo said only that lucan appreciated the cardinals 
interest in current developments in our society and the solution of 
open questions 
in a separate article the daily quoted officials as criticizing 
the petition and its authors a cosponsor of the petition 
stanislav devaty was arrested monday at his home in gottwaldov 
moravia he was arrested twice earlier this year on charges of 
antistate activity but released both times after staging hunger 
strikes 
communist party ideologist jan fojtik called the petition a 
flop rude pravo reported 
the prague leadership repeatedly has denounced the petition and 
said those signing it face fines or imprisonment 
the criticism is part of a barrage of propaganda against 
opposition groups prior to the aug 21 anniversary of the 1968 
invasion when renewed antigovernment protests are expected 
six of the activists who sponsored the petition have been told 
they are under investigation and police have searched houses and 
done repeated document checks on dissidents in recent days 
in an interview with rude pravo and the official news agency 
ctk the chief investigator of the national security corps 
jaroslav spura said he had proof the petition aimed to stir up 
unrest provoke acts of pressure and violate public order 
spura said his investigation was not finished but it already was 
clear the petitions supporters sought to overthrow the socialist 
system in czechoslovakia 
he quoted from a letter allegedly written by veteran activist 
petr uhl to banned playwright vaclav havel it was not clear how 
authorities obtained the letter and its authenticity could not be 
confirmed 
uhls telephone has been cut off by police and havel has been 
ordered by authorities to stay out of prague 
havel was detained twice last week once for three hours and the 
second time for 11 hours 
about 10000 people took part in unofficial demonstrations last 
year to mark the 20th anniversary of the invasion other 
antigovernment protests took place in october january and may 
when police used force to disperse crowds 
tomasek voiced his concern about further violence in his letter 
as a herald of peace i have the duty to warn against 
violence he said he also called on authorities and the 
opposition to meet

secondhand jackson trailer 
the 13yearold girl who lived there with her mother stepfather 
and four brothers could sometimes be heard crying stop it one 
neighbor said she was seldom allowed out said another except to 
borrow food and cigarettes 
then last month the little girl walked across the street and 
told my adopted granddaughter that she had to talk to someone 
said neighbor roy pitts i could tell she had been crying 
after she told her story child welfare authorities came to pick 
up the girl and a few hours later investigators arrested her 
stepfather and four brothers on 46 counts including child 
molestation 
we dont work a case every day where the victims own siblings 
are involved georgia bureau of investigation agent paul musick 
told the atlanta journalconstitution this is the first time i 
can remember when weve arrested every male in the family on 
molestation charges 
arrested were harold jackson 39 the girls stepfather and her 
four brothers jerry medlin 21 wesley medlin 19 edward medlin 
17 and a 16yearold whose name was withheld 
when pitts talked to the girl last month she said her older 
brother had kept her in bed all day and that he had laid out of 
work because she would be home alone he recalled 
neighbors said she did not have a key to the trailer and 
sometimes had to sit outside for hours until her parents came home 
from work pitts said he saw her when her brothers made her bum 
cigarettes for them 
they stayed shut up in the house said 74yearold hazel 
tucker who lives next door along the dusty dirt road around the 
lake shed run out and one of her brothers would take her in 
the house and slam the door 
carol tucker mrs tuckers daughterinlaw told the 
journalconstitution she sometimes heard cries of stop it from 
the jackson trailer but thought they were just typical family 
squabbles 
shed come out of the door and say leave me alone she 
recalled when i heard about the arrests it upset me real bad 
the tuckers pitts and other neighbors were interviewed a few 
hours before a superior court judge issued a gag order barring 
attorneys lawenforcement personnel and potential witnesses from 
discussing the case 
judge john d crosby approved the motion friday at the request 
of assistant district attorney diane perry who said the gag order 
was needed to protect the alleged victim and to ensure a fair trial 
for the defendants 
the girls mother beth jackson told the judge that news 
reports were causing her great emotional distress and problems at 
work mrs jackson has told authorities she was unaware of any 
sexual assaults on her daughter 
jackson and the three oldest brothers attended the hearing they 
are being held in the irwin county jail and the juvenile is being 
held in the youth detention center in eastman 
officials said the charges against the stepfather and the four 
brothers are based on alleged assaults dating back to january 1988 
pitts said the girl told him it had been happening since she was 
8 years old 
he said he believed the girl sought help out of fears she might 
be pregnant she told my granddaughter i might be pregnant and 
im scared 
she is in foster care pending the outcome of the case 
people who report suspected child abuse are guaranteed 
confidentiality but pitts said he wanted his name publicized so 
people will know not to do it around me 
i feel protective about all kids said the 56yearold 
disabled veteran who has four adopted grandchildren 
we had a gut feeling something was wrong but couldnt prove 
it he said the first time i knew i went to the 
authorities 
we knowed something was going on but you just dont do 
anything unless you know for sure said hazel tucker

the soviet union has accepted binding 
international agreements partly aimed at increased protection of 
civilians during internal armed conflicts the international 
committee of the red cross said tuesday 
other east bloc states are expected to follow moscows lead in 
ratifying the two protocols or additions to the 1949 geneva 
conventions on international humanitarian law red cross officials 
said in april hungary became the first east european country to 
ratify the protocols 
the red cross said it was extremely gratified by the soviet 
decision the private allswiss humanitarian agency monitors 
compliance with the geneva conventions and the 1977 protocols 
soviet officials notified the red cross that the supreme soviet 
the nations legislature approved ratification of the two 
protocols without reservations a red cross statement said 
the two texts were agreed by a geneva diplomatic conference in 
june 1977 many countries signed including the soviet union but 
not all ratified the agreements 
the first protocol strengthens the protection of victims of 
fighting between countries the second applies to internal conflict 
eightysix nations have ratified the first protocol and 76 are 
party to the second 
the united states signed both texts but ratified neither the 
second protocol was sent to the senate for ratification but the 
first was not because washington said it could give recognition and 
protection to terrorist groups 
the geneva conventions drafted under the impression of world 
war ii are designed to protect wounded and sick soldiers in the 
field and at sea prisoners of war and civilians in time of war 
the 1977 protocols were added to cover modernized forms of 
warfare 
for civilians in internal conflict the conventions offer 
protection after they have been captured or arrested a red cross 
jurist noted the second protocol expanded those safeguards to 
cover the effects of internal fighting such as bombings and 
shootings on the population at large

parents of lawbreaking minors could be 
placed in a public stockade under an ordinance adopted by the city 
council 
until we introduce shame back in crime and punishment were 
spinning our wheels city attorney charles sidney gibson said 
the ordinance also requires anyone under 18 must be off the 
streets and away from public places and private businesses from 11 
pm to 530 am the ordinance was approved unanimously saturday 
following a street fight the night before and an increase in crime 
during the summer 
parents unable to control their children may sign a statement 
saying so and the minors will be considered delinquent and have 
their fate decided by juvenile courts those parents will have to 
pay the city 100 for each minor so designated or render 20 hours 
of community service 
the parents will also be required to place a placard at their 
homes and display a bumper sticker on their vehicle saying my 
children are not my responsibility they are yours 
mayor eugene farrell said monday he doubted that the city would 
ever use a stockade because the city has none 
the ordinance calls for 
misdemeanor charges against parents or guardians of minors 
who fail to exercise control over their wards after being 
warned that the minor is in violation of the ordinance 
minors who violate the provisions to be taken into custody and 
held by the police until they are turned over to their parents or 
guardians 
parents of children who violate the ordinance to be fined up to 
500 jailed for up to 30 days and placed within stockaded 
public display six hours a day but not more than two consecutive 
days 
adults who fail to abide by the ordinance may also have their 
photograph placed in the local weekly newspaper for two weeks a 
caption would read irresponsible parent or custodian 
whichever applies 
gibson said he was not sure about the constitutionality of the 
stockade but felt sure the other provisions were constitutional 
police chief jerry melton said the fight that pushed the city 
council into action involved about six young people and adults and 
drew 250 onlookers 
farrell said the ordinance could be lifted if youngsters 
conduct improves 
somethings got to be done the city attorney said there 
are people in this town afraid to go out of the house youths 
curse them and steal their checks out of the mailboxes the older 
ones will initiate the younger ones by making them steal if they 
dont join the gang they whip them

chinas social and political turmoil will make 
it more difficult for its communist government to deal with 
galloping inflation falling industrial output and other economic 
woes according to a report to congress by the central intelligence 
agency 
economic reform has been put on hold by the central government 
and economic problems could prompt renewed political unrest in the 
1990s said the report to the joint economic committee released 
tuesday 
the new leadership has endorsed a continuation of the 
austerity program but the social and political turmoil that has 
gripped china since april will make it difficult for beijing to 
solve its pressing economic problems the report said 
the preoccupation of chinas leaders with consolidating power 
ridding the government of supporters of deposed premier zhao ziyang 
and strengthening party and ideological control will prevent them 
from formulating new solutions to chinas economic problems the 
cia analysts concluded 
pressures to increase government expenditures and expand the 
money supply have probably grown because of the social unrest 
the cia report said beijing may attempt to increase income 
subsidies and loans to state enterprises enough to ensure that 
wages of most urban workers keep pace with inflation 
inflation in 1989 hit 19 percent overall and 30 percent in urban 
areas the highest levels since the communists came to power in 
1949 
inflation in large cities remained at the 30 percent rate early 
this year and is likely to remain in double digits for the rest of 
1989 
the cia authors also said chinas military leaders probably will 
play a larger political and economic role in return for the 
military crackdown last may on democracy demonstrations in beijing 
military leaders probably will petition civilian authorities 
to reverse the decadelong decline in the share of the budget going 
to defense the cia said 
the cia report was made public by sen jeff bingaman dnm 
chairman of the panels national security subcommittee 
bingaman said the report shows that the clock is turning 
backward for the chinese economy 
a decade of economic reform may have effectively come to a 
standstill with the crackdown in tiananmen square he said 
china is in danger of being recentralized bingaman said 
the unfortunate lesson for westerners is that economic reform 
in socialist countries is not irreversible 
the report said that while chinas gross national product grew 
by more than 11 percent in 1988 and industrial output grew by 21 
percent those rates slumped in the first half of this year with 
industrial growth falling to an annual rate of 11 percent 
the government postponed price decontrol indefinitely and 
reimposed price controls on such commodities as steel copper 
aluminum and other materials controls over production marketing 
and distribution were recentralized 
international financial institutions such as the world bank and 
the asian development bank have suspended billions of dollars in 
lowinterest development loans 
chinas trade deficit reached 77 billion in 1988 and exports 
are slipping the cia reported estimating that export revenues 
fell by 100 million a day during the occupation of beijings 
tiananmen square by prodemocracy forces 
the cia projected a drop in foreign exchange earned through 
tourism from 1988s 22 billion to about 15 billion this year 
and said tourism could remain depressed into the 1990s

president bush sidestepping disputes with 
civil rights advocates pledged tuesday to work with them to halt 
the decline of inner cities and to remove barriers for minorities 
he vowed we will make america open and equal to all 
my administration is committed to reaching out to minorities 
to striking down barriers to free and open access bush told 
delegates to the 79th annual conference of the national urban 
league 
we will not tolerate discrimination bigotry or bias of any 
kind period he said 
the president got a cordial reception interrupted by applause 
10 times from a mostly black audience of several thousand people 
he did not unveil any initiatives nor did he address several 
areas where his administration has alienated civil rights groups 
such accepting without complaint supreme court rulings limiting 
affirmative action vetoing minimum wage legislation and nominating 
william lucas to be the justice departments top civil rights 
enforcer 
the detroit lawyers nomination was rejected by a senate 
committee after criticism by black leaders that lucas who also is 
black lacked experience in discrimination cases 
bush told the urban league that in many respects urban 
america offers a bleak picture an inner city in crisis with 
problems of crime drugs school dropouts and limited economic 
opportunities 
your problems are my problems bush said today i offer 
you my hand i offer you my word together we will make america 
open and equal to all together we will find a way to stop the 
decline in our inner cities to restore hope and make the 90s a 
decade of urban renaissance 
commenting afterward on the speech rep william gray dpa 
the majority whip of the house said i think what weve got here 
is a president whos got the right tone hes given us some 
criteria to judge him by but we havent seen the specifics the 
means for fighting that war on drugs the means of investing in 
education education is key but where is the money going to come 
from 
urban league president john e jacob said that in evaluating 
bushs administration i am willing to concede that the first six 
to eight months is the rhetoric period we will use the next 12 
months to determine how well he does in carrying that out 
his rhetoric is right jacob said he is saying the right 
things now we have to find out whether he is going to do the right 
things 
bush told the audience now im not afraid to say weve got 
hard work ahead of us weve got to wage war on poverty and wage 
war on despair wage war on the hopelessness that robs us of our 
future 
i want to tell all of you here im not going to relax in this 
job or rest until i know that i have done everything in my power to 
assure that we succeed that every child in our inner cities has a 
shot at a good job that every kid stays in school and gets a 
quality education yes lives in decent housing in a neighborhood 
free of drugs fear and violence 
bush accused by some civil rights leaders of failing to match 
his words with actions said that weve all spent a lot of time 
over the past two decades debating the best means of ending unequal 
treatment about affirmative action about quotas about goals 
and timetables 
however bush said that with americas population growing older 
there will be an abundance of job opportunities in the 1990s for 
every child growing up today black or white urban or rural 
there will be a job waiting 
bush noted that he has proposed a 250 million dollar increase 
in head start funds and had included in a 441 million education 
package some money for grants to schools hit hardest by drugs 
he called anew for approval of a program of enterprise zones 
giving tax breaks to innercity businesses and said that a 
sixyearold job training program has been helping disadvantaged 
youths enter the workforce 
there was no mention in the speech of a rumored trip by bush to 
central africa later this year white house aides said the 
possibility of such a trip is not being widely discussed in the 
administration 
meanwhile white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
bush has not decided whether to resubmit lucas name during the 
current congressional recess which would temporarily avoid the 
confirmation process 
likewise fitzwater indicated bush was not about to change his 
view that no new laws are needed to modify the supreme court 
rulings thats a decision thats already been made by the 
justice department fitzwater said

geoffrey palmer was installed as 
prime minister tuesday and said policies will remain the same 
including one barring us warships from new zealand ports because 
they might carry nuclear weapons 
new zealand became nuclearfree during the fiveyear tenure of 
his predecessor david lange who became involved in major disputes 
with the united states and france over the issue 
lange 47 resigned monday citing health reasons and the 
governing labor party chose palmer to succeed him 
palmer also 47 said of lange you have led with a vision and 
humanity that will be hard for any of us to match 
the nuclear argument with france began because of that countrys 
nuclear tests in the pacific and grew when french agents bombed a 
greenpeace ship docked in new zealand killing a photographer who 
worked for the environmental organization 
two agents involved in the 1985 bombing are back in france 
despite an agreement with langes government that they would be 
assigned to a french atoll in the pacific 
prime minister rabbie namaliu of papua new guinea said tuesday 
he would miss langes fearless diplomacy 
in a statement congratulating palmer state department spokesman 
richard bouchard said in washington the united states looks 
forward to productive dealings with new zealand under his 
leadership 
bob hawke prime minister of neighboring australia said he and 
palmer were close despite some policy differences palmer told a 
news conference new zealands future wellbeing depended on 
australia 
the economy deteriorated while lange was in office partly 
because of tight regulation and he appointed roger douglas to 
reform it 
douglas deregulated industry sold off state assets and wanted 
to go farther but lange said the social cost of moving so fast was 
too high 
early last year lange rejected douglass plans to take his 
approach into social services and the labor market sacred 
territories to the labor party 
they argued in public and lange fired douglas last december 
douglas was reelected to the cabinet last week and lange was 
supposed to give him a portfolio monday but resigned instead 
in a final swipe at douglas during his farewell speech lange 
said the juggernaut of the new right had been beaten 
an editorial tuesday in the sydney morning herald said the 
timing of the resignation suggests that health was not his only 
consideration by resigning now he makes it more difficult for mr 
douglas to become prime minister something that might have happned 
had he held on to the end of the year 
lange suffered a heart attack a year ago

washington the bush administration said tuesday that the 
nicaraguan contra rebels can remain together as a fighting force if 
they dont like the plan by central american presidents to disband 
them 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
administration is generally supportive of the pact agreed to by 
the presidents of costa rica nicaragua honduras el salvador and 
guatemala but he said were skeptical of nicaraguas 
commitment to democratic reforms 
the agreement calls for the rebels to voluntarily disband by 
dec 5 and be peacefully repatriated so long as the nicaraguan 
government moves toward democratic elections 
but the bush administration said the pact is far from the 
death sentence for the contras described by nicaraguan daniel 
ortega 
were clearly moving toward demobilization and repatriation 
said fitzwater were moving in that direction but i think 
its too early to say that the games over 
our policy is we would not like to see demobilization 
before the election set for feb 25 he told reporters 
the 120day plan set out in accords signed by the presidents 
monday set a 30day deadline for a joint unorganization of 
american states observer mission to be organized and another 90 
days for the contras to demobilize 
the contras whose 10000 troops are encamped in honduras along 
the nicaraguan border are to be part of negotiations with the 
commission and the sandinistas to work out details of the 
demobilization us officials said 
but fitzwater emphasized that if the contras dont like the 
conditions developed by the commission the issue then is 
theyre still there if they dont agree to it theyre not 
demobilized 
us officials would not discuss what stand the bush 
administration would then take on renewed funding for the rebels 
the current aid package calls for 498 million in food clothes 
and other nonlethal aid to last through feb 28 next year 
state department officials refused to confirm reports that the 
administration had lobbied the central american leaders to keep the 
contras intact until the election 
the timetables and the issue of before and after the elections 
is not something that we focus on specifically said richard 
boucher spokesman for the state department what we focus on is 
the process and the steps needed to make the process work 
the center for democracy a private nonpartisan us group 
picked to monitor the nicaraguan election next february said the 
pacts success depend on how the provisions of a political accord 
last week between the sandinistas and opposition parties are 
implemented 
we are at the moment of truth with regard to nicaragua said 
allen weinstein the centers president one that can lead toward 
genuine democratization or away from those goals 
weinstein whose organization also monitored the 1986 philippine 
and the 1988 panamanian elections for the senate said the oas and 
un should also seek an immediate start to the promised amnesty 
for political prisoners and a plan to let the contras vote in the 
election without having to return to nicaragua 
us officials said they were pleased with the parts of the 
central american pact that call for an end to the nineyearold 
salvadoran civil war being waged by marxist rebels the voluntary 
nature of the demobilization and the requirement for verifiable 
conditions that will allow peaceful and secure repatriation of the 
contras 
they also said nicaraguas recent concessions announced on the 
eve of the central american presidents meeting to ease 
restrictions on the media coverage and allow voting by soldiers 
were a positive sign 
sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the foreign 
relations western hemisphere affairs subcommittee called for us 
cooperation with the accord 
it is our role as friends of democracy and as neighbors with 
a profound interest in the stability of the region to support this 
process dodd said tuesday

a federal grand jury is investigating former 
house speaker jim wrights book deal and has subpoenaed documents 
from at least three groups that directly or indirectly bought bulk 
copies of reflections of a public man for which wright earned 
royalties of 55 percent 
the justice department refused tuesday to disclose the nature of 
its investigation attorneys for two organizations said it involved 
wrights book and a spokesman for a third said it had also been 
subpoenaed for documents related to the former congressional leader 
the house ethics committee after a years investigation said 
it had reason to believe wright a texas democrat had tried to 
evade house limits on outside income through bulk sales of the 
book that investigation ended with wrights resignation in june 
attorneys for southwest texas state university and the national 
association of realtors said tuesday they had received subpoenas 
from a us district court grand jury here a spokesman for ocean 
spray a cranberry and citrus growers cooperative in massachusetts 
said documents from the group were also being sought by the grand 
jury 
southwest texas attorney bill fly said the university received a 
subpoena dated july 14 on monday and has until friday to submit 
documents surrouding wrights speech to the school in the fall of 
1984 and the subsequent purchase of 3000 worth of the book 
laurene janik general counsel for the realtors organization 
said the group is also responding to a grand jury subpoena relating 
to wrights book 
jack pettit managing partner of the washington office of the 
law firm of hopkins sutter hamel and park said it had been asked 
to supply some documents in connection with the grand jury 
investigation of wright and were happy to comply 
pettit who testified before the ethics committee said that 
as far as i can tell what they are asking for is pretty much 
what was asked for in the ethics committee investigation 
larry shannon administrative assistant at wrights office in 
fort worth said that the investigation appears very routine 
and that it resulted from the media attention focused on wright 
during the ethics investigation 
justice department spokesman david runkel said the agencys 
inquiry is continuing i cant comment on any aspect of the 
investigation except i will confirm that is ongoing he said 
southwest texas state attorney fly said the university had 
agreed to pay wright 3000 for a speech after wrights 
appearance someone in the speakers office called the university 
to say wright had reached his limit on outside income wrights 
staff member then asked if the speaker could use the 3000 to 
instead purchase copies of his book for the university fly said 
he said that wright endorsed the check and gave it over to his 
publisher 
we received about 504 copies of that book fly said 
under an agreement with the publisher of his book wright was to 
receive 55 percent royalties while the house limits what a member 
can keep in fees from speaking engagements to 30 percent of his or 
her congressional salary royalties are exempt 
ms janik said wright spoke to the realtors group in april 1985 
a 2000 check was issued and voided and the money was to be used 
to purchase wrights book she said but the realtors have no 
record of receiving copies of the book and no staff member has any 
recollection of seeing the books ms janik said 
ocean spray spokesman john lawlor said wright spoke to a group 
of growers and management employees in november 1985 but wrights 
staff suggested that instead of giving wright a 2000 honorarium 
ocean spray use the money to purchase 2000 worth of wrights 
books for the congressmans use 
as far as we were concerned it was an honorarium in the form 
of a book purchase in place of a cash honorarium lawlor said 
how he was to use them the books was for him to determine 
lawlor said ocean spray did not want to discuss details of the 
subpoena other than to confirm that they are limited to matters 
relating to the former speaker

bob bickers a cwa spokesman said before the meeting that the 
company had requested the session to informally discuss items that 
were already on the table 
five ibew pickets were arrested monday in philadelphia for 
allegedly violating the mass picketing ban but were discharged 
after a brief hearing before common pleas judge samuel lehrer 
joan toth president and business agent for local 1944 said 
there was confusion at the time of their arrest because their union 
wasnt named in the injunction 
michael kaine a bell of pennsylvania spokesman said the union 
later agreed to abide by the order and not force the company to go 
to court again 
meantime the flow of telephone service most of it automated 
and handled by computers continued at a near normal level 
management employees are doing their best to maintain service 
levels as close to normal as they can said bell of pennsylvania 
spokesman thomas duddy there is some slowness in getting 
directory assistance and in operator assistance for toll calls in 
our area of service 
but everything else which is automated is working fine the 
strike is having no effect on basic services like telephone calls 
from homes to homes and business to business 
john schaer spokesman for chesapeake and potomac telephone co 
in alexandria va said tuesday things are going pretty much as 
expected directory assistance is a little slow and were not 
doing installations as we would regularly were not at 100 percent 
but that was not to be expected

police and farmers with flashlights 
searched a remote mountain area tuesday night for the missing plane 
carrying rep mickey leland and 13 other people 
john guerra political officer at the us embassy in addis 
ababa said the search was conducted on foot and with the aid of 
jeeps trucks and other vehicles the aerial search was suspended 
at dusk tuesday 
embassy officials said several planes remained on dirt airstrips 
in the desolate area of southwestern ethiopia ready to resume the 
search at dawn 
the twinengine plane carrying leland and the other disappeared 
monday on its way to the fugnido refugee camp near the border with 
sudan 480 miles southwest of addis ababa 
the 44yearold texas democrat is chairman of the house select 
committee on hunger and he has taken a keen interest in africas 
refugee problem 
aboard the plane with him were eight other americans and five 
ethiopians his office in washington said the americans included 
patrice johnson lelands chief of staff hugh johnson of the 
hunger committee staff and joyce f williams from the staff of 
rep ron dellums dcalif 
president bush said he telephoned lelands wife alison in 
houston to express his concern and promise his administration will 
do all we can to learn what has happened 
shes strong has a lot of hope and we all pray that hes 
safe but told a meeting of the national urban league in 
washington where delegates observed a moment of silent prayer for 
lelands survival 
i think it says a lot about mickey that he was on his sixth 
humanitarian mission to help feed the hungry in that part of the 
world bush told the meeting 
state department spokesman richard boucher said ethiopias 
government has asked for a specialized search plane and that 
the united states is trying to find one to accommodate them 
we have offered to assist in every way we can boucher said 
heavy clouds and poor visibility hampered aerial sweeps tuesday 
as rescue planes crisscrossed the cold windswept plateau in 
ethiopia until sunset 
robert houdek us charge daffaires in addis ababa said 
searchers were encouraged by reports that a small plane was sighted 
monday circling a field at dembidola 75 miles from the refugee 
camp 
if it was our plane what we find encouraging is that it would 
have transversed a lot of the more treacherous terrain to 
fugnido said houdek he said dembidola is in an inaccessible 
region far from communications points which could provide a 
benign explanation for why we havent heard anything 
they could be sitting in the bush with the plane not capable 
of taking off but in good shape waiting for search and rescue 
houdek said 
at a briefing in washington leland press secretary alma newsom 
also was hopeful 
at this point no news is good news she said recalling 
being on similar trips with the congressman where air travel and 
communications were disrupted 
the safest thing for them to do was land and just sit tight 
and we think that is what the congressman did she said 
she was confident the sighted plane was lelands she said 
because ethiopian air controllers keep close tabs on planes and no 
others were supposed to be in the area 
also in washington rep gary ackerman dny said ethiopian 
authorities in the past have used bad weather as an excuse to 
prevent american congressmen from visiting refugee camps or other 
controversial sites 
ackerman said in june that he and leland were to visit northern 
refugee camps in march but were told their charter from addis ababa 
airport could not take off because of bad weather the lawmaker 
said the weather appeared fine 
lelands twin otter aircraft left addis ababa in heavy clouds 
and poor visibility at about 1030 am monday after a twohour 
delay caused by bad weather said embassy political officer john 
guerra 
the plane was last heard from about 15 minutes after it took off 
it was about 25 miles outside of addis at the time guerra 
said 
the twin otter a plane commonly used for bush flying in africa 
carried eight people who were members of lelands staff embassy 
personnel or officers of the us agency for international 
development the five ethiopians aboard were three government 
officials the pilot and copilot 
guerra said the pilot was highly experienced and had flown all 
over the treacherously mountainous country for international relief 
agencies 
half a dozen small planes were being used in the hunt directed 
by ethiopias civil aviation authority a c130 hercules cargo 
plane also was standing by 
fugnido camp is run by the un high commissioner for refugees 
and is one of four in the region that house more than 300000 
refugees who have fled civil war in neighboring sudan

a group that built a memorial to honor the 
citys vietnam war dead wants to ban political activity pets 
bicycles and radios at the site to preserve a dignified atmosphere 
the philadelphia vietnam veterans memorial fund also wants to 
ban sports and picnics 
its not just here in philly but across the nation these 
memorials have taken on the sanctity of a burial ground said 
district attorney ron castille the groups vice president 
the american civil liberties union called the proposal 
blatantly unconstitutional 
the streets and parks belong to the people and are free and 
open to them to communicate messages said stefan presser legal 
director of the aclu of pennsylvania if the fairmount park 
commission approves this there is no doubt in my mind it will be 
challenged out of this office 
the granite monument is inscribed with the names of 641 people 
killed in vietnam 
the memorial group said the proposed regulations are not a 
response to any specific activities but are intended to dignify 
the memorial 
the veterans fund wants to allow only memorial services or 
ceremonies honoring philadelphians who died or were listed as 
missing in action 
city officials and the memorial fund officers are negotiating 
for a deed of gift a document transferring control of the 
monument from the nonprofit memorial fund to the city it would 
then come under the park commissions jurisdiction 
under the proposal partisan activities would be banned 
including demonstrations for or against federal state or local 
governments or their policies 
also banned would be any activity by a political party or a 
group seeking publicity speechmaking of a partisan nature and 
picketing signwaving or leaflet distribution 
the memorial fund further wants to ban nonpolitical activities 
like soliciting sports picnics walking pets bicycling roller 
skating littering spitting and playing radios or other audio and 
video equipment 
william mifflin executive director of the park commission said 
the proposed regulations were unprecedented for his organization 
to my knowledge weve never had a regulation of this sort 
he said 
the commission will consider the funds proposal in october 
mifflin said 
lloyd ziff counsel to the memorial fund said the proposal was 
patterned after rules adopted by the national park service for the 
vietnam veterans memorial in washington dc and arlington 
national cemetery 
the memorial was dedicated in october 1987 after the memorial 
fund raised 12 million to build it 
on memorial day vandals splashed white paint on four parts of 
the wall listing the names of the dead veterans believed the 
desecration was the work of youths they had chased away about 3 am 
firefighters flushed water over the paint washing most of it 
away and crews of veterans spent hours before and after a memorial 
day ceremony scraping and cleaning away what was left

a quebec woman barred from an abortion by an 
injunction obtained by her former boyfriend went ahead with the 
procedure her lawyer told the supreme court on tuesday 
the courts nine justices had convened in emergency session in 
ottawa to hear the case of chantal daigle a quebec secretary who 
was believed to have just entered her 23rd week of pregnancy 
her lawyer daniel bedard did not say when or where ms daigle 
21 had the abortion he apologized to the court but asked for 
permission to proceed with the case because ms daigle faces 
contempt of court 
with the urgency removed from the need to proceed before an 
abortion would become increasing dangerous any decision on the 
injunction could now be days or weeks away 
ms daigles case had focused attention nationwide on abortion 
and the lack of a national abortion law it was the latest in a 
series of cases in provincial courts this summer 
canada has been without an abortion law since the supreme court 
in january 1988 ruled that the existing laws stringent 
requirements for approval infringed on a womans rights the house 
of commons failed to approve any of six proposals in july 1988 
the outcome was that abortion was a matter between a woman and 
her doctor until the provincial court cases emerged 
the quebec court of appeal last month upheld an injunction 
obtained by former nightclub bouncer jeanguy tremblay 25 ms 
daigles exboyfriend 
she faced a twoyear prison sentence and a 42500 fine if she 
proceeded with the abortion 
but there has not been a warrant for her arrest said john 
tymchyk prosecutor in val dor quebec where the injunction was 
granted 
were not the ones who would bring it he said its a 
civil injunction so it would have to be a private individual who 
brings contempt charges against her 
both tremblay and his lawyer henri kelada said in ottawa they 
did not want to take action for contempt against ms daigle 
in toronto robin rowe national coordinator for the canadian 
abortion rights action league said it was ms daigles personal 
decision 
it shows that women who want and need an abortion will get one 
no matter what the courts say ms rowe said 
prime minister brian mulroney has said parliament will consider 
the abortion issue this fall on return from recess 
the federal government has argued in the supreme court that 
abortion is within the exclusive legislative authority of the 
parliament of canada and should not be a matter for provincial 
courts to decide 
quebecs court of appeal was divided 32 in upholding the 
injunction basing the decision on the provincial charter of human 
rights justice yves bernier wrote in the majority position that 
the child that has been conceived but not born is a reality that 
must be taken into account

occasional sniper fire echoed across 
beiruts dividing green line on tuesday and reports said christian 
army commander gen michel aoun and his syrian foes were preparing 
for major battle 
people streamed from the bombravaged capital during a lull in 
combat to avoid what moslem bank employee nabil masri called the 
worst which is yet to come 
there is talk all over lebanon that they are preparing for 
either a long confrontation or a final battle we dont want to be 
here in either case said masri who was interviewed in moslem 
west beirut 
he said he was taking his wife and three children to settle in a 
rented apartment in sidon 25 miles south of beirut 
a police spokesman said no casualties were reported in tuesdays 
firing along confrontation lines in beirut and the nearby mountains 
five months of artillery duels between aouns 20000 
predominantly christian troops and syrias 40000 soldiers deployed 
in west beirut and other mainly moslem sectors of lebanon have 
killed 549 people and wounded 1322 
all but 200000 of beiruts 15 million residents have fled to 
safer areas in south lebanon the eastern bekaa valley or 
northeastern mountain resorts 
the newspaper annahar said syria has decided to fight a war 
of attrition in lebanon to achieve its aim of taming the christian 
camp 
the independent daily said syrian officials informed their 
leftist and lebanese moslem allies that president hafez assads 
damascus government will not accept any dialogue with gen aoun 
under any circumstances 
aoun 54 a maronite catholic has declared a war of 
liberation to drive syrian forces from territories they have 
controlled since 1976 
annahar said syrian troops may try to storm through the 
310squaremile christian enclave northeast of beirut to topple 
aoun 
sources from druse chief walid jumblatts progressive socialist 
party militia syrias main ally against aoun said the christians 
could try to break into syriancontrolled territory 
one ranking source said aoun has massed tanks and troops for 
an operation across the traditional front line 
the sources spoke on condition of anonymity 
more than a week ago a threemember arab league committee said 
its twomonth mediation effort here resulted in an impasse and 
blamed syria for blocking the initiative political deadlock 
followed 
the foreign ministers of morocco saudi arabia and algeria said 
they would report back to see if they should try to reactivate the 
mission 
an arab summit last may 26 asked king hassan ii of morocco king 
fahd of saudi arabia and president chadli bendjedid of algeria to 
work out a lebanon peace settlement by november 
us ambassador john mccarthy told reporters after a meeting 
with aoun that the bush administration has urged the arab leaders 
to pursue their efforts 
outgoing president amin gemayel in september appointed aoun to 
lead an interim christian cabinet that would rule pending election 
of a new head of state 
moslems and leftists rejected this appointment and pledged 
allegiance to acting prime minister salim hoss who heads the 
moslem cabinet vying for legitimacy with aouns 
the latest round of fighting broke out in march after aoun 
blockaded illegal ports run by syrianbacked militias south of 
beirut trying to salvage about 100 million lost annually in 
customs fees 
syrian and allied forces retaliated by shelling the christian 
enclave home to about 1 million people

columbia rejoined nasas fleet of 
active space shuttles tuesday blasting into orbit with five 
astronauts to put a 10ton spy satellite on a path over the soviet 
union china and the middle east 
columbia the oldest shuttle had been grounded for 3 years 
while it was stripped and overhauled from its toilet system to its 
outer skin its performance during the countdown and at liftoff was 
as troublefree as any of the previous 29 shuttle flights 
as good as new said bob sieck the launch director its 
going to be a gem of a vehicle 
the air force which booked the entire fiveday flight from the 
civilian space agency said nothing about the cargo in the 
shuttles 60footlong hold neither did nasa which shut down its 
public announcement network except for periodic alls well 
reports 
by custom shuttle crews launch satellites as early in the 
flight as possible to have the mission accomplished should they 
need to return home early if that practice was followed on this 
mission the satellite would have been released about seven hours 
after liftoff or about 4 pm edt 
there was no word however from nasa or the air force 
the mission is expected to end sunday with a landing at edwards 
air force base in california about 1030 am edt 
the shuttles path almost perpendicular from its seaside launch 
pad was a confirmation of prelaunch reports that it would travel 
on a northnortheast course instead of heading eastward 
the resulting highlatitude orbit takes it over poland the 
soviet union mongolia china and parts of the middle east not 
normally covered by eastwardbound shuttles the satellite is 
designed to take highly detailed photographs of troop movements 
military installations and other targets of interest 
sources close to the program said the satellite can make small 
adjustments to its orbit a flexibility that would enable it to 
respond to changing conditions on the ground 
the cargo bay reportedly holds a package of scientific 
instruments for military research possibly for the star wars 
missile defense project 
columbia a veteran of seven flights ended its last mission in 
january 1986 10 days before the challenger exploded with a loss of 
seven lives 
any time a vehicle is down for a long period of time its a 
little worrisome said jr thompson deputy administrator of the 
national aeronautics and space administration there were really 
no problems of any significance the weather was good to us 
columbias return restored the shuttle fleet to three ships 
atlantis is scheduled next for launch on oct 12 carrying the 
galileo probe to jupiter and discovery is scheduled for another 
military mission in november a replacement for challenger the 
endeavour is to join the fleet in 1992 
mission control said columbias trajectory was right down the 
middle of the pike a perfect path the two booster rockets 
floated down on parachutes into the atlantic ocean within sight of 
recovery ships launch was 837 am delayed about 40 minutes by 
ground fog 
not a word was heard publicly from the five astronauts who are 
commanded by air force col brewster shaw a veteran of two earlier 
shuttle flights including a 1983 trip on columbia the other crew 
members are navy cmdr richard richards navy cmdr david leestma 
army lt col james adamson and air force maj mark brown 
we had a completely clean and smooth ascent there are no 
problems whatsoever to report said launch commentator brian 
welch and then a news blackout began silence will be broken only 
if there is a major problem nasa said crew conversation will not 
be broadcast 
the mission is the fifth shuttle flight since launches resumed 
last september after a 2year hiatus prompted by the challenger 
disaster 
after the accident nasa concentrated on modifying the newer 
orbiters discovery and atlantis pirating parts from columbia 
discovery and atlantis each have made two trips into space since 
postchallenger flights resumed 
during the flight the astronauts were to check out the safety 
modifications made to columbia among the 258 changes that were 
made 
i think the recovery process is over said forrest 
mccartney director of the kennedy space center weve modified 
all three birds weve flown all three birds now and thats 
something we can be proud of

a jordanian soldier crossed the 
border tuesday shot and wounded an american and held an offduty 
israel soldier hostage for nearly four hours before a sharpshooter 
killed him officials said 
his victims said the man told them he was avenging a brother or 
sister killed by jews military officials said he was deranged and 
acted on his own 
the siege ended when israeli troops stormed a tool shed where 
the attacker held the hostage in a date grove near the kibbutz 
lotan a collective farm 12 miles north of the red sea resort of 
eilat and a few miles from the rugged mountains of jordan 
a sniper very cleanly picked him off said wendy maayan the 
kibbutz secretary who immigrated from minneapolis 
lt gen dan shomron armed forces chief of staff told army 
radio im convinced that jordan still continues to be 
responsible so that terrorism would not infiltrate from its borders 
into israel in spite of such insane soldiers 
in spite of this being a quiet border both the army and the 
civilians are trained to respond quickly to an infiltration 
jordan is doing its best to prevent infiltrations but sometimes 
its not successful 
israel television said fatah uprising claimed responsibility for 
the attack but it did not say where the claim was issued the 
syrianbacked group is an offshoot of yasser arafats mainstream 
fatah branch of the palestine liberation organization 
the wounded woman lauren rosen of englewood nj said on army 
radio she was walking with the soldier and another woman when 
this man in military uniform came out quickly from behind a 
tree about three trees ahead of us with a gun speaking in 
english something about a brother he fired one shot and i went to 
the ground 
officials at eilats yosef tal hospital said she was slightly 
wounded by a bullet that passed through her neck 
the attack occurred on her 25th birthday she said and i was 
very very lucky i feel just fine 
she said it would not frighten her away from the kibbutz an 
assortment of brown stucco buildings that was founded by american 
reform jews in 1983 and has about 80 residents a third of them 
us immmigrants it grows vegetables and dates 
a jordanian statement identified the attacker as farid ali 
mustafa and said he abandoned a border observation post 
armed with a usmade m16 the man attacked at 1130 am just 
outside the fenced kibbutz 
the army said hostage soldier osnat lev who is in an army unit 
that lives and works on collective farms was rescued after 3 pm 
by a special antiterrorist unit 
ms maayan said an israeli soldier fired one shot as other 
troops shouted and the attacker came into view through a door of 
the corrugated steel shed 
ms lev said on the radio her attacker kept mentioning a dead 
sister and asked the location of israeli army bases he could attack 
he said all the time that his sister was killed and why was 
she killed and why i killed her so i said i did not kill her at 
all he said that the jews killed her and now he comes to kill 
everybody the soldier said 
the sharpshooter fired into the shed about 500 yards from the 
kibbutz fence after soldiers attempted to negotiate with the 
attacker for hours radio reports said 
shlomo tushinsky a member of the kibbutz council said the 
gunman asked for a koran the moslem holy book and set a deadline 
a copy of koran was brought and several minutes after that the 
story was over he said other kibbutz residents said the arab 
was shot when he bent down to pick up the koran borrowed from some 
arab workers 
israel radio said there were unconfirmed reports the man asked 
for the release of sheik abdul karim obeid the lebanese shiite 
clergyman whose kidnapping by israel on july 27 has triggered a 
crisis over foreign hostages in lebanon deputy army spokesman col 
renaan gissin said there was no connection 
in tel aviv defense minister yitzhak rabin said the incident 
illustrates that israel faces a more immediate threat from terror 
than many other countries 
for us fighting terrorism is a matter of life and death 
he said 
two other border incidents this year involved jordan 
in may a jordanian soldier opened fire on an israeli patrol 
wounding two israeli soldiers before he was killed jordan later 
said he acted on his own in march two gunmen crossed the border 
and killed an israeli soldier a palestinian guerrilla group 
claimed the attack and jordan later announced that it had arrested 
several men in connection with the incident

lightning started more fires tuesday in the forests of the 
northwest where nearly a quarter of a million acres have burned in 
two weeks but the humidity was rising and scattered showers aided 
weary firefighters 
we had 24000 lightning strikes in one 24hour period 
throughout the west said ken showalter spokesman for the boise 
interagency fire center in boise idaho but we didnt pick up a 
lot of fires because theres some marine influence on the weather 
and theres been scattered showers with it the temperatures have 
gone down and the humidity is up 
the fire center national coordination center for fire 
suppression reported containment of fires that had been burning 
over 22000 acres in the west mainly in oregon and california and 
major gains were made against a number of idaho blazes 
more than 220000 acres have been charred in a bout of mostly 
lightningcaused fires that began july 26 manpower throughout the 
west still stood at 23000 but acreage still aflame was cut back 
to 160000 acres tuesday 
even without much rain the latest weather system sweeping in 
from the pacific did bring higher humidity to the region 
in hardesthit idaho several dozen residents of the town of 
lowman 70 miles northeast of boise were allowed back in their homes 
tuesday as firefighters had secured line around 60 percent of the 
43000acre lowman fire that destroyed over 10 million in 
structures 10 days ago 
theyre letting them back in on the condition they be prepared 
to leave immediately again boise national forest spokesman rick 
perkins said a big wind could change the picture real fast 
fire managers on a half dozen other blazes also had secure line 
along at least a third of their perimeters 
each day they get more strength in the lines spokesman 
barry gay said in general things are looking good considering 
showers were reported on the oregonidaho border over the 
10000acre emmett complex of fires in the hells canyon area and 
on monday night light rain pelted warren idaho which had been 
partially evacuated a week ago 
the north side of that fire that was threatening warren is

northeastern corner was contained monday night said liz rayno a 
forest service spokeswoman in portland it destroyed three 
structures at a remote mine and forced evacuation of campgrounds

red flag warnings in eastern washington although the 
thunderstorms did bring some rain the states biggest fire was 
2500 acres on the colville indian reservation in the northeastern 
corner 
crews contained two forest fires that had burned for more than a

two congressmen who are members of the 
helsinki commission received official permission tuesday to enter a 
soviet prison camp notorious for its treatment of dissidents perm 
camp 35 in the ural mountains 
reps chris smith rnj and frank wolf rva said they got 
approval to make the trip wednesday after meeting with soviet 
interior minister vadim bakatin and the countrys chief prosecutor 
alexander sukharev 
frank wolf and i are the first two congressman to go to the 
perm camp smith said in a telephone interview from moscow 
this like the other perm camps perm 36 and perm 361 are 
notorious for their mistreatment particularly of political 
prisoners smith said perm 35 has housed such prominent 
prisoners as natan sharansky who now lives in israel 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev contends all political 
prisoners have been released during his tenure although human 
rights groups believe dissidents remain in harsh labor camps 
former prisoners have said confinement at perm camp 35 about 
1000 miles from moscow and 80 miles outside the industrial town of 
perm includes everyotherday rations of bread and gruel 
bonechilling cold isolation cells and new punishments tacked onto 
their sentences 
were trying to make sure there are no prisoners of 
conscience make sure theyre treated fairly and adequately said 
wolf 
both congressmen think the visit could pressure the soviets to 
eliminate abuses before the helsinki conference on human rights 
convenes in moscow in 1991 
were here to promote the general human rights issue said 
smith who has arranged to meet with jewish dissidents members of 
the russian orthodox church and evangelical christians since 
arriving in moscow on friday 
according to people who are in perm just our visit helps to 
improve things in the short term smith said if the soviets 
are going to host a conference on human rights and have a very 
restrictive and oppressive series of camps of forced labor were 
going to raise the issue until we get meaningful reforms 
the first foreigner to observe perm 35 conditions am 
rosenthal a columnist and former executive editor of the new york 
times said that despite claims that dissidents have been released 
the camp held people who were put in jail for expressing their 
opinion or for trying to leave the country or for doing something 
that in a normal society would not be considered a crime 
although soviet authorities promised the journalist prisoners he 
talked to would not be punished rosenthal said i have reason to 
believe they have retaliated against one quite severely 
smith warned any retribution against perm prisoners he 
interviews would place the soviets human rights record in a very 
bad light 
the two originally planned to tour perm 35 with former white 
house counsel chuck colson a former aide to president richard m 
nixon who was convicted in the watergate scandal but the soviets 
restricted the visit to the lawmakers and a state department

hurricane dean moved across 
largely unpopulated areas of newfoundland tuesday causing little 
damage and was downgraded to a tropical storm 
jim abraham of the canadian hurricane center in halifax said 
there was concern when it appeared dean might affect st johns or 
other populated areas but it tracked right across good moose 
pasture 
the cold water of the north atlantic knocked much of the 
strength out of the storm and it lost even more crossing land 
abraham said dean would become just another low pressure system 
overnight 
winds of up to 50 mph whipped up 30 foot waves along 
newfoundlands south coast and fairly heavy rain fell in some 
areas but abraham said people in the area witness this type of 
wind several times each winter if youve ever been to 
newfoundland the trees along the coast are nothing to write home 
about 
eileen rose a cook at a restaurant in grand falls central 
newfoundland said some people were worried when they heard dean 
was on the way but when it arrived the storm didnt last very 
long it wasnt much for damage 
abraham said the storm followed a path about 80 miles wide 
across newfoundland and passed 60 miles north of st johns it 
came ashore at harbour breton on the south coast and returned to 
open water at bonavista on the northeast coast about four hours 
later

an urgent meeting of the security council to consider the policy 
of destabilization and coercion pursued by the united states 
against panama 
no date was set but requests for a council meeting usually are 
honored within a week or so 
ambassador leonardo a kam said in his letter that he sought a 
continuation of the council debate held april 28

sanctions in an attempt to remove him

panama canal which is to be turned over to panama in the year 2000 
under treaties signed in 1977 
in the april debate panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter 
claimed the united states was trying to provoke chaos and disorder 
in his country to justify military intervention

concocting claims of us interference to conceal its lack of 
freedom and its apparent intention to conduct fraudulent 
elections that were held may 7 
panamas opposition the roman catholic church and international 
observers said the opposition apparently won the election the 
government voided the results

an agreement to disband usbacked 
nicaraguan rebels was praised tuesday throughout most of central 
america and both sides in el salvadors civil war said the accords 
might help bring peace there 
but leaders of the rebels known as contras said their fighters 
wouldnt disarm until democracy is guaranteed in their homeland 
were ready to comply with the tela accords but its too 
early to talk about giving up our weapons said rebel military 
chief enrique bermudez in a telephone interview with the associated 
press 
the agreement reached monday by five central american presidents 
in a summit at tela honduras was a triumph for nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega he said the accord brought nicaragua to 
the gates of peace but the nation could not let down its guard 
until the contras are disbanded 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
the bush administration is generally supportive of the accord 
but is skeptical of nicaraguas commitment to democratic reforms 
he said it was up to the contras to decide to remain a fighting 
force if they dont like the plan to disband them 
the pact signed by the presidents of honduras nicaragua 
guatemala el salvador and costa rica calls for disarming and 
disbanding 11000 contra guerrillas and 12000 dependents based in 
honduras within 120 days or dec 5 
in return nicaragua promised to guarantee democracy allow the 
contras to return home and drop a suit in the world court against 
honduras over the contra bases 
in el salvador government officials and guerrillas praised the 
accords tuesday and said they could contribute to the quest to end 
the 10yearold war there 
the rebels farabundo marti national liberation front said over 
its clandesdtine radio station it vigorously applauds the 
agreement it called the accord a victory for revolutionary 
progressive independent and democratic forces of the region 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani said he was pleased with 
the result of the summit and underscored what he said was ortegas 
commitment to halt nicarguan support for the salvadoran rebels 
sources close to the talks in tela said us secretary of state 
james a baker iii had pressed for a delay until after nicaraguas 
leftist government holds elections scheduled for february 
but contra sources said the united states had already been 
trying to force rebel leaders to give up the fight and join the 
political process 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros bitterly called the accord a 
product of political confusion in washington 
the contras began fighting in 1981 accusing the sandinistas of 
betraying the ideals of the revolution that overthrew president 
anastasio somoza in july 1979 us nonlethal aid continues to the 
rebels but military aid was suspended in february 1988 
the scale of the fighting since then has declined so much that 
the sandinista government announced last week it was suspending the 
draft 
the agreement calls for a united nationsorganized observer 
commission un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said he 
was studying the long and complex agreement 
bermudez said he would meet with the un commission but no 
repatriation could take place until the sandinistas show they are 
headed toward democracy 
ortega has set an election for feb 25 last week he got his 
domestic political opponents to join in a call for disbandment of 
the contras 
members of the nicaragua opposition on tuesday attributed the 
accord to the thaw between washington and moscow saying reduced 
soviet support was forcing the sandinistas to compromise 
neither side is interested in using third world conflicts to 
get at the other any more conservative politician emilio alvarez 
montalvan said in managua the nicaraguan capital 
a source close to president oscar arias of costa rica who won 
the nobel prize for starting the peace process two years ago said 
the five presidents went ahead with the agreement because they were 
convinced that nicaragua was serious about democratization 
arias noted however that previous central american accords 
fell apart and urged his fellow presidents to summon the 
political will needed for compliance 
honduran political will is a key factor because only the 
hondurans can cut off the contras us supply lifeline to border 
camps 
honduras has wanted to be rid of the contra problem ever since 
us military aid was withdrawn but also insists honduras can enjoy 
peaceful borders only when nicaragua becomes a democracy 
like most central americans the hondurans are weary of the 
fighting that has occupied their minds and sapped their economies 
for a decade 
most commentators in honduras hailed president jose azcona hoyo 
although the conservative newspaper la prensa called the agreement 
onesided its clear what the sandinistas got its not 
absolutely clear what they gave up 
bermudez said contra fighters would face three choices if the 
accord goes through exile return to nicaragua peacefully or keep 
fighting inside nicaragua 
speaking on condition of anonymity as did other sources contra 
officials said they feared some fighters would not give up no 
matter what and would return to nicaragua in small bands that would 
be massacred by the sandinista army 
in any case we have to consult the fighting men and see what 
they want to do bermudez said 
a contra official said us funding for the groups miami office 
was cut from 262000 a month to 24000 with more than 100 people 
laid off he accused us officials of trying to force contra 
leaders back into nicaragua we dont have more than five people 
left said xavier arguello a contra adviser in miami 
staffing at offices in costa rica also has been severely cut 
contra officials said

firefighters tuesday doused a rubbish fire 
that had buckled a section of a major highway while a judge 
ordered the dump where the waste was found to remove garbage piled 
beneath two busy roadways 
a twojudge appeals panel ordered hub recycling and scrap metals 
co to refuse any more construction waste until a lower court can 
decide whether the facility poses a threat to the community 
the judges also told hub recycling to clean out materials that 
lie beneath the highways interstate 78 and us route 22 and 
not place new waste under the roads 
flames and heat from a pile of debris monday buckled an elevated 
portion of interstate 78 a critical eastwest link with new york 
in one of the nations busiest highway interchanges state 
officials say repairs could take a year 
gov thomas kean lauded the decision by the appellate division 
of superior court saying it would pave the way for a cleanup at 
the site which state officials say is an illegal landfill 
with our hands no longer tied we can begin to clean up this 
mess and make sure the disaster doesnt get worse he said 
kean declared an emergency allowing new jersey to ask for 
federal help in paying for the repairs to the highway 
fire officials using bulldozers to reach buried pockets of 
flame said they had extinguished the blaze which on monday 
threatened to spread toward route 22 now the main alternate to 
motorists using interstate 78 
basically the fire is out but theres always the possibility 
of something being buried that wasnt knocked out said larry 
krieger a fire department spokesman 
fire officials are investigating arson and the state attorney 
generals office has opened a criminal investigation 
state officials allege hub was dumping materials illegally and 
said they have been trying for months to halt the piling up of 
waste at the fouracre site 
the events of the last 36 hours demonstrate that the existence 
of this facility poses an imminent threat to the area said 
assistant attorney general michael s caro he added that piles of 
garbage at the site hindered firefighters and emergency workers 
access to the dump

conducted outside the occupied lands or define all other forms of 
battle

under international supervision after the withdrawal of israeli 
forces as part of a global plan for a definitive solution to 
the israeliarab conflict

clinics perform pregnancy tests and refer patients to doctors who 
perform abortions

has been effectively cut off by antiabortion activists 
ive been very badly hurt by a successful campaign by 
antiabortion forces who threatened to picket or bomb colleges or 
universities where i appeared he said

their behalf

when he was asked to leave because he was a man

privacy amendment and want to pressure us marshals into escorting 
women to abortion clinics to prevent harassment by antiabortion

the new jersey supreme court ruled tuesday 
that publication of a living womans obituary did not necessarily 
harm her reputation and thus does not constitute libel 
the high court affirmed two lower court rulings against a family 
that sued the princeton packet which in 1985 published the 
obituary of a woman who had not died 
the publication is not defamatory because the reported death of 
an individual does not impugn someones reputation the court said 
in an unanimous opinion 
death is a natural state and demeans no one the court said 
one year after publication of the false obituary of marcy 
decker the woman her son and her mother sued for defamation and 
emotional distress 
the onetime princeton resident said the emotional effects 
contributed to the loss of her job and aided her exhusbands legal 
battle to gain custody of the couples child 
ms decker and her mother also claimed embarrassment and anxiety 
due to the publication of the obituary in the biweekly paper 
the court said the woman would not have legal redress unless the 
newspaper falsely reported demeaning circumstances surrounding the 
death moreover the court noted the packet acted properly by 
promptly publishing a retraction 
the publication of the death notice did not impute to the 
plaintiff any wrong and did not hold her up to ridicule the 
court said 
the seventh member of the court chief justice robert wilentz 
did not participate in the case

more than 3000 people are preparing to leave a 
small area of the russian republic where increased radiation has 
doubled the amount of illness since the 1986 nuclear disaster at 
chernobyl tass said tuesday 
one local manager reported that the gamma level at his home 
was 10 times higher than permissible levels despite 
decontamination and special sanitary measures hence a sick rate 
which has doubled in the region over the past three years the 
official news agency said 
it did not specify the illnesses the dispatch came from 
bryansk about 210 miles from chernobyl the regional center for an 
area including the 12 villages to be evacuated 
tass said scientists assured the villagers in 1986 they could 
stay if the area was properly decontaminated but experience 
proved them wrong and now more than three years after the 
disaster people are preparing to move 
villagers are awaiting final approval from government officials 
tass said 
in the past three years residents of the 12 villages have been 
careful to step on asphalt rather than grass because the 
concentration of radiation is higher in grass and have had food 
brought in the agency reported 
they no longer keep cattle for fear of contamination in the meat 
and milk it said 
the report follows a dispute between the government and 
scientists in neighboring byelorussia about further evacuations 
from the area around the nuclear power plant 
government officials in byelorussia north of chernobyl say 
11000 more people should be moved but scientists say 106000 
should be evacuated based on radiation levels in the area 
about 130000 were evacuated from around the plant in the 
northern ukraine after an explosion and fire in its no 4 reactor 
on april 26 1986 killed 31 people and released a cloud of 
radioactive material that circled the globe 
the 12 villages lie within a small part of the russian republic 
that borders byelorussia and the ukraine near chernobyl most of 
those evacuated so far have been from the ukraine and byelorussia

both sides in el salvadors 
10yearold civil war on tuesday praised the peace accords signed 
by five central american presidents and said they could contribute 
to the search for peace here 
the high command of the rebel farabundo marti national 
liberation front or fmln said it vigorously applauds the 
accords 
the presidents of el salvador guatemala honduras costa rica 
and nicaragua on monday signed an agreement for demobilizing within 
120 days the nicaraguan rebels based in honduras 
the presidents also exhorted the salvadoran government and fmln 
to negotiate a solution to the war which has killed an estimated 
70000 people 
in a communique over their clandestine radio station the 
salvadoran rebels called the accords a victory for revolutionary 
progressive independent and democratic forces of the region 
president alfredo cristiani who took office june 1 said he was 
pleased with the results of the threeday session in the honduran 
port of tela 
for the first time the salvadoran problem has been given this 
level of consideration by the presidents who commit themselves to 
contribute to peace in el salvador he said 
he underscored what he said was a commitment by nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega to halt his leftist governments support 
for the fmln 
however unlike sections of the accords dealing with nicaragua 
no procedure was specified for verifying or enforcing the 
salvadoran provisions 
col rene emilio ponce chief of the joint chiefs of staff 
nevertheless called the accords a big political defeat for the 
fmln 
the accords vehemently urge the fmln to agree to an 
immediate and effective ceasefire the rebels in tuesdays 
broadcast did not respond to that demand 
guillermo ungo president of the democratic revolutionary front 
said it was positive that el salvadors conflict was recognized at 
the summit 
cristiani had indicated he would try to link demobilization of 
the contras to demobilization of the fmln during the summit ungo 
and other leftist leaders applauded his decision not to do that 
eduardo colindres former chief of staff to christian democrat 
jose napoleon duarte who preceded cristiani as president also 
considered the tela accords positive 
they oblige cristiani to fulfill commitments to strengthening 
democracy he said 
both ungo and colindres noted the oppositions recent efforts to 
get negotiations going between the government and the fmln 
cristiani of the rightist arena party in his inaugural address 
offered to talk with the fmln but proposed a nongovernmental 
commission for such talks the rebels rejected that mechanism as 
dilatory and doomed to failure 
upon his return from honduras monday night the president said he 
now is willing to enter into a direct dialogue with the rebels

the national wildlife federation on tuesday 
asked a federal judge to force the commerce department to require 
gulf coast shrimpers to equip their nets with turtle excluder 
devices 
the departments temporary new regulations limiting trawl times 
do not protect endangered sea turtles as the department claims the 
federation argued 
the federation said it has learned that commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher has data from national marine fisheries service 
scientists that demonstrates the mortality rate from a 105minute 
tow time is more than four times greater than what the secretary 
has admitted 
mosbacher on monday promulgated regulations requiring shrimpers 
to lift their nets every 105 minutes to let any captured turtles 
escape 
a recent report from the team of scientists charged with 
managing recovery efforts for the severely endangered kemps ridley 
sea turtle states unequivocally that the species is physiologically 
unable to withstand tow times in lieu of of required excluder 
use the federation said in its petition to us district judge 
thomas hogan 
hogan is overseeing the federations legal attack on mosbachers 
failure to require excluder devices 
commerce spokesman reed boatright said he did not want to 
comment on the lawsuit now that hogan has a new petition before him 
hogan last week ordered mosbacher to adopt regulations of some 
sort by monday to protect sea turtles from drowning in shrimpers 
nets 
a new federal law last year requires shrimpers to use excluder 
devices big boxes attached to nets with hinged sides that turtles 
can swim through unless the secretary of commerce has good reason 
to require other protective measures 
the trawling regulation is to last only until sept 7 while the 
department solicits comment on what permanent regulations to adopt 
in light of conservation needs of sea turtle populations and the 
economics of the shrimp fishing industry 
mosbachers decided july 24 to suspend requirements for excluder 
devices after texas and louisiana shrimpers protested their use by 
blockading gulf coast shipping channels the shrimpers argue that 
the devices reduce their catch by as much as a third 
about 40 people organized by greenpeace protested the trawling 
rules in front of the commerce department tuesday morning chanting 
mosbacher mosbacher hear our plea save the turtles in the 
sea and carrying posters with slogans like shrimpers are 
crying but turtles are dying 
faced with mosbachers suspension the state of florida decided 
to proceed on its own gov bob martinez and his cabinet on tuesday 
unanimously approved new regulations requiring vessels more than 25 
feet long using florida waters to use excluder devices and shorter 
vessels to limit trawls to 90 minutes the governor and cabinet 
rejected requests for a delay to permit a court challenge 
atlantic coast shrimpers largely have agreed to use the devices 
environmentalists say

after the accident the coast guard said liftboats have a record 
of instability and a new inspection program began the day the avco 
5 overturned

accident and rig owners are expected to testify

san francisco bay area residents were 
jolted awake tuesday by a sharp earthquake that broke windows 
toppled groceries and startled a man into falling to his death from 
a fifthstory apartment window 
the quake occurred as state and federal emergency services 
officials prepared to conduct a twoday test of their response to a 
catastrophic earthquake 
the quake which hit with a jolt and rolled for 10 seconds 
caused only minor structural damage but was felt as far away as 
san luis obispo about 230 miles south of san francisco and in 
sonoma county 60 miles to the north 
the temblor struck at 113 am and measured 52 on the richter 
scale of ground motion it was centered on the san andreas fault 
about 15 miles south of san jose 
a moderate aftershock measuring 42 on the richter scale struck 
at 144 am followed by a second stronger aftershock that 
measured 45 at 853 am according to the us geological survey 
in menlo park 
i thought all my windows were going to break said margaret 
dunlap of san francisco my whole bed was shaking 
in los gatos where the quake was centered police reported that 
matthew james bignall 19 accidentally jumped from his bedroom 
window after apparently being startled awake by the earthquake 
bignall died of multiple injuries according to a spokeswoman 
with the santa clara county coroners office 
residents reported some broken windows and items falling off 
shelves but no major problems a los gatos police dispatcher said 
damage was confined mostly to santa clara and northern santa cruz 
counties according to the state office of emergency services in 
sacramento 
experts warned that the seismic activity signals an increased 
chance that a severe earthquake will strike the area during the 
next week 
it certainly shows us the fault is becoming more active 
said andy michael a usgs geophysicist who said the quake was the 
largest in the area since 1969 
the stress is building up in the earth and were going to 
start getting large earthquakes said michael it should serve 
as a reminder to prepare 
dave shea 21 spent more than an hour cleaning up the paint 
store he manages in los gatos where about 20 cans fell off shelves 
and four quarts of paint splattered on the floor 
it made a nice little splotch mess he said estimating 
damage at about 300 
the false ceiling in a vacant los gatos business came down and 
about half a dozen businesses reported broken windows police said 
one of the front windows of a grocery store blew out according 
sharon sieker an assistant manager at the safeway she said she 
found red wine all over the floor when she arrived about 2 am 
pacific gas amp electric co and pacific bell reported no major 
problems as a result of the quake 
the earthquake drill involved a mock temblor in the bay area in 
which 5000 people die 
marilyn quayle wife of vice president dan quayle was in 
sacramento to attend the first day of the test when she woke up at 
530 am and saw coverage of the actual earthquake on television 
she thought it was part of the exercise 
i thought gee this is pretty interesting they have the 
earthquake simulation on television already mrs quayle said 
the openended richter scale is a measure of the energy released 
by an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a 
seisomograph 
san franciscos great quake which occurred in 1906 before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 recent 
estimates say more than 2000 people died in the quake and the fire 
it touched off which burned much of the city 
each increase of one number as in a jump from magnitude 55 to 
65 means that the ground motion is 10 times greater a quake of 
35 can cause slight damage in populated areas while a quake of 
60 can cause severe damage in march 1964 an earthquake in alaska 
hit 85 on the richter scale killing 114 people

us soldiers detained 29 panamanians 
who entered a restricted military area tuesday and released them 
after confiscating their weapons a spokeswoman for the us 
southern command reported 
she said among those briefly detained were 10 officers and 
troopers of the panamanian defense forces including maj manuel 
sieiro he is a brother inlaw of gen manuel antonio noriega who 
is commander of the defense force and controls the government 
the spokeswoman mercedes morris said five panamanian 
journalists were among the civilians in the group 
she said in a telephone interview the panamanians were detained 
because they ventured without authorization into a military 
zone reserved exclusively for american forces 
ms morris said about 40 us marines were conducting a 
reconnaissance exercise on roads leading to the panama canal when 
the panamanians entered the area in 15 vehicles 
a number of submachine guns rifles and pistols were confiscated 
and will be returned to the defense forces through a 
uspanamanian coordinating commission in charge of handling 
problems related to the security and defense of the canal ms 
morris said 
she said the panamanians were detained for about 1 hour and 15 
minutes 
ms morris was asked if the panamanians were held at gunpoint 
and she said the necessary security measures required in this 
case were taken she refused to give further details 
mayor alberto de santis of the town of arraijan 9 miles west of 
panama city and near the site where the incident occurred said the 
panamanians were stopped at gunpoint by the marines and held 
for 2 hours and 45 minutes 
he told reporters about 100 people demonstrated against the 
american troops as they passed through the town in six armored 
vehicles the panamaninan vehicles then appeared and followed the 
americans according to the mayor 
he said that at a jungle area a few miles outside of town the 
american vehicles turned around and the marines surrounded the 
panamanians at gunpoint and detained them 
sieiro is defense forces commander for the chorrera military 
area a few miles west of the capital and in the area where the 
incident took place 
a defense forces spokesman declined comment on the indicent 
the panamanian journalists asked that they not be identified by 
name 
the incident is the latest in a series of confrontations between 
american and panamanian troops in recent months 
noriega was indicted in february 1988 by two federal grand 
juries in florida on drug trafficking and money laundering charges 
the us imposed economic sanctions against panama last year when 
noriega refused to step down 
most of the incidents between panamanian and us troops 
involved the exchange of a few shots at nighttime and the 
occasional detention for a brief period of americans by panamanian 
police for alleged traffic violations no one has been reported 
hurt 
noriega has accused the united states of trying to force him to 
resign and replace him with a docile government to avoid 
turning the canal over to panama by the years 2000 as stipulated in 
treaties signed in 1977 
the american southern command insists it has the right to 
conduct military exercises in defense of the canal under the 
treaties 
the pronoriega news media calls the exercises a provocation

firefighters through upperstory windows

mexican newspapers said tuesday a visit by 
senior bush administration officials marked a new cordiality in 
relations with the united states but some said it could be just a 
honeymoon between new governments 
secretary of state james baker iii headed a delegation of 40 
us officials including four cabinet members at talks with 
mexican officials monday 
baker was quoted as saying no friendship was more important to 
the united states than that with mexico 
the unusually large delegation followed the bush 
administrations support of mexico in reaching an agreement with 
foreign creditor banks on reduction of its 107 billion foreign 
debt 
a spirit of greater understanding toward mexico was expressed 
there is hope that this meeting is the beginning of a new 
era el universal newspaper wrote 
in a frontpage editorial the daily uno mas uno said 
evidently relations are on a very distinct level from the tension 
that characterized relations with the government of ronald reagan 
reagan administration officials frequently accused mexico of 
failing to take sufficient action to stop drug trafficking of 
official corruption and of failing to support us policies in 
central america 
but the leftleaning la jornada the newspaper most critical of 
the mexican government and the united states said both 
administrations were new and there hadnt been time to discover 
more profound differences 
excelsior one of mexicos largest newspapers questioned the 
depth of the new harmony 
will all this be reality or just wishful thinking asked 
columnist miguel barbarena 
he said that on monday both sides skirted thorny issues such as 
central america and illegal mexican aliens in the united states he 
said the talks produced nothing concrete in narcotics control or 
financial questions 
an editorial in the same paper said the dangers persist that 
bilateral relations will take a distinct turn from what is 
anticipated 
in the weeks leading up to the debt settlement salinas took 
numerous steps to assuage washingtons major complaints corrupt 
union leaders were arrested a drug kingpin was jailed and foreign 
investment restrictions were relaxed

the united states on tuesday rejected any 
suggestion tying the fate of american hostages in lebanon to 
billions of dollars of iranian assets frozen in this country for 
nearly a decade 
the questions of the assets have no connection or linkage 
whatsoever with the hostage issue state department spokesman 
richard boucher said at a briefing for reporters 
bouchers comments came in response to a report in the 
englishlanguage tehran times which quoted a source as saying iran 
would definitely intercede to gain the release of the hostages if 
washington gave assurances it would release frozen iranian assets 
us assurances that the assets will be released should be 
concrete and there should be convincing grounds that these 
proposals will be translated into action the unidentified source 
told the newspaper 
at the white house meanwhile presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said 
there have been a good many messages back and forth between 
the united states and iran through various intermediaries over the 
last many days we wont comment on the specifics and wouldnt 
comment on whether or not they mentioned the assets in particular 
but he added that rafsanjani has mentioned that publicly 
before so its not a secret matter and weve answered it publicly 
before and since then i would say that theres no change on either 
side in that equation 
boucher repeating the longheld us position said the assets 
were in no way related to eight american hostages who are believed 
to be held by proiranian shiite moslems in lebanon 
he said that us officials continue with their intensive 
diplomatic efforts to free the hostages 
boucher noted that claims against the assets are pending before 
the iranus claims tribunal in the hague netherlands 
the tribunal set up in 1981 after iran freed american hostages 
held at the us embassy in tehran has carried out its work in a 
nonpolitical environment officials said 
what is really unique is that it is resolving a whole host a 
class of tough technical issues between all kinds of claimants 
said one department official who like others asked that he not be 
identified 
since it was established the tribunal composed of nine 
international judges has resolved billions of dollars worth of 
claims stemming from the rupture in diplomatic relations between 
the two nations in 1979 
at the time the united states froze iranian assets including 
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military equipment 
purchased by shah mohammed reza pahlavi before his regime was 
toppled iran also seized us assets many belonging to american 
firms 
when the tribunal was established in 1981 the united states 
transferred 99 billion in frozen assets to its supervision some 
38 billion was transferred to iran with the rest going to 
various escrow accounts under the tribunal the state department 
said 
interest on the escrow accounts amounts to more than 13 
billion the department said 
although the united states has little control over assets 
controlled by the tribunal iran has made claims against the 
washington for other money specifically for military hardware it 
says was paid for but not received 
iran now claims claims that money amounts to 12 billion the 
state department said it could not determined the amount the shah 
paid upfront for equipment the shah had contracted for 20 billion 
in equipment by 1979 the department said 
in august 1979 the revolutionary government of iran announced 
that it was cancelling 9 billion worth of arms contracts with the 
united states 
officials said the tribunal has settled scores of claims 
ranging from those made by individuals to those made by the 
respective governments us nationals have been awarded about 12 
billion through august 1989 and the tribunal has awarded about 
118 million in cases brought by iranian nationals the department 
said 
iran has generally adhered to the tribunals decisions making 
payments t claimants when ordered to do so officials said some 
american companies however have appealed the tribunals decision 
in us courts effectively delaying payments they said 
the report in the tehran times echoed earlier statements by 
hashemi rafsanjani irans president and formerly the countrys 
parliamentary speaker 
in early 1987 rafsanjani brought up the issue several times 
saying iran would intercede on behalf of the hostages if irans 
frozen assets were released

the race for mayor of this glittering 
crimeplagued southern capital became a oneman show tuesday when 
former mayor maynard jacksons only opponent quit the campaign 
i have decided that my greatest service now is to ensure that 
this campaign does not divide our citys families said michael 
lomax the fulton county commission chairman 
lomax told reporters he believed he might have been able to win 
by pounding on the crime issue that has been his major campaign 
theme 
but he said i felt that it would have been too costly a 
victory and thats why i stepped aside 
he stopped short of endorsing jackson but said he pledged to 
work with him i have extended the olive branch he said i 
believe he will be generous enough of spirit to receive it 
the nonpartisan election is oct 3 to succeed mayor andrew 
young who cannot serve a third consecutive term 
lomax spokesman jim gray said earlier tuesday that lomax decided 
to quit the race because of his poor showing in recent polls 
the decision has been made that michael just cant win even 
though the gap has narrowed it hasnt narrowed enough gray said 
jackson said he was not ready to assume the mayors job was his 
i dont want to take anything for granted never ever do 
that jackson said after a speech to a business group tuesday 
both lomax and jackson are black democrats but the key to 
lomaxs chances was the white conservative business community that 
is a powerful minority in predominantly black atlanta 
jackson who became the citys first black mayor in 1974 and 
served two fouryear terms was often at odds with the business 
establishment but campaign aides say his support among whites this 
year is better than in either of his previous two races 
lomax tried and failed to capitalize on atlantas crime rate 
ranked worst in the nation in the latest fbi survey jackson 
meanwhile pledged not to let the citys ongoing construction and 
business boom overrun neighborhoods 
lomaxs withdrawal allows him to keep his job as chairman of the 
county commission which he would have been forced to give up next 
wednesday at the mayors race qualifying deadline 
jackson was mayor during atlantas string of child slayings and 
also endured a police department scandal over cheating on promotion 
exams but he was widely credited with adopting progressive race 
relations policies that opened the doors of city hall to blacks and 
women 
he refused to hold city functions at any organization that 
discriminated against minorities and began the citys affirmative 
action policies in contracts

the new zealand capital of 
wellington and the french city of lyons announced record bids 
tuesday to stage the 1990 world chess championship final 
the host for the 10week contest will be decided wednesday by a 
vote of the 89 delegates to the international chess federations 
annual meeting being held in this city on puerto ricos western 
coast 
in a potentially explosive move the federation decided tuesday 
to choose the venue for the final without consulting the players 
wellington offered prize money of 3 million swiss francs about 
18 million plus 37000 for the federations fund to promote the 
game in developing countries 
lyons offered the same prize fund and a trophy encrusted with 
diamonds and gold valued at 93000 for the winner 
according to international chess federation rules up to 20 
percent of the total world championship prizes will go to its fund 
for developing nations 
this is a window of opportunity for chess in the southern 
hemisphere gillian houser representing new zealands organizing 
committee told delegates 
the french bid was supported by former soviet world champion 
boris spassky who now lives in and plays for france 
the 1987 title dual in seville spain between garri kasparov 
and fellow soviet anatoly karpov raised a record of 285 million 
swiss francs then about 18 million 
delegates to the 124member international chess federation 
decided by a vote of 596 with 12 abstentions to change the rules 
governing the choice of venue 
in recent contests the titleholder and challenger have visited 
the prospective venues before stating their preferences in 1987 
kasparov and karpov chose different cities and the match was 
awarded to the highest bidder seville 
the rule change means the host city for the 1990 final will be 
chosen without consulting the champion kasparov or his 
challenger who will be known after the final qualifying match next 
march 
in a further attempt to impose its authority over the leading 
grandmasters the federation also decided that each player must 
accept match conditions within 28 days of the qualifying final if 
either the champion or challenger refuses his place will be taken 
up by a reserve

contractor to build a house on the property and to buy a car 
well move for a default judgment and seek damages but we 
want equitable transfer of the funds back to the federal

rentsubsidy program which gives developers subsidies to build 
housing for lowincome people

the saks fifth avenue department 
store chain said tuesday it has agreed to change its policy of 
charging customers for alterations on skirts and dresses but not 
for fixing suits blazers and slacks 
the outofcourt action settles a class action discrimination 
lawsuit filed by muriel mabry of anaheim hills and lori anderson of 
mission viejo who bought dresses and were charged 40 each for 
alterations at the same time the ritzy department store was 
tailoring suits slacks and blazers for free 
we are now adding several free alterations on dresses and 
skirts and we will continue to review the policy for similar 
appropriate revisions said patricia fox spokeswoman for the 
saks fifth avenue store in costa mesa 
mabry and anderson took their case to feminist attorney gloria 
allred who accused saks of illegal discrimination and asked the 
court to issue an injunction that would force the store to charge 
equally for alterations 
the suit also sought 250 for each woman hurt by saks bias over 
the past three years allred said the suit filed sept 8 1988 
was resolved amicably 
bill acton a spokesman for saks maintained that there had not 
been the issue of a double standard involved and that no damages 
were paid 
saks he said has never had a double standard so it cant 
agree to end one he explained that the store previously charged 
for work done on dresses and skirts because of the work involved 
however he said there was no charge for clothing that was 
considered unisex since 1980 he said there has been no charge 
for courtesy work on slacks or blazers done for men or women 
as a result of the settlement however the company decided to 
take a second look at its policy of charging for alterations 
done on skirts and dresses acton said 
allred lauded saks change in policy at a news conference 
tuesday 
saks response to the plaintiffs suit could serve as a model 
for the industry as a major force in the american fashion 
industry saks is sensitive to issues that affect women allred 
said outside the saks store in beverly hills 
many department stores charge women but not men for 
alterations others sometimes charge men a small fee for major 
alterations 
hopefully other large retail chains will follow suit and if 
they do not we expect that other women will file lawsuits as we 
did mabry said adding the victory is especially sweet in that 
two women size 2 and 4 could take such a big issue and prevail

antiapartheid leaders demonstrated tuesday in support of a 
national defiance campaign police reported widespread student 
unrest in townships near cape town 
tutu was among several opposition clergymen and academics who 
addressed a church service held in solidarity with former detainees 
who have begun defying restrictions imposed by police following 
their release 
the black anglican archbishop the 1984 nobel peace laureate 
joined about 60 people in a demonstration outside st georges 
cathedral after the service outdoor protest demonstrations are 
illegal but police did not intervene 
hundreds of activists released from detention this year were 
served with restriction orders requiring them to be at home each 
night and to report daily to local police stations many were 
banned from political activities 
on sunday 21 cape town area activists said they would defy 
their restrictions other former detainees are expected to join 
them on aug 20 as part of a defiance campaign begun this month by 
the antiapartheid movement 
in mixedrace townships near cape town students supporting the 
campaign have been staging protests and erecting street barricades 
several large rallies were held tuesday 
police headquarters said officers fired tear gas in three 
incidents monday to disperse crowds of students one delivery van 
was firebombed and other vehicles were stoned police said 
maj gen herman stadler a police spokesman said we can 
expect the unrest will increase toward the elections 
parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held sept 6 
residents of oukasie a ramshackle rural black township 
meanwhile won a potentially decisive court victory in their 
longrunning struggle against government efforts to relocate them 
their lawyer geoff budlender said tuesday 
pretoria supreme court justice kees van dijkhorst ruled monday 
that the government acted improperly last year when it declared the 
55yearold township an emergency camp 
under terms of the declaration rents in oukasie were raised by 
more than 50 percent unauthorized visitors were barred and 
permits were required to renovate homes civil rights workers said 
the declaration was imposed to make life so miserable oukasie 
residents would leave voluntarily 
government lawyers said tuesday they would appeal 
white authorities have tried for years to coax or coerce the 
approximately 6000 residents of oukasie into moving to a newer 
township 12 miles away 
the official reason for oukasies intended demise is that the 
government considers it an unhealthy slum 
residents believe the real reason is that oukasie is a few 
hundred yards from the white suburb of brits brits 30 miles west 
of pretoria is a stronghold of the farright conservative party

broke up over western iowa 
general electric spokesman david lane said tuesday that 
handbills have been distributed in an area of western iowa where 
parts of the engine may have landed to keep up interest in the 
search 
the engine parts are key in discovering why the dc10

control when hydraulic lines were cut the planes crew managed to 
guide the jumbo jet to sioux gateway airport at sioux city and 
attempted an emergency landing the fiery tumbling crash killed 
111 people of the 296 on board

owners and farmers he said the fliers specify the reward is for 
engine parts and offer as much as 1000 for some of the parts 
the search has been concentrated 60 miles east of sioux city

farmer found fragments of a jet fan blade while working in a hay 
field eddy said one fragment measured 10 by 12 inches

engine have not been located investigators have said that finding 
the disk and shaft would help them determine what caused the engine 
to malfunction

may elections in panama as a fraud agreed tuesday to lead a 
delegation to observe next winters elections in nicaragua

which will visit nicaragua at least once before the feb 25 
elections 
i will make sure that the members of my delegation will not 
interfere in the internal affairs of nicaragua and we will be 
impartial with respect to the candidates and parties competing for

when storms roll in the from the 
pacific the people of tuvalu look carefully at the waves in the 
lagoon for signs of the greenhouse effect 
one day it could be a matter of the survival of their island 
nation 
a slight rise in the sea level caused by manmade gases warming 
the atmosphere and melting polar ice would send storm waves 
crashing over this atoll where the highest point is only 12 feet 
above sea level 
at its narrowest this nation of eight inhabited coral atolls 
with a population of 8000 is only the width of a golf course 
fairway 
already in stormy weather winddriven waves break over the 
seawall into the hotel and over the front lawns of houses 
tuvaluans remember the 1972 hurricane that flattened every 
house toppled coconut trees and sent waves smashing across the 
island 
people had to cling to coconut trees to stop being washed 
away said prime minister tomasi puapua it was very 
frightening thats why we are so worried about the greenhouse 
effect old men say that now the winds from the west are stronger 
than they were in past days 
puapua said his fourman government was doing its best to keep 
up with the latest research on the greenhouse effect but this is 
difficult because tuvalu in the central pacific midway between 
hawaii and australia has no newspapers no television and only 
four hours of local radio broadcasting a day 
scientists predict the emissions of manmade gases from the 
worlds industrial complexes and automobiles could warm the 
atmosphere melt the polar ice cap and raise sea levels six inches 
to 45 feet by the year 2030 
our country would disappear puapua said other countries 
would have flooding but we would be swamped we would have to 
leave 
puapua said he welcomed an australian offer to spend 48 
million on a network of scientific stations around the pacific to 
monitor sea levels tides atmopsheric pressures temperatures and 
weather 
puapua holds some optimism about the future of tuvalu which 
became independent from britain in 1978 
this greenhouse may not happen he said we dont know we 
hope the scientists are wrong but we dont want to spend the next 
50 years worrying about it theres no need to panic 
prime minister bob hawke of australia recently told puapua and 
president ieremia tabai of neighboring kiribati that australia 
would consider resettling their populations if their islands had to 
be evacuated 
but i dont want to go puapua said 
meantime puapua and his government are moving ahead with 
development of the country formerly known as the ellice islands 
which occupies just 16 square miles of dry land and is so poor it 
is likely to remain dependent on outside aid forever according to 
a recent australian parliamentary inquiry on the pacific 
tuvalu gets 688 per capita in aid the highest in the pacific 
it has a per capita gross national product of 570 
despite the absence of resources the government is planning to 
pave the airports 1200foot grass runway in the hope of 
attracting tourists 
this would interfere with tuvalus soccer competititon because 
games are played on the airstrip a siren sounds 10 minutes before 
the twiceweekly flights arrive to give the players time to take 
down the goal posts and move their bicycles 
paving the runway which takes up half the land area of 
funafuti will mean the prison would have to be moved but it 
recently had only six prisoners all serving time for being drunk 
and disorderly police comissioner saloa tauia said there have been 
only two murders in his 33 years in the force 
although most of the population of polynesian islanders live at 
subsistence level they make a little money from stamp sales 
handicrafts copra sales and fishing 
most of their revenue comes from graduates of the marine academy 
who work as seamen on british and german merchant ships but to cut 
costs the germans recently reduced the salaries of tuvaluan seamen 
by twothirds to 145 a month 
the tuvaluans recently turned down an offer of 500 bicycles from 
south korea because they had nowhere to store them and were 
concerned they would rust in the salty air 
in any case they dont like taking aid and rather than take 
handouts each year they established the tuvalu trust fund with 30 
million in contributions from britain australia and new zealand 
the money is invested and managed by an indpedendent board the 
interest is used to pay the governments expenditures 
we would like to be independent financially puapua said 
but it is doubtful we can ever achieve that so we would like to 
live peacefully we say dont worry be happy

the logo of steven bochcos new production 
company making its debut in the fall will be an animated 
50yearold picture of his violinist father 
rudolph bochco who died in 1977 was in part the inspiration 
for the first series from steven bochco productions doogie 
howser md a halfhour comedydrama about a 16yearold 
doctor the show will premiere this fall on abc the first 
production from bochcos 10series deal with the network 
ive sort of always been interested in prodigies bochco 
told a meeting of the television critics association my dad was 
a prodigy and he was a violinist its just a fascinating kind of 
freak of nature they dont really understand why it happens 
prodigies were on bochcos mind when he hit upon the notion of 
a kid who by virtue of very specific circumstances had all of those 
prodigious abilities kind of laserfocused onto medicine 
i think a show like this assuming an audience accepts the 
fundamental premise can be very entertaining for years to come 
whether other people find it as intrinsically interesting as i do 
gee i dont know i hope they do 
bochco said he approached a doctor friend and asked would it be 
possible for a 16yearold to practice medicine 
he said well i dont know but let me look into this and 
ill get back to you he got back to me a day or two later there 
are absolutely no restrictions whatsoever on anybody of any age who 
has completed the required educational training to practice 
medicine 
i said you mean to tell me that a boy of 16 who cant go 
into a grocery store and buy a sixpack of beer can write a 
prescription for morphine 
it might be technically feasible for a 16yearold genius to 
work as a doctor but it remains to be seen whether audiences will 
buy the premise packaged as it is as a halfhour dramedy the 
form has failed to win high nielsen ratings in the past bochcos 
own hooperman lasted only two seasons but that made it the 
longestrunning of the batch of dramedies that showed up a couple 
of years ago except for the days and nights of molly dodd 
but that show had to move to cable to stay in production 
bochco has not given up on the format 
people have only been attempting these kinds of halfhours for 
a short time and its not unexpected that the majority of them 
like the majority of everything else will fail i continue to 
believe its an extremely viable form he said i mean i 
think wonder years is a real successful show and i dont think 
it falls into a typical halfhour sitcom format 
in the pilot doogie played by newcomer neil patrick harris 
kisses his first girl and suffers his first crisis as a physician 
ending the episode on a distinctly bittersweet note his parents 
are played by james b sikking hill street blues and belinda 
montgomery who played sonny crocketts exwife in miami vice 
bochco said subsequent episodes will not be as heavy on the 
drama as the pilot but he felt a serious approach was necessary at 
the outset to establish the credibility of the premise to 
demonstrate that the shows aim was not simply giggle giggle 
laugh laugh about a 16yearold doctor 
bochco said his deal with abc will progress slowly im going 
to try very hard to do no more than one project per season and 
he is still somewhat involved with his nbc creation la law 
though not on a daytoday basis 
he wouldnt elaborate on any future projects except to say 
theres one hour show that i desperately want to attempt to do 
hopefully in the next year and a half well manage to do it other 
than that i have no ideas for anything

american economic history in recent years is 
recorded in a series of shocks but the encouraging lesson that 
might be drawn from them is that somehow the country has survived 
them all 
more are coming accompanied by alarming predictions about the 
decline of america there is for instance the coming of a united 
europe in 1992 viewed by alarmists as a fortress europe that will 
exclude american goods 
before that time arrives however we must contend with the 
alarming report issued after the big stock market bust of 1987 in 
which 33 economists from 13 countries said the world economy was in 
the worst mess since the 1930s 
the crash the esteemed economists said was attributable to the 
existence of major and unsustainable imbalances in the world 
economy the most glaring of which was the growing indebtedness of 
the united states 
unless more decisive action is taken to correct existing 
imbalances at their roots the next few years could be the most 
troubled since the 1930s they stated in their report the 
global economic crisis after wall street 
theirs was not the first warning about imbalances 
throughout the 1980s publications flapped the storm flags about 
ruinous inflation soaring interest rates energy shortages and 
credit crunches the common theme was america living beyond its 
means the forecast collapse 
before that in 1979 president carter delivered his malaise 
speech americans suffered a crisis of confidence he said they 
doubted the purpose and meaning of their own lives they had lost 
their sense of national unity 
delivered from the heights of the presidency itself from a 
leader expected to correct such defects of spirit the speech was 
demoralizing some who didnt feel dispirited before the speech 
might have felt that way afterwards 
it was a time of other crises too especially that produced by 
the high price of imported oil can anybody forget the grim 
warnings of disaster of an america unable to compete in the world 
because it had been outfoxed by arabs 
if problems with oil wouldnt do america in then the japanese 
would why it was demonstrated in showrooms all over america the 
japanese produced better cars and lower prices and beat detroit in 
detroits own territory 
americans did everything wrong they consumed instead of 
produced spent instead of saved wasted time instead of putting 
their noses to the grindstone indulged themselves in the present 
instead of planning for the future 
considering the pace at which this transition was occurring it 
was said america would become a secondrate power by the turn of 
the century the future belonged to japan if not to the soviet 
union which would bury us economically if it didnt destroy us 
and probably the world in an atomic battle 
edward yardeni never one to join in the ecofadish economic 
fad thinking which generally is pessimistic and always alarming 
declares that things are not nearly what they might seem 
yardeni director of economics at prudentialbache securities 
talks instead about the triumph of capitalism the collapse of 
communism freemarket spirit global markets costreducing 
competition free trade economic reform technological innovation 
communications deemphasis of military 
the entire world he indicates may be reaching for another 
level of achievement it is a dynamic one in which problems are 
more transitory than permanent and become resolved eventually 
rather than allowed to destroy 
americans havent saved yes he concedes americans were young 
and in a consuming mood now that they are growing a bit older they 
will save emerging economies in contrast will take to spending 
like americans used to 
in a dynamic world problems arent necessarily permanent or 
reflective of national weaknesses the pessimists arent seeing 
the big global picture he says 
communism has failed capitalism has triumphed by 1993 us 
government bonds should yield 5 percent and the dow jones 
industrial average should be at 5000 which is a way of saying 
america will prevail

when joe and joyce cruzan visit their 
32yearold daughter in her bright private room at the missouri 
rehabilitation center they cant help wonder what she would tell 
them if she could speak 
she would say pull the plug stop it i dont want to live 
like this i have no dignity joe said during a visit to the 
hospital where nancy cruzan has lain comatose for six years i 
think that probably would be the key word no dignity 
she used to come to me and say dad my car is not running 
very well and i would fix it for her now its dad im in a 
situation that i cant help can you do something for me 
so far the answer has been no 
the cruzans hope that will change this fall when the us 
supreme court rules on their request to remove feeding tubes that 
sustain nancys life the case is the first time the court has 
agreed to consider the troubling issue of when it is appropriate to 
stop medical treatment to pull the plug on a life 
the cruzans world changed forever on jan 11 1983 nancy 
driving home from work lost control of her car and it overturned 
at first she was presumed dead by the time paramedics revived her 
she had irreparable brain damage 
ever since nancy cruzan has been in what doctors call a 
persistent vegetative state 
lying in bed in a small fourthfloor room she breathes on her 
own but by all accounts is unaware of her surroundings birthday 
and greeting cards are taped to a window a widebrimmed straw hat 
with ribbons hangs near the door 
nancys body is stiff and her hands so contracted that her 
fingernails cut into her wrist if not trimmed her eyes are 
sometimes open roaming aimlessly but she does not respond to 
voices or gestures 
the cruzans visit weekly joyce makes colorful gowns for her 
daughter to wear instead of drab hospitalissued clothing she 
used to talk to her daughter during those visits but not so much 
anymore 
its always been an exercise in futility its always been 
more for me i used to come in and tell her everything and now 
sometimes i tell her stuff sometimes i just brush her hair and 
sit and touch her 
medical experts say nancy cruzan could live another 30 or 40 
years as long as she is given food and water through a feeding 
tube implanted in her stomach 
the cruzans who live in carterville in southwest missouri have 
fought for approval to remove the tube 
a state court judge said a year ago they could ask the hospital 
to remove the feeding tube but the missouri supreme court 
overturned that decision in a 54 ruling last fall acting as her 
guardians the cruzans appealed to the us supreme court which is 
expected to hear the case in november or december 
no federal appellate court has ruled directly on the issue and 
opinions are split at the state level arizona and massachusetts 
high courts have ruled that such patients retain a federal 
constitutional right to refuse such treatment including feeding 
while missouri and washington ruled to the contrary said bill 
colby of kansas city the cruzans attorney 
in the most famous righttodie case the new jersey supreme 
court ruled in 1976 that joseph and julia quinlan had a right to 
take their comatose daughter karen ann off a respirator the us 
supreme court declined to review the case and karen died at age 31 
in 1985 nine years after her respirator was removed 
the cruzans like the quinlans want to remember their daughter 
as she was before her accident an independent young woman who 
enjoyed life 
if she had her way shed like to come back like she was 
said cruzan 55 a sheet metal worker thats what i wish but 
its not going to happen 
the crux of the cruzan case is the lack of a state law allowing 
removal of food and water in such cases in fact the missouri high 
court noted the state living will statute prohibits such removal 
from terminaly ill patients 
while the statute never was an issue in the case and nancy 
cruzan is not terminally ill it is important because it reflects 
the states policy of not including food and water as medical 
treatment that can be withdrawn 
colby is optimistic the supreme court will rule in favor of the 
cruzans 
its an important part of our countrys traditions that 
recognizes the sanctity of the family he said i think the 
us supreme court will continue to recognize the importance of the 
family in our case 
the state supreme court improperly discounted the rights of 
the individual in the 14th amendment he said that amendment 
says no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property 
without due process 
within this concept of individual liberty is the right for 
that person to accept or reject invasive medical treatment colby 
said 
missouri attorney general william webster while sympathetic to 
the family disagreed with colbys interpretation we dont 
believe the 14th amendment extends the right to privacy to remove 
food and water in this case 
the issue he said is whether the constitutional right of 
privacy extends to the right of a third party when the patient is 
not terminally ill to withdraw nutrition and hydration from an 
incompetent ward of the state 
the legislature could pass a statute allowing the removal of 
food and water from patients like ms cruzan although lawmakers 
this year refused to act on such a measure he said i cant 
project how i would feel if i was in their circumstances i dont 
know if anybody can 
but im not sure if the tragic nature of the circumstances 
gives rise to argue a constitutional right of privacy where the 
supreme court has been silent on the issue and the words dont 
appear in the constitution 
the ordeal has taken its toll on the family cruzan has trouble 
sleeping and his wife has taken medication to fight depression 
its always there just below the surface cruzan said 
when you go to bed at night and the first thing usually when you 
wake up in the morning

on the first day without wakes or 
funerals since the tragedy children are running in the farmyard 
spraying each other with a garden hose while their mothers shout 
for them to cut it out 
it would be a normal day but for one thing elmbrook the dairy 
farm nurtured by five generations of theuerkauf men over 108 years 
has no one to run it save for the widows and children 
inside the great white farmhouse linda theuerkauf and her 
children gather in a circle surrounded by memories and say the 
names 
first tom 
tom theuerkauf 27 was the first one into the manure pit 
through a narrow hole and down the ladder to clear the drain 12 
feet below 
then danny 
dan theuerkauf 15 quiet and thoughtful like his uncle tom had 
been cutting hay by himself for two years already part of the 
circle of theuerkauf farmers dan saw toms head hit the ladder and 
slip into the dark he sent his 8yearold brother brian for help 
and then went down 
and brian got bill first 
bill hofer 63 was the third man down a cousin who grew up 
across the lane from the theuerkaufs went to school with them and 
farmed with them 
and i got my grandpa 
carl theuerkauf sr 66 the day they buried him a patriarch 
with a love for farming surpassed only by his passion for his 
family he hated nothing more than when people wouldnt try yet he 
once stopped carl jr from running into a burning barn to save the 
cows the farm equipment the new tractor 
dorothy theuerkauf remembers her son said spray me down dad 
and ill go in carl said no way dont risk your life for 
machines 
carl sr stepped into the hole to save his son grandson and 
cousin 
and then my carl linda finishes the toll 
carl theuerkauf jr 37 was the last man down 
i dont know where he came from linda said he wasnt 
supposed to be on the farm that day 
at first no one knew what had happened men went into that pit 
every week to clear the drain before the pump was turned on but 
methane from the decaying sewage had built up during a heat wave 
it took only seconds for each man to collapse scant minutes to 
suffocate in air that contained no oxygen 
the automatic waste pit was one innovation cited in 1981 when 
michigan state university named carl sr the state farm manager of 
the year 
over five generations the theuerkaufs pronounced turkoff 
built elmbrook into the largest and most respected dairy farm in 
michigans upper peninsula gain the theuerkaufs trust and you had 
the ear of every farmer for 50 miles lose it as one state ag man 
did and your word is dirt a county agent said 
as their lives touched menominee county so did their july 26 
deaths newspapers carrying stories of the family sold out and 
people stood by the road in the rain when the funeral procession 
passed not since more than 700 people celebrated elmbrooks 
centennial a year ago july was there such a gathering 
carl sr was so proud of that centennial he was near tears at 
the county fair last year when they handed him the historical 
marker this year the fair was deserted what with the funerals 
and the rain 
the same gloom hung over elmbrook a cow was loose in the back 
field two newborn calves lay untended in the mud of a holding pen 
thick wet muck coated the stall floors in the dairy barn 
no longer is elmbrook a tight ship farmed by committee carl sr 
and sons tom and carl jr meeting in the yard every morning hands 
on hips debating the days work sometimes for an hour 
missing from those meetings was carl srs third boy bill a 
woodworker not a farmer carl once said he could handle anything 
so long as it wasnt a death but he cried three years ago when he 
learned bill had lost his hands in a car crash 
elmbrook still needs running the pit still waiting to be 
emptied sits like a vault beneath the dairy barn and nobody will 
go near it 
bill just 23 but aged incredibly it seems these past weeks 
is taking a crash course in his familys occupation scrambling 
between the paid hands and neighbors who volunteered to help what 
are you doing what must be done there 
that doesnt stop one of those raucous water fights with wet 
laughing theuerkauf children everywhere they splash each other 
like they did just the sunday before when their fathers and 
brother were throwing water too 
thats the kind of thing the theuerkaufs are keen to remember 
there are the sunday mornings when linda made waffles and carl 
jr would poke fun at her cooking tasteless tasteless he 
would say 
there are the sunday afternoons when carl and linda drove alone 
to see the cornfields and carl would talk of plans for the future 
the family the farm 
how carl loved the farm his dream was to make it the best 
farm it could be so we could be together linda said 
after the ambulances and the television crews linda awoke in 
the dark it was the hour carl would be getting up and she walked 
across the yard to the bright lights of the barn i stood and 
watched the man milk the last six cows it was 3 am and i felt 
carl there with me 
she smiled do i hate the farm because of what happened no 
but that night after they died linda hated elmbrook i just 
wanted to pack and move away and never come back 
in the trailer next door 5yearold tommy promises toms widow 
wendy he will take care of her twoyearold rachael cries at 
night toms pet german shepherd whines softly even the dog is 
lost wendy said 
she doesnt know if she will stay i have to see what my kids 
say what is the farm to them now pain love 
farming and elmbrook remain life and love for carl jrs 
children the oldest 16yearold becky sees her father and her 
brother dan in the work of the farm hands 
from a sandbox in the yard brian plotted how he and dan would 
run their own dairy operation brian tucked a toy tractor into 
dans coffin and the saturday they buried his big brother he 
begged to go home in time to turn on the tv wrestling shows so i 
can tell danny about it 
dan had wished for such a brother on the candles of a birthday 
cake a pregnant linda guessed it i said you wished for a baby 
brother and he started crying he said if somebody knows your 
wish it wont come true 
linda and her children are crowded together on the couch 
passing a rose and a carnation two flowers saved from the funeral 
the day before on the wall above hangs a portrait of elmbrook 
painted long ago by a relative 
for an afternoon brian becky 12yearold tracy and 
10yearold carrie sit with linda and tell warm funny stories 
dads california vacation that turned out to be tours of 
farms 
how grandpa would drive around lost never asking 
directions filling the car with cigar smoke until it seemed the 
journey would never end 
dannys favorite joke why did they outlaw round bales of 
hay because cows couldnt get a square meal 
what was your fathers favorite song linda asks they sing 
sugar in the morning sugar in the evening sugar at 
suppertime be my little sugar and love me all the time 
linda laughs pulling dark hair back from her face to show not 
tearswollen misery but twinkling eyes he sang that to me all of 
the time and he had a rotten singing voice 
they laugh and laugh then becky asks the question 
why why did he have to go down

american executives spend too much time on 
unproductive or unnecessary phone calls according to a survey of 
top corporate managers motivational systems a 
managementdevelopment consultant that preaches time management and 
efficiency surveyed the phone habits of 200 top executives at the 
largest 1000 us corporations 
the results according to company president roger flax show an 
undisciplined approach to the telephone that costs money and hurts 
productivity 
flax said the 200 executives responding to the survey were chief 
executive officers chief financial officers and managing partners 
of major companies they were questioned about the amount of time 
they spent on the phone the results they achieved and the number 
of followup calls needed 
overall the executives said they spend about 28 percent of 
their working days on the phone based on a ninehour work day 
flax said that means 13 hours a week or 145 weeks a year are 
spent on the phone 
flax estimates that about four of those weeks or hundreds of 
hours a year are wasted calling people back reaching the wrong 
person or simply not being organized enough to get the job done 
with one call 
flax said he tells clients of his west orangebased company that 
their servitude to the telephone is unneccesary he said phone time 
can be cut dramatically by making phone calls in clusters rather 
than interrupting the days routine by never leaving vague 
messages because they invite the same and by having a secretary 
screen incoming calls 
larry baker president of time management center inc of st 
louis said many executives are needlessly interrupted because 
their secretaries have not been taught which calls to let through 
and which can be better handled elsewhere 
he suggests keeping track of a weeks worth of incoming calls 
then going over the calls and classifying them so the secretary 
sees the principles behind the decisions he or she has to make 
baker uses four basic classifications calls that need to be put 
through directly those that should be referred elsewhere those 
the secretary can handle and calls that need returning each group 
can be broken into efficient subgroups he said 
the key is basing the system on the real world experience of 
calls that actually came in one week he said 
flax also suggests writing an informal agenda before important 
calls and learning the fine art of cutting the call short when the 
conversation gets sidetracked 
let the caller know that you have a meeting to attend a 
letter to dictate or a project that needs your attention he 
said some people need a gentle reminder that others may be 
pressed for time 
baker agrees 
when two people get on a telephone theyre really having a 
twoperson meeting he said the person who receives the call 
usually doesnt know its coming and so having an agenda gives the 
other person a great advantage 
david blake dean of rutgers universitys graduate school of 
management warns against going too far for the sake of efficiency 
he said executives must keep in mind that business is essentially a 
network of personal relationships 
the development of interpersonal skills and the ability to 
relate to people are both important components of a successful 
businessman he said we all seek efficiency but were making 
a mistake if we forsake social graces 
but blake agreed that an organized wellbalanced phone strategy 
produces superior results 
at american telephone amp telegraph co where one would not 
expect to find a passion for shorter telephone calls a range of 
courses is available to counsel executives and other clients on 
telephone technique 
jim taylor the district manager for client education training 
at the companys divisional headquarters in bridgewater said time 
management goes hand in hand with good communications 
if you manage your time efficiently as an executive for 
instance setting aside a time period to make most of your calls 
you get more done he said 
he stopped short of recommending brevity however

the government has accused two exstockbrokers 
and a lawyer of insider trading on information received indirectly 
from dennis levine the former investment banker who triggered the 
ongoing crackdown on wall street crime 
in a lawsuit the securities and exchange commission charges the 
three men and an investment company formed by two of them with 
unlawful trading in 15 stocks from march 1984 through june 1985 as 
part of an international trading ring 
the sec seeks alleged illicit profits and penalties totaling in 
the millions of dollars in the suit filed monday in us district 
court in manhattan 
the defendants allegedly received nonpublic information from 
bernhard meier who was levines account representative at bank leu 
international a bahamian bank through which levine ran his 198086 
illegal trading operation 
in some prior cases people who received inside information 
secondhand have not been charged but the lawsuit claims that the 
three men knew or should have known they were using nonpublic 
information about pending mergers or takeovers 
the complaint is the first against parties who allegedly 
received information through meier who in 1986 settled charges 
with the sec and was barred for life from the securities industry 
levine a former wall street banker pleaded guilty to violating 
securities laws and returned 116 million in illegal profits in 
june 1986 his admissions spawned dozens of civil and criminals 
charges in the continuing wall street insider trading investigation 
levine 36 who made millions trading on inside information on 
the stocks of companies targeted for takeovers was paroled from a 
federal prison last year he has said he has formed a private 
consulting firm in mergers and acquisitions 
the defendants are brian s campbell 32 of new york who 
worked at merrill lynch amp co from 1982 to february 1985 and then 
at smith barney harris upham amp co until june 1987 kevin barry

vehicle formed by campbell and barry in 1984 
the complaint details five of the 15 deals listing 452175 in 
alleged illegal profits made by the defendants friends and family 
members 
under federal securities laws the sec also is demanding three 
times the total in penalties sec attorney therese pritchard said 
unspecified profits were made in the 10 other deals but not listed 
in the lawsuit 
according to the lawsuit meier placed many of levines orders 
through accounts managed by campbell it also states that campbell 
and barry had separate stock dealings with meier 
campbell also traded securities using inside information through 
an account he shared with zubillaga the suit claims the two had 
an agreement to split profits and losses on the trades it says 
the lawsuit also claims that campbell helped meier and levine 
try to deceive the sec after they learned of the governments 
investigation providing reports purported to be stock analyses 
based on public information 
it also says meier destroyed documents showing that he had 
provided money used by campbell and barry in some real estate 
investments to further the alleged deception 
barry fallick campbells lawyer said his client would fully 
litigate the matters an attorney for barry michael pelletiere 
declined to comment sec lawyers said they would attempt to serve 
the suit on zubillaga in venezuela 
the 15 stocks listed as involved in the alleged illegal trading 
are gd searle amp co textron inc mcgraw edison co nabisco

million barrels a day in july nearly 3 million barrels higher 
than this time last year and about 2 million barrels more than the 
195 millionbarrel ceiling set by opec when it met in june 
one clear message seems to be that the system of proportional 
quota increases applied in vienna in june just doesnt work 
petroleum intelligence weekly an industry publication said in a 
report released monday 
revenue needs seem just as important as opec rivalries in 
sparking increased production this summer it said 
the international energy agency estimates that world oil 
consumption this year will average 521 million barrels a day 24 
percent more than in 1988 but demand appears to be easing 
too much oil last year led to a price drop of more than 5 in 
wti from 1852 on april 18 1988 to the years low of 1260 on 
oct 5 while analysts dont expect anything that dramatic this 
year they see prices continuing to weaken before they recover 
some predict prices could fall to 1750 a barrel before opecs 
next meeting scheduled for sept 23 in geneva to discuss whether 
to raise or lower the production cap in the final three months of 
the year 
eventually people feel opec will get it together and prices 
will get strong but in the immediate situation theres going to 
be a little bit of pain said james r fiedler vice president in 
charge of energy brokering for edampf man international futures 
inc 
dillard spriggs president of new yorkbased petroleum analysis 
ltd believes prices could fall even further to around 1650 a 
barrel by the time opec meets 
i see this continuing spriggs said opecs productive 
capacity is higher than people think and its growing particularly 
because of iraq 
iraq said recently that a new export pipeline would add 15 
million barrels a day to its current capacity by next year the 
repair of oil terminals damaged in its eightyear war with iran 
also is expected to expand its capacity 
weakness in the gasoline market also has pressured crude prices 
in recent weeks 
exaggerated estimates of strong demand and concern about supply 
problems due to the exxon oil spill in alaska refinery maintenance 
delays accidents and production problems in the north sea led 
refiners to produce too much gasoline too quickly as inventories 
piled up because of slow demand prices have eroded 
us refineries in recent days lowered the posted wellhead price 
for wti by 25 cents to 1725 a barrel

officials of ual corp say they will give 
careful consideration to an unsolicited takeover offer from 
investor marvin davis which sent shares of united airlines parent 
company soaring 28 percent 
the offer from davis who unsuccessfully bid to acquire the 
parent of northwest airlines earlier this year reportedly values 
ual at 200 a share or 432 billion although analysts say the 
price could rise if others make offers 
ual shares jumped 4625 to close at 21075 a share monday in 
heavy trading on the new york stock exchange 
ual described the offer monday as highly conditional but 
declined to give further information the ual board will consider 
it at a wednesday meeting officials said 
while the board of directors has not decided whether a sale of 
the company is in the best interest of the companys shareholders 
and other constituencies in keeping with its fiduciary duty the 
board will give careful consideration to mr davis proposal 
stephen m wolf ual chairman and president said in a statement 
jim fingeroth a spokesman for davis said the los angeles 
investor would not make any comment on his offer which was 
disclosed monday 
united is the nations secondlargest airline after american 
airlines in terms of paid passenger miles 
the carrier owns 80 percent of its 408jet fleet the highest 
percentage of ownership among the major carriers and a factor seen 
as enhancing its value to suitors its other planes are leased a 
practice common with airlines 
earlier this year united announced orders for as many as 370 
new boeing co aircraft valued at 1574 billion 
united also has a large route network in the pacific the 
worlds fastestgrowing airtravel region and last month one day 
before the deadly crash of a united dc10 near sioux city iowa 
the carrier filed petitions with the department of transportation 
for several new european routes 
louis marckesano an airline analyst for the philadelphiabased 
investment firm janney montgomery scott inc said davis bid is 
reasonable 
what i expect is that it will trigger interest in the 
airline he said the key is who will be new bidders which 
could include other airlines 
in 1987 members of the union representing uniteds pilots 
proposed an employee takeover of ual for 45 billion which was 
rejected as inadequate 
capt jim damron of the air line pilots association said monday 
the union has not seen davis proposal but that the unions 
financial and legal advisers would study it 
the pilots have a longtime interest in employee ownership in 
whatever form that would take damron said 
davis a former oil wildcatter who once owned moviemaker 20th 
centuryfox film corp prompted a takeover battle for nwa inc 
when he announced march 28 he had offered to purchase the eagan 
minnbased parent of northwest airlines for 90 a share 
the nwa board of directors rejected the offer and davis 
appealed directly to shareholders with a tender offer the board 
then put the airline on the market eventually selling it to a 
group headed by los angeles investor alfred checchi for 365 
billion or 121 a share 
ual stock rose sharply as a result of the nwa bidding going 
from 11750 in midjune to 190 in late july amid speculation that 
investors such as robert bass and davis had purchased stakes in ual 
the stock settled in recent trading closing friday at 16450 
but it soared monday as word spread about the davis bid opening at 
196 and climbing to 21075 at the close 
the us transportation department has indicated recently it 
would no longer look kindly on leveraged takeovers of major us 
airlines and marckesano said a highdebt bid for united could draw 
opposition 
it would weaken the company to such an extent it would not be 
a viable carrier he said 
but he said if someone with ample new equity like checchi 
makes an offer i dont see that much room for transportation 
department objection 
in reaction to davis bid standard amp poors corp put uniteds 
215 million in bbbrated industrial revenue bonds on review for 
possible downgrading such a move would increase borrowing costs 
for the airline 
united reported a 14 percent increase in its secondquarter 
profit from a year earlier for the quarter ended june 30 the 
airline reported net income of 141 million or 652 per share on 
revenue of 25 billion the company had revenue of 898 billion 
in all of 1988

us computer manufacturer 
hewlettpackard co has signed a technologysharing agreement with 
samsung electronics co and intends to resell lowend workstations 
built by the south korean company 
the move was seen as an effort by hewlettpackard to capture 
more of the burgeoning worldwide market for workstations 
highperformance desktop computers priced from 5000 to 100000 
by sharing technology on development of socalled reduced 
instruction set computer semiconductor chips hewlettpackard could 
gain a competitive edge over rival manufacturers who are trying to 
win acceptance for their own riscbased chips 
hewlettpackard is expected to devote it own manufacturing 
resources to highmargin workstations and other products said 
andrew allison a writer who follows the workstation market 
expected to reach 20 billion annually by 1992 
samsung is a very credible lowcost alternative for hp he 
said 
hewlettpackard rarely has resold computers built for it by 
others and the move indicates how serious hp is in fighting for a 
share of the workstation market allison said 
two weeks ago hewlettpackard announced its first agreement to 
share its computer technology in a deal with hitachi ltd of japan 
the two will develop superfast computer chips to be used in 
computers manufactured by both companies 
hewlettpackard last year bought apollo computer at the time 
the secondlargest maker of technical workstations 
samsung electronics a division of south koreas samsung group 
manufacturers both semiconductor chips and computers samsungs 
computers are expected to be in the 12000 range 
sun microsystems of mountain view is among the major competitor 
to hewlettpackard over the risc chip and computer market 
hewlettpackard plans to also share some advanced chipmaking 
techniques with samsung as well as a version of the its unix 
operating system samsung has the right to independently market 
products based on the technologies

a relatively low stock price and stable 
cash flow has prompted directors of the parent company of the long 
john silvers seafood shoppes chain to agree to be acquired for 
620 million 
warren w rosenthal chairman of the lexingtonbased jerrico 
inc said the stock price recently about 20 a share and cash 
flow 70 million a year could attract unfriendly offers a prime 
factor in the decision to sell 
once in play youre gone rosenthal said 
rather than leave the company open for that possibility 
rosenthal said when he was approached with what seemed like a good 
offer from the djsinverness amp co and castle harlan inc 
investment groups a couple of months ago he decided to explore it 
jerricos directors agreed to sell to the two new yorkbased 
investment groups for 2425 in cash per share of common stock 
rosenthal and david s weil vice chairman will retire when the 
transaction is completed other executives are to receive an 
ownership position in the company which also operates jerrys 
florenz and fazolis restaurants 
jerrico got its start as the white tavern shoppes a small chain 
of hamburger stands begun by jerome lederer in shelbyville ky in 
1929 
it soon moved to lexington and in 1946 started a jerrys 
restaurant in 1957 under rosenthal it began franchising the 
familystyle restaurant 
its first long john silvers seafood shoppe opened in 1969 the 
company the nations largest seafood chain now employs about 
18000 people nationwide 
but a mature restaurant business has slowed the companys growth 
and price increases in fish in recent years cut profit below 
anticipated levels that prompted a slowdown in construction plans 
the layoff of about 60 employees earlier in the year and general 
belt tightening 
such factors also have prompted speculation in recent months 
that the company was a takeover candidate 
in the past few months though jerricos fish prices have 
declined and cost cuts have improved its financial picture said 
leonard harlan president of castle harlan 
he and his fellow investors were attracted to jerrico for those 
reasons and because they believe that people as they become more 
health conscious are eating more fish 
harlans company owns the peasant restaurants a medium to 
higherpriced chain based in atlanta and the highpriced mortons 
restaurants of chicago 
djsinverness recently has acquired the sampa restaurant corp 
which operates the steak amp ale and bennigans chains 
the acquisition is contingent on the investment groups receiving 
at least 51 percent of jerricos stock under their offer

the las vegas reviewjournal and las vegas sun 
journalistic rivals for 39 years have announced plans to merge 
their business circulation and production operations 
the proposal is a move to save the sun which is losing about 3 
million a year has a debt of 107 million and has not been 
profitable since 1981 according to the proposal for a joint 
operating agreement 
the suns founder and feisty editor hank greenspun who died 
july 22 for years sought a joa with the more powerful 
reviewjournal an agreement was signed by the two papers july 12 
and the plan was announced onday 
if approved by the us justice department the plan will make 
las vegas at least the 19th us city to have a joa 
the agreement calls for both newspapers to maintain separate 
newsrooms and separate weekday editions the reviewjournal would 
remain a morning paper and the sun would become an afternoon 
publication but combined morning editions labeled the las vegas 
reviewjournalsun would be published on saturdays sundays and 
holidays 
without this move we believe the sun is in probable danger of 
financial failure sun president brian greenspun said in a 
statement with this move there will be no displacement of sun 
newsroom personnel and there will be the continuation of an 
important newspaper 
the reviewjournal is nevadas largest newspaper and the 
flagship for donrey media group which owns 59 us daily papers 
the sun is the states thirdlargest paper 
like many papers in a city with a dominant competitor the sun 
has been losing circulation it dropped 8 percent daily and 11 
percent sunday between 1980 and 1988 while the reviewjournals 
circulation increased 50 percent daily and 60 percent on sunday 
the reviewjournals daily circulation at the end of 1988 was 
121321 compared with 50515 for the sun sunday circulation was 
142923 for the reviewjournal 54669 for the sun 
under the joa the sun would receive 10 percent of the operating 
profits of the two newspapers and the reviewjournal would receive 
90 percent based on its stronger financial position 
the sun will give donrey media group 10 percent of the 
outstanding stock in community cable tv worth an estimated 20 
million and an option to purchase an additional 35 percent of the 
stock

local pilots for eastern airlines voted by a 
4to1 margin early today to continue their fivemonthold strike 
and a spokesman recommended a national airline walkout on labor day 
about 500 striking pilots and their spouses met for an 
informational meeting late monday with members of the national air 
line pilots association and voted 493121 not to return to work 
pilots union leaders will take the results of the straw ballot 
to washington later this week where they will be discussed by the 
groups 20member master executive councl which will plan future 
strike action pilots were voting in other cities around the 
country this week 
theres no compromising said dan klein a pilot with 
eastern for 26 years this has nothing to do about money its 
just plain old dignity 
an alpa spokesman said much of the sentiment in the closed 
meeting was to urge a national suspension of airline service near 
labor day weekend 
its easier to try to shut down the whole country than to 
continue alone said jack gray a spokesman for pilots in 
atlanta it would create political chaos and get presidential 
intervention 
he said such a suspension was just a tentative plan 
john mazor a spokesman at alpas washington headquarters said 
the unions national leadership has not taken a position yet on 
whether it would support a national walkout 
he said the possibility of a national walkout was among the 
topics that would be discussed in a meeting today between alpa 
president henry duffy and officials of the aflcio mazor would not 
say where that meeting was to take place 
pilots walked out on eastern in march in solidarity with the 
machinists union which struck eastern march 4 the airline a few 
days later filed for reorganization under chapter 11 bankruptcy 
eastern has said that under its reorganization it will need only 
1700 pilots it said that by the end of last week 380 pilots had 
crossed picket lines 300 newly hired pilots had completed training 
and 700 more were in training 
alpa has 3600 members employed for eastern 
from the outset eastern management has said it doesnt need the 
striking machinists union whose 8500 members include mechanics 
baggage handlers and other ground services workers

general electric co fired an 
engineer after a security investigation alleged he was homosexual 
then rehired him 17 days after he filed a federal lawsuit against 
the company the employee claims 
james m wood claims in the lawsuit which also names the 
department of defense as a defendant that his right to due process 
was violated when he was laid off in june from his job as an 
information systems engineer for ge aerospace the job required 
government security clearance 
on july 31 17 days after he filed the suit ge rehired him 
giving wood a similar job in another laboratory and back pay 
woods attorney cletus lyman told the philadelphia inquirer 
wood called the new job a step in the right direction toward 
making decisions based only on my qualifications 
wood and his attorney declined to say whether wood is a 
homosexual contending that only the perception of homosexuality 
caused his application to be derailed 
in his suit filed in us district court wood said one of his 
bosses told him in may that ge had withdrawn the application for 
security clearance a spokeswoman for the department of defense 
declined to comment on the lawsuit 
ge spokesman don norton declined comment but said that the 
security clearance is not a problem because this job does not 
require the level of security clearance that was needed for the job 
before 
in the suit wood 26 of philadelphia said the defendants 
violated government procedures by never giving him an acceptance or 
denial of his clearance application or holding a hearing where he 
could confront witnesses or examine the evidence against him 
the suit which does not ask for monetary damages asks that his 
application be processed without discrimination

united technologies corp has taken its 
norden systems subsidiary off the market after more than a year of 
looking unsuccessfully for a buyer willing to pay what utc thought 
the radarsystems maker was worth according to a letter to 
employees made public today 
the letter from division president edwin d decker was 
distributed to nordens 3500 employees monday 
hartfordbased utc announced in april 1988 that it planned to 
sell norden because it didnt feel norden fit into its overall 
plans and would fare better as part of a large defense electronics 
company 
norden a 400 millionayear company makes radar systems for 
aircraft and ships it also has a contract to make radar systems 
for the federal aviation administration 
utc had discussions with several companies but had but unable 
to conclude a sale on terms reflecting the true value of norden 
decker said 
decker said norden management had supported utcs decision to 
solicit bids for the norwalkbased subsidiary 
but he said the past year has been a frustrating and uncertain 
period for all of us noting the company had undergone many 
changes including an ongoing restructuring 
although norden sales had fallen in recent years the company is 
now on the rebound and decker predicted that norden would 
complete its turnaround to again contribute to the success of the 
corporation 
utcs other divisions include sikorsky helicopters and pratt and 
whitney aircraft 
norden founded 60 years ago by carl norden developed the 
norden bombsite used in american bombers at the end of world war ii 
norden spokesman scott brinckerhoff attributed the subsidiarys 
recent problems on the fact that there are a lot of pitfalls in 
building state of the art radar systems 
ours is very high risk business he said

soybeans suffered doubledigit losses tuesday on the chicago board 
of trade 
a wave of selling by several large brokerage houses near the 
close forced the november soybean contract to yet another low one

conrad leslie 
leslies report estimated this years soybean crop at 198 
billion bushels and corn at 759 billion bushels leslies figures 
above the averages of 195 billion for soybeans and 753 billion 
for corn that had been widely anticipated by the trade were 
supposed to have been embargoed until after the close of trading 
tuesday 
there wasnt any rhyme or reason to it said vic lespinasse 
a trader with dean witter reynolds inc chicago the market was 
on the defensive all day but there wasnt any fresh news at the 
close 
on the close wheat was 3 cents lower to unchanged with the 
contract for delivery in september at 391 a bushel corn was 1 
cents lower to cent higher with september at 224 a bushel

washington ampcopittsburgh said it had acquired 662000 shares of

oil futures prices rose tuesday in light 
trading pushed up by buyers hoping for a drop in oil inventories 
the american petroleum institutes weekly statistics on oil 
stocks were due out after the close of trading 
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate 
crude for delivery in septemer rose 21 cents to close at 1812 
wti the benchmark grade of light us crude fell 12 cents on 
monday in another quiet session

closed below 18 a barrel 
among refined products traded on the exchange unleaded gasoline 
for september rose 069 cent to finish at 5044 a gallon while 
september heating oil gained 012 cent to a settlement price of 
4856 cents a gallon 
except for a few upward blips crude prices have been falling 
since late july the september contract has lost 42 cents since 
july 25 when it traded at 1854 
analysts said the latest gains came on expectations that last 
weeks hurricane in the gulf of mexico would reduce some of the 
inventories that have been building lately sluggish demand and 
excess production by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries have increased the supplies of crude and gasoline in 
storage 
people were buying ahead of the apis said john hill energy 
broker for merrill lynch energy futures because of the hurricane 
last week people think there will be a drawdown in inventories 
the storm forced the shutdown of some refineries delaying the 
production of gasoline and other refined products 
despite the advance some traders said the underlying weakness 
in the market remains and prices could fall further 
we expect prices to continue on a downtrend said randall 
rothenberg trader with dean witter reynolds inc it might not be 
tomorrow or the next day but we expect the market to go down before 
it comes out of this doldrum

that growers with marginal crops are considering abandoning the 
acreage or trying to plant another crop

new york cotton exchange with the contract for delivery in october

on the defensive all day but there wasnt any fresh news at the

crude oil futures at 20 a barrel three weeks ago had been 
tending downward since but the price climbed above 18 and held 
the line tuesday at the new york mercantile exchange pulling the

else but the trade tends to rally on round numbers said jim 
ritterbusch of carson petroleum co chicago

a year in corporate limbo ended for norden 
systems inc with the announcement tuesday that the subsidiary of 
united technologies corp is no longer for sale 
the norwalkbased manufacturer of radar systems and other 
electronic military equipment was put up for sale in april 1988 
but utc decided to keep it after receiving offers it said were 
inadequate 
nordens 3460 employees learned of the decision monday in a 
letter from division president edwin d decker the letter was made 
public tuesday 
it wasnt a grudging kind of decision it really wasnt im 
pleased to be able to say that because if it was id really be 
feeling bad and im not decker who participated in the 
decision said during an interview at his office 
they would be delighted to have us return to profitability 
and thats what were going to do decker said predicting norden 
would begin to improve its bottom line after 1990 
security analyst michael bunyaner vice president of research 
with oppenheimer amp co in new york said norden was pulled off the 
auction block because the market is glutted with defenserelated 
businesses 
its not as an attractive property as it was a year ago he 
said 
norden has been part of hartfordbased utc since 1958 
decker said utc came close to selling the company on more than 
one occasion but he said no offers were made that came close to 
what utc executives and decker thought was a fair price for the 
400 millionayear company decker declined to name the suitors 
there was a lot of good interest by a couple of substantial 
companies that were intrigued with our technological 
capabilities he said 
since 1988 norden has eliminated nearly 700 jobs including 400 
that were announced in late may when a restructuring plan was 
revealed decker said more jobs might be cut after this year 
norden has been posting losses since 1986 those losses resulted 
in part from cost overruns and demands for additional investments 
in four new radar systems that were being developed simultaneously 
by norden for the military decker said the company spent 
hundreds of millions of dollars in development costs over the 
past four years 
in april norden was eliminated in april as a subcontractor to 
general dynamics corp for the navys advanced tactical aircraft 
or a12 norden had spent 114 million to design and develop the 
radar system for the a12 
norden has filed suit in stamford superior court seeking 
unspecified damages from general dynamics general dynamics which 
canceled the contract because it was reportedly dissatisfied with 
nordens performance has sought to have the suit dismissed because 
of the topsecret nature of the project 
decker declined comment on the lawsuit but said work on the two 
remaining radar systems is progressing he said norden is in the 
flighttest stage for both radar systems the final step before 
they are put in operation 
norden founded 60 years ago by carl norden developed the 
norden bombsite used in american bombers at the end of world war 
ii since that time virtually all of nordens business has been 
for the military 
decker said the company has no plans to expand into 
nondefenserelated areas and soon will announce details of two 
contracts signed in the past two weeks he revealed that the 
contracts are worth a total of 60 million 
utcs other divisions include sikorsky helicopters pratt amp 
whitney aircraft otis elevators and carrier air conditioners

china still could be a big customer for us 
grain but recent internal turmoil could delay progress developing 
that market an official of the us feed grains council said 
tuesday 
wuu hao director of the councils operation in china said the 
country is short on cash to buy feed grain 
but with more than a billion people to feed china needs to 
have more grain both for feeding to livestock for meat production 
and for making consumer products from corn flakes to beer 
they have to improve the diets said hao without happy 
citizens nothing will work 
the feed grains council will continue to focus on improving 
livestock feed production in china and on teaching the chinese 
modern livestock production techniques he said 
the poultry industry holds the greatest potential for growth in 
china because it offers faster profits and as a relatively new 
industry faces fewer government restrictions he said 
but pork remains the main meat in the chinese diet hao said 80 
percent of the total meat consumption is pork but production 
techniques are very primitive usually a couple of pigs in the 
yard eating crop waste 
only 10 percent of chinas 300 million hogs are fed a modern 
blended feed ration hao said adding that us feed grains council 
representatives are working with the chinese to change that 
in addition the chinese have started buying better swine 
breeding stock 
eventually hao said that will mean a demand for more feed 
grain but the chinese currently can afford to import only wheat 
flour to fill stomachs of the people he said 
the market right now is not very much because they just dont 
have the foreign exchange said hao 
its still too early to assess the impact of this summers 
violence on trade with the united states he said 
hao said he and the four people on his staff left china during 
the fighting because they did not know what to expect but have 
since returned to resume work in china 
among their projects are sending 4000 technical brochures on 
livestock feeding quarterly to government officials schools and 
others who could spread the information working with chinese 
producers on feed quality control to make sure animals are getting 
the nutrition they need and teaching feed management to producers 
the us feed grains council a private organization of farm and 
agribusiness groups was formed in 1960 to promote export markets 
for us corn barley and sorghum

bestknown retailing names which now operates under the name of 
fantles drugstores filed tuesday for bankruptcy court protection 
from creditors 
we deeply regret having to take the step of filing for 
bankruptcy relief sheldon fantle darts chairman said in a 
statement our board determined that it was far better to take 
this step now while our company has substantial resources to 
implement a plan of reorganization 
fantle led a group of investors that took over management of the 
company in november 1987 at that time dart owed more than 164 
million to bondholders and to its bank lenders it has paid more 
than 26 million in principal and interest payments on that debt 
we came to the conclusion that the company simply could not 
afford to continue to make payments on that amount of debt said 
fantle 
dart operates 69 retail drug stores in the washington dc 
area of which landover is a suburb and five totalplus discount 
stores in the richmond va area dart has more than 2000 
employees 
in the quarter ended april 29 it lost 73 million on revenue 
of 392 million against a loss of 96 million on revenue of 541 
million in the corresponding quarter a year earlier 
in the nine months ended april 29 the company lost 166 
million on sales of 1288 million compared with a loss of 133 
million on sales of 1749 million in the corresponding 
yearearlier period 
dart drug stores was founded in 1954 by herbert haft who sold 
the company to a management group in 1984 before going on to make a 
series of unsuccessful corporate takeover attempts under the mantle 
of his dart group corp which is unrelated to the drugstore chain 
fantle attempted to revamp the company by remodeling stores 
placing new emphasis on customer service restructuring the 
companys finances and starting an unusual plan to donate 5 percent 
of the companys gross receipts to charity 
the company filed its bankruptcy petition in us bankruptcy 
court in rockville under chapter 11 management may be permitted 
to operate the company while developing a reorganization plan

a call by eastern airlines pilots union leaders to
