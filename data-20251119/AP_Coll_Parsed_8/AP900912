comedian rodney dangerfield angered over 
questions about the severity of an eye injury he says he suffered 
in a steam bath accident at caesars palace lashed out wednesday at 
a lawyer for the casinohotel 
attorney louis meisinger defending the casino against a lawsuit 
filed by dangerfield questioned the comedian about the extent of 
problems he has had since the march 1988 incident 
what youre trying to do is make a liar out of me and im 
not dangerfield told meisinger during his second day on the 
stand 
you have a way of putting things in peoples mouths 
dangerfield said at one point 
the comment drew a rebuke from us district judge roger foley 
meisinger spent the morning session in a painstaking 
interrogation of dangerfield mostly about his actions following 
the backstage accident that prompted him to cancel several shows at 
the las vegas strip resort 
dangerfield is suing caesars for nonpayment of the 45000 a 
show he was to receive plus 5 million in damages caesars filed a 
countersuit seeking 100000 plus punitive damages 
dangerfield testified that he must put salve in his eyes nightly 
or he wakes up in extreme pain in the morning a condition he 
blamed on the accident 
the condition is always there now every minute it was never 
there before he said 
meisinger tried to show that dangerfield had gone to doctors for 
eye problems since 1977 and that he had used a dangerous 
prescription analgesic that doctors warned him against 
the only flash of humor came when the attorney produced records 
showing dangerfields vision had improved from 2030 in his right 
eye in 1977 to 2025 in december 1988 
i cant wait until im real old dangerfield replied ill 
have 1010 then 
dangerfield testified earlier that he scalded his eyes so bad he 
had to cancel shows at caesars because he was in too much pain to 
be funny 
dangerfield said he got relief from the pain only by wearing 
sunglasses which he said he could not wear onstage and still get 
laughs 
i cant work with sunglasses he said its not my image 
dangerfield admitted however that he went to see other 
comedians performing on the las vegas strip one of the nights he 
missed and went to a boxing match another night 
it was better than sitting in my room doing nothing he said 
dangerfield missed shows on march 17 18 and 19 then performed 
march 20 and 21 before cancelling a march 22 show before a packed 
house 
he said he walked onstage and cancelled the march 22 show 
because he was miffed over an effort by caesars to delay paying him 
for the shows he missed 
dangerfield left caesars after that and now performs across the 
strip at ballys hotel

the us military buildup in the persian gulf 
though adequate to defend saudi arabia against iraq wont be 
completed for about two months the us commander is quoted as 
saying 
such a completion would be about a month later than had been 
reported earlier 
give me another couple of months and we will surely have the 
forces on the ground that we need to defend saudi arabia against 
any attack they could possibly have said army gen h norman 
schwarzkopf in an interview appearing in thursday editions of the 
washington post 
the interview was conducted in riyadh saudi arabia 
the general was reported as saying the buildup is currently five 
or six days behind schedule because of delays caused by breakdowns 
aboard the navys eight fast transport ships that were supposed to 
have been ready to use at a moments notice 
the navy has been forced to use slower ships 
air force transport flights fell from 80 a day to 70 a day in 
the last week and will drop further as the heavily used aircraft 
are taken out of service for muchneeded maintenance including 
replacement of engines schwarzkopf said 
only about a third of the armys heavy tanks have arrived the 
newspaper said 
other unidentified officials were quoted as saying the air force 
planned to complete its deployment of combat units in the next two 
weeks and all commando units should be in place in the same period 
the good news is that at the most dangerous time everything 
went great schwarzkopf said the bad news is that it has 
slowed up but it doesnt matter as much as it did before 
the newspaper said officials put the us buildup at 143000 men 
and women including sailors at sea and are expecting more than 
50000 additional soldiers the current total is about 10000 fewer 
than some other reports

relatives of us hostages and soldiers caught up in the persian 
gulf crisis wanted to know more tuesday after president bush 
promised the nation that saddam husseins occupation of kuwait 
ultimately will fail 
they wanted to know how it will end and when their loved ones 
might come home 
yet at the same time they knew the president couldnt provide 
those answers 
it left me with a nonfeeling because all i know is that 
my husband is hot and miserable and without power said bonnie 
anderton of larkspur colo who last week left her husband at the 
us embassy in kuwait 
im not a political analyst but my basic feeling was kind of 
fractured shakespeare id like a little more matter and a little 
less art mrs anderton said after watching bushs address with 
her 10yearold daughter 
bush hailed the opportunity to move toward an historic period 
of cooperation among nations aligned against saddams aug 2 
invasion of kuwait and relatives of those in hiding or under the 
hot saudi arabian sun said they took comfort in his strong stand 
still the presidents vigor and words were not enough 
it was a good general talk but im at the point where i need 
more than generalities said donnita cole of odessa texas i 
want specifics i want my husband 
her husband oil worker john cole is among about 1800 
americans stranded inside iraq and kuwait 
at the same time more than 150000 us combat forces so far 
have been deployed to the region 
for all of their families the persian gulf situation that bush 
painted tuesday evening already has come home in a very personal 
way 
none of us want to fight but we will if we have to and win 
thats what the president was saying and i believe him said 
david heard of manassas va who has two sons on duty in the 
middle east 
congress and the public have appeared overwhelmingly supportive 
of the military buildup ordered by bush but polls have also shown 
growing concern over how long it will last and how much it will 
cost 
so far the persian gulf episode has been a great success story 
for mr bush and he is basking in the glory said gary orren 
a public opionion specialist at harvard university but any day 
now things could get a lot messier 
and then things will get much more specific in terms of 
what this is costing us and whether its worth the loss

former gov evan mecham battled millionaire 
developer j fife symington iii and three other republicans on 
tuesday as he sought an astonishing comeback 2 years after he was 
ousted through impeachment 
the three others sam steiger fred koory and bob barnes 
claimed selection of either mecham or symington would split the 
party and lead to a democratic victory in november 
with 3 percent of precincts reporting symington had 1205 votes 
or 45 percent to mechams 786 votes or 29 percent 
the prospect of a low turnout in arizona was regarded as a 
factor that could help mecham whose core of loyal supporters could 
be counted on to vote if the turnout is under 35 percent mecham 
could win it said bruce merrill director of the media research 
center at arizona state university 
former phoenix mayor terry goddard had 1729 votes or 82 percent 
in the early going while perennial candidate david moss had 379 
votes or 18 percent 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
democratic gov rose mofford who inherited the job when mecham 
was forced out decided not to run for a full term 
no one issue dominated the campaign so much as mecham himself 
although a 350 million tax hike enacted last june angered many 
voters 
mecham was elected governor in 1986 on his fifth try his term 
in office was short and stormy he was impeached by the state house 
and convicted by the senate in 1988 on charges of misusing money 
from supporters and interfering with a police investigation of an 
alleged death threat by one of his aides 
in office he was known for a conservative populist brand of 
politics and an outspoken some would say bombastic personal 
style he drew national attention for some of his positions most 
notably his diehard opposition to a holiday in honor of martin 
luther king jr 
symington the greatgrandson of us steel founder henry clay 
frick and nephew of former us sen stuart symington spared no 
expense in his first campaign for public office and spent much of 
his time attacking mecham for having made arizona the object of 
national derision 
steiger a former congressman and mecham aide ran an 
oldfashioned campaign shunning media consultants and taking 
positions similar to the ones he espoused while running for 
governor as a libertarian in 1982 
koory a former maricopa county supervisor had support from 
many of the partys rankandfile workers barnes a former mecham 
aide and teacher had little visible support 
on the democratic side goddard held commanding leads in money 
organization and polls over moss a former businessman

political novice sharon prattdixon scored an 
upset victory tuesday in the democratic primary to nominate a 
successor to mayor marion barry while jesse jackson gained the 
partys backing to become a shadow senator for the nations 
capital 
it looks wonderful dixon told supporters but she refused 
to to claim victory 
were going to wait until we get the final returns we dont 
count it until we have it thats exactly how were going to run 
the government dixon said 
in the race for the citys nonvoting house seat former carter 
administration official eleanor holmes norton defeated veteran city 
councilwoman betty ann kane 
former police chief maurice turner was unchallenged in the 
citys republican mayoral primary and attorney harry singleton was 
the only candidate for the gop delegates nomination but winners 
of the citys democratic primaries will be heavy favorites for 
election in november since democrats outnumber republicans by a 
91 margin 
barry announced in advance of his conviction on a single drug 
charge earlier this year he would not seek election to a fourth 
term as mayor his decision touched off a chain reaction that 
guarantees the city a toptobottom realignment of political 
leaders next year 
dixon won with 35 percent of the vote to 25 percent for city 
councilman john ray her closest rival in complete totals from the 
citys 140 precincts delegate walter fauntroy who gave up his 
nonvoting house seat to seek barrys job finished last in the 
fiveway field 
in the race for a nonvoting senate seat jackson had 56 percent 
of those ballots in a fiveway race for a pair of nominations 
it was jacksons first time on any ballot other than in a 
presidential primary the unofficial shadow senator post offers 
neither salary nor voting privileges in the senate and was 
established to lobby congress to grant statehood to the district of 
columbia 
ray led every poll taken in the weeks leading up to the 
election but dixon gained momentum from an endorsement by the 
washington post barry took a similar path to his first term in 
1978 winning a hotly contested threeway race after receiving an 
electionweek endosrement from the post 
norton had 39 percent of the vote to 33 percent for kane 
the battle for the citys nonvoting house seat heated up last 
weekend after the disclosure that ms norton frontrunner in the 
polls had filed no local tax returns from 1982 through 1989 kane 
had hoped an electioneve endorsement by the washington post would 
push her to victory 
norton said she thought her husband had filed the returns and 
over the weekend the couple sent the city more than 25000 to 
settle a 1982 tax dispute 
barry is running as an independent this fall for a city council 
seat

the us supreme court on tuesday had rejected a lastditch 
effort by two other death row inmates to block the execution and 
illinois high court turned back a challenge from deathpenalty 
opponents as well the appeals had argued that the injection system 
did not comply with the illinois capital punishment law 
walker however had opposed any attempt to save his life 
saying he preferred death to imprisonment for the murders of a 
young couple he tied to a tree shot and robbed im guilty i 
can accept my punishment he once said im sorry i done it 
yeah but its done 
walker became the 139th person executed in the united states 
since the us supreme courts 1976 ruling allowing states to 
resume use of the death penalty 
illinois which had not put an inmate to death since it sent a 
man to the electric chair in 1962 became the 16th state to resume 
executions since 1976 oklahoma became the 15th on monday 
walker watched television saw visitors and crocheted in his 
cell hours before his execution outside the prison about 200 
people held a silent candlelight vigil on a foggy hill most 
opposed the death penalty 
god said thou shalt not kill and i dont think he meant 
except when the state of illinois says its ok said mary

the case was closely watched by death penalty advocates 
including chicago mayor richard daley who praised gov james r 
thompsons refusal monday to commute walkers death sentence 
im all for walker being executed daley said tuesday 
think about the people he killed didnt they have a right to 
live 
walker had said a thirst for alcohol and money led him to kill 
kevin paule 21 and his fiancee sharon winker 25 they were 
slain while fishing near mascoutah in southwestern illinois 
less than eight hours before walker went to his death the us 
supreme court refused a stay by a vote of 61 with justice 
thurgood marshall who opposes capital punishment in all 
circumstances voting to block the execution justice harry 
blackmun did not take part in the case 
the illinois supreme court denied another request to block 
walkers execution that effort filed monday by the illinois 
coalition against the death penalty sought to block the state from 
using tax money on an execution method that opponents say fails to 
comply with the states death penalty law 
walker quit high school in fayetteville and went to 
jacksonville fla where his criminal record began with a vagrancy 
arrest 
he returned to fayetteville and worked as a laborer until 1958 
when he was arrested for participating in an autotheft ring from 
then until 1979 he was in prison most of the time for burglary 
for attacking a girlfriend and shooting at police for robbing a 
convenience store 
in all he has spent 24 of his 50 years in prison 
in 1983 walker decided to visit a favorite fishing spot where 
he met winker and paule enjoying an afternoon of fishing along 
silver creek 
walker said he talked with the couple then decided to rob them 
he said he threatened them with a pistol and began using duct tape 
to tie them to trees 
he planned to leave with their fishing tackle the 40 in 
paules wallet and winkers car but paule changed his plans 
paule said something to the effect of you cant get away 
with this i know you youre walker said sheriff mearl 
justus walker shot each once in the head with a 25caliber pistol 
and left to buy beer 
that night he robbed a bar and abandoned his car which held the 
couples fishing tackle and gave police the link between walker and 
the murders walker fled to colorado but was caught and returned 
to illinois where he confessed

the armybacked caretaker government 
today filed more charges of corruption against ousted prime 
minister benazir bhutto in what she sees as a political vendetta 
against her 
the charges were filed in the provincial capital of punjab 
before a special onejudge court set up by the caretaker government 
to try graft cases and disqualify candidates from the scheduled 
oct 24 election 
ms bhutto is planning to contest at least four seats in the 
217seat national assembly the lawmaking lower house of 
parliament nominations were to close at midnight tonight 
meanwhile another special court in lahore threw out a 
corruption charge against one of ms bhuttos former cabinet 
ministers citing lack of evidence 
the caretaker government comprised of ms bhuttos most 
outspoken critics and former allies provided few details about the 
charges against the former prime minister 
justice rashid aziz khan is expected to begin the proceedings on 
sept 16 
ms bhutto had no comment about the latest charges against her 
but earlier said the caretaker governments action was a 
political vendetta 
the 37yearold former prime minister head of the pakistan 
peoples party was dismissed aug 6 by president ghulam ishaq 
khan who accused the 20monthold government of rampant 
corruption nepotism and abuse of power 
earlier this week the caretaker government which accuses ms 
bhutto of heading pakistans most corrupt and inept government 
filed two corruption charges before a special tribunal in karachi 
her hometown the judge set a hearing for sept 18 to decide 
whether to accept the cases 
the charges allege she misused her power by hiring a foreign 
consulting firm with an asian development bank loan to oversee a 
power project in karachi and awarding a lucrative contract to a 
british firm to export cotton at rates below the international 
market 
if convicted of any charge the tribunals could not only 
disqualify her from next months polls but bar her from politics 
for seven years 
ms bhutto who won election in november 1988 and took office a 
month later as the first woman to lead a modern moslem nation has 
previously she will not appear before the tribunals if she 
refuses legal experts she could be arrested 
at least five former cabinet ministers had been charged with 
corruption and more than 100 supporters have been arrested in the 
past month 
besides her ministers and supporters ms bhuttos husband asif 
ali zardari also is a key target of corruption investigations the 
caretaker government has alleged zardari used the prime ministers 
position to hand out government jobs to friends and to demand 
commissions on government contracts 
zardari a karachi businessman has not been charged and he has 
repeatedly denied the allegations 
he has announced he will seek a seat in the federal legislature

the thrillseeking sport of bungee 
jumping was banned today pending review of an accident that injured 
the former miss australia and an experienced jumper 
natalie mccurry whose reign as miss australia ended monday 
suffered a broken collarbone when a cord came free as she and a 
staff member of the bungee bats group plunged 130 feet 
john fahey the new south wales industrial relations minister 
said the sport would be outlawed pending a report into the 
accident it was not immediately clear whether jumps would be 
allowed elsewhere in australia 
ms mccurry made a successful solo jump from a cage suspended by 
a crane off sydneys birkenhead point she then took a tandem 
plunge with crew member andy gulby 
they had their arms wrapped around each other and elastic cords 
attatched to their ankles were supposed to stop their fall a couple 
of yards above the water 
but one of the cords broke free from the cage leaving only the 
other to support the couples combined weight 
they hit the water and went under before the remaining cord 
stretched back then they dangled upside down for several minutes 
with their heads just above the surface 
an ambulance spokesman said they were treated for neck and back 
injuries and taken to nearby balmain hospital 
bungee bats director wayne page said all regular safety checks 
had taken place before the pair jumped 
he said the jumpers had gone through the usual weighins where 
cords were allocated with a tension to match their combined weight 
so they would not hit the water 
we dont really know what caused the problem he said 
bungee bats began public jumps in sydney last month after a 
threemonth battle with the department of industrial relations over 
safety concerns the department granted approval after tightening 
safety standards which included shortening cords to ensure jumpers 
did not enter the water 
participants pay 56 per jump 
one fatality and another serious injury have been reported in 
new zealand where the activity got its commercial start two years 
ago 
france recently introduced rules on bungeejumping after three 
deaths in 1989

primary voters set up the third 
gubernatorial battle in six years between republican incumbent 
edward d diprete and democratic businessman bruce g sundlun 
with new englands economy sagging diprete is vulnerable in his 
bid for a fourth twoyear term polls taken before tuesdays 
primary indicated dipretes approval rating 70 percent two years 
ago hovered around 20 percent 
diprete overwhelmed his sole gop primary challenger sundlun 
finished 9 percentage points ahead of his closest competitor in a 
field of three 
former rep edward p beards comeback try fell short as 
democrat john f reed easily won the democratic primary in the 2nd 
congressional district trudy coxe won the districts gop primary

change in state government 
we feel that the voters of this state have been signaling that 
they want change and we are prepared to bring the experience and 
the plans for major change diprete said he did not elaborate 
sundlun a 70yearold millionaire spent more than 2 million

a russian parliamentary committee called today for 
the immediate withdrawal of soviet military specialists from iraq 
even though it could endanger 5800 soviet citizens still in that 
country 
the international affairs committee of the republics parliament 
also called for suspension of the soviet treaty of friendship and 
cooperation with iraq the official news agency tass reported 
under the present circumstances the committee believes it 
unacceptable and immoral to maintain any contacts in the military 
sphere with the aggressor tass said 
on tuesday foreign minister eduard shevardnadze told the soviet 
parliament that the military men would leave as their contracts 
end he said the government was worried about what might happen to 
the 5800 soviet citizens if the advisers are pulled out right away 
if the contracts are not fulfilled by our side that will 
concern not only our military specialists but also a very large 
group of civilian specialists he said 
as soon as their contracts are finished they will leave he 
added he did not say exactly when that would be 
since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 it has held thousands of 
westerners as hostages against possible attack by the usled 
multinatioonal force building in the persian gulf region 
the soviet union iraqs largest arms supplier and a longtime 
ally cut off weapons shipments on aug 3 the day after iraq 
invaded kuwait 
but about 190 military specialists remain training iraqi 
soldiers to use and repair their soviet gear 
the issue of soviet military specialists in iraq has been a 
concern of president bush who encouraged president mikhail s 
gorbachev at sundays summit in finland to withdraw the advisers 
from iraq gorbachev refused 
the baghdad government has allowed the soviet union to evacuate 
nearly 3000 of its citizens including all 883 from kuwait all 
274 children from iraq and most of the 699 women from that country 
shevardnadze said 
he said the 5800 soviets mostly men working on civilian 
construction projects remain behind 
in the past soviet spokesmen have refused to say whether their 
citizens were barred from leaving they deliberately blurred their 
answers to reporters questions to avoid accusing iraq of holding 
the soviets as hostages 
shevardnadze also acknowledged tuesday that financial 
considerations played a role in the soviet decision to fulfill its 
contracts in iraq despite the un embargo on trade with that 
country 
we also would have to make up for the financial losses 
amounting to tens of millions of dollars he told the legislature 
we must keep these material facts in mind when we decide the 
question of withdrawal of our specialists 
the soviet economy is in dire straits prime minister nikolai 
ryzhkov told the legislature earlier in the day that imports of 
medicine and consumer goods would have to be cut by twothirds due 
to a shortage of foreign currency 
shevardnadze said the soviet union is already suffering 
financially from the persian gulf crisis it has not received an 
expected 800 million worth of oil and hard currency from iraq and 
kuwait this year he said 
the foreign minister said only about 90 to 95 of the 190 
military specialists are engaged in direct work with the iraqi 
armed forces many of the others are translators and other support 
personnel he said 
he also said the soviet union might be willing to send troops to 
the gulf to participate in a un peacekeeping force if iraqi 
troops leave kuwait 
after hearing shevardnadzes report legislators passed a 
resolution approving soviet policy in the crisis and the joint 
ussoviet statement at the helsinki summit condemning the 
invasion 
the vote was 27719 with 61 abstentions

president bush is finding himself drawn by the 
persian gulf crisis into a role he once shunned as much as ronald 
reagan relished television communicator 
bushs address to a joint session of congress on tuesday evening 
his third in 20 months in office was the latest installment in 
a battle of the airwaves that bush the reluctant communicator is 
waging with saddam hussein 
unable so far to budge the iraqi leader from kuwait with a 
massive us military presence or international sanctions bush has 
been engaging in a series of highprofile events choreographed to 
showcase world unity 
after all saddam himself has been making extensive use of 
television to attempt to influence public opinion in broadcasts 
aired by the cable news network 
last weekends orchestrated superpower summit in helsinki 
arranged by bush had a high symbolic content the image beamed 
around the world of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and bush 
standing as bush put it shoulder to shoulder against saddam 
and in his speech to congress and the nation the president 
sought to deliver the same message declaring it is iraq against 
the world 
he also used the occasion to steel the nation to a possible long 
engagement he said he did not know how long us troops would have 
to remain in saudi arabia or how long iraq could endure the 
international economic sanctions but he declared let no one 
doubt our staying power we will stand by our friends 
today bush videotaped a message to the iraqi people the 
administration really doesnt have high expectations that saddam 
will allow the tape to be televised in his country so the message 
was made with an eye toward domestic consumption and for viewing in 
other arab nations it was accompanied by arabic subtitles and 
voice dubbing 
saddam had offered to send an iraqi film crew to interview the 
president bush rejected that offer but said he would send his own 
tape 
televised addresses including speeches to joint sessions of 
congress were reagans forte but bush has tended to avoid them 
he favors less formal events and behindthescenes diplomacy 
he acknowledges feeling uncomfortable giving nationally 
televised speeches a point underscored again tuesday night when 
bush on occasion smiled in an inappropriate moment or failed to 
deliver a powerfully written phrase with enough vigor and that was 
after coaching from roger ailes his television coach from the 1988 
campaign 
regardless the presidents address was warmly received from 
both sides of the congressional aisle 
house armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis said 
bush essentially laid out in one document a very comprehensive 
argument for our position in the gulf 
and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said if there 
are any fencesitters on the presidents decisions in the middle 
east this speech ought to push them off the fence 
since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 bush has given four 
speeches on the crisis and 10 news conferences all or parts of 
which were carried live by the major tv networks 
and even though bush may not have quite the smooth delivery and 
timing of former actor reagan hes just used to different kinds 
of forums spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
his approval rating speaks to his ability to talk on 
television as good as the best of them fitzwater added his 
techniques are just different

reusing plastic bread bags to store food 
could be hazardous because the paint on the outside may contain 
lead a health official warns 
people who use the wrappers inside out risk having the lead mix 
with their food dr bernard goldstein director of the 
environmental and occupational health sciences institute in 
piscataway said tuesday 
its ironic that in this case recycling may actually pose an 
environmental health risk goldstein said 
because the plastic acts as a barrier between the paint and the 
food leadbased paints arent considered a hazard on the outside 
of a bread bag 
but once the bags are inverted and used for storage the paint 
can either flake off or be extracted by acids in the food said 
goldstein 
the institutes interest in bread wrappers began in late spring 
when in response to a telephone query it began researching 
obscure sources of lead in the environment 
after finding leadbased paint on 17 of 18 bread wrappers the 
institute surveyed 106 middleclass families in central new jersey 
seventeen or one out of six said they stored food in bread 
packaging 
exposure to lead levels in bread bag paint is not dangerous in 
itself goldstein said but if people continually ingest lead the 
amount in their bloodstream could rise to dangerous levels 
our advice to consumers is to stop reusing bread bags for food 
storage he said 
goldstein said evidence is compelling that exposure to even 
relatively low levels of lead can harm mental development and 
produce hyperactivity in small children higher concentrations can 
cause mental retardation he said

fortynine blacks and a white 
policeman were killed in some of the most vicious factional 
fighting since violence erupted in townships around johannesburg a 
month ago police said today 
a predawn bombing damaged the offices of the governing national 
party but caused no injuries police said 
the deaths occurred tuesday and early today in the townships 
ringing johannesburg where battles between rival black groups have 
claimed some 700 lives in the past month

bodies were found police said also 13 people were killed in 
vosloorus seven in tokoza and one in katlehong all townships

when they were ambushed with assault rifles while driving through a 
squatter camp in the soweto township 
also in soweto three blacks were killed when their yellow van 
was riddled with gunfire from ak47 rifles the attackers 
apparently mistook the van for a police vehicle most of which are 
painted yellow 
the blast at the deserted national party offices in pretoria 
the capital shattered windows and damaged computer equipment said 
the partys regional secretary danie labuschagne 
no one claimed responsibility for the bombing which was carried 
out with commercial explosives according to police 
extreme rightwing groups have claimed responsibility for 
several recent nighttime bombings including attacks on other 
national party offices commercial explosives were used in those 
bombings 
white extremists have vowed to resist plans by president fw de 
klerk to dismantle the apartheid system of racial segregation and 
share power with the black majority 
meanwhile skirmishes continued today in the black townships 
houses and cars were set alight in katlehong tokoza and 
vosloosrus southeast of johannesburg corpses remained on the 
street in several areas 
women and children packed belongings into wheelbarrows and 
shopping carts and fled the area 
in tokoza armed men at a squatter camp said they planned to 
avenge an overnight attack by zulus from a nearby migrant workers 
hostel hundreds of the squatter shacks were burned to the ground 
in tokoza and nearby vosloosurs 
the zulus are killing us said one resident of the tokoza 
squatter camp who was carrying an ax every night they come with 
guns 
the fighting in tokoza has been mostly between zulus in the 
hostels and other blacks in the squatter camps but on tuesday 
night the violence spread to nearby middleclass homes 
township residents said white men wearing masks took part in 
attacks in the area a charge made frequently in recent days 
police say they are investigating but have no evidence to support 
the claim 
the townhsip fighting erupted aug 12 between zulus loyal to the 
conservative inkatha movement and other blacks supporting the 
african national congress the fighting spread from the eastern 
province of natal where the ancinkatha feud has killed about 
5000 blacks since 1986 
de klerk and anc leader nelson mandela met tuesday but 
announced no new plans to stop the bloodshed 
mandela accused the government of waging war against the anc and 
said failure to halt fighting threatened talks on ending apartheid 
we will do everything in our power to ensure that the peace 
process remains on track but the government has to do its part 
mandela said after tuesdays meeting if the government is 
dragging its feet as it is doing now then the peace process is 
definitely threatened

saturdays edition of the new york post the 
nations oldest continuously published daily could be its last if 
its unions do not come up with millions in concessions demanded by 
the publisher 
publisher peter s kalikow told the unions sept 4 that he is 
losing 27 million annually on the tabloid and that he wants the 
unions to relinquish 174 million in payroll and 19 million in 
benefits by saturday 
but because he wants to write an editorial either saying goodbye 
to new yorkers or telling them of the posts survival kalikow 
changed the deadline on tuesday to 8 pm friday 
whatever the decision he wanted it clearly explained to the 
public said kalikow spokesman howard rubenstein 
the allied printing trades council a group of newspaper unions 
says that kalikow has always been honest with the unions and 
therefore they are willing to renegotiate the contract that ends 
next march 
formal talks began tuesday night with a 90minute session 
covering ground rules following confirmation by the unions 
auditors that the post was fighting for its financial life 
the allied also is negotiating over contracts that expired in 
march at the daily news the nations second largest metropolitan 
daily talks there have been intense but fruitless since january in 
what both sides say is a fight for the newspapers life 
the news management demands rights to eliminate rules it says 
force it to pay for excess production workers the unions claim the 
news is seeking to eliminate the unions and either sell or shut 
down the paper 
the unions are asking retail advertisers to boycott the news 
until a settlement is reached 
the news has been losing money also and has been hit by an 
industrywide advertising decline 
news management told the newspaper guild on tuesday that it 
demands the same concessions the guild makes to the post 
guild president barry lipton said the news demand was a naked 
attempt to collapse these negotiations 
john t sloan news vice president for human resources said a 
provision in the expired contract guaranteed that concessions made 
to one publisher be made to others contracting with the same union

comeback try and jesse jackson won his first primary race for 
something other than the presidency as voters selected nominees in 
10 states and the district of columbia 
jacksons victory tuesday in washington dc was in a 
democratic primary for the purely symbolic post of shadow 
senator created to lobby for statehood for the city 
democratic party chairman ronald h brown said the party had 
nominated a strong field of candidates for november elections 
that he said will hinge largely on domestic issues mishandled by 
the gop and the bush administration 
american people want to know whos going to clean up the 
savings and loan mess who is going to get this economy moving 
again and who is going to provide the leadership to get these 
budget deficits under control brown said 
ive got to feel optimistic about november he said i 
wish the general election was tomorrow 
republican national committee spokeswoman leslie goodman was 
equally upbeat about the gops lineup heading into the fall 
were very confident of our candidates she said 
minnesotas democratic gov rudy perpich whose eccentric habits 
earned him the nickname governor goofy won a closely contested 
bid for renomination to another term after 10 years in office with 
94 percent of precincts reporting perpich had 55 percent to 42 
percent for former commerce commissioner mike hatch 
in the republican race to oppose perpich businessman jon 
grunseth defeated state auditor arne carlson and a third candidate 
perpich said he got the opponent he wanted 
this makes it much easier for us because weve got the middle 
ground perpich said 
charles black the rncs chief spokesman said the fact that 
democrats had nominated perpich gives republicans a great chance 
to win the governorship in november 
other incumbents had an easy time on the biggest primary day of 
the election year and one which nearly completes the fall election 
lineup 
three republican governors easily won renomination judd gregg 
in new hampshire edward diprete in rhode island and tommy thompson 
in wisconsin 
democratic gov william donald schaefer coasted to renomination 
in maryland 
one former governor who was making a comeback try vermonts 
richard snelling easily won his republican primary and will face 
democrat peter welch in the fall snelling served four twoyear 
terms before retiring in 1984 and was succeeded by democrat 
madeleine kunin who decided not to run again this year 
mecham lost to phoenix developer j fife symington in the race 
for the gop nomination for governor of arizona former mayor terry

to mechams 24 percent and the rest was divided among three other 
candidates 
ill support fife mecham said even hell be better than 
goddard as ive said many times goddard will be a 100 percent 
disaster fife will only be an 80 percent disaster 
mecham a former car dealer was impeached in 1988 after two 
tumultuous years as governor in which he stirred controversy for 
his outspoken opposition to establishing the martin luther king 
holiday and drew charges of financial wrongdoing democratic gov 
rose mofford who inherited the job when mecham was forced out 
decided not to run for a full term 
in washington dc sharon pratt dixon who had been an 
alsoran in preelection polls scored a surprising victory in the 
democratic primary for mayor to succeed marion barry barry 
convicted on a single drug count in august is running as an 
independent in november for a city council seat 
the bottom line now is to close ranks said dixon a former 
utility company executive and democratic national committee member 
who was making her first bid for elective office she will face 
former police chief maurice turner a republican though she will 
be heavily favored in the city where republicans are outnumbered 9 
to 1 
jackson the twotime presidential candidate who moved to the 
heavily black city from chicago just last year had 57 percent of 
the vote in a fiveway race for a pair of nominations for unpaid 
shadow senator posts that carry neither voting nor floor 
privileges 
nonetheless it was jacksons first time on any ballot other 
than in a presidential primary 
in another dc race eleanor holmes norton narrowly won 
nomination for the citys nonvoting congressional delegate 
despite a weekend disclosure that she and her husband had failed to 
file city tax returns over an eightyear period norton said she 
thought her husband had filed them 
she is seeking the post given up by delegate walter fauntroy 
who ran last in the democratic mayoral primary won by dixon 
in a closely watched congressional race rep roy dyson a 
maryland democrat won renomination in a democratic primary over 
state legislator barbara kreamer and two others he was considered 
one of the most vulnerable congressional incumbents and had been 
shaken by the recent disclosure that he avoided military service as 
a conscientious objector during the vietnam war a contrast to his 
hawkish positions on defense issues in congress 
dyson won 54 percent of the vote against three opponents he 
will face republican wayne gilchrest who narrowly lost to dyson in 
1988 and defeated seven opponents for the gop nomination 
in rhode island 70yearold democrat bruce sundlun won a tough 
threeway primary for the nomination to oppose diprete defeating 
providence mayor joseph r paolino jr and warwick mayor francis x 
flaherty 
diprete has defeated sundlun in the last two elections but the 
republican governors popularity has sunk with the states 
beleaguered economy and democrats believe he is vulnerable this 
time 
its deja vu here we go again said diprete 
sundlun called diprete an opponent from whom i expect the 
worst and said governor diprete showed last time that he will 
stop at nothing to win an election and we have no reason to believe 
that he has changed his stripes 
in the race for new hampshires open senate seat rep bob smith 
defeated thomas christo and two others for the republican 
nomination 
former sen john durkin won the democratic nomination in his bid 
for a return to the senate from new hampshire the seat is vacant 
because of the retirement after two terms of conservative gop sen

for a state senate seat a job that pays 100 a year

opposition in the republican primary he will face paul wellstone 
a political science professor who won the democratic primary 
in connecticuts governors race rep bruce a morrison 
defeated state legislator william j cibes jr the retiring 
incumbent william oneill is a democrat but morrison goes into 
the threeway general election an underdog largely because of the 
states poor economy and recordsetting tax increases of the past 
two years 
he will face republican rep john g rowland and the 
frontrunner former sen lowell p weicker a republican running 
as an independent 
in a test of abortion as an issue two veteran maryland state 
senators were handily defeated by abortionrights candidates

uncovering alleged overcharges on government military contract work 
hughes spokesman bill herrman said an appeal would be filed 
a superior court jury deliberated one week before deciding 
tuesday in favor of bobby coffey a former program control 
administrator in hughes radar system group the jury also found 
the 55yearold was fired because of his age 
the message that hughes needs to understand is that it is not 
a one way street said coffeys attorney melanie lomax you 
dont just discard older workers like used toilet paper 
hughes attorney joel krischer contended that the woodland hills 
resident was terminated because he charged eight hours overtime 
that he did not work 
the jury found coffey had been fired without cause the panel 
found hughes had improperly billed the government and acted with 
malice against coffey 
coffey said he had an exemplary work record in 11 years with 
hughes until he pointed out inconsistencies involving government 
contracts in 198384 
a former pentagon contracts officer and another exhughes 
employee filed separate lawsuits against the company charging about 
70 million in inflated labor costs from 198389 and flaws in 4 
million defense system microchips

congress and the bush administration should 
not use the weakening economy or the persian gulf crisis as excuses 
to avoid a significant deficitreduction plan this year the 
general accounting office said today 
the gao an arm of congress offered the advice as it issued a 
report saying the deficit could reach a staggering 400 billion 
next year if the economy slides into a recession 
the latest forecast from the white house office of management 
and budget is for a 230 billion deficit a far smaller figure 
chiefly because omb uses surpluses in social security and other 
trust funds to offset shortages in general government accounts 
just nine months ago omb forecast a 100 billion deficit 
comptroller general charles a bowsher who heads gao used the 
words out of control to describe the deficit within a year he 
told a news conference the federal government will be spending 
more for interest on its debt than on the military 
the gao report which lists a series of options for correcting 
the problem but makes no recommendations was issued by sens 
jjames exon dneb and charles grassley riowa members of the 
senate budget committee 
exon praised the report as a frank and telling assessment of 
the magnitude of the federal budget crisis but acknowledged he 
opposes farmprogram cuts outlined by gao 
grassley said the report makes clear that the 50 billion 
oneyear deficit reduction that the administration and 
congressional leaders are trying to put together would be only a 
first step this report says weve got to lower the deficit by 
105 trillion by 1997 he said 
the report noted the economy is weakening and says this fact 
calls for caution in the timing of shortterm tax increases and 
spending reductions 
also the situation in the middle east calls for prudence in 
shaping shortterm defense budget decisions while accentuating the 
need to reassess the forces needed to meet future postcold war 
threats gao wrote 
we urge the administration and the congress to consider 
alternatives that take all of these factors into account but not to 
use them as an excuse for postponing action the report stated 
none of them changes the size or nature of the longterm 
fundamental problem the country faces

the house intelligence committee neared a vote 
today on helping the rebels of jonas savimbi in angola and sources 
said it was a close call whether the aid would be cut for the 
first time since it began 
whether the aid was cut or not conditions would probably be 
attached to its use said one source who spoke only on condition 
of anonymity 
it would be the first crack in the almost unanimous 
congressional support for savimbi that has been built up in 
washington since 1986 by a wellfinanced lobbying operation 
but support for savimbi has been eroded by peace initiatives 
throughout the world improved ties with the soviet union which 
is angolas main backer and growing budget problems here 
a clear sign of this came this summer when the senate 
intelligence committee put off a decision on savimbis aid for the 
fiscal year that starts oct 1 the panel agreed to decide on the 
aid figure later this year in a joint conference with the house 
committee said another source 
its a close call in the house said the source speaking of 
the closeddoor vote planned for later in the day current aid is 
estimated at 60 million or more 
todays vote is part of a covert aid bill that includes proposed 
money for rebels in cambodia and afghanistan 
an angolan official lobbying to defeat the aid has been telling 
members of congress and the administration this week that 
rightwing south africans with the tacit approval of their white 
minority government are providing the usarmed rebels with 
weapons 
maj gen roberto leal monteiro chief military adviser to 
angolas president jose eduardo dos santos is also arguing that 
further us aid to the rebels prolongs the 15year civil war in 
his country 
two ships from south africa recently docked at the port of 
matadi in zaire and unloaded two puma helicopters and a group of 
uniformclad black angolan mercenaries or rebels monteiro said 
angolan intelligence believes white rightwing extremists 
opposed to an emerging settlement between south africas white 
minority government and the countrys black majority are forging 
alliances with radicals in the region monteiro said 
south africa was savimbis biggest arms supplier until last 
year when it agreed to stop as part of a regional peace plan 
but monteiro said the government has turned a blind eye to 
some of the radicals activities including their regular flights 
ferrying weapons to the angolan rebels via an air strip in 
lubumbashi zaire 
monteiro is arguing that his government has done all the united 
states has asked agreeing to hold multiparty elections and 
changing to a marketoriented economy and yet the administration 
keeps aiding savimbi

full sovereignty 
foreign ministers from the united states the soviet union 
france and britain signed the historic document along with 
representatives from the two german states in the soviet communist 
partys plush oktyabrskaya hotel 
the socalled twoplusfour agreement is the last major document 
needed to clear the way for unification and will lead to an end of 
the world war ii allies special rights on german soil 
it marks the crowning of months of sometimes worried talks over 
germanys future strategic role nagged by the specter of germanys 
nazi past some nations expressed concern over what they perceived 
as the potential threat of a single nation of 80 million germans in 
the heart of europe 
the treaty thus incorporates builtin limits demanded by the 
soviets on the germans military might it also contains the 
germans acknowledgment that they cannot regain lands forfeited to 
poland after the nazis defeat in 1945 
the end of the special powers for the world war ii allies above 
all concerns berlin which is now technically under the 
adminstration of the four nations and not part of west germany 
after unification berlin becomes one city within a united germany 
president mikhail s gorbachev watched west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher affixed the first signature 
followed by east german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
the four allies were next french foreign minister roland dumas 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze secretary of state 
james a baker iii and british foreign secretary douglas hurd 
after the signing shevardnadze shook hands with genscher and de 
maiziere the six ministers plus gorbachev drank a champagne 
toast 
this treaty marks the end of the cold war era de maiziere 
said in a speech it is part of the most important body of 
european treaties of the postwar period 
western diplomatic sources said the participants did not resolve 
until two hours before the treaty was signed a dispute over nato 
troop maneuvers in what is now east germany after the withdrawal of 
red army troops by 1994 
the ministers negotiated until 3 am and again later this 
morning before reaching a compromise the sources said speaking on 
the condition of anonymity they did not say what the compromise 
was 
genscher lauded the treaty late tuesday saying it marks a new 
chapter not just in german history but also in european history 
the two germanys have chosen oct 3 as their unity date less 
than a year after east germanys hardline communist rulers were 
ousted in a peaceful popular revolution 
full german sovereignty is expected a couple months later after 
ratification by the legislatures of the four allies and an 
allgerman parliament 
genscher said the four allies are expected to sign a pact in new 
york on oct 1 to suspend allied rights in germany after 
unification 
he said the rights including control over air corridors to 
berlin will permanently end after the ratification of the treaty 
in addition to the twoplusfour agreement bonn and moscow have 
been negotiating agreements covering longterm financial aid for 
the soviets as well as generous payments to facilitate the 
withdrawal of red army troops from east germany west german 
officials say the two strictly germansoviet documents are nearly 
ready to sign 
the soviet unions decision to give full blessing to german 
unity has been made in tandem with bonns promises of financial 
help the aid will mean a sizable commitment by the germans to help 
salvage the soviet unions devastated economy 
details on the financial aid package have not been released 
however west german finance minister theo waigel said tuesday that 
his government had agreed to pay 76 billion for retraining red 
army troops and for building housing for soldiers returning home to 
the soviet union 
the soviets had demanded about 12 billion to cover the costs 
for the fouryear withdrawal of the 370000 red army troops from 
what is now east germany bonn had initally offered 45 billion 
the final haggling was left to west german chancellor helmut 
kohl and gorbachev who discussed the matter by telephone monday 
the united states and its two western partners were quick in 
giving their approval to german unity but the soviets were harder 
to move at first moscow stiffly rejected western insistence a 
united germany belong to nato 
the soviets dropped their objections after a pledge that nato 
troops would not be stationed on what is now east german soil that 
red army troops would have up to four years to withdraw and a 
united germany would keep its troop levels down to 360000 
the two german nations have a combined troop strength of about 
600000 
the celebrations in both germanys were in contrast with a 
statement from an israeli group today protesting the treatys 
failure to mention the nazi killings of european jews during world 
war ii 
after only a few years the germans are trying to deny and 
erase from their memories the horrible deeds of the german 
people wrote matityahu drobles chairman of the israeli wing of 
the world jewish congress in a letter to the west german embassy 
in tel aviv

a judge today temporarily barred st martins 
press from distributing a book purporting to expose secrets of the 
israeli intelligence service the mossad the publisher said 
st martins said the order was signed by state supreme court 
justice michael j dontzin at 105 am in his home after he heard 
oral argument by lawyers but without any testimony of witnesses 
or formal legal papers supreme court in new york state is a 
triallevel court 
the extraordinary and unprecedented order was issued at the 
request of israel the publisher said in a statement 
st martins said it intended to ask an appeals court to vacate 
dontzins order later today 
we are shocked and dismayed that israels attempts to enlist 
the support of an american court in censoring this book have so far 
met with success said st martins lawyer david n kaye 
the book by way of deception the making and unmaking of a 
mossad officer was barred from release in canada its canadian 
publisher stoddart publishing co said earlier this week in 
toronto the author victor ostrovsky who collaborated with ottawa 
journalist claire hoy on the 300page book also was ordered not to 
discuss the book 
ostrovsky 40 now living in canada claims to have been a 
mossad agent form 1984 to 1986 
jonathan lerner a lawyer for the israeli government declined 
to comment today 
dontzin set a court date on friday for arguments on whether the 
book should be released 
the judge said he was acting on israels contention that 
publication would disseminate extremely confidential information 
which would among other effects endanger the lives of various 
people in the employ of the state of israel and would be 
detrimental to the government of the state of israel 
according to israeli press reports the book asserts that the 
mossad had advance knowledge of the terrorist bombing that killed 
240 us marines in beirut in 1983 it said the israelis did not 
pass the information along because the bombing would worsen 
relations between the united states and arab nations 
the book also was said to describe mossad espionage activity 
inside the united states 
dontzin ordered st martins to stop shipping the book to 
bookstores or otherwise disseminating any books essays or 
articles containing information provided by the defendant victor 
ostrovsky or any other person on his behalf in connection with 
ostrovskys work for mossad 
dontzin also directed st martins to recall all of the 17000 
copies believed to have been shipped

searchers scoured the north atlantic 
today for signs of a boeing 727 jetliner that ran out of fuel and 
ditched at sea with 18 people aboard 
the jet owned by faucett airlines of lima peru was carrying 
airline employees and members of their families when it disappeared 
tuesday afternoon off newfoundland 
authorities said the plane strayed off course on a flight from 
the mediterranean island of malta to miami 
all of the crew members were from peru and it was not clear if 
there were any survivors 
eight canadian planes were searching a 60000squaremile area 
centered 185 miles off cape race newfoundland aided by ships two 
us air force planes were sent from detroit and iceland to help 
search 
tom cole a spokesman for the boeing co in seattle said the 
boeingdesigned aircraft was capable of floating after ditching 
perhaps for hours 
weve done a lot of analysis on ditching and we designed the 
airplane with that possibility in mind he said 
the 727s operating manual includes ditching procedures how 
to set up the airplane flaps down gear up what kind of speeds 
that kind of thing he said 
this aircraft was delivered to western airlines in 1969 and had 
gone through several owners before being bought by faucett which 
leased it to air malta 
we have a number of signals we have several different 
soundings hundreds of miles apart walt chipchase a search and 
rescue spokesman in halifax said of attempts to find the plane 
from its emergency radio beacon 
authorities said they had no explanation for unusual signals 
picked up by satellites and did not know if they had come from a 
plane or life raft 
equally mysterious was why the airplane was so far off course 
authorities said the plane should have reached gander 
newfoundland at 3 pm tuesday for a routine refueling stop but 
that the pilot radioed a fuel emergency at 323 pm and said he 
was ditching hundreds of miles out to sea 
we dont know why it was off course faucett airlines 
spokesman betty mcdaniel said in miami 
the jet had been under contract to air malta for about six 
months and was being returned to faucetts operations base in miami 
it had stopped in keflavik iceland but a refueling supervisor 
in keflavik said there was no problem during the stop there

the bush administration is threatening to veto 
any congressionally approved defense bill that hampers the persian 
gulf operation which defense secretary dick cheney says could cost 
up to 15 billion in the next year 
the pentagon chief offered the cost estimate tuesday as the 
house weighed a 283 billion defense budget for fiscal year 1991 
which begins oct 1 and searched for a way to defray the expense 
of the us military buildup 
a decision on using the defense bill as a vehicle for a down 
payment on operation desert shield is contingent on white house and 
congressional negotiators agreeing on how to cut next years 
federal deficit by 50 billion 
house democrats are considering using money originally earmarked 
for the strategic defense initiative and a navy guidedmissile 
destroyer a total of just over 1 billion said congressional 
sources who requested anonymity 
another option for lawmakers is to complete the defense budget 
and craft a separate supplemental package to cover the cost of the 
gulf operation 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash told reporters today he 
tends to be optimistic well reach a conclusion this week in 
negotiations on paring the deficit 
meanwhile lawmakers today began the first full day of debate on 
the defense bill by venting their frustration over the response 
from us allies in aiding the campaign against iraq 
its time for our allies especially japan to pay their fair 
share said rep david bonior dmich a member of the 
democratic leadership 
bonior the chief deputy whip said japan has announced a 
package of 1 billion in aid but the assistance is a very small 
amount compared to what is going to be needed in that region for 
the next year 
cheney told the senate armed services committee on tuesday 
we expect these incremental costs to total about 15 billion 
in fiscal year 1991 if the crisis continues for the entire fiscal 
year if the conflict occurs these costs would multiply many 
fold 
previous estimates for the cost of massing more than 100000 
us troops in the gulf region were 1 billion a month 
the defense budget which the house armed services committee 
crafted before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait would slash nearly 
2 billion from president bushs request for sdi halt production 
of the b2 bomber and reduce us troop strength by 129500 
the measure came under fire tuesday from the administration and 
house republicans 
if the house bill is enacted in its present form then the 
presidents senior advisers and the secretary cheney would 
recommend that the president veto it defense department 
spokesman pete williams told reporters 
he singled out the cuts in strategic programs and the reduction 
in activeduty strength that far exceeds the 38000 called for by 
the pentagon 
that would pose an undue risk to national security greatly 
complicate the departments ability to deal with the current crisis 
in the gulf and also rob the department of the flexibility we need 
to manage the force drawdown in an effective way williams said 
the ranking republican on the house armed services committee 
rep bill dickinson of alabama said the legislation breaks faith 
with the men and women in uniform 
a group of house republicans said the 24 billion cut from 
bushs request of 307 billion in military spending for fiscal 1991 
threatens the security of the united states 
democrats defended the bill as the appropriate response to a 
changing world environment in which the soviet threat to the west 
has diminished while conflicts such as the standoff in the middle 
east have moved front and center 
the house armed services committee has fashioned a bill that 
makes real progress toward restructuring united states military 
forces to meet changing circumstances of the 1990s and beyond 
rep charles bennett dfla said during debate on the house floor 
other lawmakers focused their criticism on the slow response 
from us allies toward helping the effort in the gulf and in 
particular the actions taken by japan 
although japanese officials said tuesday they are considering 
giving 2 billion to egypt jordan and turkey the house plans to 
consider a measure today that would force japan to pay all the 
costs associated with stationing us troops in the asian nation 
the house also will weigh several amendments on increasing and 
decreasing funds for sdi commonly known as star wars votes on all 
the legislation was scheduled for late in the day a move to allow 
budget negotiators to meet without interruption 
on tuesday the house rejected an amendment that would have 
forced the navy to close the planned home port battleship base 
at new york citys staten island an installation in which the 
pentagon has invested more than 230 million 
the house also overwhelmingly approved a measure sponsored by 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass to create a professional work 
corps within the pentagon to purchase weapons and other 
defenserelated items 
meanwhile the senate approved 972 a nonbinding resolution 
saying the united states should prosecute saddam hussein and other 
iraqi leaders as war criminals if hostilities break out in the 
gulf

president bush applauded the german 
reunification treaty signed in moscow today as a historic 
event but sent his regrets that he will be unable to attend the 
oct 3 ceremonies in berlin his spokesman said 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said that scheduling problems 
prevented bush from accepting the invitation from west german 
chancellor helmut kohl to join in the unification celebration 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has also been invited 
bush discussed the reunification ceremonies in a phone call on 
tuesday with kohl fitzwater said 
reading from a prepared statement on behalf of the president 
fitzwater said the signing in moscow this morning of the german 
unification treaty is a historic event 
todays treaty signing makes the dream of a unified free and 
democratic germany just a short step away 
the treaty was signed by the foreign ministers of the united 
states soviet union france and britain as well as representatives 
of the two germanys the socalled twoplusfour agreement is the 
last major document needed to clear the way for unification 
the successful conclusion of the twoplus four process is a 
tribute to the hard work and good faith of all the parties 
involved fitzwater said 
three weeks from today there will be a single germany 
anchored in the west and participating as a full member of nato 
president bush has worked assiduously for the last year to help 
guide this process in the glare of todays persian gulf crisis it 
is easy to forget the anxiety and turmoil for east and west during 
the unfolding of these events 
but they were successfully managed and today we can look 
forward to a unified germany that is a partner with its neighbors 
and committed to fostering new world order 
on a related subject fitzwater said that the administration is 
still hopeful that a treaty can be signed this year to reduce 
conventional arms in europe even though progress is slow 
the reunification of germany dramatically altered the ground 
rules for the treaty since it means the withdrawal of far more 
soviet troops from eastern europe than originally envisioned by 
either moscow or washington

forthright message to the iraqi people explaining in eight 
minutes his reasons for the us military buildup in the persian 
gulf aides said

taping which was to be delivered to iraqi officials for broadcast 
on iraqi television said sig rogich the presidents media adviser 
im very pleased with it he was very forthright rogich 
said after the taping 
officials did not release bushs message saying the white house 
wanted to first give iraq a chance to air the tape 
however white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush 
reiterated his statement that the united states has no quarrel with 
the iraqi people and that their suffering is due to their 
presidents invasion of kuwait bush said on the tape that we 
want a peaceful resolution we want peaceful coexistence with the 
people of iraq fitzwater said 
the spokesman asked if bush used harsh rhetoric against iraqi 
president saddam hussein said the message was personal and 
directed toward the people of iraq 
fitzwater said the tape would be delivered to the iraqi 
ambassador mohammed almashat later today by deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger the white house will give the iraqi 
government five days to broadcast the tape before releasing it to 
the us media and to other governments around the world fitzwater 
said 
rogich said that he was putting arabic subtitles on the tape and 
that a simultaneous audio translation would be added 
bush made the tape following an announcement by the iraqi 
government last week that it would broadcast a message to the iraqi 
people from bush and an offer to send a television crew to 
interview him 
the president chose to make his own videotape rather than submit 
to an interview 
there has been no formal contact between the two governments 
about the message fitzwater said today 
it was a very straightforward message said rogich who also 
produced many of bushs campaign television ads 
fitzwater said that bush worked on the message with officials 
from the state department and national security council and that he 
also consulted with experts on the arab world 
rogich said bush read from a teleprompter and also read a 
quotation from a piece of paper he pulled from his pocket 
the iraqi offer was announced after bush commented that he would 
like to have the same access to address the iraqis as saddam has 
had in getting his message to the american people saddams 
interviews and statements have been widely televised often live 
on us networks

stronghold in kashmir the northern sector of jammukashmir state 
the students based in jammu in a predominantly hindu sector 
had ignored the official pleas

the registerguard eugene ore on campaign finance 
the latest campaign finance report from the federal election 
commission simply reaffirms the steady and deeply disturbing trend 
toward electoral domination by political action committees 
according to the fec congressional candidates have received a 
total of 937 million from pacs during the first 18 months of the 
198990 election cycle that represents a 320 percent increase over 
the same 18month period just four years ago 
as disturbing as the amount of money and its accompanying 
political influence is the fact that 12 times as much pac money 
went to incumbents as to challengers 
moreover the 937 million in pac money represents onethird of 
the 279 million that congressional candidates will raise and spend 
this year 
the two campaign finance reform bills that have passed one 
chamber or the other are certainly welcome steps toward lessening 
the impact of middlemen pacs and other special interests in the 
elections process of the two the senate bill is clearly superior 
it would establish muchneeded spending limits in conjunction 
with partial public funding of congressional campaigns it would 
also ban the acceptance of honoraria which the house has already 
done by rule to curb the influence of pacs the senate bill takes 
a twotier approach an outright ban on pac contributions or if 
that were found unconstitutional an aggregate limit equal to 20 
percent of the spending limit on all pac giving 
the matter of campaign finance reform should be of concern to 
every member of congress a recent new york timescbs news poll 
found that 42 percent of americans surveyed believed at least half 
or more of the members of congress are financially corrupt

the providence ri journalbulletin on poverty 
the bush administration is beginning to look at major revisions 
in the way poverty is defined for purposes of federal benefits 
the current system stems from a crude measure created by a civil 
servant in the early 1960s she took the agriculture departments 
cheapest recommended food budget and multiplied it by three to 
arrive at a poverty line 
it is unclear whether a redefinition would raise or lower the 
numbers of people defined as poor while it is true that many 
people defined as poor and receiving benefits dont seem to receive 
nearly enough to make ends meet the current method may also in 
some cases actually overstate the extent of poverty 
on the other hand some say the current formula sets the poverty 
line unrealistically low because its based on outdated spending 
assumptions while 30 years ago the average american family was 
thought to spend a total of three times its food budget to keep 
body and soul together it now spends five times that amount 
largely because of rises in the cost of housing and child care 
we shall see for now though let us praise the administration 
for being willing to open up a hornets nest to get at something 
like the truth once thats found we hope demagoguery from right 
and left wont harm efforts to improve programs to help the poor

valley news lebanon nh on acid rain 
after spending 10 years and 537 million a federal study group 
released a draft of its report on the effects of acid rain 
the report and its reception could prove crucial to the fate of 
acid rain legislation 
the question naturally arises how can these findings possibly 
be used by those who oppose enactment of concrete measures to 
reduce emissions responsible for acid rain the answer lies in the 
one thin straw the report offered to those desperate enough to 
clutch it it said that acid rain is a serious problem but not a 
crisis 
common sense tells us that a serious problem is best addressed 
before it becomes a crisis

crowded ships for a new world where they believed they would find 
the freedom to go as far as their talents and their determination 
would allow 
husbands left wives and children behind not knowing how long it 
might be before they could earn enough money to send for them the 
wives when the summons finally came after lonely months and years 
of waiting then made the trip with sons and daughters often many 
of them in tow sometimes small children travelled alone to join 
parents or other kinfolk fear anxiety and confusion must have 
been the travelling companions of them all

the times london on the persian gulf 
following the helsinki summit between presidents bush and 
gorbachev the persian gulf confrontation begins what could be 
the final diplomatic preliminary to war 
every shred of evidence suggests that saddam hussein was set on 
a determined campaign of regional destabilization 
he would not only have toppled one gulf state after another 
possibly with the aim of subjugating his old enemy iran he would 
also have directed his attention west toward the levant where 
there are many fuses for him to ignite 
his declared ambition is to liberate jerusalem and there is 
no reason to doubt his sincerity he is plainly without moral 
constraint in his regard for international law common humanity or 
the use of the worlds most horrible weapons 
saddam presents the nightmare scenario of nuclearchemical 
warfare strategists of a threat not from a superpower but from a 
dictator with nothing to lose 
the united states is the one world power capable of projecting 
and paying for a true challenge to this menace

jakarta indonesia post on the persian gulf 
the remarkable feature of the persian gulf crisis which saddam 
hussein apparently had not foreseen at all is the fact of the us 
and the ussr working in tandem in response to the alarming 
situation developing in the middle east 
moscow has shown uneasiness over the concentrated military power 
that is being marshaled in the gulf area particularly in saudi 
arabia by the united states and other western powers moscow is 
having qualms as washington is showing its determination to apply 
that awesome power to restore kuwaits sovereignty 
president bushs aides were keen to depict sundays summit 
meeting in helsinki as a display of superpower solidarity at a 
time when washington is eager to hold together the alliance against 
iraq

kenya times nairobi kenya on the persian gulf 
the diplomatic and financial pressures that have been adapted 
must be maintained until iraq is brought down to its knees chances 
are that such a situation will force iraq out of kuwait 
this is why we concur with british foreign secretary douglas 
hurd that peaceful means should be sought before resorting to other 
options 
although no significant headway has been made so far there are 
chances that something positive may be achieved in future 
we also maintain that arab leaders should try to make saddam 
hussein see some sense because what this leader is doing is 
certainly not in their interests he must be made to realize that 
in the long run he will have to yield to pressure 
but before this happens efforts must be made to ensure that the 
situation does not degenerate into a physical confrontation this 
must be done urgently because the situation is deteriorating fast

enough time is on saddams side not the worlds 
the resolve that the world demonstrated early on is slowly but 
surely wilting and the horror of iraqs takeover of kuwait seems to 
have lost much of its shock value 
with each passing day the burden of standing up to iraq mounts 
defending saudi arabia imposing a naval blockade stopping trade 
with iraq and compensating waverers for sticking to sanctions is 
expensive all round 
the united states in particular is straining under its 
selfappointed and thankless job of world policeman 
it has not been simply a matter of sending in a couple of handy 
carrier groups as president george bush has stressed the 
commitment has been more on the scale of planting a complete 
mediumsized american town in the saudi desert 
it is estimated that the 100000strong us military force will 
ring up a bill of 25 billion by the end of this month 
with each passing day calls in the west for action against 
saddam become more muted and are being joined by more and louder 
discordant voices with no single obvious solution politicians and 
commentators are pushing their own theories 
with each passing day despair among kuwaitis and all small 
vulnerable countries must also increase 
economic sanctions naval blockades diplomatic isolation and a 
defensive shield in saudi arabia are all very useful but they do 
not look like the most effective weapon against an adversary that 
was able to endure eight years of grinding war against iran without 
too much difficulty 
one thing is certain as long as the current situation endures 
the international community is in a crisis of principle might will 
be proved right and size the master over sovereignty 
the result at the end of each day that passes with iraq still in 
possession of kuwait is not a stalemate or a draw 
it is a victory for saddam hussein and the forces of 
international terror

tass soviet news agency on cambodia 
the cambodian knot can be untied this seems obvious after the 
decision to form the supreme national council made by the 
cambodian parties at the jakarta meeting 
the move signals a breakthrough in the political settlement in 
the spirit of national reconciliation 
this important decision fully attunes with the recommendations 
elaborated by the five permanent members of the un security 
council they regard the supreme national council as an embodiment 
of the independence sovereignty and unity of cambodia 
the khmer rouge first balked at supporting norodom 
sihanouks proposal according to available information these 
objections have now been lifted but hardly anyone can forecast how 
the khmer rouge will behave in future 
a statement made by sihanouk in beijing introduced a new 
element of uncertainty into the situation sihanouk who was to 
head the council said that he was compelled on health grounds to 
abandon political and diplomatic activity for six months 
it is important to complete the formation of the council and 
to make sure that the interkhmer dialogue is kept going 
the soviet unions proposal to announce a moratorium on military 
aid to all cambodian parties as a component of a comprehensive 
settlement is assuming particular importance 
the organization and holding of free and fair elections under 
un auspices in cambodia and the implementation of measures that 
would rule out a return to the policy and practice of the past 
when pol pot and his clique perpetrated horrible crimes in the 
country will require enormous efforts 
lastly international guarantees need to be adopted to ensure 
the independent and neutral status for cambodia

chinas few remaining nomadic herders will be 
required to lease fixed plots of pasture ending their wandering 
ways an official report said wednesday 
the englishlanguage china daily said china plans to lease 
millions of acres of grassland to herders who roam relatively 
freely over stateowned pastures 
the newspaper quoting li shoude an official from the 
agriculture ministry said the new policy will require herdsmen to 
contract pasture from the government for a period up to 15 years at 
annual rates dependent on grass quality 
the program is aimed at saving chinas grassland from 
deterioration due to overgrazing li said he said the herdsmen 
would be responsible for keeping up the land they lease and could 
renew their leases 
li estimated the policy will take more than 10 years to be 
implemented nationwide as some herdsmen might find it difficult to 
switch from their nomadic lifestyle 
chinas nomadic herders live mainly in the border areas of 
xinjiang uygur autonomous region qinghai and inner mongolia the 
size of the herding population was not immediately available

consumer shortages caused by printing too many 
rubles are coming home to the soviet government its running out 
of ink 
the national newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported wednesday 
that the country is down to just two or three weeks supply of 
printers ink its entirely possible that in a short time 
presses for newspapers passports and rubles will come to a halt 
the article said 
the soviet union is plagued by shortages including bread 
cigarettes and recently fivekopeck coins for the moscow subway 
system economists blame the government policy of printing excess 
rubles to pay workers more than the value of their production 
as a result the ruble is becoming worthless citizens are 
resisting working for nothing and production is falling with 
fewer exports the soviet union has been unable to pay its foreign 
bills on time 
asked if the ink shortage meant rubles soon would be 
disappearing sergei galkin of the state printing committee told 
the newspaper well maybe thats good 
the author agreed commenting if we judge it logically why 
do we need money after all theres nothing to buy 
adding to the embarrassment the soviets need dollars to print 
more rubles 
galkin said western suppliers of printers ink have not been 
paid for their last shipment and refuse to send any more on credit 
he said he needs 12 million to 17 million before he can replenish 
supplies 
the article was printed under the sardonic headline marxs 
dream comes true money is abolished it referred to karl marxs 
belief that money would not be needed in a communist society 
because everything would be free and freely available

the united states regained its leadership in 
world trade volume last year with a bigger increase in exports than 
any other major industrial country the international monetary fund 
said wednesday 
but the united states may not hold the lead long against 
competition from a united germany 
west germanys share of world trade has held steady dropping by 
only half a percentage point to 13 percent since its 1986 peak 
the fund does not report on east germany which is not a member 
after the scheduled oct 3 german unification the numbers will 
be combined some west german exports may be diverted for a time to 
help build up the eastern part of the country but a united germany 
could take the lead again 
us traders boosted their exports by 105 percent in 1989 
accounting for 135 percent of the volume of goods bought and sold 
internationally that does not include oil which is considered 
separately 
the us share of world trade rose from the 115 percent low of 
1987 but was still under the 15 percent average of the 1970s 
according to the funds annual report 
by contrast the share of japanese exports in world trade 
declined from a peak of 115 percent in 1986 to 10 percent in 
1989 the report said 
japan has been under heavy international pressure to improve its 
standard of living at home instead of concentrating so heavily on 
exports 
the report was sent to the funds 151 member governments aug 1 
the day before iraq invaded kuwait it does not take into account 
the invasion or subsequent events 
the funds figures dealt with the volume of goods traded not 
their dollar value they were given only in percentages not in 
actual tons 
ups and downs in the price of currencies sometimes distort the 
picture when trade is reported in terms of the dollar in this 
case dollar figures also show the united states back in the lead 
for exports in 1989 shipping 363985 billion worth of goods 
compared with west germanys 341231 billion worth 
west germany held the lead in dollar value of exports from 1986 
to 1988 
the report urged us authorities to resist pressure for 
protecting domestic industries against imports and to continue to 
lead efforts for freer trade it also urged a policy of national 
and private savings 
an increase in national savings achieved mainly through 
fiscal restraint was in the boards view the key to further 
reductions in the external deficit the report said 
the fund report reflecting the opinions of board members said 
a majority view held that the federal reserve would be well 
advised to continue focusing mainly on inflation control since the 
abatement of cost and price pressure was not yet fully confirmed 
the board said us inflationary pressures had lessened in the 
second half of 1989 and that a recession did not appear imminent 
but that lower inflation should be a goal

the children of northeast saudi 
arabia this week became one of the biggest obstacles to press 
coverage of the american military buildup in the region 
the us military has been using rented buses to take groups of 
reporters on organized tours of various military camps and 
installations the most popular atractions have been guided tours 
of an air base where many newly arrived soldiers take their first 
steps in saudi arabia 
but the military lost most of its buses tuesday when the dhahran 
academy opened the school year while the kids were heading back to 
school a lot of reporters were sitting around a hotel 
we better figure this one out soon because im already tired 
of looking at this group one military spokesman said just hours

the heat boredom and uncertainty at times take their toll on 
the morale of us military personnel but it seems every unit here 
has had some special delivery from the states that has picked up 
morale at just the right moment 
for air force capt michael hatcher of front royal va that 
moment came last week when the awacs unit in which he is a pilot 
received several packages of cookies from schoolchildren from three 
maryland towns outside washington 
hatcher was half asleep when a reporter sat down next to him 
during an overnight awacs mission saturday but he roused himself 
long enough to offer a note with the childrens names and a request 
that they somehow be thanked for their gesture 
it means a lot to us he said of the cookie shipment which 
provided dessert for the 30member crew on the flight you 
realize that someone else in the world cares about you it was a 
real nice surprise 
the cookies he said came from maura orourke of bethesda md

the government wednesday halted 
offensive actions against communist rebels in manila and three 
northern provinces but demanded a show of sincerity from rebels 
before the ceasefire is expanded 
there was no immediate reaction from guerrillas if they agree 
to a ceasefire it would be the most extensive truce between 
rebels and government since a 60day truce in december 1986 
the government move is widely seen as an attempt to stop 
fighting so that the government can concentrate on rehabilitating 
areas devastated by the july 16 earthquake 
justice secretary franklin drilon a member of the cabinet 
security committee said the truce would cover the manila area and 
the provinces of benguet mountain province and nueva vizcaya 
which were badly damaged by the quake 
defense secretary fidel ramos said rebels must prove their 
sincerity in wanting peace before it can be expanded to other areas 
of the country 
president corazon aquino said she called the ceasefire in 
response to calls for peace in the philippines she did not say how 
long it would last 
in response to the peoples call for a genuine peace i have 
directed the armed forces of the philippines to maintain the 
suspension of offensive military operations in the 
earthquakeaffected areas and the national capital region mrs 
aquino said 
the statement avoided the word ceasefire deputy press 
secretary horacio paredes said the military was allergic to the 
word 
sen wigberto tanada who proposed the move said insurgents can 
still be arrested but soldiers will not conduct patrols in known 
rebel strongholds to avoid shootouts with guerrillas the move also 
does not apply to military rebels who have threatened new attacks 
last week the rebel umbrella national democratic front said a 
ceasefire would be ineffective unless the government offered ways 
to solve the nations problems including poverty repression and 
the presence of us military bases the rebels oppose the us 
presence in the philippines 
the military has objected to the word ceasefire because it 
feels the term gives belligerency status to the insurgents the 
military believes the nationwide ceasefire declared in 1986 
enabled rebels to regroup and retrain 
last july rebels declared a limited ceasefire in 
quakedevastated areas but the government did not respond 
meanwhile guerrillas killed two militiamen in a predawn 
assault wednesday on a military checkpoint in the town of 
catbalogan on central samar island 
almost simultaneously two rebels on a motorcycle lobbed a 
grenade at the towns police headquarters wounding two policemen 
samar a rebel stronghold is not covered by the truce

for the second time in two weeks scientists 
report cloning a gene of a brain communication system that may shed 
light on treating schizophrenia and other brain disorders 
the gene tells brain cells how to make a dopamine receptor a 
structure that a brain cell uses to receive a chemical messenger 
called dopamine from other brain cells 
the newly cloned gene is for a type of dopamine receptor called 
d3 last week other scientists announced the cloning of the gene 
for d1 the gene for d2 was cloned in 1988 
the new work by scientists in paris is reported in thursdays 
issue of the british journal nature 
dopamine receptors are sites of action for drugs used in 
treating schizophrenia and parkinsons disease a potentially 
disabling condition that can include a tremor rigidity and gradual 
loss of spontaneous movement 
the new cloning may lead to powerful new strategies for 
developing safer and more effective drugs to treat psychosis the 
loss of touch with reality seen in schizophrenia solomon snyder of 
the johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore 
commented in a nature editorial 
the finding also may help shed light on parkinsons said 
olivier civelli one of the researchers who announced cloning of 
the d1 gene last week 
scientists eventually may uncover five or even 10 types of 
dopamine receptor said civelli of the oregon health sciences 
university in portland

a senate committee today overwhelmingly 
approved a fiveyear extension of the beleaguered national 
endowment for the arts and proposed recouping federal funds from 
any grant recipient convicted of violating obscenity or child 
pornography laws 
the 151 vote by the senate labor and human resources committee 
sent the bipartisan compromise to the senate floor for action 
similar legislation in the house has bogged down in bitter 
wrangling over nea support for works that some critics consider 
obscene or blasphemous 
the senate bill which supports the white house request for 175 
million for the federal arts agency next year was supported by 
committee liberals and conservatives on both sides of the nea 
controversy 
arts supporters said the bills support by such figures as sens 
edward m kennedy dmass the committees liberal chairman and 
orrin hatch of utah its ranking republican and a staunch 
conservative would heighten the bills chances for passage by the 
full senate 
before it approved the compromise the panel rejected on a 142 
vote a proposal by sen dan coates rind to impose 
antiobscenity guidelines on nea panels that select grant 
applications for approval coates was backed by sen strom 
thurmond rsc who then voted in favor of the committee 
compromise 
hatch said the bill would take the arts endowment out of the 
business of judging which artistic and literary works might be 
obscene and leave those questions for the courts to decide 
the compromise would require the nea to recover grant money from 
any recipient convicted of using federal funds to produce works 
that violate obscenity or child pornography laws 
the guilty artists would be banned from receiving nea grants for 
three years or until the funds are repaid whichever is longer 
coates the lone dissenter on the final vote said the arts 
endowments very existence will be jeopardized unless congress 
takes stronger steps to halt federal subsidies for what he called 
the filth and garbage that is profoundly offensive to the 
majority of the american people 
his proposal would have required nea panels to reject grants for 
works that violate the supreme courts obscenity standards portray 
sexual exploitation of children or attack historic religious 
figures principles or symbols 
the endowment has been buffeted for the past 18 months by 
criticism of its past support for controversial exhibitions of 
works by photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist andres 
serrano which conservative lawmakers and religious fundamentalists 
have denounced as obscene and sacrilegious 
the neas statutory authority will expire sept 30 also 
expiring on that date will be a congressional ban on nea support 
for works that may be considered obscene the ban was attached 
to the neas current 171 million budget last fall at the urging of 
sen jesse helms rnc 
meanwhile a bipartisan commissions plea for congress to omit 
antiobscenity restrictions on the nea in its reauthorization 
legislation drew cheers from liberal activists and boos from 
conservative lawmakers 
the 12member study panel said tuesday that it unanimously 
opposed any new legislative curbs on the content of works financed 
by nea grants 
content restrictions may raise serious constitutional issues 
would be inherently ambiguous and would almost certainly involve 
the endowment and the department of justice in costly and 
unproductive lawsuits it said 
the commission established by congress last fall to examine nea 
operations amid the obscenity furor also suggested that nea 
chairman john e frohnmayer scrap a requirement that all grant 
recipients sign an antiobscenity pledge 
both proposals were applauded by the liberal people for the 
american way action fund which called them an utter repudiation 
of the proposals of the neas attackers 
the commissions report drew a mixed response from rep e 
thomas coleman rmo a leader in house negotiations over a 
compromise bill to extend the endowments life 
coleman welcomed the report as a possible framework for a 
compromise but he made clear that its not enough for most 
members to accept 
he predicted that the house will ignore the commissions appeal 
and ultimately approve some form of antiobscenity curbs on nea 
grants coleman also deplored the panels rejection of his proposal 
to shift as much as 60 percent of federal grant money to the 
control of state arts agencies 
rep dana rohrabacher rcalif a vocal conservative critic of 
the nea dismissed the commissions report he said the panel was 
created to provide political cover for nea supporters who are 
fighting legislative restrictions on the kinds of art eligible for 
federal grants

the attorney general said in statements 
published wednesday that the governments financial war against 
billionaire cocaine cartels has been a failure 
speaking to congress on tuesday attorney general alfonso gomez 
mendez said the governments campaign to seize drug wealth has 
been a failure because it has represented more costs to the nation 
than benefits for the community 
gomezs statements were published in major bogota newspapers 
since beginning an antidrug crackdown in august 1989 the 
government has seized about 670 real estate properties allegedly 
belonging to drug traffickers among the seizures are hotels night 
clubs luxury homes ranches 23 clandestine airports 365 cars and 
68 airplanes according to government figures 
gomez said the goods estimated to be worth hundreds of millions 
of dollars were taken by the state without being judicially and 
technically prepared to administer them 
he warned that innefficient bureaucracy may force the government 
to return many of the properties 
gomez added that the confiscations have generated corruption in 
the judicial branch because many judges have returned properties 
under suspicious circumstances about 40 colombian judges are now 
being investigated for possible abuses 
other officials are being investigatied for alleged embezzlement 
of drug traffickers goods 
gomez said police and army costs for maintaining the goods are 
too high he said 16000 security officers are needed to guard them 
president cesar gaviria has said colombias drug war cost the 
country 1 billion in the last year 
gavirias predecessor virgilio barco began the crackdown in 
august 1989 after the medellin cocaine cartel was blamed for 
murdering a presidential candidate

a bank controlled by republican gubernatorial 
candidate clayton williams may have violated state and federal 
consumer protection laws in financing hundreds of new cars in 
houston a newspaper reported today 
the houston chronicle said many of the car buyers generally 
poor credit risks complain they were forced to purchase unwanted 
and unnecessary insurance through claydesta national bank of 
midland as a condition of getting the loans 
in addition to the price of the car most buyers said the loans 
financed insurance policies typically ranging from 1000 to 
7000 that would cover payments in case of illness or death 
claydesta president david n jones denied any wrongdoing and 
said the insurance was simply an option 
jones said he doesnt believe any laws were violated in the loan 
transactions but he said he had little control or knowledge of 
what the customers were told by employees of dealerships where 
borrowers signed for loans 
there was no immediate comment from williams a controlling 
partner in the bank his spokesman gorden hensley said today 
there is nothing improper here hensley referred all questions 
about the story to jones who said it was riddled with 
inaccuracies 
claydesta bank has never required insurance to be purchased 
through us as a requirement for a loan jones said i am upset 
im upset any time the bank and its policies are misrepresented we 
always have managed our business with honesty and integrity and im 
upset when that comes into question 
according to documents obtained by the chronicle claydesta made 
more than 400 car loans at 18 percent interest in the houston 
area between june 1989 and february 1990 
texas assistant attorney general clyde farrell said if insurance 
was required as a condition of the loans it must be included as 
part of the finance charge and calculated into the interest rate 
some of the loan agreements obtained by the chronicle however did 
not fulfill that requirement the newspaper said 
one purchaser noelia rodriguez said she and her husband were 
told they had to buy the bankprovided insurance when they financed 
a new pickup last december 
another houston purchaser gladys dickerson said more than 
1000 in insurance premiums was included in her loan agreement 
i thought it was mandatory she said 
jones said that although loan papers were drawn up with the 
insurance costs included by bank personnel buyers could decline 
the insurance and the papers would be redrawn

the united states sent troops guns and tanks 
to saudi arabia the uso is sending in the clowns 
steve martin and jay leno have been booked and other bigname 
talent is being wooed to entertain the more than 100000 american 
troops deployed in the area 
bob hope whos made a practice of bringing laughter to us 
troops since world war ii may swap deserts and go from his palm 
springs calif home to saudi arabia for one of his famed 
christmas shows 
if hes called hell go said an aide to the 87yearold 
hope 
martin is scheduled to go to saudi arabia next month 
accompanied by his wife actress victoria tennant 
the couple will meet with soldiers at the main us airbase in 
the northeastern saudi city of dharan where most americans are 
stationed and in remote posts around saudi arabia 
martin the standup comic turned actor wont stage a show 
preferring to spend his time in impromptu sessions with the troops 
just the fact that he is coming to see soldiers in their 
tents bunkers is a very important message that people care about 
them said kevin mccarthy executive producer of uso united 
service organization 
if anyone can make these men and women forget about the heat 
and pressure for a few hours its this wild and crazy guy 
mccarthy said 
leno has been lined up for two thanksgiving shows and other 
performers will be announced as their tours are finalized 
the dallas cowboys cheerleaders regulars on the uso circuit 
in recent years probably wont wave their pompons for the troops 
because such a show wouldnt sit well with the saudi hosts 
in keeping with strict moslem law saudi women are hidden behind 
veils and robes limited in their movements and prevented from 
associating with men who arent their relatives 
we will have to have special sensitivities for the cultural 
and religious differences mccarthy said adding that the uso 
will consult with the state and defense departments about whats 
acceptable by saudi standards 
theres nothing wrong with a clean wholesome dance show but 
our role is entertainment not just pretty girls mccarthy said 
however he said entertainers will have more leeway aboard the 
dozens of us warships in the region 
the usos morale building is getting off to a slow start because 
priority has been given to the massive task of moving the troops 
and their equipment to the region 
we would have liked to be in there earlier mccarthy said 
but we also dont want to get in the way 
martin leno and the others are donating their time uso will 
pay for the productions out of a 2 million gulf crisis fund 
established with corporate gifts since iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
the uso also is setting up centers in egypt turkey saudi 
arabia and other locations to provide troops with currency 
exchange phones televisions movies and other offduty comforts 
the operation also will be funded by private donations and 3 
calls to a 1900 number where callers may leave messages for the 
troops

gop leaders heaved a sigh of relief wednesday after evan 
mechams defeat in arizona and hailed minnesota gov rudy perpichs 
victory in a hotly contested democratic primary as offering a 
great chance to capture that office 
abortion opponents celebrated the latest election results while 
conceding they were very mixed 
the results of tuesdays 11 primaries offered a little bit for 
many to celebrate 
in arizonas republican gubernatorial primary j fife symington 
beat mecham whose term as governor ended 2 years ago with his 
impeachment conviction 
we nominated our strongest candidate said charles black 
the principal republican party spokesman in the absence of gop 
chairman lee atwater who is battling a brain tumor 
democratic party chairman ronald h brown also professed delight 
with the primary results 
i wish the general election was tomorrow said brown who 
contended that the lineup of democratic candidates in the 36 races 
for governor this year was almost too good to be true 
tuesdays primaries left only a few states that havent 
completed the lineup for the november elections next week voters 
in massachusetts washington and oklahoma will settle contests 
the customary professions of unity were heard across the primary 
states the day after the votes were counted 
perpichs primary opponent mike hatch said he would work for 
the governors reelection but mecham offered symington an 
endorsement with a difference 
the former governor said he would back the millionaire developer 
because he would be better than democratic nominee terry goddard 
goddard will be a 100 percent disaster said mecham fife 
will only be an 80 percent disaster 
despite the latest primary results brown insisted that support 
of abortion was playing very positively for democratic 
candidates he conceded there were some exceptions including 
minnesota pennsylvania and kansas where the democratic nominees 
for governor were firmly antiabortion 
in a close contest i think it can make a difference said 
brown 
speaking for a party that is trying to move away from hardline 
opposition to abortion the gops black said there are very few 
races where abortion is a big issue 
in minnesota the fact that governor perpich was renominated 
gives us a great chance to win the governorship said black 
but perpich ridiculed by critics as governor goofy looked 
as tough as a minnesota winter as he defeated hatch by 56 percent 
to 42 percent after a campaign that once looked like a dead heat 
businessman jon grunseth won the gop nomination for governor in a 
primary in which his antiabortion views were called a major factor 
the abortion issue played awfully awfully big much bigger 
than anybody expected said the gop loser state auditor arne 
carlson who was attacked for his prochoice views 
a similar contrast existed in the democratic race with perpich 
opposed to abortion and hatch prochoice 
antiabortion activists also hailed the primary victory by 
maryland congressman roy dyson over three challengers including 
state legislator barbara kreamer who was endorsed by the national 
abortion rights action league naral 
but elsewhere in maryland three legislators who led a state 
senate filibuster against prochoice legislation were defeated by 
abortion rights advocates 
the results are very mixed said nancy myers of the national 
right to life committee we are thrilled with the results in 
minnesota we basically cleaned their clock in maryland we 
lost the senate races but we kept dyson 
in new hampshire democratic senate nominee john durkin 
promised to make abortion an issue in his campaign against the 
gops rep bob smith in the race for the senate seat being vacated 
by republican gordon humphrey durkin who served one sixyear term 
in the senate in the 1970s is prochoice smith is antiabortion 
leaving washington after two senate terms humphrey immediately 
sought a seat in the new hampshire senate and defeated state rep 
jack sherburne in a primary in which abortion was an issue 
theres no one wed rather beat than gordon humphrey said 
peg dobbie executive director of naral despite narals efforts 
humphrey captured 58 percent of the primary vote 
in the arizona primary campaign symington said he would support 
unlimited access to abortion during the first three months of 
pregnancy and would oppose a total ban on abortion democratic 
nominee goddard campaigned as a supporter of abortion rights 
in the district of columbia sharon pratt dixon scored a 
surprise victory in a fiveway race for the democratic nomination 
for mayor and received congratulations from the current mayor 
marion barry who decided not to seek a fourth term after he was 
indicted on cocaine posesssion and perjury charges 
i feel some relief that this is over now said barry 
obviously the voters wanted some major changes

suzette woodruff says patriotism wasnt a big 
deal in her young life until the iraqi invasion of kuwait sent 
her scrambling in an escape that was assisted by the royal families 
of kuwait and saudi arabia 
she found herself joining six companions in an emotional 
rendition of god bless america when their plane touched down in 
new york city 
i really did want to get down and kiss the ground the 
21yearold las vegas woman said tuesday when you get away from 
this country when you see what we saw you really take pride in 
america 
woodruff returned home saturday family members were waiting for 
her with streamers and small american flags 
i was never so thankful to see an american flag she said 
earlier this year woodruff got a part as a dancer with a group 
of entertainers going to the middle east 
the group including singers and dancers performed three months 
at a hotel in bahrain 
at the end of their engagement they were invited to kuwait by a 
member of the royal family who was a friend of the groups leader 
gypsy norton of honolulu 
we thought that would be great no problem woodruff said 
she recalled going to a grocery store in kuwait city the night 
the group arrived and finding long lines of people stocking up on 
food 
we should have known something was wrong she said 
back at their hosts beach house they were approached by 
officers dressed in uniforms of the kuwaiti coast guard but 
learned later they were iraqi soldiers in disguise 
early the next morning they found that kuwait had been invaded 
our host told us to grab our suitcases that we had to get out 
quickly she recalled 
we headed for the border of saudi arabia after our host made a 
couple of calls she said it was chaos at the border people 
were panic stricken it was so bizarre we sat for three hours 
crammed in a van finally we were able to get across because of our 
hosts connections we got out 30 minutes before they closed the 
saudi border 
she said there was an eerie change in the environment in the 24 
hours they spent in kuwait 
when we got there it was so beautiful so peaceful you could 
feel the gloom the panic when we left we didnt realize the 
danger we were in everybody thought he saddam hussein would pull 
his troops out in a day or two 
she said the groups host had the instinct not to take them to 
the american embassy where they would have faced further danger 
and delay 
his first instinct was just to get us out of the country 
she said 
the entertainers accompanied by a driver from the kuwaiti royal 
family made it to alkabar saudi arabia they were eventually 
contacted by representatives of the saudi royal family and got 
assistance from a source woodruff wont identify even to her 
family because of security concerns 
the group was able to get out of saudi arabia in time to finish 
a scheduled engagement in morocco before returning home 
woodruffs mother shirley rankin spent many tense hours early 
in the invasion when news reports indicated the entertainers and a 
member of the royal family were missing 
this has made the world a lot smaller to us she said 
tuesday 
i thought it would be an adventure for her but nothing like 
this mrs rankin said

republican j fife symington iii heads into a 
gubernatorial showdown against democrat terry goddard with a 
lessthanringing endorsement from former gov evan mecham 
ill support fife said mecham who lost his comeback 
attempt in tuesdays primary as ive said many times goddard 
will be a 100 percent disaster fife will only be an 80 percent 
disaster 
with 99 percent of the states precincts reporting symington 
had 161347 votes or 44 percent to mechams 89496 votes or 24 
percent in the fiveway gop race goddard had 209454 votes or 84 
percent to beat perennial candidate david moss who 39970 or 16 
percent 
now the great battle begins said symington a millionaire 
developer of his general election contest with goddard the former 
phoenix mayor who also is known as samuel p goddard iii 
mecham was seeking a political comeback 2 years after his 
impeachment conviction and removal analysts said his chances were 
doomed by higherthananticipated turnout in addition the 
fiveway race split the vote 
this isnt particularly an excuse because we knew this going 
in its a little difficult for one libertarian and two 
conservatives to beat a liberal mecham said referring to others 
among the gop losers 
mecham refused to say whether he would run for office again 
democrat rose mofford the secretary of state who became 
governor upon mechams ouster had decided to retire rather than 
seek the office in her own right 
the republican turnout of about 413 percent was well above the 
expected 35 percent to 37 percent pollsters earl deberge and bruce 
merrill attributed it symingtons lastminute ad blitz 
we saw the undecided vote dropping very quickly in the last 
week said merrill who had predicted a possible mecham victory 
if turnout stayed below 35 percent the decideds flowed 
principally to symington 
symington 45 portrayed as the liberal in the gop primary used 
his victory speech to get in his first jabs at goddard 43 son of 
former governor sam goddard and a descendant of one of abraham 
lincolns confidantes 
goddard is a professional politician a taxandspend dukakis 
liberal democrat and im a goldwater conservative and im proud 
of it said symington who graduated from harvard in 1968 
actually im not a professional politician replied 
goddard harvard class of 1969 im a professional lawyer and am 
not politically employed at the moment 
symington no stranger to politics ran a major campaign in the 
mid1980s to promote a retail office complex that he was developing 
over thenmayor goddards objections his greatgrandfather henry 
clay frick founded us steel and his uncle stuart symington was 
a us senator 
symington announced for the republican nomination last year 
saying he feared mecham would win it by default even though he was 
a schoolyard bully who deserved a poke in the nose 
mecham in his turn attacked symington as a candidate of corrupt 
powerbrokers 
goddard elected mayor as an antiestablishment outsider in 
1983 quickly moved to the center his family is wealthy and like 
symington who far outspent his gop opponents goddard can mobilize 
wealth for his campaigns he resigned as mayor for the governors 
run 
goddard loves ceremonies treasures the plaques he receives and 
has kept a firefighters uniform in the trunk of his car 
symington was a major financial backer of the drive to recall 
mecham in 1988 the recall election was called off when the state 
senate sitting as court of impeachment voted to oust mecham on 
charges of obstructing justice and misusing state money 
among the other gop primary candidates former maricopa county 
supervisor fred koory had 17 percent former congressman and mecham 
aide sam steiger who previously had run for governor as a 
libertarian had 13 percent former mecham aide bob barnes had 2 
percent

andrew dice clay and eddie murphy will likely 
tone down their comedy routines to keep their acts popular 
predicts veteran funny man bill cosby 
a comedian has to be liked if people dont like you they 
definitely dont see anything funny about you cosby said in an 
interview this week on the syndicated television show 
personalities 
the only business that i know of is in the field of sports 
where you can be disliked and make a living cosby said 
cosby singled out murphy and clay as examples of comics whose 
humor will probably change as they get older 
i know that when they hit 30 whatever it is man theyre not 
going to want to be known as the guys who said and grabbed and did 
all of that scatological humor especially if they have kids 
growing up said cosby

irans spiritual leader today called the 
struggle against the united states a holy war and said moslems 
who die fighting the us presence in the region would go to heaven 
as martyrs 
the call by ayatollah ali khamenei came a day after tehran 
reprtedly agreed to give iraq food and medicine in exchange for oil 
and cash such a deal could puncture the un embargo that aims to 
force iraq out of kuwait 
it also came two days after iran said it plans to renew full 
diplomatic relations with iraq which is seeking to break out of 
the isolation imposed on it since it invaded kuwait aug 2 
speaking on tehran radio khamenei said moslem nations will 
not allow america to set up its security and defense system in the 
region 
the struggle against american aggression greed plans and 
policies in the persian gulf will be counted as jihad holy war 
and anybody who is killed on that path is a martyr he said on 
the radio monitored in nicosia 
analysts said khameneis comments may have been aimed at 
placating antiwestern radicals in the tehran hiearchy who have 
been critical of the us presence as well as the moderating 
policies of president hashemi rafsanjani 
both khamenei and rafsanjani have in recent months headed off 
criticism from radicals by issuing hardline statements that appear 
intended for internal consumption 
a wellinformed source in tehran speaking in a telephone 
interview late tuesday said irans leaders had agreed to iraqs 
request for the trade deal which he said would involve shipments 
of 200000 barrels of refined oil a day 
there was no official comment from tehran or baghdad on the 
reported agreement but the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said it was struck during a visit sunday by iraqs 
foreign minister tariq aziz 
he was the first senior iraqi official to visit iran in 15 years 
facing mounting international isolation after its seizure of 
kuwait iraq suddenly sought a formal settlement with iran its foe 
in an eightyear war that ended in a 1988 ceasefire 
it exchanged prisoners of war withdrew troops from disputed 
territory and agreed to share the shattalarab waterway for iraq 
a vital outlet to the persian gulf 
the effort is expected to free up hundreds of thousands of iraqi 
troops along the 730mile iranian border for redeployment in the 
faceoff with a usled multinational force across the kuwaiti and 
iraqi borders in saudi arabia 
the tehran times reported in an editorial today that iran was 
studying the issue of providing food and medicine to iraq 
the englishlanguage daily which reflects government thinking 
said once iran finalizes its decision and starts shipping food 
and medicine to iraq political circles here believe iraq will 
have an outlet in its present strapped situation 
iranian officials are convinced that the moslem iraqi people 
should not pay for the mistakes of their government iraqi children 
and women have had no role in the occupation of kuwait by baghdad 
troops the paper added 
it made no mention of receiving oil in return oil is iraqs key 
earner but the unordered embargo on trade with baghdad has 
choked exports 
tehran has called for iraqs immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal from kuwait and rafsanjani of iran said last month that 
his country would would honor the international sanctions 
but iran also opposes the us military buildup in the region 
and claimed on the eve of the aziz visit that food and medicine 
shipments would not violate the un embargo which aims to force 
saddam hussein to relinquish kuwiat 
iraq has been desperately seeking ways of beating the sanctions 
on monday saddam offered free oil to developing nations but at 
least publicly there appeared to be no takers 
the source in tehran said the iranians refused iraqs offer of 
full payment in oil for the commodities but agreed to take up to 
200000 barrels of refined oil a day about 6 million worth 
wellinformed oil industry sources in the region contacted by 
the ap say that although iran is a major oil exporter itself it 
currently has to import about 150000 barrels of refined oil a day 
for domestic use 
iranian refineries damaged in the 198088 war with iraq are 
unable to meet the domestic daily consumption of 750000 barrels 
the oil industry sources said iraqs bazargan oilfields or a 
refinery in basra just 12 miles from the border could be used to 
supply that oil 
iran currently is exporting about 25 million barrels of crude a 
day it has already benefited from the persian gulf crisis which 
has nearly doubled the price of oil over the last few weeks to 
about 30 a barrel 
that windfall has earned billions of dollars for tehran which 
is desperate for foreign exchange for postwar reconstruction 
unconfirmed reports from baghdad say the iranians already have 
allowed rice flour and wheat consignments across the border 
but iran which imports more than 40 percent of its food would 
be hardpressed to divert much food to iraq experts say they note 
that it lacks the port facilities to deal with a much higher volume 
of imports

a 1940 law that protects military reservists 
on active duty from debt collectors back home needs updating to fit 
todays economic realities witnesses told congress wednesday 
for example the provision prohibiting landlords from evicting 
members the reserves and the national guard who have been called up 
applies only if the rent is 150 a month or less 
obviously inflation has seriously affected the usefulness of 
that figure in todays rental market said assistant defense 
secretary christopher jehn the law was last revised in 1966 
during the vietnam war 
since irag occupied kuwait aug 2 and the united states began 
its persian gulf buildup lenders landlords and employers have 
been cooperating with the military callup in many cases writing 
down the expenses of soldiers and sailors on duty in the gulf or in 
the united states filling in for others sent to the gulf said a 
house veterans affairs committee aide who requested anonymity 
but that isnt expected to last forever 
recently the president announced that by oct 1 about 47000 
of the 117 million civilians who belong to the reserves and 
national guard will be called to active duty since the buildup 
began said rep gv montgomery dmiss chairman of the house 
veterans affairs committee 
he told wednesdays joint hearing with the senate veterans 
affairs committee that the callup has prompted many inquiries 
about the protections in the soldiers and sailors civil relief 
act 
sen alan cranston dcalif and the chairman of the senate 
committee said service members told him during his recent fourday 
trip to visit troops in saudi arabia that they were worried about 
their financial obligations back home 
the law prohibits debt collectors and others from taking any 
action against reservists who are on active duty and who 
temporarily are unable to meet their obligations because of their 
military duty 
assistant secretary jehn said his office is preparing 
recommendations for congress to revise the law in the following 
areas 
eviction protection jehn said a suggestion has been made to 
raise the 150 limit on protected rent to 750 with an escalator 
provision tied to the consumer price index 
interest rates under current law interest owed by an 
activeduty reservist on debts ranging from mortgages to credit 
cards must drop to 6 percent during the active duty but it is not 
clear whether the interest is compound or simple and whether that 
portion unpaid is to be forgiven or must be paid later 
credit protection jehn said the law needs specific language 
that protects the service members credit rating 
court proceedings and default judgments more detailed language 
is needed to protect service members involved in legal proceedings 
from problems that could arise from missing court appearances 
malpractice insurance doctors called to active duty need 
adjustments in their insurance rates to account for losses in 
income during military service 
tuition reimbursement some students called into active duty 
need to be assured they will be reimbursed for prepaid tuition for 
classes they find they cannot attend

despite renewed warfare between tamil 
rebels and the government tourism is on the rise in this indian 
ocean island of beaches gems and jungles officials said wednesday 
the number of foreign tourists who arrived in the past three 
months when tamil guerrillas and the army were fighting their 
biggest battles in recent years soared 62 percent over the same 
period last year the government tourist board reported 
for the first eight months of 1990 the rate of increase was 4 
percent over the comparable period in 1989 
the increase is mainly because the situation has improved in 
sri lanka said mnl lantra director of research for the 
tourist board last year there were problems in the south and 
central regions of the country but this year the violence is 
confined to the north and east 
in june tamil rebels resumed their 7yearold violent campaign 
to carve out a separate homeland for their ethnic minority tamils 
have long accused the sinhalese majority of discriminating against 
them in jobs and education 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people while 
sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population and control the 
government the violence has claimed more than 14000 lives since 
1983 
lantra said 18050 tourists arrived in june compared to 11630 
in june 1989 july arrivals were 26410 this year compared to 
15194 in 1989 and 26786 tourists arrived last month compared to 
17220 in august 1989 
last year tourism was badly hit by a murderous cycle of 
assassinations and retaliations involving sinhalese extremists and 
progovernment forces they peaked during the summer in the beach 
resort areas of the south coast the government quashed the revolt 
last winter with the arrests and killings of the top leaders of the 
peoples liberation front a radical sinhalese group that opposes 
government concessions to the tamils 
sri lanka formerly called ceylon had a shortlived respite 
from its ethnic wars until june 11 when the tamil tiger rebels 
broke a 13monthold ceasefire and resumed the war in the 
northeast 
shortly before the battle flared anew tourists were starting to 
return to the northeast which has some of the islands best 
beaches since june the tourist board and some embassies have 
advised foreigners to avoid unnecessary travel to the north and 
east 
tourism has been a mainstay of sri lankas economy it provides 
more than 50000 jobs when the tamil revolt started in 1983 
tourism was at its peak with 337000 arrivals per year 
the number of arrivals dropped to 317000 in 1984 and has 
remained below 300000 every year since then the worst year was 
1987 when 182620 tourists arrived

an improperly installed seal is 
believed to have caused the hydrogen leaks that halted last weeks 
launch of the space shuttle columbia and it has been replaced 
nasa said today 
the seal had been crushed and was found tuesday during a check 
of fuel lines inside the shuttles aft compartment said james 
hartsfield a spokesman for the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
the seal was replaced tuesday night and helium tests conducted 
today produced no leakage in the area 
nasa said today that tuesday is its target date for a fourth 
attempt to launch columbia and that oct 8 is the day it hopes to 
launch discovery 
the teflon seal about 2 inches in diameter is part of a valve 
on a hydrogen line that leads to one of the shuttles three main 
rocket engines he said 
they feel extremely confident thats what stopped our show 
last time hartsfield said they think theyve cured it its a 
great thing to be able to say 
officials believe the seal was misinstalled after columbias 
last flight in january hartsfield said 
the countdown for columbias astronomy mission was delayed for 
the third time last week by leaking hydrogen workers on monday 
installed a new set of recirculation pumps which engineers 
initially believed was the source of the leaks 
columbias flight with seven astronauts and a 150 million astro 
observatory has been on hold since may when leaking hydrogen fuel 
first was detected a second launch attempt earlier this month was 
put off because of problems with one of astros four telescopes 
time is running out for columbia which must lift off next week 
or be delayed until after discovery is launched on a toppriority 
mission in october 
discovery has from oct 5 to oct 23 to lift off with a 
plutoniumpowered satellite called ulysses that will be sent on a 
fiveyear journey to study the suns polar regions if nasa misses 
that deadline discoverys 750 million mission will have to be 
postponed until late 1991 when earth is aligned properly again 
with the sun and jupiter 
jupiters gravity will be used to whip ulysses into the proper 
orbit around the sun it will be the first spacecraft to circle 
over the suns poles 
milt heflin flight director for the ulysses mission said at a 
news briefing today at johnson space center that he is confident 
discovery will be able to lift off on oct 5 or soon afterward no 
hydrogen leaks were detected during discoverys last flight in 
april and that is a good sign the shuttle will not leak during 
fueling he said 
a leak in discoverys cooling system is not rapid enough to 
force a postponement of the mission nasa officials said 
nasa has not launched a shuttle since discoverys april flight 
with the hubble space telescope which later was found to have a 
defective mirror

the european community should impose lower speed 
limits throughout its member countries to fight air pollution 
french environment minister brice lalonde said in an interview 
published wednesday 
lalonde also told le figaro newspaper that german automakers 
were losing their reputation for environmental awareness by 
producing too many powerful cars there is no speed limit on many 
sections of the west german highway system 
lalonde noted that the ec has no jurisdiction over traffic 
safety rules in the 12 member nations but if the ec set limits for 
carbon monoxide emissions he said we could then limit speeds on 
the european level in the framework of the fight against 
pollution 
he did not suggest specific speed limits 
outside west germany speed limits among ec countries range from 
866 mph on some italian highways to 55 mph in ireland which does 
not have an extensive highway system 
the 12 ec nations are france west germany italy luxembourg 
belgium netherlands denmark greece ireland portugal spain and

people who smoke crack cocaine appear to increase 
their risk of strokes and doctors should consider drug abuse 
whenever treating young people with strokes a study concludes 
the report found a strong temporal if not causal link 
between crack and strokes 
we believe that the ongoing crack epidemic will lead to more 
cocainerelated strokes the researchers wrote 
the report describes 28 people who suffered strokes within 72 
hours of smoking crack other researchers have found similar links 
between strokes and other forms of cocaine 
they said that doctors should take a thorough history of drug 
use and give blood and urine tests when evaluating any young 
patient with a stroke 
the report by dr steven r levine of henry ford hospital in 
detroit and other doctors was published in thursdays new england 
journal of medicine 
of the patients studied twothird suffered symptoms of strokes 
within an hour of using cocaine 
most had been regular crack users for at least two years 
although one had smoked it only occasionally and another was 
stricken after his first use 
the researchers theorize that crack and other forms of cocaine 
could trigger strokes in several ways the drug raises blood 
pressure and this could cause a blood vessel in the brain to 
burst the drug also causes heart rhythm abnormalities which could 
trigger the formation of a clot that travels to the brain and 
blocks a blood vessel cocaine could also causes spasms that make 
blood vessels in the brain squeeze shut starving brain tissue 
the study was based on stroke cases seen by doctors in detroit 
new york miami and new haven conn

lawmakers from energydependent states 
proposed legislation wednesday that would allow the president to 
prohibit unreasonable oil and gasoline price increases during a 
national emergency 
the price of gas has gone up more than 20 percent in the last 
month and has stayed up even when crude oil prices dropped 
temporarily and even when other nations began increasing their 
output of oil to make up for the iraq and kuwait shortfall said 
sen joseph lieberman dconn who introduced the legislation 
the american petroleum institute which represents the major oil 
industries called the proposal a thinly disguised effort to revive 
the price controls of the 1970s that led to long lines at gas 
stations 
under the proposal the attorney general would have the power to 
investigate cases of alleged price gouging a conviction for 
profiteering could result in jail time and up to a 500000 fine 
the federal government would also have the power to seize any 
illegally obtained profits from oil companies 
seventeen senators and 29 representatives most from northern 
energyconsuming states joined in proposing the legislation

the victors of world war ii on wednesday signed 
one of the most important documents of the postwar era giving 
international sanction to both german unity and a major reshaping 
of the eastwest balance of power 
secretary of state james a baker iii proclaimed the signing a 
rendezvous with history 
this represents the end of a 45year journey baker said 
after he and the foreign ministers of the soviet union britain 
france and the two germanys signed a treaty settling the global 
aspects of german unification 
at the signing ceremony inside moscows posh october hotel 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev watched west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher affix the first signature followed 
by east german prime minister lothar de maiziere who is also 
foreign minister 
the allies were next french foreign minister roland dumas 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze baker and british 
foreign secretary douglas hurd 
the seven men shook hands and drank a champagne toast 
immediately after the signing 
the sweeping document called the treaty on the final settlement 
with respect to germany climaxes seven months of tough bargaining 
between the six nations 
in it the same four powers that defeated germany in 1945 give 
their seal of approval to german unity it will lead to scrapping 
their special rights in germany such as their control of air 
corridors into berlin 
the treaty was the last major document needed to clear the way 
for merging the two germanys on oct 3 
under the document the soviet union loses east germany as its 
most valued military ally the six nations agreed all of germany 
can belong to nato 
the soviets will be allowed to keep their estimated 370000 
troops in east germany for a maximum of four years armed forces of 
the three western world war ii allies will be permitted to remain 
in berlin as long as soviet troops are still in east germany 
the treaty also addresses soviet concerns about the potential 
might of a united germany and about shifts in the european balance 
of power 
the soviets won a pledge from the germans they would put a cap 
of 370000 on their total troop strength the two germanys 
currently have about 600000 soldiers 
both german nations also vowed to renounce ownership or use of 
atomic chemical and biological weapons 
the soviets won a concession that no nuclear weapons would be 
deployed on east german soil even after all red army troops are 
withdrawn 
the treaty also states that a united germany will never try to 
claim land forfeited to poland after world war ii 
poland had expressed reservations about a united germany 
fearing the germans might try to reclaim the territory 
the horrible devastation of world war ii started by nazi 
germany in 1939 is evoked in the sixnation treaty germanys 
division and the start of the the cold war era followed the 
nazis 1945 defeat 
the governments of the federal republic of germany west 
germany and the german democratic republic east germany reaffirm 
their declarations that only peace will emanate from german soil 
the treaty states 
it adds according to the constitution of the united germany 
acts tending to and undertaken with the intent to disturb the 
peaceful relations between nations especially to prepare for 
aggressive war are unconstitutional and punishable 
genscher said the treaty signing was a day of joy and 
jubilation for germans but that the victims of world war ii and 
the nazi terror must never be forgotten and the agony of the 
jewish people never repeated 
in this hour we remember the victims of war and totalitarian 
domination he said 
baker and his counterparts heralded the impending birth of a new 
german nation 
we have closed the book on world war ii and started a new 
age shevardnadze said 
negotiations on the treaty continued up until hours before 
wednesday afternoons signing because of technicalities in the 
wording 
the soviets wanted assurances there would be no largescale nato 
maneuvers in what is now east germany after the red army 
withdrawal a postmidnight session between baker and genscher 
produced lastminute language approved by the others that the 
germans will judge what sort of maneuvers the western alliance 
might conduct but without any nuclear weapons 
resolving another nagging issue the six ministers agreed to 
permit launchers that could fire a nuclear payload to be based in 
the present east germany but not actual nuclear weapons themselves

a gang of offduty us immigration guards 
masqueraded as law enforcement officers and stole from people they 
thought were illegal aliens or drug dealers prosecutors said 
wednesday 
indictments unsealed wednesday charged four immigration and 
naturalization service guards with robbing and burglarizing eight 
legitimate citizens who reported the crimes district attorney 
robert morgenthau told reporters 
but they are suspected of committing dozens of armed robberies 
during the past year preying mainly on people unlikely to go to 
the police 
there are probably victims who are drug dealers and who are 
illegal immigrants morgenthau said but its more difficult to 
get them to cooperate 
gang members who called themselves the nasty boys posed as 
fbi or ins agents or city police usually wearing uniforms and 
carrying badges and phony warrants prosecutors said 
they forced themselves into homes by telling their victims they 
were on government business although their only real jobs were as 
guards at the ins detention center in lower manhattan 
morgenthau said other guards from the center were involved but 
he would not speculate on a number ins spokesman charles troy said 
the center employs about 80 guards supervisors and guard managers 
the ins and the us justice department are continuing the 
investigation along with local authorities 
the defendants carried illegally possessed weapons in the 
robberies morgenthau said noting that they were unarmed when at 
work 
most of the victims were hispanic 
the district attorney said any illegal alien who was victimized 
by the gang and comes forward to help the prosecution might be 
granted the legal right to remain in the country 
it makes a difference to the ins he said the number 1 
thing is to root out corruption in government thats our 
priority 
asked how someone might recognize that the perpetrators were not 
real federal agents morgenthau said they cant thats why this 
is such a really horrendous practice 
but he added when they take your money you know theyre not 
on official business and you should report that immediately 
the indictments charge that pedro galiano 36 held up two men 
may 22 in the lobby of their apartment building handcuffed them 
and physically assaulted them 
luis nelson 22 and carol canedo 26 allegedly broke into an 
apartment on july 7 forced a family into the living room and told 
them they were searching for someone 
when they left the family discovered items missing including 
cash and jewelry and realized they had been robbed assistant 
district attorney michael warren said 
nelson canedo and benjamin nazario 36 also burglarized two 
apartments on july 14 warren said 
all four are being held in lieu of 25000 bail he said 
nazario and nelson had left their jobs at the time of their 
arrests said troy canedo and galiano were suspended without pay 
he said 
galiano was a supervisor and the most senior of the suspects 
having worked at the manhattan center since 1983 troy said

white house at the prompting of a neighbor bush quoted part of it 
in his speech to congress and the nation tuesday night on the 
persian gulf crisis 
my mom i talked to her several weeks ago before i came over 
here and she said some of her friends had read it merritt said 
in a television interview wednesday from the middle east they 
got her to send it to the president i was shocked 
in his speech bush cited merritt as a symbol of patriotism 
in the face of danger they are brave well trained and 
dedicated bush said 
then the president read a passage from merritts 2page missive 
i am proud of my country and its firm stand against inhumane 
aggression i am proud of my army and its men i am proud to 
serve my country 
the president continued let me just say wade america is 
proud of you and grateful to every soldier sailor marine and 
airman serving the cause of peace in the persian gulf 
merritts sister kim inklebarger said the family has always 
felt that he was very special hes always had a real special 
artistic writing ability so we are glad that it has been 
recognized and we are pleased for him

as americans we often take our freedom for granted wrote 
merritt a member of the 24th military intelligence battalion 
which shipped out from fort stewart ga for saudi arabia on aug 
19 
now the freedom of peaceful nations is being jeopardized and 
it is the just duty of myself and my fellow men to restore freedom

being of all our men and women in our armed forces and the other 
peaceful and friendly nations he wrote 
wish and pray for a peaceful and speedy solution to this whole 
affair and may our adversaries think in this way too have faith in 
our president and his decisions 
merritts father ken said wade has always been very macho 
and gung ho about his country but the elder merritt added he 
lives within himself hes sort of quiet it takes something 
special for him to express himself 
the family was notified tuesday by the white house that the 
letter would be included in the presidents remarks they gathered 
round the television set to watch the speech and then found 
themselves on television wednesday being interviewed by the network 
morning talk shows 
wade i never knew just writing this one letter would cause 
all this mrs merritt told her son wednesday in a telephone 
conversation conducted in front of the tv cameras 
merritts father said the family was quite elated that 
president bush mentioned the letter and mentioned our sons name 
but whats really important is that these are the feelings of 
my son not my feelings imposed on him this is from his heart

to visit the soviet union in years left wednesday for talks in 
moscow on bilateral and middle east issues a foreign ministry 
spokesman said 
the visit yet another sign of improving israelisoviet 
relations comes against the background of a changing soviet role 
in the region 
the israeli delegation includes arieh levine head of israels 
consular delegation in moscow david afek head of the foreign 
ministrys center for political research and two of the ministrys 
deputy directorgenerals 
this is the first time that diplomats of this level have been 
invited by the foreign ministry of the soviet union an israeli 
foreign ministry spokesman said he briefed reporters on condition 
of anonymity 
the team is to lay the groundwork for foreign minister david 
levys meeting this month with his soviet counterpart eduard 
shevardnadze at the un general assembly government officials 
said talks also would focus on moscows role in the middle east 
arms race including its relations with iraq and syria 
according to press reports the team also may discuss israels 
request for expanding its diplomatic mission in moscow and raising 
the level of political meetings in the soviet capital 
moscow broke off diplomatic relations with the jewish state 
following the 1967 middle east war ties have improved over the 
past three years and both countries have set up diplomatic 
missions 
i hope full diplomatic relations will be established very 
soon levy told a news conference wednesday 
in addition to the diplomatic team israeli housing minister 
ariel sharon is in moscow to encourage more soviet jewish 
emigration he is the second cabinet minister to visit the soviet 
union in the past year 
meanwhile us officials were quoted in israeli newspapers 
wednesday as saying washington may be willing to allow an expanded 
role for the soviet union in middle east peace efforts because of 
moscows positive role in the gulf crisis 
israel must get used to a new era proclaiming a greater extent 
of ussoviet coordination in political issues the hebrew daily 
maariv quoted a senior american official as saying 
the official who was not identified suggested that 
israeliarab peace efforts in the future could involve a meeting 
under joint auspices of the superpowers 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir has long opposed moscows 
proposal for an international peace conference on the region but 
he has not ruled out talks sponsored by the superpowers 
levy said at the news conference there was room for soviet 
involvement if moscow changed its policy of arming arab nations 
hostile to israel 
american rapprochement with syria a longtime soviet ally and 
enemy of israel has given rise to suggestions the united states 
may try to bring israel and syria together israeli officials said 
they have not seen any specific proposals but are ready for direct 
talks with any arab leaders

president bush videotaped a message wednesday 
telling the iraqi people he has no quarrel with them and they 
should blame any hardship from the mideast crisis on their own 
government the white house said 
on the eightminute tape which the white house hopes will be 
broadcast unedited in iraq bush says the us military is in the 
persian gulf only to defend saudi arabia from iraqi aggression 
we want a peaceful resolution we want peaceful coexistence 
with the people of iraq bush says on the tape according to 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the white house held off releasing a transcript but fitzwater 
gave an overview of bushs comments 
the presidents address was intended to create internal problems 
for saddam by emphasizing iraqs isolation in the world community 
as a result of the invasion of kuwait ush has said previously he 
would not be unhappy if the people of iraq removed saddam from 
power and the address stressed that iraqis are paying a heavy 
price for his actions 
the president consulted with arab specialists and met twice 
with state department and national security council officials to 
come up with the wording fitzwater said 
the arab specialists were asked to look at the wording to make 
sure that the tone of it translates well into arabic said one 
official speaking on condition of anonymity you can write a 
speech that sounds perfectly good to western ears but might not 
convey the right impression in arabic the official said 
fitzwater described the message as a very candid but personal 
description of our goals and our objectives in the region 
the president was forthright and didnt stage anything just 
gave a direct message said sig rogich bushs assistant for 
media consultation who produced the tape for the president 
the white house worked wednesday on adding arab subtitles and 
audio translation to the tape before sending it to the iraqi 
ambassador via deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
the voice of america said in a statement that it was doing the 
translating before the tape is handed over to forestall any 
excuses for not using the tape 
fitzwater said although there had been no direct contact between 
the two governments regarding the videotape we expect that iraq 
will honor its invitation to allow this to be addressed to the 
iraqi people and we will ask them to provide us an air time within 
the next five days 
he told reporters that the white house will release the tape to 
the media after it is aired or after five days if the iraqis do 
not show it 
bush made the tape after the iraq government offered to sent a 
tv crew to interview him and broadcast the interview on national 
television he opted to make his own tape instead of submit to an 
interview 
he taped the message at 730 am in the oval office standing 
in front of his desk and reading from a teleprompter 
essentially it repeats some of the themes that the president 
expressed last night particularly that we have no quarrel with the 
iraqi people that the iraqi government has forced incredible 
hardships on the people of iraq by virtue of the naked aggression 
against kuwait said fitzwater 
asked if bush used any of the harsh rhetoric against president 
saddam hussein that he has used for domestic consumption fitzwater 
said the message was personal and its directed toward the people 
of iraq and the hardship theyve had to bear in this matter 
he said saddam is mentioned in the tape but it the message is 
not an attack on the iraqi leader 
the iraqi government offered bush tv time after the president 
stated publicly that he would like to have the access to the iraqi 
people that saddam hussein has had on us tv networks 
saddam husseins news conferences and appearances with hostages 
have been widely aired often live and in full on tv news programs 
in the united states 
fitzwater said he anticipated broad international interest 
in bushs message

the nations airlines saying they already 
face losses of billions of dollars because of soaring fuel prices 
appealed wednesday to federal budget negotiators to reject calls 
for higher aviation taxes 
higher tax rates would depress consumer demand for air travel 
depress airline earnings and depress government tax receipts all 
in one fell swoop robert j aaronson president of the air 
transport association said in a letter to the negotiators 
aaronson said that since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
gasoline prices have risen 30 cents to 90 cents a gallon 
every penny increase adds 150 million to annual industry 
operating expenses he said 
if fuel prices stay above 90 cents a gallon and demand for 
air services remains soft the industry will lose an estimated 
125 billion this year and possibly 2 billion over the next two 
quarters aaronson said 
including an aviation tax in a federal deficit reduction package 
would have severe financial consequences he said 
airlines have been slow to raise prices to cover the rapid rise 
in fuel prices because they fear they would lose customers 
aaronson said adding that demand for air service already is weak 
because the us economy is on the edge of a recession

more than 650000 cans of french corned 
beef full of hair and other dirty and smelly stuff were 
recalled from refugee camps along the border with iraq officials 
said wednesday 
the united nations relief and works agency had delivered the 
donated food to the refugee camps the camps are home to at least 
50000 foreigners mostly asians who have been stranded here since 
fleeing iraq and kuwait after the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
health minister mohammad adoub alzaben said the cans of corned 
beef delivered monday had to be immediately trashed because 
laboratory tests proved they were unfit for consumption 
he refused to say who made the donation but reporters who saw 
the shipment read on the cans not for sale gift of the european 
economic community 
alzaben said the shipment was originally directed to the 12 
million palestinian refugees who have been living in jordan for 
years but the un agency suggested the food be diverted to the 
more recent refugees 
the food is polluted alzaben said anybody who looks at 
the cans would not accept to eat what is inside it it is full of 
hair and other dirty and smelly stuff 
apparently no one at the camps ate any of the beef alzaben 
said 
the minister said the food was not old or expired but it is 
just not fit for consumption 
to ensure the health safety of the refugees he instructed all 
concerned authorities to inspect any food donations before they are 
distributed for refugees alzaben said 
previously 10 tons of dates donated by egypt had to be returned 
because they were too hard to chew

a senior opposition leader has been 
indicted in connection with a fire set by demonstrators at the 
socialist party headquarters the state news agency bta said 
wednesday 
konstantin trenchev leader of the podkrepa independent labor 
confederation was charged for his role in the aug 26 blaze bta 
said 
trenchev caused embarrassment in the ranks of the opposition 
union of democratic forces after witnesses quoted him as saying a 
group of supporters would attack the party headquarters unless the 
socialists removed the red communist star from atop the building 
the fire was set the same night 
alexander lilov chairman of the successor party to the 
communists subsequently accused hawks in the opposition with 
masterminding the fire 
the charge against trenchev was announced by sofias prosecutor 
borislav yotov 
trenchev denied wrongdoing saying his comments were taken out 
of context 
bta also reported criminal charges have been filed against 
plamen stanchev a member of the civil disobedience group who 
threatened to set himself on fire if the stalinist symbols were not 
removed from public buildings 
he was charged with draft evasion and besmirching the state 
flag bta said it did not elaborate on the charges 
witnesses said stanchev poured what appeared to be a flammable 
substance over himself just before the building was set ablaze but 
was prevented by bystanders from lighting a match 
twenty people have been charged so far for complicity in the 
fire and 11 of them are under arrest newspapers reported 
wednesday 
the attack on the building was a reflection of dissent with the 
socialists who won democratic elections in june but have since 
been increasingly blamed for the countrys growing economic crisis 
trenchev was subsequently barred from traveling abroad and 
podkrepa said the restrictions were imposed under an article of the 
passport law applied to persons whose departure would threaten the 
national interest 
trenchev planned to attend trade union congresses in paris and 
vienna later this month

a mysterious murder film turned out to be no 
mystery at all when police discovered the evidence was really a 
rock music video 
the film found in a movie camera lying in a michigan cornfield 
last year shows trent reznor lead singer for the cleveland rock 
group nine inch nails lying face up in an ally on chicagos north 
side 
chicago police detective hal ardell said tuesday the rock group 
made the film last september using 8mm movie cameras held aloft 
with helium balloons for some of the scenes but a tether broke and 
the balloons carried one of the cameras to a cornfield 125 miles 
away near burr oak mich 
the farmer who found the camera turned it over to michigan state 
police who developed the film and sent a copy to chicago police 
pathologists at the cook county medical examiners office said 
it appeared reznor was dead but ardell said it was starch powder 
placed on reznors face that gave him the deathly look 
inquiries at college film departments turned up a former art 
institute of chicago student who said his employer hgun video 
productions had been hired by a new york firm to produce a music 
video for nine inch nails the man explained how the camera broke 
loose 
the bottom line is we dont have a body and we dont have 
mystery or homicide said john townsend chief of detectives of

must do something to make this city better she wrote we have 
no other choice

itll take more than three coins in a fountain to 
get water spurting at miamis bayfront park city officials want to 
install a credit card slot that would charge gawkers 21 an hour 
for the privilege 
miamis city commission discussed the idea tuesday after 
learning that operating the 315 million claude and mildred pepper 
fountain costs 42 an hour and the city has no money in the budget 
for it after oct 1 
any scheme that helps us pay for running a fountain and gets 
tourists more interested in the park is fine by me said mayor 
xavier suarez 
the idea for a tellerlike machine at the fountain named after 
the late congressman and his wife was suggested by a contracting 
company that offered to build the device to help defray the cost 
to our knowledge this is a unique concept said francisco 
farach president of edd helms electrical contracting inc 
suarez asked if the machine would accept quarters for shorter 
periods farach said no but added that it could take 5 or 10 
bills 
the commission took no final action on the project

the activity known as bungeejumping 
was banned wednesday after two people were injured when one of the 
cords attached to their feet broke free leaving them dangling with 
their heads just above water 
natalie mccurry whose reign as miss australia ended monday 
suffered a broken collarbone when she and a staff member of the 
bungee bats group plunged 130 feet 
john fahey the new south wales industrial relations minister 
said the sport was banned until a report was completed on the 
accident it was not immediately clear whether jumps would be 
allowed elsewhere in australia 
ms mccurry made a successful solo jump from a cage suspended by 
a crane off sydneys birkenhead point she then took a tandem 
plunge with crew member andy gulby 
they had their arms wrapped around each other and elastic cords 
attached to their ankles were supposed to stop their fall a couple 
of yards above the water one of the cords broke free from the 
cage leaving only the other to support the couples combined 
weight 
they hit the water and went under before the remaining cord 
stretched back then they dangled upside down for several minutes 
with their heads just above the surface 
an ambulance spokesman said they were treated for neck and back 
injuries and taken to nearby balmain hospital 
bungee bats director wayne page said all regular safety checks 
had taken place before the pair jumped he said the jumpers had 
gone through the usual weighins and that the cords used had a 
tension to match their combined weight so they would not hit the 
water 
we dont really know what caused the problem he said 
bungee bats began public jumps in sydney last month after a 
threemonth battle with the department of industrial relations over 
safety concerns the department granted approval after tightening 
safety standards which included shortening cords to ensure jumpers 
did not enter the water 
participants pay 56 per jump 
one fatality and another serious injury have been reported in 
new zealand where the activity got its commercial start two years 
ago 
france banned the activity after an elastic cord gave way and a 
man plunged to his death from a 180foot crane at a festival in 
eastern france in june 1989it was legalized again last october 
after rules were established under them jumpers must undergo 
heart exams elastic bands must be changed every 150 jumps and the 
number of jumps per hour for each set of elastic bands must be 
limited

four bank offices in bastia were bombed 
early wednesday and a caller claimed responsibility on behalf of a 
nationalist guerrilla group police and news reports said 
there were no injuries and damage was slight they said 
the bombs exploded in quick succession about 2 am at branches 
of four different banks in and near bastia in northern corsica 
the french news agency agence francepresse said a man later 
telephoned its local office to claim responsibility on behalf of 
the corsican national liberation army 
similar claims were made last weekend in which vacation homes in 
southern corsica were bombed 
police investigators have said they are unsure whether the 
corsican national liberation army is a new distinct group or a 
splinter faction of the corsican national liberation front for 
many years the main proindependence guerrilla group on the french 
island 
at each bombing site the attackers have painted an r the 
caller reportedly said this signified revolt 
according to afp the caller said the banks dont serve the 
corsican people they were established to assist the colonialists 
whatever their nationality 
interior minister pierre joxe described the bombers as a few 
desperados he said they apparently were upset at political 
developments aimed at reconciling corsican demands for more 
automony

a crushed seal that escaped 
repeated checks of columbias leaking rear compartment has been 
replaced and a confident nasa set tuesday as the date for the 
shuttles fourth launch attempt 
engineers initially believed one of columbias three 
recirculation pumps leaked during fueling last week for nasas 
third attempt to send the shuttle on an astronomy mission the 
crushed seal was discovered tuesday as technicians checked the 
newly installed pumps 
nasa spokesman james hartsfield said wednesday the seal 
apparently was damaged when it was installed improperly after 
columbias last flight in january the teflon seal about 2 inches 
in diameter is part of a valve on a hydrogen line that leads to 
one of the shuttles three main rocket engines 
they feel extremely confident thats what stopped our show 
last time hartsfield said they think theyve cured it its a 
great thing to be able to say 
nasa has been trying to send columbia on an astronomy mission 
since may when the shuttles hydrogen leaks first were detected 
the space agency replaced the hydrogen lines between the orbiter 
and external tank and made minor repairs in the aft compartment 
the new components did not leak during fueling for thursdays 
launch attempt but hydrogen flooded the rear compartment where 
the pumps and three main engines are located 
tests of the pumps that were removed found only minor leakage 
and that could not account for the amount of hydrogen that filled 
the compartment hartsfield said 
the national aeronautics and space administration has only a few 
days next week in which to launch columbia with seven astronauts 
and a 150 million observatory called astro after that the flight 
will have to wait until after discoverys toppriority mission to 
send a satellite on a fiveyear journey to study the suns polar 
regions 
the space agency on wednesday targeted oct 8 as a launch date 
for discovery although officials said that could change by a few 
days either way depending on flight preparations discovery must 
lift off by oct 23 otherwise the 750 million mission will have 
to be delayed until 1991 when earth is aligned properly again with 
the sun and jupiter 
the plutoniumpowered sun probe called ulysses will use 
jupiters strong gravitational field as a slingshot back to the 
sun it will be the first spacecraft to orbit over the suns poles 
discoverys five astronauts in interviews at johnson space 
center on wednesday said they have full confidence in nasa and 
their shuttle discovery is the only spaceship in which a hydrogen 
leak has not been detected 
nonetheless were all going to be anxious and be watching our 
tanking a few hours before launch said astronaut tom akers 
were keeping our fingers crossed 
two of columbias three launch scrubs occurred during fueling 
five to six hours before liftoff problems with one of four 
telescopes inside the cargo bay accounted for the second failed 
launch attempt 
atlantis leaks were discovered when hydrogen was pumped into 
the shuttle during a tanking test in june 
nasa has not launched a shuttle since april when discovery was 
sent into space with the hubble space telescope the telescope 
later was found to have a mirror that was manufactured with a 
serious flaw preventing sharp focusing 
discovery astronaut bruce melnick attributes nasas trouble with 
hubble and leaking shuttles to an unusual string of bad luck 
its a shame that weve had our poor batting average here over 
the summer melnick said its time we started launching 
shuttles again

a senate committee wednesday endorsed a 
fiveyear extension of the national endowment for the arts but 
with a demand that grant recipients convicted of violating 
obscenity laws forfeit their federal subsidies within 90 days of 
the conviction 
the bill was approved 151 with strong bipartisan support and 
sent to the full senate after the committee resoundingly defeated a 
proposal by sen dan coates rind that would have imposed much 
stricter antiobscenity curbs on the federal arts agency 
the bill includes 175 million in spending authority for the 
endowment next year the same amount requested by the white house 
in the house a subcommittee has voted to boost the neas current 
171 million budget to 180 million in the fiscal year that begins 
oct 1 
the senate compromise was drafted by a coalition of liberals and 
conservatives on the committee including the chairman sen edward 
m kennedy dmass and the ranking republican sen orrin hatch 
of utah 
arts supporters predicted that the senate bills broad 
bipartisan support in the committee will heighten its chances of 
passage by the full chamber the fate of similar legislation in the 
house was clouded by bitter political wrangling over the obscene 
art issue 
the neas statutory authority expires sept 30 lapsing on the 
same day will be a congressional ban on nea support for artistic 
and literary works that may be considered obscene including 
depictions of homoeroticism sadomasochism individuals engaged in 
sex acts and sexual exploitation of children 
the antiobscenity ban was enacted in october at the urging of 
sen jesse helms rnc who led a conservative assault on the nea 
for supporting exhibitions of works by photographer robert 
mapplethorpe and artist andres serrano that critics charged were 
pornographic and sacrilegious 
hatch said the senate compromise would take the nea out of the 
business of determining what is obscene and would leave those 
decisions to the courts 
the bill would require repayment of federal grant money awarded 
to artists or arts organizations convicted of violating obscenity 
and child pornography laws convicted grant recipients would be 
forbidden to receive further nea grants for three years or until 
their funds are repaid whichever is longer 
coates the lone dissenter said the bill didnt go far enough 
to halt what he called nea support for filth and garbage 
that is profoundly offensive to the majority of the american 
people 
he proposed imposing guidelines on nea panels that select grant 
applications for approval forbidding them to approve works that 
violate the supreme courts obscenity standards involve child 
pornography or attack historic religious figures tenets or symbols 
coates amendment was defeated on a 142 vote after kennedy said 
it probably would be held unconstitutional as a form of prior 
restraint on grant recipients and would have a chilling effect 
on the arts 
coates was supported only by sen strom thurmond rsc who 
then voted in favor of the committee compromise and predicted it 
would provoke a terrible fight on the floor of the senate 
the senate bill made no mention of a proposal pushed by nea 
reformers in the house that would shift the bulk of the endowments 
grant money as much as 60 percent to the control of state arts 
agencies

the phone rings constantly in the 
offices of saudi officials dealing with kuwaiti refugees another 
call often means another demand 
one man in a regular hotel room wanted a luxury suite another 
wanted 3000 for car repairs both requests were denied 
officials are still looking into a refugees plea to move from 
his 12thfloor apartment to a lower level 
while the jordanian government struggles with about 50000 
impoverished asian refugees who fled after iraqs aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait the saudis face a different challenge in coping with up 
to 100000 displaced kuwaits many accustomed to a privileged 
lifestyle 
they think of themselves as guests said one official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
besides the problems of sheer numbers saudi officials also 
confront conservative families not used to living outside the 
privacy of villa walls meanwhile saudis try to tone down the 
grandiose expectations of one of the richest refugee populations in 
history 
they all want accomodation and financial help said prince 
fahd bin salam on wednesday if i was going to see all the 
kuwaitis i would have to see 1000 per day 
there is extra pressure on the kuwaiti women many of whom have 
never traveled much outside their homes before 
one kuwaiti woman dressed completely in black with her face 
shrouded pointed an angry finger at a tape recorder carried by a 
reporter 
turn it off turn it off she yelled retreating into a 
corner she was later told the music was spewing out of the 
elevators loudspeaker 
the government is seeking to move people into about 2000 empty 
apartments built in skyscrapers for lowincome saudis but never 
claimed 
but 16000 refugees remain in schools in the eastern province 
and officials fear classes may be delayed up to a month if the 
refugees are not moved by the start of the session in two weeks 
prince salman said 
saudi arabia is paying for food housing and laundry for the 
refugees in the kingdom many in luxury hotels private caterers 
churn out 20000 meals a day to those families that dont want to 
cook 
so far saudi officials have not released the cost of caring for 
the refugees 
the deposed government of kuwait announced this week that it 
would take over the expenses of the refugees paying each family a 
salary 
married couples will get about 300 dollars a month each plus up 
to 150 per child 
the money will be distributed through refugee committees who 
are trying to help kuwaitis who fled without any papers proving 
their citizenship 
one corner of a parking garage in a 12story building in damman 
has been converted into a mosque 
kuwaitis also flock to daily sessions held by the ruling 
princes a sort of government complaints service where they listen 
to individual problems 
one sudanese man showed up at the province offices monday and 
used the public audience to say he was destitute and needed a 
ticket home prince fahd assured him he would get it

anything to apologize for in a written reply to mokhiber exon 
said his remarks had concerned parts of the arab world not all 
arabs 
my view is that there is indeed less concern today and respect 
for human life in parts of the arab world than elsewhere exon 
wrote without question this is true with some of the leadership 
by warring factions in several places and by obvious government 
policy in other tragic events 
he added i am saddened to learn of any threats or violence 
against american arabs i condemn this and it is not of my doing i 
do not support bigotry 
exon had said at the august fundraiser in the arab world 
force and force of arms is the only thing they understand in 
the arab world human life is not as important as it is in the

chaotic violence raged 
wednesday through black townships where armed gangs set fire to 
homes and chased people through the streets police said at least 
50 people were killed 
it was some of the worst unrest in a month of black faction 
fighting in townships near johannesburg more than 700 people have 
died 
people piled possessions in wheelbarrows and supermarket carts 
to flee clashes between groups armed with machetes axes spears 
and clubs in the black townships 
we have to leave we are helpless without guns said one man 
who refused to give his name 
ambushes in soweto killed a white policeman and three blacks 
while street fighting killed 46 blacks in four other townships 
police said 
later in the day police reported four black men in a van opened 
fire with an ak47 assault rifle on passersby in downtown 
johannesburg killing at least three blacks the independent south 
african press association said 10 people were wounded 
officers fired tear gas and birdshot to disperse crowds in 
vosloorus and soweto houses and cars were set alight and charred 
corpses remained on the street in several areas 
the zulus are killing us said one man at the tokoza 
squatter camp who was carrying an ax every night they come with 
guns 
a resident of the katlehong township told the south african 
press association that youths attacked a train there wednesday 
night setting three wagons on fire the man muzi mango told the 
news agency that he heard gunshots and people screaming 
police said they had no report of such an attack 
african national congress leader nelson mandela discussed the 
violence tuesday with president fw de klerk and called for the 
military to end the fighting mandela and other black leaders have 
been unable to bring peace despite repeated pleas they have 
accused police of fueling the fighting and allege that whites with 
blackened faces or wearing masks have joined in the attacks 
the fighting involves zulus loyal to the conservative inkatha 
movement and xhosas and other blacks linked to the anc it began 
aug 12 in johannesburgarea townships after spreading from natal 
province in the east natal is the traditional zulu homeland 
anc supporters have charged that much of the recent fighting 
began with inkatha attacks on squatter camps and other dwellings 
a senior police official said sending more security forces to 
the townships could control the violence but would fail to address 
its root causes 
i think we can only put the lid on maj gen herman stadler 
told radio 702 the pot is still boiling 
the latest victims included a police officer and three 
colleagues who were ambushed with assault rifles while driving 
through a squatter camp in soweto the policeman was killed and the 
others were seriously injured 
police said the ambushed patrol went to the camp after anc 
leader walter sisulu told them tuesday night that inkatha was 
attacking residents police brig gen vic haynes said sisulus 
report proved false but that the quick police response showed the 
force was not siding with inkatha 
we do not at all say that mr sisulu deliberately led the 
policemen into an ambush haynes added 
also in soweto three blacks died when their yellow van was 
riddled with gunfire from ak47 rifles police said the attackers 
apparently mistook the van for a police vehicle most of which are 
yellow 
the government sent troops into the townships last month to back 
up police but fighting didnt stop mandela said tuesday the 
government could stop the fighting if it wanted to by using its 
powerful military 
he also said the continued unrest threatened talks with the 
whiteled government on ending apartheid mandela has made similar 
statements in the past but the talks have continued 
both inkatha and the anc oppose apartheid but differ over 
tactics and plans for a future south africa inkatha accuses the 
anc of trying to monopolize power by terrorizing political 
opponents the anc says inkatha spread the violence from natal in a 
bid to broaden its constituency 
foreign affairs minister pik botha in a letter to the united 
nations called for international pressure to get mandela and 
inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi to join forces in seeking an 
end to the fighting the anc has so far rejected contact with 
buthelezi 
meanwhile a bomb exploded overnight at a governing national 
party office in pretoria no one was injured a man who identified 
himself as a member of an extreme rightwing group claimed 
responsibility in a telephone call to a johannesburg radio station 
rightwing groups oppose de klerks efforts to end apartheid 
the system of racial segregation that denies blacks a voice in 
national affairs

farmers are harvesting a bumper corn crop 
estimated at a fouryear high of 812 billion bushels up 8 percent 
from last years crop and 3 percent more than forecast a month ago 
the agriculture department said wednesday 
last years corn harvest was 753 billion bushels and the 
department in its initial forecast aug 9 put this falls harvest 
at 785 billion bushels 
abovenormal temperatures the last of august accelerated 
development of the corn crop but it still lagged behind normal 
in most of the major producing states said the departments 
agricultural statistics board 
by sept 2 only about 7 percent of the corn acreage was mature 
19 percentage points was behind normal although harvest had begun 
as far north as kentucky 
the september estimate of 812 billion bushels would be the 
largest corn output since 823 billion bushels were harvested in 
1986 
based on early september surveys corn yields were estimated at 
1217 bushels per acre harvested compared with 1162 last year and 
1177 indicated last month the record is 1194 bushels in 1987 
as livestock feed corn is the largest and most important us 
farm crop and is essential for the production of meat poultry and 
dairy products 
consumer food prices which rose an average of 58 percent in 
1989 the sharpest yeartoyear increase since 1981 are expected 
to climb an additional 5 percent to 7 percent this year 
the huge corn harvest along with bumper wheat yields will help 
cushion against sharp food price increases in 1991 
soybean production a source of highprotein meal and vegetable 
oil was estimated at 183 billion bushels down 5 percent from 
last years harvest of 193 billion bushels and virtually unchanged 
from the august estimate 
cotton production was indicated at 147 million bales up 21 
percent from last years output of 122 million bales but down 1 
percent from the august forecast 
the september report showed total 1990 wheat production at 276 
billion bushels up 35 percent from the 1989 harvest and up 2 
percent from last months estimate average yields at 394 bushels 
per acre equal the record high of 1983 
the departments allcrops production index was reported at 112 
percent of its 1977 average used for comparison that is the 
highest reading since the index averaged 116 percent in 1985 
in a related report on supply and demand for major commodities 
analysts said total corn use in the 199091 marketing year which 
began sept 1 is expected to be about 8075 billion bushels 
including domestic and export requirements 
with demand slightly exceeding 1990 corn production that will 
mean a small increase in us corn stockpiles to about 1375 
billion bushels left over by sept 1 1991 
a month ago with a smaller harvest expected analyst expected 
the corn stockpile to decline in the coming year 
despite the modest upturn it is a sharp turnaround from last 
seasons decline when it plummeted from 426 billion bushels on 
sept 1 1988 to 193 billion bushels on hand last sept 1 
the report said us corn prices may average in the range of 
210 to 250 per bushel in the 199091 marketing year down 25 
cents from the august projection corn prices at the farm averaged 
about 238 per bushel last season 
with largerthanexpected wheat production the stockpile at the 
end of the 199091 marketing year next june is expected to be 946 
million bushels 100 million bushels more than forecast in august 
and almost double the 535 million bushels carried over june 1 
as a result of the larger wheat supply prices at the farm are 
expected to decline to an average of 255 to 285 per bushel this 
marketing year from 372 in 198990 
soybean prices at the farm were forecast at 550 to 7 per 
bushel in 199091 compared with 570 the past marketing year 
that was unchanged from the august forecast 
other 1990 crop estimates based on sept 1 indications compared 
with 1989 output included 
sorghum 5724 million bushels and an average yield of 618 
bushels per acre compared with 6179 million and 554 in 1989

chancellor helmut kohl on wednesday praised 
german unification as the first modern merger of a nation without 
war and suffering 
germans in the east and west hailed the historic signing of the 
unification pact in moscow as the end of the postwar era 
there was none of the euphoria that greeted the opening of the 
berlin wall 10 months ago however 
most east germans now are more concerned about soaring 
unemployment west germans have become upset over the costs of 
unification and many are worried about possible tax increases 
the only negative voices in germany came from the powerful 
lobbying group of germans thrown out of eastern europe after world 
war ii 
the federation of expellees clings to hopes of one day regaining 
lands forfeited to warsaw after world war ii and it objects to the 
formal recognition of polands present western border 
a protest also was lodged by a jewish leader in israel who 
condemned the treaty for failing to mention the nazi holocaust in 
which 6 million jews were killed during world war ii 
with the treaty signing germans have been guaranteed full 
rights over their own united country 45 years after it went down in 
flames 
world war ii is truly over the ard television network 
commented shortly after the signing these signatures 
reestablish the sovereignty of a united germany 
the four world war ii powers that defeated and carved up nazi 
germany signed the treaty with the two german states it approves 
of their unification and heralds the return of full sovereignty 
in bonn kohl said wednesday was another key date on the way 
to german unity 
this is the first unification of a country in modern history 
that is taking place without war suffering and disputes that cause 
new bitterness he said in a written statement 
while the recent rush to unification has been amicable the road 
has been long the division of germany was filled with 
worldthreatening tensions between the late 1940s and the 1960s 
when the superpowers struggled over berlin 
ard television showed dramatic film clips of the german 
separation as part of its report on wednesdays historic signing 
germans also saw as they have many times before film clips of 
the berlin wall being built in 1961 and president kennedy giving 
his famous ich bin ein berliner speech 
the more recent shots showed a smiling soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev chatting amicably with kohl 
ard noted that gorbachevs policies and the end of the eastwest 
conflict cleared the way for german unity and the normalization 
of sovietgerman relations 
secretary of state james a baker iii soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze and their french british and german 
counterparts signed the treaty in the plush oktyabrskaya hotel 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said the 
treaty signing was a day of joy and jubilation for germans but 
that the victims of world war ii and the nazi terror must never be 
forgotten he also noted the agony of the jewish people and 
said it must never be repeated 
in jerusalem prime minister yitzhak shamirs spokesman avi 
pazner said he hoped that the united germany would adopt the 
same friendliness and cooperation with israel as has west germany 
through all these years 
but matityahu drobles chairman of the israeli wing of the world 
jewish congress sent a protest letter to the west german embassy 
in tel aviv because the treaty did not mention the holocaust 
the fact that germany totally ignores its basic moral 
obligation already at the beginning of the unification should be a 
warning light to the jewish nation and to humanity as a whole 
said drobles a survivor of the auschwitz concentration camp

sen paul simons spokesman labeled simply 
wrong a newspaper report wednesday that said the illinois 
democrat made several calls on behalf of a political supporter who 
owed a thrift millions of dollars 
the chicago suntimes said it obtained internal government memos 
that questioned simons phone calls to first nationwide financial 
corp of san francisco 
simon a frequent critic of the governments handling of the 
savings and loan crisis has acknowledged making only one call on 
behalf of stephen ballis a chicago developer who defaulted on a 
loan once held by pathway financial the savings and loan failed 
and was taken over by first nationwide in a rescue that was aided 
by public tax dollars 
the newspaper said it obtained a memo to the federal deposit 
insurance corporations legislative affairs office that was written 
by the fdics james tenney 
one call to get the story is understandable but fivesix 
calls seems highly inappropriate tenney said in the aug 2 memo 
according to the suntimes we thought you should be aware of 
this type of contact 
the memo is simply wrong its untrue simon spokesman david 
carle said they were playing phone tag trying to reach each 
other for a long period of time counting phone message slips is 
not the same as counting phone conversations 
tenney told the associated press he is an ombudsman at the fdic 
but said he could not comment on the memo 
simons rival in the november elections gop rep lynn martin 
said she sent has the suntimes story to the senate ethics 
committee which she has asked to investigate the simonballis 
connection 
i cant imagine with all the problems going on in the savings 
and loan industry that you would find it normal procedure to call 
someone you do not know on behalf of a major contributor she 
said 
another fdic memo dated july 31 said simons calls caused 
thrift officials to meet again with ballis even though he had 
refused the latest workout offer the suntimes said 
first nationwide has said simons intervention didnt affect its 
handling of the loan but a settlement was soon worked out with 
ballis

president mikhail s gorbachev said wednesday a 
plan for converting the soviet union to a market economy has been 
submitted simultaneously to the national parliament and those of 
the 15 republics 
gorbachev saying the entire country should be involved in this 
difficult choice was for the first time seeking nationwide 
approval via the elected parliaments of a policy that 
previously was determined by the communist regimes central 
government 
in an interview with the evening television news program 
vremya gorbachev confirmed that the plan he endorsed and 
submitted to the national and republic parliaments was based on a 
radical proposal by economist stanislav shatalin 
in doing so gorbachev has rejected the proposal for a more 
moderate reform program put forth by prime minister nikolai i 
ryzhkov who has indicated he would resign if his plan is defeated 
when the national legislature reconvenes next week 
reflecting the political uncertainty and public anxiety over the 
economy some soviet newspapers raised questions about the 
stability of society democracy that doesnt provide food is 
doomed said an editorial in wednesdays komsomolskaya pravda 
a columnist for the weekly literaturnaya gazeta suggested the 
militaryindustrial complex might well decide its cheaper and 
safer to launch a military coup he then suggested such an action 
would return the nation to the stagnation that existed under 
former leader leonid brezhnev 
the government newspaper izvestia ran an interview tuesday with 
col gen vladislav achalov who sought to calm readers by telling 
them the presence of paratroops near moscow was benign the troops 
are helping with the harvest and drilling for the nov 7 revolution 
day parade he said and are not a threat to democracy so 
please dont suspect them in any actions against the people 
its a difficult choice to be made gorbachev said in the 
nationally televised broadcast speaking about the decision to 
launch the overall economic reforms 
this is not the choice of one person or of a group of 
people he said it is the country that should make its choice 
and having made the choice to have it going and moving forward 
shatalins plan calls for transferring most economic authority 
from the national government to the republics who then could move 
to free prices privatize government industries legalize private 
ownership of land and take other steps toward a marketbased system 
ryzhkovs plan calls for keeping central control over the 
economy and making a much slower transition to a marketbased 
system he recommended keeping price controls on most food and 
household products while raising the cost of some major items 
such as televisions radios and refrigerators 
the parliament of russia the largest of the republics on 
tuesday overwhelmingly approved a version of the shatalin plan the 
republic led by popular reformer boris n yeltsin has taken the 
initiative on pressing for economic change increasing the pressure 
on gorbachev 
gorbachev had asked a group of economic experts led by abel 
aganbegyan to hammer out a program to submit to the national 
parliament taking elements from both the shatalin proposal and the 
government plan which was written by ryzhkov 
on tuesday he told the parliament of his preference for the 
shatalin proposal and on wednesday he said the unified plan 
submitted to the parliaments is generally based on the concept 
suggested by the group headed by academician shatalin 
but at the same time it is a new document gorbachev told 
the vremya interviewer it has absorbed lots of ideas and 
suggestions of the governments program and of the program 
suggested by many scientists and many ideas and suggestions 
made by our union republics 
gorbachev also appeared to calm the anxieties of a soviet 
populace that has endured shortages of the most basic goods such as 
bread and cigarettes and a wave of panicbuying this year 
no matter what program we choose this transition will be the 
most difficult compared with anything we have done so far during 
the perestroika years he said referring to the economic and 
social program he has launched since taking power in 1985 
we should regard it in a businesslike manner because it must 
be done gorbachev said

maestro wolfgang sawallisch on wednesday was 
appointed music director of the venerable philadelphia orchestra 
the third major us orchestra to pass the baton to a german in the 
past two years 
this orchestra stands at the top and ive known a lot of 
orchestras the 67yearold sawallisch told reporters 
it is the most important thing i can remember he said of 
his appointment 
sawallisch becomes the sixth music director since the orchestra 
was founded in 1900 the latest in a distinguished line that 
included leopold stokowski and eugene ormandy 
these are some pretty big shoes for me to fill sawallisch 
said 
sawallisch will succeed riccardo muti starting with the 199394 
season 
i know that i will be leaving the orchestra in the hands of a 
colleague for whom i have great respect admiration and 
friendship said muti who also is music director at milans la 
scala opera house and is conducting in vienna this week 
theodore a burtis president of the philadelphia orchestra 
association said 230 candidates were considered since muti 
announced in the spring that he would not renew his contract which 
expires in august 1992 
sawallisch is currently music director and general director of 
the bavarian state opera in munich where he was born in 1923 
sawallisch will leave that job at the conclusion of the 199293 
season he plans to keep his munich home and spend three to four 
months a year in philadelphia 
sawallisch becomes the third german to take over as music 
director of a major us orchestra in april kurt masur was 
appointed by the new york philaharmonic christoph eschenbach took 
over in houston in september 1988 
john rockwell a critic for the new york times said the moves 
seem to reflect a growing preference for germanic musical 
interpretation traditional structured music the opposite of 
what the flashy flamboyant muti is likely to produce 
larry grika a violinist for philadelphia and a member of the 
search committee said sawallisch doesnt necessarily fit the mold 
he shows up in a conservative german business suit and tie 
but he is a romantic when he picks up the baton grika said 
sawallisch began his conducting career with the opera theatre of 
augsburg he was later named music director in aachen wiesbaden 
and cologne in 1953 he became the youngest conductor ever invited 
to lead the berlin philharmonic as well as the bayreuth festival 
in the 1960s he was chief conductor of the vienna symphony 
orchestra and music director of the hamburg philharmonic he was 
named music director of the bavarian state opera in 1971 and chief 
conductor and artistic director of the orchestre de la suisse 
romande in 1973 he held both jobs until 1980 
stokowski the philadelphia orchestras third music director 
lifted the orchestra to worldclass status during his reign from 
191236 he and the orchestra appeared in the disney movie 
fantasia ormandy replaced stokowski in 1936 and the big 
booming philadelphia sound further boosted the orchestras 
stature 
that sound attracted muti who replaced ormandy in 1980

chinese authorities are arresting and torturing 
tibetans despite the end of martial law in tibet the dalai lama 
said wednesday 
the nobel prize winner and spiritual leader of tibetan buddhists 
was in new york to help launch a yearlong campaign to raise public 
awareness of tibetan culture and call attention to chinas rule 
over his homeland 
in march 1989 civil strife rocked lhasa the capital of tibet 
and martial law was imposed for a year the public security bureau 
in tibet later said 387 lhasa citizens died in the antichinese 
riots most of them were tibetans but some security forces also 
were killed the bureau said 
tibetans claim more than 450 of their people were killed 
martial law was lifted in march but the dalai lama told 
reporters the actual situation has not at all improved 
the military uniformed personnel changed their clothes to 
police uniforms and plainclothes incidents of arrest and 
torture these also continue said the dalai lama who won the 
1989 nobel peace prize for his leadership of his people 
he said he feared that in 15 years if present conditions 
dont change the tibetan community will become insignificant in 
its own land now a province of china 
about 6 million tibetans still live in their homeland but they 
are outnumbered by chinese even in tibet 
after 40 years of chinese occupation much of tibets 
civilization has been destroyed the dalai lama said 
actor richard gere who is the president of tibet house in new 
york introduced the dalai lama at a news conference to begin the 
year of tibet a series of art exhibits and cultural events to 
promote public awareness of tibetan culture 
many of my friends find tibetan culture quite healthy quite 
useful said the dalai lama who then chuckled and added but i 
dont know 
many of his remarks were sprinkled with selfdeprecating humor 
the year of tibet opens with a show of more than 150 works of 
tibetan art including 31 from the hermitage collection in 
leningrad in april 1991 at the asian art museum in san francisco 
it moves to new york in october 1991

peacemaking meeting of rival palestinian groups wednesday in an 
occupied west bank town and arrested some of the participants 
according to news reports 
israel radio and the national itim news agency said the 
gathering in tulkarem was held to work out a truce between the 
fundamentalist moslem hamas movement and factions of the palestine 
liberation organization 
at least 20 arabs were injured this week in warfare in and 
around tulkarem where the rival movements also have traded angry 
underground leaflets some incidents of hamasplo fighting also 
were reported in the occupied gaza strip 
hamas and the plo have been allied in the 34monthold uprising 
against israeli rule of the occupied lands but they also have had 
disputes over tactics and control the latest outbreak of street 
battles and knifings was among the most violent arab reports say 
participants in the tulkarem meeting held at the municipal 
building included representatives of hamas and fatah the plos 
largest faction such figures as faisal husseini a leading proplo 
activist from east jerusalem and sheik subhi al bitawi a regional

service and paramilitary border police surrounded the building and 
prevented husseini from entering security forces then went in and

some palestinian observers expressed suspicions that the action 
was aimed at prolonging the warfare between the rival arab factions 
in 1989 there were fistfights and knifings in the west bank 
between hamas activists who advocate an islamic state and proplo 
factions who traditionally have been secular in their approach 
hamas one of the groups that started the uprising has argued 
for the overthrow of israel while the plo factions have backed plo

half a million americans live in counties with 
no obstetrician and more than 300000 live in counties that have no 
physicians at all said a congressional report issued wednesday 
these figures typify the health care problems facing people who 
live in sparsely populated areas where hospitals are losing money 
one in six families lives in poverty and 18 percent are uninsured 
the report said 
nearly 57 million people about 23 percent of the us 
population live in what are considered rural areas said the 
report by the office of technology assessment 
the future prospect for rural health care in the absence of 
intervention by the federal or state governments is grim the 
report said rural america cannot support its present complement 
of hospitals and the hospitals are going broke 
rural hospitals tend to have low occupancy rates because they 
are losing patients and many small community facilities will 
continue to lose wealthier patients to more distant urban hospitals 
and clinics the report said 
rural hospitals are also losing money because they have a high 
rate of patients who cannot pay the full costs for their care 
rural areas also have a difficult time recruiting and retaining 
doctors nurses and other health care professionals and in some 
areas an absolute lack of providers may become a crisis 
situation the report said 
in 1988 111 counties with a total of 325100 residents had no 
physicians the report said

a proposal to make it easier for judges to 
carry firearms on the job was approved wednesday by the us 
judicial conference which sets policy for the federal courts 
the plan requires passage of a law by congress and the signature 
of the president 
it would in effect exempt federal judges and magistrates from 
state gun laws 
the idea was prompted by attacks in recent years on some federal 
judges 
the judicial conference is composed of 27 federal judges and is 
headed by chief supreme court justice william h rehnquist

a federal appeals court has refused to assign 
john m poindexters appeal of irancontra convictions to the same 
panel that set aside guilty verdicts against oliver l north 
the three judges of the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia that set aside norths irancontra convictions 
july 20 this week issued an order assigning poindexters case to a 
different panel 
poindexter had argued in a motion filed aug 1 that the same 
panel should consider his appeal of a sixmonth sentence for five 
counts of lying about the irancontra affair because the case 
presented the same issues that were confronted in norths case 
the panel voted 21 to set aside norths convictions ruling 
that references to the immunized testimony he gave congress may 
have seeped into the trial both north and poindexter gave 
testimony to the congressional panels that investigated the 
irancontra affair under limited grants of immunity from 
prosecution 
those grants meant that their testimony could not be used 
against them in criminal trials 
the appellate panel over the vigorous defense of chief judge 
patricia wald ruled that the judge in norths case should hold a 
witness by witness hearing to determine if any testimony was 
influenced by what north told congress during highly publicized 
hearings 
in his petition to assign his case to the same panel poindexter 
said his appeal raises the identical issues based upon identical 
facts and the identical ruling by the same trial court 
but independent counsel lawrence walsh opposed what he called 
poindexters undisguised attempt to select the judges who decided 
adversely to the government in us v north 
the panel which also included circuit judges laurence silberman 
and david sentelle denied poindexters request because it was not 
filed before the july 23 deadline for procedural motions 
poindexter was convicted april 7 of lying to congress about the 
covert military assistance to nicaraguan rebels and the sale of 
us arms to iran poindexter a retired navy rear admiral who was 
once thenpresident reagans national security adviser was given a 
six month prison sentence june 11 by us district judge harold h 
greene 
poindexter remains free pending the appeal which will be 
assigned to another three judge panel of the court

italy will propose that the european community 
normalize relations with syria italys foreign minister said 
wednesday 
economic ties have been frozen since 1986 when the 12nation ec 
accused syria of involvement in international terrorism 
however syria has been among the arab nations that have worked 
closely with western nations since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
and set off the persian gulf crisis 
it is time for a full restoration of relations between the ec 
and syria foreign minister gianni de michelis told reporters 
after talks in rome with his syrian counterpart farouk alsharaa 
a fiveyear ec economic aid package for syria of 191 million 
was suspended in 1986 de michelis said he will propose monday at 
the ecs headquarters in brussels that those funds be released 
immediately and that negotiations begin on a new fiveyear accord 
italy holds the rotating presidency of the community 
this is the first important step for complete normalization of 
relations de michelis said 
alsharra said we are looking forward to much better 
relations between syria and the european community our cooperation 
is very important for stability and security in the middle east 
and the gulf as well 
secretary of state james a baker iii was to travel to damascus 
syria on thursday and alsharaa said the visit will certainly 
normalize and improve very much the relations between syria and 
the united states 
we have been pursuing dialogue for a couple of years he 
said this visit will prove that this dialogue has yielded 
results 
the two countries have been at odds in the past over middle east 
issues and us allegations of syrian involvement in terrorism 
italy and syria will reopen talks in damascus this fall on 
commercial technical and scientific relations he said it will be 
the first such meeting in three years 
de michelis said wednesdays talks produced a complete 
identity of views between the ec and syria on the gulf crisis 
both agree on the need for strict implementation of the un 
resolutions calling for iraqs withdrawal from kuwait as well as 
compliance with the economic embargo against iraq syria and the ec 
also believe a military solution must be avoided de michelis said 
de michelis reacted coolly to the release of 10 italian male 
hostages by iraq the 10 including seven who were ill flew 
wednesday to jordan from baghdad and were scheduled to return to 
italy on thursday 
it is believed to be the first time iraq has allowed a group of 
western male hostages to leave since the rev jesse jackson 
arranged for the departure of four american men on sept 1

about 2700 textile workers from mills up and 
down the east coast marched wednesday outside the white house 
asking congress to back a bill restricting the growth of us 
imports despite president bushs veto threats 
waving signs that read save our jobs limit imports workers 
from shoe and clothing factories in new york pennsylvania north 
carolina and other states marched from the capitol down 
pennsylvania avenue to lafayette park just across the street from 
the white house 
they urged support for a senatepassed measure to restrict the 
growth of us imports of textiles and apparel to 1 percent a year 
and freeze imports of shoes at 1989 levels 
the house could vote on a similar plan tuesday supporters said 
the senate bill is nearly identical to measures passed by 
congress in 1985 and 1988 but vetoed by president reagan 
bushs senior advisers have recommended a veto as well 
last week secretary of state james a baker iii wrote house 
speaker thomas s foley to say the textile bill would hurt us 
efforts in the persian gulf 
baker said the textile bill would violate existing trade 
agreements with turkey and egypt countries that are 
indispensable to our efforts to solidify crucial international 
collaboration 
in addition michael boskin bushs chief economic adviser said 
the legislation would hurt american consumers by driving up prices 
threaten progress in ongoing trade talks and reduce us 
international competitiveness 
supporters of the measure contend the domestic textile industry 
and its workers are being used as a sacrificial lamb in the 
administrations jockeying to reduce foreign trade barriers to us 
exports 
at the rally sen jesse helms rnc said us textile 
workers jobs should not be sacrificed on the altar of the state 
departments foreign policy notions 
since 1980 the us trade deficit on textiles and apparel has 
jumped from 47 billion to 265 billion making it the second 
largest component of the nations trade deficit behind oil 
over the same time more than 1800 textile and apparel plants 
have closed and employment has dropped by 400000 to just over 19 
million jobs despite an 18 billion modernization effort 
but critics contend the bill would cost consumers 25 billion to 
27 billion a year in higher prices 
jack sheinkman president of the amalgamated clothing and 
textile workers unions said the workers who traveled to washington 
were trying to drum up enough support so the bill could pass the 
house with enough votes to override a veto or more than twothirds 
the senate passed the measure by a potentially vetooverriding 
6832 
these people are fighting for a job not a handout 
sheinkman said 
loretha miller a 36yearold mother of three from andrews 
sc said the textile mill where she used to work let her go three 
weeks ago 
im laid off right now because of the imports she said 
when the senate passed the bill bush rejected a request from 
lawmakers from textileproducing states to back away from his 
threatened veto 
i cant say i think the answer to the problem of textiles is 
further protection bush said at the time 
the senate measure would establish nationbynation quotas on 
us imports of textiles apparel and nonrubber footwear beginning 
this year except for certain products from canada and israel 
which have freetrade agreements with the united states 
textile and apparel imports which have tripled in the last 
decade would be allowed to grow only 1 percent a year while shoe 
imports would be frozen at their 1989 level 
however to reduce opposition from farm interests who fear 
retaliation the bill would provide increases in quotas to 
countries that increase their purchases of us agricultural 
products

the congressional budget office predicted 
wednesday that even without a recession 600 to 700 commercial 
banks will fail over the next 3 years and drain the governments 
deposit insurance funds by more than 20 billion 
the projection came just one day after a report that the 
government already is only the hook for at least 8 billion in as 
yet unreported losses from the collapse of texas banks in the 1980s 
the budget office assessment added to fears that banks just 
like sampls will require a multibilliondollar taxpayer bailout 
robert reischauer director of the budget office agreed with an 
assessment tuesday by the general accounting office that a 
recession or the failure of a single major commercial bank could 
force the federal deposit insurance corps 132 billion bank 
insurance fund into insolvency 
there is a possibility there yes reischauer told the 
senate banking committee were on thin ice but the pants are 
still dry 
if the declining real estate values now plaguing the northeast 
spread nationwide and fall as far as they did in the southwest the 
fdic could experience up to 40 billion in net losses by the end of 
1993 
lawmakers reeling from the political fallout of the savings and 
loan debacle that has forced president bush to renege on his no 
new taxes pledge introduced bills in both the house and senate 
to bolster the fdics funds the bills would permit higher 
insurance premiums assessed against banks 
the fdic now charges banks 12 cents a year for every 100 in 
insured deposits under the sampl bailout law passed last year the 
premium will automatically rise next january to 15 cents but the 
agency has proposed raising it to 195 cents 
even with the larger increase the general accounting office 
said insurance funds would still not have enough money without a 
taxpayer rescue to cover possible losses to bank depositors during 
a recession 
it would be a mistake for congress to adjourn this fall 
without ensuring that the fdic has whatever authority it needs to 
raise assessment premiums said senate banking committee chairman 
donald riegle dmich 
riegle introduced a bill to allow the fdic to raise the premiums 
by however much is necessary to increase reserves by 25 billion to 
35 billion 
i hope such increases will not be needed but congress first 
priority must be to protect the bank insurance fund and the 
taxpayers that stand behind it he said 
a similar bill introduced in the house wednesday by rep frank 
annunzio dill the chairman of the banking committees financial 
institutions subcommittee would require the fdic to raise its 
annual premiums to 1 for every 100 of deposit coverage 
the taxpayer should not be saddled with another bill for 
financial institution failure said annunzio who scheduled a 
subcommittee vote on his proposal for sept 27 we must act to 
prevent this catastrophe 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady said wednesday that the 
bush administration also will send a bill to congress in the next 
several days to raise deposit insurance premiums 
we believe the fdic should have all the tools it needs to act 
responsibly brady said 
two other house banking committee members reps richard 
lehman dcalif and gerald kleczka dwis introduced a bill 
wednesday that would limit deposit insurance to 100000 per 
individual depositor 
the fdic now insures each account up to 100000 with no limit 
on how many insured accounts a single depositor can have 
the committee chairman rep henry gonzalez dtexas has 
endorsed the idea of limiting the number of insured accounts and 
reducing the insurance limit 
the bush administration had previously asked congress to wait 
until it completes a study early next year on the entire issue of 
deposit insurance before making any changes in the law

former president reagan who once used the 
berlin wall to give the east bloc a rhetorical bashing grabbed a 
hammer and chisel wednesday to take a few real whacks at the 
remnants of the cold war barrier 
onlookers applauded and shouted we love you ronnie and 
bravo ronnie as the 79yearold reagan and his wife nancy 
walked through the landmark brandenburg gate between east and west 
berlin 
a hundred yards further the reagans came to one of the few 
remaining sections of the concrete wall in central berlin the 
expresident his tongue sticking through his teeth in 
determination gave it a few smacks 
in a speech three years ago in west berlin reagan challenged 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to tear down this wall 
reagans presidential library in simi valley calif has a 
threeton section of the wall which was opened in november 
following an autumn of prodemocracy demonstrations the two 
germanys are scheduled for reunification oct 3 
looking back one year who would have believed that today you 
would be in the final stages of uniting your country reagan said 
in a speech later to a forum on germanys future 
today that symbol of separation the berlin wall is a fading 
memory yet for nearly three decades it had separated the german 
people and it symbolized the lack of freedom for those in east 
germany to travel to speak out to live and to work where they 
chose 
he predicted the united germany would be a partner in western 
security and economic growth and join international peacekeeping 
forces 
it will also serve as a symbol of the unquenchable human 
spirit a spirit embodied in the terms freiheit freedom and 
einigkeit unity 
after visiting the wall reagan visited east german parliament 
president sabine bergmannpohl she said she hoped reagan would 
return to visit the country after unification 
berlin was reagans first stop on a 10day european trip that 
also includes scheduled stops in poland the soviet union and 
italy on thursday he is expected to travel to bonn the west 
german capital to meet with chancellor helmut kohl 
reagan said he believes the course for reforms in eastern europe 
began in the early 1980s when west germany agreed to accept bases 
for cruise missiles with nuclear warheads and the us began its 
star wars strategic defense initiative conceived as a shield 
against nuclear strikes 
both decisions forced the soviets to accept a treaty on 
intermediaterange nuclear forces and focus more on internal 
economic problems he said 
inevitably they loosened their grip on the states of central 
and eastern europe reagan said

a retired czechoslovak general said warsaw 
pact troops were prepared to invade poland in 1980 to crush the 
solidarity labor movement according to an interview published 
wednesday 
but the former czechoslovak officer gen stanislav prochazka 
said the invasion plans were abruptly scrubbed after former polish 
communist leader gen wojciech jaruzelski told pact leaders some 
polish army units would probably fight back 
prochazka made his remarks in an interview headlined we were 
already in the tanks published in the current issue of the 
polish weekly polityka 
prochazka was the commander of the western region of the 
czechoslovak army but retired after he opposed the 1968 warsaw 
pact invasion of czechoslovakia that suppressed the prague spring 
reform movement 
he is now a military adviser to czechoslovakias new 
noncommunist government involved in efforts to democratize the 
army although he did not participate in the 1980 preparations 
prochazka said he obtained his information from reports now 
accessible to him 
in august 1980 a nationwide strike wave forced polands 
communist authorities to allow workers the right to form 
solidarity the first free trade union in the soviet bloc 
the strikes toppled thencommunist leader edward gierek and 
aroused fears among the conservative kremlin leadership headed by 
leonid brezhnev 
prochazka said the sovietled military alliance prepared its 
invasion plans in earnest in november 1980 
soldiers were told that poland needs international help 
because solidarity seriously threatens socialism prochazka 
recalled 
the soldiers were prepared mentally and physically for 
possible fighting they were told that they could expect military 
resistance from the polish army 
troops were moved into attack positions in early december but 
the invasion plans were suddenly called off on dec 5 after a 
meeting of warsaw pact leaders in moscow he told polityka 
prochazka credited jaruzelski then polands defense minister 
with averting a tragic battle by convincing other pact leaders 
that an invasion would mean a high price in bloodshed because at 
least part of the army would likely resist 
i think that jaruzelski successfully explained at the kremlin 
what was obvious to everyone that intervention in poland would not 
be another czechoslovak august 1968 
there was no organized resistance from the czechoslovak army 
when troops from the soviet union and other warsaw pact nations 
including poland invaded 
i know how gen jaruzelski is criticized in poland for 
implementing martial law in december 1981 but it is a fact that 
then in 1980 he prevented a massacre prochazka said 
according to prochazka the invasion plans called for 45000 
czechoslovakian troops and a tank divison to cross the border in 
two columns directed toward the southwestern polish cities of 
wroclaw and opole 
soviet troops were to invade from the east and a symbolic 
contingent of east german troops was to come in from the west he 
said 
the date of full military readiness was set for dec 6 he 
said 
troops were issued live ammunition and officers received maps 
with their objectives he said 
we were supposed to surround polish military units in their 
barracks completely disabling them from doing anything and 
allowing polish authorities to intern solidarity activists he 
said 
prochazka said everyone was convinced that the intervention 
was inevitable but on dec 5 at 8 pm the troops were ordered 
to lower readiness 
on dec 6 the troops began to withdraw from the border and by 
dec 10 they were back in their barracks he said 
the power struggle between polands communist authorities and 
solidarity continued through 1981 amid recurring soviet threats 
on dec 13 1981 jaruzelski who had been named prime minister 
and communist party leader led the military crackdown that 
suppressed solidarity 
jaruzelski defended his action as a lesser evil implying 
that if the polish army had not acted decisively the result would 
have been a sovietled invasion with much bloodshed 
although banned solidarity survived underground throughout the 
1980s and regained its legal status in april 1989 under a 
powersharing agreement with communist authorities 
solidarity won an overwhelming victory in partially free 
elections in june 1989 and went on to establish the east blocs 
first noncommunist government 
jaruzelski was elected president by parliament in july 1989 but 
has been under pressure to resign

he called its residents a group of drug addicts he did not 
apologize for the remark 
im not a drug addict priscilla flint russell told silber 
hey man get the hell out of here 
russell repeatedly asked silber where he thought the drugs came 
from and peppered him with unrelated questions about boston 
university he is on leave as the colleges president after 
several minutes silber said i have no time for that 
fanaticism and ended the press conference 
silber called the session in the boston neighborhood of roxbury 
to explain a comment he made during a debate tuesday with candidate 
francis x bellotti a former attorney general the democratic 
primary is next tuesday 
silber asked how often he campaigned in the highcrime police 
district including roxbury mattapan and parts of dorchester said 
i will tell you something about that area there is no point in 
my making a speech on crime control to a group of drug addicts 
black community leaders were outraged but silber did not 
apologize wednesday insisting that that his words were 
misinterpreted by opponents who paint him as racist the 
neighborhoods are mostly black 
i am sorry that youve been misled he said to the crowd of 
mostly journalists neighborhood residents milled around and 
watched from front steps and balconies 
and if your feelings have been hurt i certainly regret 
that he said but my intentions were quite clear my 
intentions were to point to crime in this area and to the fact that 
its long overdue that we clean this area up 
russell interrupted silber saying that two of her sons had 
died but neither from drug abuse one died in a fire and another 
in a car accident said russell who said she once worked for the 
boston university school of nursing which closed in 1987 
shortly before silber arrived in roxbury on wednesday black 
leaders held a press conference nearby at a neighborhood park 
no wicked racist individual who deserves no name a wicked 
individual should slander our community by calling us drug 
addicts or mad dog killers to perpetuate the kind of racist 
attitudes and the kind of racist atmosphere that was created around 
the charles stuart murder case said rep gloria fox dboston 
racial tensions were heightened last october after carol stuart 
was shot and killed in the mission hill section of boston her 
husband charles blamed a black attacker and police scoured black 
neighborhoods a black man was arrested on unrelated charges and 
identified as a suspect in the murder 
later charles stuart apparently killed himself after learning 
his brother had implicated him in the killing 
vernice gabriel 76 who has lived in the neighborhood for 
almost 40 years said silber made a mistake but acknowledged the 
area had problems 
its true we cant come out in the street gabriel said i 
know im a prisoner in my house i cant even sit on my steps

frustrated by the slow response of allies to 
the campaign against iraq the house adopted legislation wednesday 
to force americas friends to pay a greater portion of the overall 
defense burden 
by a vote of 37053 the house approved an amendment to the 283 
billion defense bill to require japan to pay all the costs of 
stationing us forces in the asian nation or begin losing the 
troops 
collective security means collective responsibility rep 
david bonior dmich a member of the democratic leadership said 
before the vote that lawmakers believed would send a clear message 
to japan 
legislators spent the first full day of debate on the defense 
budget for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 lashing out at japan 
and other allies that have limited their contributions to the us 
effort to stop iraqi aggression 
although the chairman of the house armed services committee 
rep les aspin dwis didnt vote for the measure he 
acknowledged the motivations of his colleagues 
it is not the right thing to do substantively but its 
irresistible politically aspin said 
the house also agreed to require the defense department to come 
up with a plan by 1994 to dual base all military units 
permanently stationing all american troops in the united states and 
ordering shortterm rotation overseas 
it agreed to prohibit using any defense department money for 
building a new air base at crotone italy for the 401st tactical 
air wing of f16 jet fighters 
an amendment by rep david martin rny to eliminate the 
dual base provision as well as the language on the facility at 
crotone failed by a vote of 249174 
the measures are not included in the version of the defense bill 
approved by the senate and will have to be worked out in conference 
between the two chambers 
under the amendment on japan the asian nation would be required 
to pay all the costs associated with the 50000 us troops 
deployed to the asian nation for each year japan does not cover 
the costs 5000 troops would be taken out of the country 
the united states spends 45 billion annually for us forces 
in japan japan contributes 29 billion 
this is a wakeup call this is a real wakeup call for the 
new world order said bonior sponsor of the legislation 
rep bill alexander dark said the allies will allow us to 
pay the expense of their defense as long as uncle sugar will do 
it 
the house however rejected an amendment that would impose a 
permanent ceiling of 30000 on the number of us troops in south 
korea with that goal to be achieved by 1993 the vote was 265157 
against 
defense secretary dick cheney has called for reducing the 
current number of 43000 troops by 7000 over the next three fiscal 
years 
in other action the house approved 287134 a measure calling 
for establishment of a new base closure process similar to the 
independent commission that selected 86 installations for closing 
or new missions two years ago 
the amendment prohibits cheney from closing any domestic base 
until congress has approved a new system or until jan 1 1992 
whichever comes first 
this past january the secretary recommended closing or changing 
more than 50 bases worldwide a move than led to charges of 
partisanship from democrats on capitol hill who contended the list 
targeted bases in their districts 
legislators also clashed over amendments to increase or decrease 
the 1991 budget for the strategic defense initiative popularly 
known as star wars a vote on the sdi amendments was delayed until 
thursday as the house sought to wrap up wednesdays action on the 
bill by early evening 
president bush proposed spending 47 billion on the 
antimissile shield in his january budget request the senate cut 
about 1 billion from the proposal and the house armed services 
committee slashed nearly 2 billion 
the ranking republican on the house armed services panel rep 
bill dickinson of alabama said he received a letter from bush 
stressing that star wars has made tremendous progress to 
strengthen deterrence 
if we continue to decimate the program dickinson told his 
colleagues the final product will look something like a lace 
doily and it will not be signed by the president 
rep barbara boxer dcalif sponsor of an amendment to end 
star wars said it was time to stop paying billions of dollars on 
a fairy tale

eight environmental pioneers were named 
wednesday to spend two years with just each other and 3800 
varieties of plants and animals inside a glassandsteel dome 
trying to duplicate earths ecosystem 
among the crew are a 66yearold gerontologist an electrical 
engineer a marine biologist and a botanist they are two britons 
a belgian a german and four americans 
all the biospherians have worked together for at least three 
years on the biosphere ii project an attempt to copy the planets 
natural environment inside a 2acre closed selfsustaining 
system the planets natural environment is designated biosphere i 
im working five years toward this aim of a twoyear closure 
and the closer the day comes the more excited i get said crew 
leader bernd zabel a 41yearold german 
as a laboratory for showing ways to solve environmental problems 
such as pollution the privately funded biosphere could become a 
moneymaking venture scientists have said it also is a prototype 
for sustaining life in space 
inside the sealed geodesic frame all air water food and 
wastes will be regenerated and recycled 
only electricity will link its ecological system with the 
outside computers and telephones will provide communications with 
mission control and the rest of the world 
crew members will be able to leave via airlocks in event of 
emergency 
plans call for the venture to begin dec 5 
the other crew members all single are abigail k alling 31 a 
marine biologist and cocaptain dr roy walford a nationally 
noted gerontologist and nutritionist and professor of pathology at 
the ucla school of medicine who will be medical officer linda 
leigh 38 scientific director sally silverstone 35 taber k 
maccallum 26 jane elizabeth poynter 28 and mark van thillo 29 
the 30 million worldwithintheworld will be like a space 
colony tethered to earth it consists of distinct ecological areas 
or biomes desert ocean savannah fresh and saltwater marshes 
agriculture and human habitat 
im sure therell be many emergencies that arise during that 
twoyear period but i think also that it ought to be an extremely 
stimulating and mindexpanding experience said margret 
augustine chief executive officer of space biospheres ventures 
she said all the crew members are highly qualified talented 
dedicated enthusiastic and extremely special people by facing 
difficult and dangerous situations in other ventures she said 
they have shown themselves capable of coming up with the needed 
decisions and actions at the appropriate time 
augustine said six other people who were candidates for the crew 
also hold key management positions with the project and will be 
involved in the experiment 
asked about possible relationships developing among the people 
sealed inside the biosphere leigh said that would be a personal 
matter as long as it doesnt interfere with their work 
i anticipate there will be relationships developing as there 
are in biosphere i i dont really see that will change she said 
the wildlife areas interconnect with only the agriculture and 
human habitat areas partitioned the latter includes apartments 
offices labs and recreational space 
plants will dispose of the humans and animals carbon dioxide 
breaking it down into oxygen and carbon and will provide food 
microbes will break down wastes filters will purify air and water 
moisture in the fairly humid confines will condense on 
refrigerated coils over the tropical rain forest 
the biospherians will monitor and take advantage of the 
ecological mix which will range from rice to papayas sorghum to 
sweet potatoes plus wild plants rotating from among 150 crops

trek that has gained widespread attention here bolivian president 
jaime paz zamora flew wednesday with members of his cabinet to meet 
with them along a dirt highway 
the march is not against anybody but a call for bolivians to 
pay attention to their plight paz zamora said in a radio 
interview after the meeting near yolosa 90 miles east of la paz 
fernando cajias governor of the la paz province said initial 
agreements regarding the need to prevent the exploitation of 
forests from affecting the survival of indian groups have been 
reached 
the marchers pressing for the return of 750000 acres of land 
deeded to lumber companies left their jungle villages and began 
the march last month from trinidad

its climb into the andes the marchers are expected in la paz 
which is 13000 feet above sea level this weekend 
the march which involves various small indian tribes has 
captivated the attention of bolivians by exposing the misery of the 
oftneglected tribes from the isolated lowlands of interior bolivia 
residents along the way have provided marchers with food and 
lodging support groups from la paz assisted with emergency medical 
care doctors said at least 100 of the indians were suffering from 
highaltitude sickness 
indian leaders say the march is for the dignity and defense of 
native territories the indian groups are asking the government 
to overturn contracts that granted the huge tracts of tropical 
rainforest in the amazon and la plata river basins to four lumber 
companies 
the contracts were signed under the administration of victor paz 
estenssoro who turned over the presidency to paz zamora his 
nephew after elections in may 1989 
a coalition of indian groups say the logging companies are not 
replanting the mahoganies and other fine woods they cut and are 
destroying the delicate ecological balance of the area

fighters loyal to rebel leader charles 
taylor advanced to within firing distance of the presidential 
mansion wednesday filling a vacuum left by a rival groups 
execution of president samuel doe 
the british broadcasting corp quoting exiled liberians in the 
united states said taylor had executed some opponents among them 
prominent politician jackson doe 
doe no relation to the late president was the 1985 
presidential candidate of the liberian action party many observers 
said he was robbed of victory by election officials appointed by 
samuel doe who took power in a 1980 coup 
taylors force mainly untrained youths had been bogged down by 
samuel does men for nearly three months on monrovias eastern 
outskirts 
but doe died monday after being captured by rebels under prince 
yealu johnson and his loyalists fled in disarray offering an 
opening for taylor columns of smoke rose as taylors rebels 
advanced through eastern suburbs behind a barrage of shell rocket 
and gunfire they moved past the spriggs payne airfield and john f 
kennedy hospital to city hall a few hundred yards from the 
executive mansion 
about 230 relatives and remnants of samuel does army were 
trapped inside the hilltop sevenstory mansion 
prince johnson who earlier in the week had been hunting down 
doe loyalists around the city agreed wednesday to allow the late 
presidents followers to leave monrovia if they surrender their 
arms

nasa restored highspeed communications 
with magellan for the first time in four weeks wednesday then 
released more of the spacecrafts pictures of jagged lava flows and 
giant craters on venus 
the irregularly shaped craters one measuring 5 miles wide 
are called calderas each one probably formed when lava flowed out 
from underneath the planets volcanoes causing the entire top of a 
volcano to collapse said steve saunders magellan project 
scientist 
a lava flow shown in another picture is much like flows on 
earth that are called by geologists aa ahah a hawaiian word 
that probably mimics the sound the ancients uttered while running 
barefoot over the rough jagged surface saunders said in a news 
release 
the images were made during an aug 16 test of magellans 
picturemaking radar just before the spaceship temporarily lost 
contact with earth for the first time engineers at the national 
aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
spent wednesday preparing magellan so that it can attempt to make 
more pictures during a crucial test on saturday 
they turned the spacecraft so its main antenna pointed toward 
earth experiment representative steve wall said that allowed 
magellan to send back information at up to 268800 bits per 
second 6720 times faster than was possible through its secondary 
antenna which has been used since the communications problems 
developed 
the secondary antenna has a broader radio beam allowing it to 
maintain contact with earth more easily than the main antenna 
restoring the highspeed link was necessary so engineers could 
play back the contents of an onboard tape recorder the recorder 
contains more of the radar picture data collected aug 16 and 
engineering information that may provide clues about magellans 
troubles 
the engineers still havent identified the problem that made 
magellan lose radio contact with earth for 14 hours starting aug 
16 and for 17 hours beginning aug 21 wall said 
magellans computers rejected a command wednesday to turn off a 
faulty gyroscope that developed problems when the spacecraft 
started orbiting venus aug 10 the device is no longer needed to 
help point magellan and engineers said it wont harm the mission 
plans call for magellan to formally start its 744 million 
mission to use radar to makes maps and pictures of venus 
cloudcovered surface late this month wall said 
but unless the tape playback reveals an unforeseen problem 
magellans radar will be turned on friday and tested saturday if 
all goes well and magellan produces more highly detailed pictures 
officials might simply declare afterward that the formal mapping 
mission started saturday 
one of the pictures released wednesday shows a basalt lava flow 
11 miles wide and at least 15 miles long it has lobed edges is 
extremely rough and probably flowed in a thick pasty manner 
before it solidified saunders said 
another picture shows at least two volcanic calderas similar to 
those in the summit area of broad shield volcanoes such as mauna 
loa and kilauea on hawaii the largest measures 5 miles long by 22 
miles wide 
calderas on earth usually are much larger than typical volcanic 
craters hawaiian icelandic and apparently the venusian calderas 
were created when lava flowed from vents on the flanks of 
volcanoes causing their summits to collapse 
earths biggest calderas were formed by extraordinarily 
explosive eruptions examples include calderas at yellowstone 
national park in wyoming and at californias long valleymammoth 
lakes resort area 
a third new venus picture shows a valley about sixtenths of a 
mile wide that formed when a block of land dropped down between 
two faults as the area was being stretched apart saunders said 
the valley cuts through a series of older ridges and valleys but 
was partially flooded by later lava flows 
similar faultbounded valleys are found in california east 
africa and germany 
magellan went into orbit around venus after traveling a looping 
948millionmile path since its from the shuttle atlantis on may 4 
1989

palestinian leader yasser arafat held talks 
with king hussein on the gulf crisis wednesday and the plos 
executive committee issued a statement condemning the us military 
buildup in the region 
arafat the palestine liberation organization chairman held two 
rounds of talks with the jordanian monarch before leaving amman 
said the plos representative in jordan altayeb abdulrahim 
he would not disclose arafats next destination citing security 
considerations 
arafat and hussein have supported iraqi president saddam hussein 
during the crisis while seeking to play a mediating role 
abdulrahim said the two discussed the recent developments in 
the gulf and the dangers threatening arab national security in view 
of the foreign military buildup in the gulf arab region 
he said they also assessed the outcome of sundays superpower 
summit between president bush and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev in helsinki finland 
arafat and hussein supported all efforts for a peaceful 
settlement of the gulf conflict and those aimed at preventing a 
military explosion in the region abdulrahim said 
hussein has been holding numerous meetings at home and abroad in 
recent weeks after pledging to seek a diplomatic solution to the 
crisis triggered by the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
a statement released by the plos executive committee at the 
groups headquarters in tunis tunisia deplored the usled 
military buildup in the gulf region 
it also criticized the united states for separating the gulf 
crisis from the palestinian question 
the united states continues to beat the war drums to 
concentrate more and more american and foreign forces to prepare an 
aggression against brother iraq said the statement 
the executive committee called for an arab political 
solution to the crisis 
the plo has supported saddam against potential threat from 
foreign forces but has also condemned the invasion of kuwait 
the plo has circulated a peace plan calling for the withdrawal 
of iraqi troops from kuwait and us forces from saudi arabia and 
the dispatch of an arab and un peacekeeping force to kuwait until 
elections could be held in the oilrich emirate 
echoing saddam the plo also has accused the united states of 
hypocrisy in demanding enforcement of un resolutions calling for 
an iraqi pullout from kuwait while tolerating israels refusal to 
comply with resolutions calling for an end to the israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip

an administrative law judge has denied neil 
bushs request to dismiss the governments case against him for 
alleged conflict of interest in his role as a former director of a 
collapsed colorado thrift the government disclosed wednesday 
judge daniel j davidson turned down bushs petition in an order 
issued tuesday the office of thrift supervision which is seeking 
to bar the presidents son from working for any bank or savings and 
loan made davidsons decision public late wednesday 
bush 35 was an outside director of silverado banking savings 
and loan association a denver thrift that failed in late 1988 at a 
cost to taxpayers estimated at 1 billion 
in written arguments submitted to davidson late last month bush 
said there was no possibility that he could continue the alleged 
abuses since silverado already has been taken over by the 
government bush continued to deny any wrongdoing 
the judge rejected bushs argument in his onepage order saying 
it is not supported by existing regulations and case law 
bushs attorney james nesland did not immediately return a 
telephone call seeking comment bush and nesland have maintained 
that the regulators actions are politically motivated 
davidsons decision clears the way for a public hearing that has 
been scheduled before him starting on sept 25 in denver following 
the hearing the judge is expected to make a recommendation to the 
director of the office of thrift supervision timothy ryan 
in its response to bushs request the office had told davidson 
in a brief filed monday that bush could become a director at 
another financial institution and repeat the conduct that harmed 
silverado 
indeed throughout these proceedings bush has evinced no 
willingness to consider that he has done anything wrong nor even 
any understanding that he ever had potential conflicts of 
interest the thrift agencys brief said 
the office said it wa clear that bushs conduct was contrary 
to generally accepted standards of prudent operation and could 
cause harm to any financial institution if continued 
the regulators have accused bush of conflict of interest for not 
disclosing his business ties to two big silverado borrowers 
developers kenneth m good and bill l walters 
bush also could be a target of a negligence lawsuit that the 
federal deposit insurance corp is considering filing against him 
and other former directors of silverado

prime minister brian mulroney on wednesday 
appointed two new members to the senate and opponents accused him 
of attempting to pack the legislative chamber in order to win 
approval of an unpopular tax measure 
mulroney appointed john buchanan to the senate moments after he 
quit as nova scotia premier amid allegations of a patronage scandal 
also named to the upper chamber was noel a kinsella of 
fredericton new brunswick the former president of the canadian 
human rights commission 
the latest appointments raise the number of mulroneys recent 
senate nominations to 10 
buchanans appointment drew particular scorn from opposition 
leaders 
its cynicism to the utmost said liberal house leader 
jeanpierre gauthier 
mulroneys government has been frustrated by the upper chambers 
refusal to pass his proposed 7 percent goods and services tax he 
has been appointing new senate members in an effort to whittle away 
the liberal majority 
there are 52 liberals in the 104seat senate along with 41 of 
mulroneys progressive conservatives and six independents or 
members of smaller parties 
the latest appointments leave five vacancies the prime minister 
can also use an obscure constitutional provision to add as many as 
eight new senate seats 
liberal senator sid buckwold chairman of the committee studying 
the tax measure warned mulroney against packing the senate with 
extra members to speed passage of the unpopular tax 
that would be one of the greatest political blunders of all 
time buckwold said 
its expected that his committee will recommend changes to 
mulroneys proposed consumption tax 
buchanans appointment came as a surprise 
buchanans provincial government has come under fire in recent 
months after a former deputy minister michael zareski raised 
allegations of corruption 
the royal canadian mounted police has been investigating 
zareskis claims that buchanan was at the center of a wide net of 
patronage and payoffs 
buchanan a 59yearold progressive conservative was elected 
premier of nova scotia in october 1978 
kinsella 50 was most recently a deputy minister in the new 
federal multiculturalism department and has been a member of 
canadian delegations to several un bodies

president bush on wednesday threatened to veto 
a major anticrime bill nearing action in the house unless lawmakers 
strengthen its death penalty features and other major provisions 
designed to aid police 
the bottom line is really this i will not sign a crime bill 
that handcuffs the police bush told prosecutors gathered in the 
rose garden as the house positioned its bill for floor action 
bush renewed his criticism of congress for refusing to act on 
major portions of his anticrime program saying they were needed to 
fight back against the epidemic of violent crime still raging in 
america 
a leading sponsor rep william hughes dnj said on capitol 
hill later the bill had a few defects that he would attempt to iron 
out on the floor but he argued the bill was strong overall and 
added its just unfortunate that once again we have seen a crime 
bill disintegrate into partisan posturing 
the house bill calls for capital punishment for 10 offenses 
ranging from presidential assassination to treason and sets a 
timelimit on filing some kinds of appeals 
it also calls for tougher penalties for drug offenses along with 
a mixed bag of law enforcement measures ranging from scholarships 
for police to a ban on state lotteries based on sporting events 
the bush administration has been critical saying provisions 
designed to end long delays in carrying out executions would 
actually do the opposite it said a provision allowing 
deathpenalty appeals based on racial statistics would effectively 
wipe out capital punishment in america 
bush and attorney general dick thornburgh suggested that 
formulas drawn up on capitol hill could be more helpful to 
criminals than to law enforcement 
thornburgh was asked why lawmakers would draft a bill helpful to 
criminals they may have been mistaken they may have been overly 
idealistic they may have been naive he said 
bush told prosecutors visiting in washington to lobby against 
the house bill that for the past two weeks america has been 
gripped by chilling headlines that tell of kids going back to 
school in bulletproof coats 
he recalled how a visiting utah man a kid really sports 
lover was killed while defending his mother from a new york 
subway gang said to be after pocket money so they could go 
dancing 
the american people really are fed up bush said and 
i urge the congress to heed the voices of our people our police 
and our prosecutors and send me a crime bill that will help take 
back the streets 
unlike the presidents package and legislation passed by the 
senate the house bill does not contain major provisions designed 
to curb firearms but sponsors of such measures were hoping to add 
them on the floor 
if they fail to do that the house plans to take up a separate 
bill that would ban domestically made semiautomatic assault rifles 
not designed for sporting purposes the senate bill would ban nine 
specified assault weapons 
the presidents plan would ban ammunition clips containing more 
than 15 rounds

the police chief was fired wednesday after he was 
indicted for allegedly lying to a panel investigating his dismissal 
of an officer 
mack vines was charged with one misdemeanor perjury count by a 
dallas county grand jury and fired by city manager jan hart vines 
52 chief for two years had been suspended with pay last month 
the grand jury rejected the district attorneys recommendation 
that vines be indicted on seven felony perjury counts 
i am surprised and saddened by the precipitous action that has 
been taken by the dallas city manager i plan to fight the 
minor legal charge returned by the grand jury vines said in a 
statement 
at a news conference ms hart said the dismissal was in the 
best interests of the city the issue is really one of public 
confidence and trust she said 
prosecutors had urged felony charges against vines for 
statements he made in august to a panel investigating the firing of 
dallas police officer patrick lemaire details of his testimony 
were not released 
lemaire was fired in june 1989 about two weeks after he killed 
a mexican man he was reinstated last july by a civil service panel 
that said vines did not justify the dismissal he did not rejoin 
the dallas force 
assistant district attorney ted steinke said wednesday that he 
thought the evidence was sufficient to convict vines on the felony 
charges but he would not contest the grand jurys decision 
the grand jury has spoken they have acted as the conscience 
of the community steinke said we respect that decision 
vines faces a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a 2000 
fine if convicted

for police chief edward gallant it was a 
pretty simple equation more crime and less money to pay overtime 
so he made a list of crimes in order of severity and ordered his 
force to work from the top down 
thats when he ran up against another simple fact some 
residents of this city of 40000 about 40 miles northwest of boston 
were not prepared to hear that their police department was no 
longer a phone call away 
the policy requires residents to go to the police station report 
cases of minor assault or petty larceny rather than calling an 
officer to their homes 
gallant whose department of about 70 received 26000 calls last 
year said prioritizing has been a fact of life for more than two 
years in fitchburg 
but the formal list released last month prompted some 
complaints 
ive definitely found that the response has been that they 
would have rathered that i didnt say anything gallant said last 
week people have to face reality and this is certainly reality 
and i had to provide reasonable guidelines to my people 
councilman bernard foley said the policy should have been 
debated by council before being implemented and perhaps volunteers 
could help bolster the force 
i think the kind of comments im getting from residents is 
theyre not all that happy with some of the delays that may result 
for some of the lesser priority actions foley said 
the economic crisis gripping massachusetts translated to a 12 
million cut in fitchburg which has an overall budget of 45 
million said mayor jeffrey bean who supports the crime list 
the police department has lost about 75000 in overtime and has 
been unable to hire more officers for the last three years gallant 
said 
overall crime rates have increased about 10 percent over the 
past few years he said in 1989 the city had two murders 33 
rapes 58 robberies 384 assaults 570 burglaries 1340 larcenies 
over 500 200 auto thefts and 14 cases of arson 
the departments list divides crime into seven ranked 
priority crimes and four nonpriority offenses the list 
was written down to guide officers if they are swamped with calls 
the seven priority crimes begin with felonies in progress 
involving violence or potential violence and end with a misdemeanor 
not in progress currently being reported with an identified 
witness or complainant 
police also instituted a selfreporting system for the 
nonpriority offenses of vandalism and larceny below 250 and minor 
assault excluding domestic violence 
also on that list are shoplifting below 250 and a nonviolent 
misdemeanor where the complainant declines to identify himself for 
example anonymous calls reporting loud parties 
gallant said officers wasted the most time on noise complaints 
because so many callers were unwilling to let their neighbors know 
they made the calls

bush administration and congressional 
bargainers considered a boost in the federal tax on cigarettes 
wednesday as they pushed with new optimism toward the end of 
marathon talks to reduce the federal deficit officials said 
after months of deadlock budget bargainers positions have 
moved toward each other and participants have begun to predict they 
will soon produce a package cutting the deficit 50 billion next 
year and 500 billion through 1995 negotiators planned to work 
nonstop until they either succeed or deadlock 
i tend to be optimistic well reach a conclusion this week 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash told reporters during the 
sixth day of talks at andrews air force base in maryland near 
washington 
the two sides spent much of their time wednesday discussing the 
makeup of a package of tax increases to raise revenue toward 
deficit reduction they have already agreed to boost taxes by 25 
billion next year and 130 billion over the next five years but 
sharp disputes over the specifics remain 
white house budget director richard darman proposed several new 
taxes officials said 
one was a 1 percent tax on almost all petroleum products 
including gasoline heating oil chemical raw materials and the 
hundreds of items that leave refinery gates the tax would raise 
800 million next year and 7 billion over five years 
other taxes he suggested included a levy on luxury items 
including expensive automobiles jewelry furs private planes 
boats and electronic equipment democrats have proposed taxing 
similar items but at a higher rate than darman proposed the 
figures were not immediately available 
participants confirmed that they were discussing increasing 
tobacco taxes one official asking to not be identified said 
bargainers were considering doubling the 16centperpack federal 
tax on cigarettes such an increase would add an estimated 28 
billion to government coffers next year 
he indicated both parties have agreed to take responsibility 
jointly for the proposal which would be unpopular in tobacco 
states as well as among smokers 
another official said the proposal was made by rep bill archer 
rtexas although archer later said the idea had come from a 
democrat but this official expressed uncertainty over the amount 
of the proposed increase 
the same official said the two sides which have previously both 
proposed increasing alcohol taxes were trying to agree to the 
amount of the boost 
the bush administration was also beginning to indicate it was 
willing to accept some type of tax on energy this official said 
democrats have proposed putting a 4 percent sales tax on various 
fuels and on increasing the 9centpergallon federal levy on 
gasoline by 11 cents 
another major battle was waged over president bushs proposal to 
cut the tax rate on capital gains bush says lowering that levy 
which is imposed on the sales of property will boost government 
revenues by encouraging people to sell 
but democrats continued to insist that such a reduction would do 
nothing but reduce federal tax collections and hand the proceeds to 
wealthy property owners 
there is a dispute about capital gains that continues that 
comes in our view under the heading of fairness foley said 
democrats said they would not accept a capital gains tax 
reduction unless republicans accept higher income taxes on the 
rich a change the gop opposes 
among the newest democratic proposals is one that would increase 
by 20 percent double their initial proposal the income taxes of 
people earning more than 500000 annually 
the two sides are also trying to narrow differences over 
domestic spending democrats want to limit reductions to about 90 
billion over five years while republicans want cuts 40 billion 
higher 
military spending which would grow to 306 billion next year to 
account for inflation would be pared by 10 billion or 11 billion 
under an agreement the bargainers are nearing over five years the 
saving would be 170 billion to 200 billion with republicans 
championing the lower figure 
if a deficitcutting deal is not enacted by oct 1 the start 
of fiscal 1991 the grammrudman law will slash overall spending 
by 100 billion such a reduction in the 12 trillion budget would 
be staggering to many individual programs officials said 
also wednesday the bargainers were told that the massive 
deficit they were fighting appears to be even bigger 
robert reischauer director of the nonpartisan congressional 
budget office told the senate banking committee that the fiscal 
1991 deficit now looks 30 billion to 35 billion larger than it 
did in june because of the weakening economy and rising oil prices 
in june reischauer projected the shortfall would be 232 billion

a measure to require girls to obtain 
parental consent for an abortion flew through the michigan 
legislature on wednesday but abortionrights activists pledged a 
quick counterattack 
the measure requires unmarried girls 17 and younger to have 
permission from a parent or a judge to get an abortion it will 
become law 90 days after the last legislative session in december 
taking effect about april 1 
the legislature approved an identical bill earlier this year but 
gov james blanchard vetoed it right to life of michigan then 
gathered about 330000 signatures to put it back before the 
legislature which took less than five hours to approve it 
because it began with a petition drive blanchard cant veto the 
latest version 
barbara listing president of right to life of michigan said it 
would encourage sexually active teenagers to use birth control 
girls who do become pregnant will be able to get help guidance and 
support from their families in deciding what to do she added 
state rep maxine berman denounced the bill as a meanspirited 
shame a lot of teenagers are going to find themselves in horrible 
positions because of this 
katherine spillar national coordinator for the fund for a 
feminist majority said laying the groundwork for a repeal effort 
will start immediately 
we will be organizing the outrage and the anger we know its 
an uphill battle here she said when people understand what 
will happen we will turn public opinion around 
repealing the law would take a vote of the people or another 
vote by the legislature spillar said her group hadnt decided 
which route to follow 
liberal democratic activist zolton ferency already has filed a 
legal challenge to the measure no hearing date has been set for 
that lawsuit in ingham county circuit court 
carol king executive director of the michigan abortion rights 
action league said her group will start an effort to help pregnant 
girls ask probate judges for permission for an abortion 
she said she expected the measure would lead to an increase in 
teenage suicides and mothers and dangerous back alley and 
selfinduced abortions 
one of the measures strongest senate backers state sen fred 
dillingham said it would allow parents to help their daughters 
the parental rights in this doesnt prevent abortion parental 
rights simply allow parents to guide their children through a very 
traumatic time he said 
blanchar a democrat seeking his third fouryear term has vowed 
to veto any bill that restricts abortion rights 
his republican opponent senate majority leader john engler 
opposes abortion except in cases of rape incest or to save the 
life of the mother he voted for the parental consent bill 
the measures speedy journey through the legislature began with 
a senate committee meeting at which two indiana parents bill and 
karen bell told how their 17yearold daughter died after a 
botched back alley abortion 
bill and i were just any mom and dad mrs bell said 
were saying if it can happen to us it can happen to any family 
states that currently enforce parental consent or notification 
laws are alabama arkansas indiana louisiana massachusetts 
minnesota missouri north dakota ohio rhode island south 
carolina utah west virginia and wyoming 
parental consent bills are pending in several other states

the house intelligence committee approved 
legislation wednesday that largely preserves intact americas 
controversial covert aid programs to rebels in angola afghanistan 
and cambodia sources said 
the move if upheld when the 1991 intelligence authorization 
bill is considered by the full house would put the committee at 
odds with its senate counterpart whose members voted sharp cuts in 
the afghan and cambodian programs according to sources who 
discussed the divergence on condition that they not be identified 
a potential battle still looms in the house over aid to the 
unita rebels led by jonas savimbi who are fighting the 
sovietbacked government of angola 
one source said he expected members of the congressional black 
caucus who oppose aid to the unita rebels to demand an open 
debate on the secret military assistance 
another source said the vote was really close he said the 
panel approved the administrations request of about 60 million 
for unita 
in its version of the intelligence bill the senate left the 
unita question open deferring it until the housesenate conference 
on the bill 
while most of the bill is secret it is belived to authorize 
roughly 30 billion for programs ranging from support for the three 
rebellions to spy satellites 
the program of aid to the noncommunist resistance in cambodia 
two rebel groups fighting the vietnameseinstalled government of 
hun sen is believed to total about 13 million a year the senate 
panel eliminated the program in its version of the bill 
for afghanistan the senate committee voted a cut of about 100 
million in the nearly 300 million annual support for the 
mujaheddin rebels 
both moves reflect a growing distaste on capitol hill for covert 
proxy wars and an erosion of the old cold war rationale for many 
of the regional conflicts 
one member of the panel declining to discuss the committees 
action said nevertheless that he was annoyed by the heavy lobbying 
he had been subjected to on the angola issue it was clear from the 
number of lobbyists involved that the matter is far too open to be 
a covert program he said 
savimbi since 1986 has used a wellfinanced lobbying operation 
to build support for his forces in congress current aid is 
estimated at 60 million or more 
an angolan official lobbying to defeat the aid had been telling 
members of congress and the administration this week that 
rightwing south africans with the tacit approval of their white 
minority government are providing the usarmed rebels with 
weapons 
maj gen roberto leal monteiro chief military adviser to 
angolas president jose eduardo dos santos also argued that 
further us aid to the rebels prolongs the 15year civil war in 
his country 
he said two ships from south africa recently docked at the port 
of matadi in zaire and unloaded two puma helicopters and a group of 
uniformclad black angolan mercenaries or rebels 
south africa was savimbis biggest arms supplier until last 
year when it agreed to stop as part of a regional peace plan 
but monteiro said the government has turned a blind eye to 
some activities of radicals in the region including their regular 
flights ferrying weapons to the angolan rebels via an air strip in 
lubumbashi zaire 
monteiro is arguing that his government has done all the united 
states has asked agreeing to hold multiparty elections and 
changing to a marketoriented economy and yet the administration 
keeps aiding savimbi

gross negligence by a ferry company and seven 
former employees caused a 1987 ferry disaster in which 193 people 
were killed the prosecutor said wednesday in opening arguments in 
the manslaughter trial 
p and o european ferries three former directors and four former 
crew member have pleaded innocent 
the car and passenger ferry overturned on march 6 1987 in the 
belgian port of zeebrugge with 454 passengers and 80 crew on board 
the ship had set sail minutes earlier for dover south england 
with its main car deck doors open 
charges in the 12page indictment center on the obvious and 
serious risk posed by sailing with the bow doors open and the 
alleged reasons why they were not closed 
the trial is considered a test case relatives of the victims 
fought for more than three years to bring what is believed to be 
only the second charge of corporate manslaughter against a british 
company in the first case a construction company was acquitted in 
a 1965 hearing 
to keep the case simple the accused are charged with the 
unlawful killing of one victim 27yearold alison gaillard 
the trial began monday and prosecutor david jeffreys outlined 
his case wednesday 
he said 154 passengers and 38 crew died when the ferry sank the 
death of a person who died later is the subject of a separate civil 
action 
jeffreys said the defendants either gave no thought to the 
possibility of there being any risk or having recognized there was 
some risk went on to take it and behaved with gross negligence 
you dont have to be a maritime expert to see what it meant to 
sail with those bow doors open he told the jury the case 
is that the capsize was avoidable

the fbi on tuesday arrested a mohawk 
wanted for allegedly blocking off a new york reservation to keep 
federal authorities out after a helicopter passing overhead was 
targeted by gunfire 
michael r thomas 32 of altona ny was surrounded by fbi 
agents and a contingent of local police outside a cafe and 
surrendered without resisting 
three other mohawks who said they were from kahnawake quebec 
were taken into custody and later released thomas was scheduled to 
appear wednesday before us magistrate hugh morgan 
he was indicted in northern new york state after the march 30 
shooting of the vermont national guard helicopter over the 
ganienkeh indian territory near plattsburgh ny about 150 miles 
north of albany 
a doctor aboard the aircraft was wounded 
mohawks who contend they have jurisdiction over criminal 
investigations on reservation lands barred federal authorities for 
11 days indians armed with assault rifles manned roadblocks and 
barricades 
ultimately authorities were allowed onto ganienkeh to 
investigate the shooting for a couple of hours no arrests in the 
shooting have been made 
thomas was one of 16 people indicted for allegedly resisting and 
impeding an fbi search 
the four indians were in key west for two or three days and had 
been under surveillance since monday fbi spokesman paul miller 
said no weapons were found he added 
the indians may be members of the mohawk warrior society a 
selfproclaimed indian security force that has skirmished with 
authorities in canada and the united states he said 
mohawks from the kahnesatake reservation have been embroiled in 
a standoff with quebec police and the canadian army since july over 
the attempt by oka officials to expand a golf course onto land the 
indians considered sacred 
an early confrontation in the standoff erupted in gunfire that 
left a policeman dead 
in solidarity with mohawks in oka about 18 miles northwest of 
montreal mohawks from the kahnawake reserve south of montreal set 
up a barricade on the mercier bridge in montreal the mercier is a 
key commuting bridge in the city that barricade finally came down 
two weeks ago and the bridge reopened last week 
the quebec government on tuesday rejected an offer from mohawks 
holed up oka to end a twomonth impasse by surrendering in a brief 
statement by premier robert bourassa the government called the 
proposal unacceptable because it contradicts fundamental 
principles of democracy and our justice system 
the mohawk offer hinged on creation of a special commission that 
would exercise ultimate authority for determining any criminal 
charges the panel would produce a final report within 60 days 
weve gotten information recently through our legal attaches 
in ottawa and contact with the quebec provincial police that 
thomas and other individuals may be involved in the incident at oka 
or the bridge miller said 
key west police had closed off local streets before the fbi and 
special weapons officers moved in to make the arrests miller said 
florida marine patrol and florida department of law enforcement 
teams helped with the surveillance

the highestranking officer 
accused in the murder of six jesuit priests was relieved from his 
command more than a month before authorities acknowledged his 
implication the judiciary said wednesday 
the judiciary issued a statement giving details on closeddoor 
hearings held on the murder case 
the statement raised questions as to when members of the high 
command learned of col guillermo benavides alleged involvement in 
the massacre 
president alfredo cristiani announced on jan 13 the names of 
the nine men col benavides three lieutenants and five soldiers 
charged with the killings the priests their housekeeper and her 
daughter were slain before dawn on nov 16 
the president and top military authorities have said the 
suspects were identified through the work of an armed forces 
honor commission formed jan 5 
the judiciary statement said lt col juan velasco testified 
monday before an investigating judge that he replaced benavides as 
commander of security for the sector encompassing the defense 
ministry and the military college at the beginning of december 
benavides was director of the military college 
the sector also included the central american university where 
the slain priests taught and lived 
judge ricardo zamora asked velasco if at the time he took over 
benavides command he knew of benavides implication in the 
massacre 
i do not remember the communique quoted velasco as saying 
velasco is currently commander of the bracamonte elite infantry 
battalion 
the office of defense minister col rene emilio ponce said he 
was unavailable for comment on why benavides was removed from the 
command only three weeks after assuming it 
ponce was chief of the joint chiefs of staff last november 
velasco said his order to replace benavides came from the joint 
chiefs 
us rep joe moakley dmass heads a bipartisan commission 
overseeing the investigation into the jesuits murders 
he issued a statment last month saying salvadoran military 
officers have withheld evidence destroyed evidence falsified 
evidence and repeatedly perjured themselves in testimony before the 
judge 
us legislators have said the amount of future economic and 
military aid to el salvador depends in part on a successful 
investigation into the massacre and punishment of those responsible

iraqi officials censored a cnn report wednesday 
in which a woman who had been trapped in kuwait said iraqis killed 
people simply because they had pictures of the countrys deposed 
emir 
as in previous cases the report was censored by fastforwarding 
past the womans comments during the reports satellite 
transmission from baghdad making her words unintelligible a cable 
news network spokesman said 
however correspondent tom mintier who filed cnns report from 
baghdad called a colleague in jordan with his recollection of the 
womans comments which was relayed to cnn in atlanta for a later 
broadcast cnn said 
the woman whose name was not released was on a londonbound 
charter flight filled with foreigners who had been trapped in 
kuwait since iraqs aug 2 invasion of that country said cnn 
spokesman steve haworth 
she was interviewed during the flights stopover in baghdad he 
said 
the woman was quoted as saying that they iraqis are killing 
them for having pictures of the emir and paper flags the kids have 
for school they are killing them for this its getting really 
bad

the flag of kuwait he said 
iraqi censorship of us network reports occuring even as iraqi 
president saddam hussein continues to try to portray himself 
positively on television is neither unusual nor yet excessive 
network officials say 
its a common experience among all the networks said ed 
turner cnns executive vice president for newsgathering 
turner said another networks shot of baking pita bread was 
censored and yet another had a sound bite from saddam himself 
and that was fastforwarded 
cnn has been censored about six times which is not so many as 
to be onerous but it is annoying turner said 
each time including wednesday cnn showed the full report as it 
was received from baghdad but noted which parts were censored 
iraqi officials seem more concerned with pictures than words 
although wednesdays incident involved both 
nbc news foreign editor david miller said since last week three 
taped nbc reports all about hostages were censored during 
satellite transmission 
the correspondents words were not altered but the picture was 
blurred he said 
each time the nbc nightly news aired the full report 
iraqi censors seem most sensitive to reports on hostages said 
cbs foreign editor al ortiz but the censorship has not been so 
severe that we havent been able tostill manage to get the 
story reported he said 
miller said there are no advance warnings from iraqi officials 
and they seem to have no rules 
i dont think they have guidelinestheres no set of rules 
the way the us military in saudi arabia does it

the united auto workers union has an array of 
options open to it as national contract talks with general motors 
corp enter their final hours some of the strategies if carried 
out carry potentially devastating effects for the us economy 
in a nutshell the union has three choices reach agreement 
before the current contract expires at midnight friday extend the 
current agreement beyond then or stage some kind of strike 
it difficult wednesday to accurately assess the chances of an 
agreement before the deadline however union leaders in california 
and indiana said the uaw had scheduled a meeting monday in dearborn 
of the gm bargaining council 
that group typically would be briefed on a tentative agreement 
before a ratification vote is taken it was possible that the 
council could be briefed on strike activities but a uaw official 
speaking on condition of anonymity said it was more likely that 
the leaders would discuss a settlement 
the tone of negotiations since they began in midjuly has been 
mostly cordial and calm but some auto analysts have said for 
months that a strike by the union against gm is likely 
the uaw also is bargaining with ford motor co and chrysler 
corp but the union has put talks with those two companies on hold 
pending the gm negotiations in all more than 450000 active auto 
workers are covered by uaw contracts with the big three each of 
which expires at the same time 
with a strike fund of about 770 million the union has the 
fiscal flexibility to take a large number of the 300000 gm workers 
out of the companys plants for a long time 
but the union may feel that such a labor bomb is unnecessary to 
demonstrate its dissatisfaction with gm 
the company like other automakers brings parts to its assembly 
plants within hours of them being installed in vehicles that means 
even a small strike can take on huge proportions as it dries up the 
parts pipeline 
the uaw demonstrated that last month when it staged a walkout 
involving about 2800 workers at gms ac rochester west plant in 
flint where fuel tanks and other parts of gm cars and trucks are 
made 
when the supply of fuel tanks stopped so did assembly plants 
the strike was seen as a signal of what the union could do to 
the automaker if national talks broke down 
by the time the sixday strike was over seven assembly plants 
and portions of more than a dozen component factories had been shut 
down temporarily idling more than 20000 workers 
whenever an assembly plant shuts down layoffs ripple out 
depending on how long production at an assembly plant is 
interrupted effects can be felt throughout the auto supplier 
industry including plastic glass rubber and steel makers 
negotiations in the auto industry come as the economy is slowing 
down and predictions of a recession are growing 
the government recently reported that unemployment in august 
reached 56 percent the highest in two years annual growth of the 
gross national product has dropped to 12 percent and many analysts 
project it to fall further and orders for durable goods including 
cars have been flat 
in 1970 an alreadyweak economy slipped into recession when the 
uaw struck gm for 69 days said donald ratajczak of the economic 
forecasting center at georgia state university in atlanta at that 
time he said gm played a much larger part in the economy than it 
does now 
therefore it gm by itself isnt going to take down the 
economy ratajczak said wednesday of this years negotiations 
although its a negative were being hit by negatives all over 
the place 
he said the negotiations come at a bad time when consumer 
psychology is hurting anyway you start to run up the unemployment 
rate from a strike and youll kill christmas 
a strike that slows production conceivably could help clear out 
dealers lots of unsold cars but inventories are already at 
optimum levels for this time of year the dealers say 
auto dealers struggling with slumping sales for nearly a year 
have been decreasing their orders to increase their profits 
inventories of unsold new and used cars and truck stands between 55 
and 60 selling days according to tom webb senior economist with 
the national automobile dealers association in mclean va 
dealers would feel the effects of any kind of strike quickly 
webb said the uncertainty grows he added because at this time of 
year dealers are struggling to maintain a balance between supplies 
of 1990model cars and the new 1991 versions 
if its prolonged youll have a severe falloff in 
inventory webb said if that occurs at gm dealers customers may 
turn to competitors for their new vehicles 
should the choice be japanese the strike would fulfill the 
worst nightmares of labor and management the japanese share of the 
newcar market has grown from about 25 percent to close to 30 
percent since the last contract agreement in 1987

a judge wednesday issued a middleofthenight 
order temporarily barring st martins press from distributing a 
book about the mossad israels secret intelligence service 
the israeli government sought the ban of the book by way of 
deception the making and unmaking of a mossad officer the 
author victor ostrovsky claims to have been a mossad operative in 
the mid1980s 
lawyers for the israeli government argued that the book 
contained information that could in the language of the judges 
order endanger the lives of various people in the employ of the 
state of israel and would be detrimental to the government of the 
state of israel 
state supreme court justice michael j dontzin signed the order 
in his apartment at 105 am after hearing from lawyers for israel 
and st martins supreme court in new york state is a triallevel 
court not a court of appeal 
dontzin said he would hear arguments friday on whether to keep 
the ban in effect 
the judge ordered st martins to tell bookstores that none of 
the 17000 copies shipped so far are to be sold 
ostrovskys book says mossad knew in advance about the terrorist 
bombing that killed 240 us marines in beirut in 1983 but said 
nothing because it wanted relations between the united states and 
arab nations to worsen 
the book also describes mossad spying inside the united states 
roy gainsburg president of st martins denounced the order 
and denied that anyone would be endangered by the book 
wherever the disclosure of a persons name might endanger 
them that name is not mentioned gainsburg maintained we are 
confident this book doesnt endanger anybody 
itll certainly embarrass a lot of people but can you imagine 
a book being banned in the united states because its detrimental 
to some other government or to the united states government for 
that matter the first amendment says you can be as critical as you 
want about the us government or any government 
a st martins lawyer john lankenau commented there are 
17000 books out there already is any foreign intelligence agency 
so inept that it cant get a copy 
lankenau said he was filing an appeal of dontzins order 
on friday israel obtained a court order in ontario barring 
release of the book in canada where ostrovsky 40 was born and 
now lives the books primary publisher stoddart publishing co 
is canadian 
ostrovsky in an interview wednesday in canada with the 
associated press said two of his former israeli commanders turned 
up a week ago at his home in suburban ottawa first trying to buy 
his silence then threatening him 
they said money was no object they said it was for my own 
good and the good of my family ostrovsky has a wife and two 
daughters 
they said that its better for me that i dont write it they 
told me to stop it they wanted to know if i still controlled it 
publication he said he asked for police protection but was 
refused 
gainsburg said nothing about ostrovskys book was heard in new 
york until tuesday when lawyers representing israel telephoned to 
ask that copies not be shipped to us sellers 
the publisher said that when they learned several thousand books 
already were out the lawyers said they wanted to see a judge 
he said dontzin heard from lawyers for both sides for two hours 
in his apartment but received no evidence 
they referred to an affidavit under seal in the canadian court 
in ontario which neither we nor the judge have ever seen 
gainsburg said we do not know what that affidavit said nor does 
the judge 
a call to dontzin seeking comment was not returned immediately 
jonathan lerner one of the lawyers for israel refused to 
comment saying i dont want to make my legal arguments in the 
press 
asked about first amendment implications he said if i didnt 
feel there was precedent i wouldnt have made the application 
at the israeli consulate spokesman yuval rotem said his 
government would make no comment about a matter before a court

a roman catholic bishops organization said 
wednesday it had asked the bush administration to make sure the 
trade embargo against iraq does not cover essential food and 
medicine for civilians 
the moral justification for our intervention requires that we 
maintain the distinction between the iraqi regime and ordinary and 
vulnerable iraqi citizens said a letter to secretary of state 
james a baker iii from the chairman of the us catholic bishopss 
committe on international policy 
we urge that in the implementation of the embargo and other 
sanctions against iraq the utmost care and sensitivity be exercised 
so that innocent civilians are not deprived of those essentials for 
the maintenance of life ie food and medicines wrote the 
committee chairman archbishop roger m mahony of los angeles 
a united nations sanctions committee could not agree on what 
kind of food aid to allow into iraq and occupied kuwait most of 
the delegates want to allow shipments only to foreigners and 
children while cuba and yemen called for a broader resolution 
allowing in food to all civilians 
bush has said the united states favors humanitarian food and 
medical shipments but has not spelled out what that should mean

albanian border guards shot and 
killed a 4yearold girl who was among a group of albanians 
attempting to cross illegally into yugoslavia the official 
yugoslav tanjug news agency said wednesday 
eighteen other albanians including an army officer and two 
soldiers using a military boat managed to safely flee to 
yugoslavia in the same escape attempt tuesday tanjug said 
the girl identified as anisa gruda was fatally shot when 
border guards opened fire on the escapees while they were crossing 
lake skadar on the albanianyugoslav border 
the report gave no further details 
albania the last hardline communist nation in europe is at 
odds with yugoslavia over the fate of ethnic albanians in the 
serbcontrolled yugoslav province of kosovo it frequently disputes 
the accuracy of yugoslav reports concerning albania 
in may albania announced a package of limited reforms 
including a liberalization of travel restrictions and the abolition 
of the death penalty for those fleeing the country in july a 
measure took effect allowing any adult to apply for a passport to 
travel abroad 
but despite the changes about 70 albanians illegally crossed 
into yugoslavia in july and august according to yugoslav 
statistics 
the refugees normally cite the harsh economic conditions in 
albania as their main reason for fleeing 
over 4000 albanians were allowed to leave for the west in july 
after they took refuge in western embassies in tirana the albanian 
capital but authorities have since put up a wall around the 
embassy district to prevent a similar incident

worried that michigan is becoming a haven 
for suicide after two widely publicized cases a lawmaker said 
wednesday hell sponsor a bill that would make it a felony to help 
people kill themselves 
weve had these examples of people traveling thousands of 
miles to reach what is considered to be the safe state of michigan 
to perform assisted suicides i think that is certainly a very 
black eye on michigan nationally said sen fred dillingham 
michigan now has no law against assisted suicide murder laws 
dont cover it the state court of appeals has ruled 
janet adkins an oregon woman who suffered from alzheimers 
disease traveled to suburban detroit in june and committed suicide 
using a machine developed by dr jack kevorkian kevorkian hooked 
her up to it but adkins pushed a button that sent lethal drugs 
into her body kevorkian wasnt charged 
bertram harper 79 of california faces trial on murder and 
conspiracy to commit murder charges in the aug 19 death of his 
wife virginia 69 in a detroitarea hotel harper told police he 
pulled a plastic bag over her head after she took some sleeping 
pills 
myself and others are very very concerned about michigan 
continuing to be considered some type of suicide haven 
dillingham said its wrong and it needs to be stopped 
his legislation would make it a felony to help someone commit or 
attempt to commit suicide it would carry a maximum penalty of four 
years in prison and a 2000 fine he said he would introduce the 
measure this week

president alberto fujimori said wednesday he 
would not sign an agreement with the united states for 35 million 
in military aid to fight cocaine trafficking 
speaking at a press conference fujimori said peruvian military 
advisers consider it against our interests at this time to sign 
the accord this year 
the us agreement was to have included 20 million to build a 
training base near perus cocarich upper huallaga valley and 
provide arms and equipment for peruvian soldiers 
the upper huallaga is the worlds principal supplier of coca 
leaf the raw material for cocaine political analaysts estimate 
more than 1000 maoist shining path guerrillas operate in the 
valley a jungle region 250 miles northeast of lima 
the guerrillas provide protection for the drug traffickers in 
exchange for money and weapons 
the agreement had been drawn up by washington and presented to 
fujimoris predecessor alan garcia who insisted the agreement be 
accompanied by economic aid 
fujimori repeatedly warned he would not sign the agreement 
unless it included economic aid to wean farmers from growing coca 
fujimori stressed the need to develop alternative crops in the area 
and build a paved highway to bring the products to markets on the 
coast where most of the populace lives 
fujimori said because the aid package is destined only for the 
fight against drug trafficking we are not going to sign this 
agreement 
the aid package was planned for the 1990 fiscal year which 
concludes at the end of september us ambassador anthony quaynton 
said in an interview with the news magazine caretas this week that 
if peru does not sign the agreement the aid would go to other 
countries 
the peruvian military is more preoccupied with the countrys 
10year guerrilla war than with controlling perus annual 1 
billion cocaine trade in peru the police force is in charge of 
the drug fight 
peruvian politicians have criticised the agreement fearing it 
could lead to direct us involvement in a guerrilla war that has 
left nearly 20000 dead since 1980 
the us drug enforcement administration already operates an 
antidrug base in the huallaga valley jointly with peruvian police 
the shining path attacked the base in april 
fujimoris refusal to sign the agreement comes at a time when 
peru is reeling from tough austerity measures aimed at curbing 
3000 percent annual inflation 
fujimori who was sworn in on july 28 inherited a moribund 
economy and a huge government deficit generated by the freespending 
government of garcia 
fujimori is to travel to the united states at the end of 
september for talks with un secretary general javier perez de 
cuellar according to the state news agency andina 
quaynton said fujimori may also meet with president bush andina

the rebuilt exxon valdez returned to service 
wednesday delayed a few hours by environmentalists who climbed 
aboard its rudder and chained themselves to a boom near the ship 
nine greenpeace protesters were arrested charged with 
misdemeanor suspicion of trespassing and disturbing the peace and 
later released said arthur leblanc chief of harbor police 
the environmentalists said they used the departure of the ship 
renamed the exxon mediterranean to protest the united states 
dependence on foreign oil and lack of energysaving programs and 
alternatives to fossil fuel 
the tanker caused the countrys worst oil spill when it ran 
aground march 24 1989 in alaskas prince william sound spilling 
nearly 11 million gallons killing scores of animals and fouling 
hundreds of miles of coastline 
were trying to make a point that the exxon valdez represents 
our addiction to oil which will cause more spills like prince 
william sound and also has us on the verge of war in the persian 
gulf said greenpeace spokesman kelly quirke 
the exxon valdez isnt the only tanker thats a danger to 
coastlines around the world there are hundreds of tankers out 
there and theyre all an accident waiting to happen 
arrested were two protesters who handcuffed themselves to the 
rudder and were removed by police one in a rubber raft who tried 
to put a banner on the ship and six swimmers chained to a boom set 
around a 20foot inflatable globe floating next to the tanker 
after the twohour protest scuba divers checked the ships hull 
we did a routine sweep of the bottom which we would have done 
anyway to make sure the propeller wasnt fouled and to make sure 
that no one had put anything in the propeller or the rudder 
shaft said fred hallett a spokesman for national steel amp 
shipbuilding co 
the tanker left the pier about four hours late and then waited 
another 30 minutes in san diego bay for fog to dissipate 
we regret this incident happened our desire was to get 
underway and to launch the vessel on her initial voyage and to have 
a timely and safe voyage said les rogers an exxon spokesman in 
houston 
the ship is to refuel in singapore before continuing to the 
mediterranean the company said it would carry oil from the middle 
east to europe 
after the alaska spill the 4yearold ship returned to the 
shipbuilding companys shipyard in san diego where it was built 
for nearly a year of repairs totaling 30 million 
workers replaced onethird of its hull with 3000 tons of new 
inchthick steel the 987footlong tanker holds nearly 14 million 
barrels of crude oil a barrel is 42 gallons 
the ship was renamed the mediterranean in july exxon officials 
have denied that the change in name and base stemmed from the spill 
exxon officials said the tanker was too big for us pacific 
ports and declining production from alaskan oil fields reduced the 
need for such large tankers on the west coast

edward lewis humphreys history of 
mental illness scarred face and fondness for knives helped make 
him stand out in the search for the methodical killer of five 
college students 
but after nearly two weeks authorities wont say for sure hes 
their man 
police called for national guard help for an intensive search 
thursday of 10 square miles near humphreys gainesville apartment 
in a search for evidence police refused to reveal what they are 
looking for but say the evidence they are seeking could rule out 
or confirm humphrey as a suspect 
also wednesday the us justice department approved a 941639 
emergency grant to help pay for the investigation much of the 
money will be used for personnel costs said jon peck a spokesman 
for gov bob martinez 
while circumstantial evidence mounted against the 18yearold 
university of florida freshmen even those close to him wondered 
about dramatic changes evident in the eagle scout and high school 
honor student 
humphrey has been in the brevard county jail in lieu of 1 
million bond since aug 30 on unrelated charges including one that 
he beat his 79yearold grandmother he has not been charged in 
connection with the gainesville deaths 
normally police wont publicly identify a suspect before an 
arrest is made but this is a highprofile case 
hes the one weve received the most information about said 
police spokeswoman lt sadie darnell so i think thats why he 
became the focus rightly or wrongly 
police searches of humphreys gainesville apartment and 
indialantic home and car turned up six longbladed knives a 
butcher knife hidden in a milk jug a fishing gaff and an advanced 
version of the fantasy game dungeons and dragons the orlando 
sentinel reported wednesday it said police are looking for 
videotapes or audiotapes recording the slayings human flesh and 
photographs of the victims 
police have refused to discuss such details 
humphrey enjoyed dressing up in military clothes strapping on a 
knife and slipping into the woods around his apartment for 
nighttime pseudo reconnaisance maneuvers neighbors told police 
neighbors said he bragged he was going to fight in saudi arabia 
and three weeks before the slayings he was found in a restricted 
area on the patrick air force base near his home walking in 
circles and claiming to be a member of the elite 82nd airborne 
division 
he was freed without being arrested a base spokesman said but 
two knives with 6inch blades were confiscated from his car 
hes not the same person he used to be said friend jeff 
deratany hes not ed humphrey 
during high school in the upscale coastal town of indialantic 
about 180 miles southeast of gainesville humphrey appeared to be 
the allamerican boy with looks good grades positions on the 
student council and junior varsity football team he hung around 
with surfer buddies and dreamed of becoming a lawyer 
friends said the youngest of four children was emotionally 
affected by his parents bitter divorce about five years ago 
two years ago when humphrey was hospitalized for several weeks 
with mononucleosis during his senior year at melbourne high school 
he became severely depressed telling friends he could smell 
death 
soon after that humphrey either fell or jumped from a car 
traveling at 70 mph in gainesville 
the accident left him with a limp and months of therapy stays 
in mental health programs and a reliance on the drug lithium to 
control mood swings friends said 
last fall near his indialantic home his car rammed a utility 
pole and his face smashed into the windshield leaving deep scars 
humphrey used to complain that the lithium left him groggy and 
fat and sometimes he would stop using it 
you could tell when he wasnt on it said erik bedesem 19 
an indialantic resident who describes himself as humphreys best 
friend he was real aggressive and high strung 
asked if humphrey could have killed he said its not 
unbelievable 
in may he enrolled in the first summer term at the university 
of florida and relatives said he did well 
for a time he lived at the gatorwood apartments where two of 
the slayings occurred manager carol hyde said he was asked to 
leave but would not say why a resident of the complex told the 
sunsentinel in fort lauderdale that he had a crush on one of the 
victims 23yearold tracy inez paules 
he is registered at the school this fall as a freshman with no 
declared major 
after his summer courses he traveled to montana friends said 
he once had a romance there with a girl who had written to him 
saying she was in love with someone else 
his mother and grandmother alerted authorities in montana to 
find him and send him home 
ravalli county montana sheriff jay printz said humphrey had a 
rambo complex he was definitely an emotionally troubled young 
man he said he just didnt have all his marbles together 
humphrey started the fall semester on aug 25 the day before 
two bodies were found he was arrested five days later after 
entered his grandmothers indialantic home during the night and 
yelled you are going to hell and you are going to die he 
allegedly began choking her and pummeling her face according to a 
sheriffs report 
i hit her and im sorry he reportedly told deputies 
grandmother elna hlavaty was treated for broken facial bones and a 
swollen eye 
authorities have refused to comment on published reports that 
humphrey told investigators he knew who killed two victims and gave 
a name police believe is one of his multiple personalities 
a jail guard testified at a hearing last week that humphrey 
often referred to himself as john saying john doesnt take no 
prisoners

chinese authorities have executed more than 500 
people this year in the most severe crackdown on crime since 1983 
amnesty international said in a report released thursday 
the londonbased human rights group said that some people were 
put to death within two weeks of their arrest 
amnesty international said 1100 people are known to have been 
sentenced to death in the last 12 months but it said the actual 
figure of those put to death is undoubtedly much higher 
amnesty which opposes the death penalty as a matter of 
principle appealed earlier this month to chinese prime minister li 
peng to suspend the executions 
the amnesty report said almost all those sentenced to death this 
year have been tried under emergency procedures that give them 
little opportunity to prepare their defense 
trials are often a mere formality with the verdict decided 
beforehand and little chance for appeal or pardon the report 
said 
amnesty said the number of executions was the greatest since 
5000 or more people were killed in 1983 during a major anticrime 
campaign against crime 
the courts have been ordered to severely crack down on such 
crimes as drug trafficking embezzlement gang robberies and theft 
the fourth such sweeping attack on crime in the last eight 
years the report said 
despite the increase in death sentences the level of crime 
has not dropped in the last decade the report said

in a period of hardening vatican demands for 
doctrinal conformity two top american catholic thinkers have 
zeroed in on a specific case of enforcing it and cried foul 
they say the action was unjust in the first place and that 
continuing academic complicity in it is harmful not only to the 
victim but to roman catholic higher education and to the church 
itself 
the protest amounts to a challenge both to ecclesiastical 
authorities and to administrations of catholic universities 
it comes after a recent tightening by the vatican of 
prohibitions against dissent but focuses on a 1986 case against 
the rev charles curran a prominent moral theologian ousted from 
the catholic university of america 
arguing the ouster was carried out by unjust means the rev 
richard p mcbrien theology department chairman at the university 
of notre dame and the schools noted christian ethicist the rev 
richard a mccormick charge 
continuing exclusion of father curran from catholic college 
and university theology faculties represents complicity in the 
original injustice 
the two scholars say efforts have been made by various catholic 
theology departments to get curran on the faculties but he has 
been positively excluded by upper administration 
writing in the sept 815 issue of the jesuitedited national 
catholic weekly america the two scholars say 
we regard this exclusion as a continuing complicity in the 
original injustice done to father curran and as harmful not only to 
him but also to catholic higher education in this country and to 
the church 
most of currans theological colleagues would give their 
proverbial right arms to get him on their faculties but the 
resistance comes from upper administrations which are afraid 
the article says 
it is at once unintelligible and inexcusable that catholic 
educators who know better should now have assumed the disturbing 
role of accomplices to the original injustice an injustice not 
only to father curran but to catholic higher education and the 
church he continues to serve so faithfully the article adds 
the rev george w hunt americas editor in chief said he 
expected the essay to cause a great deal of reaction both in 
ecclesiastical and educational circles 
curran was ousted after some of his views on sexual ethics such 
as defending contraception were denounced by the vaticans 
doctrinal arbiter cardinal joseph ratzinger 
ratzinger ruled him neither suitable nor eligible to teach 
catholic theology more than 750 american theologians signed a 
statement supporting currans stature in his field 
in the last three years he has held teaching posts at secular 
institutions at cornell university the university of southern 
california and now auburn university 
at issue in the case was not the right of the church to teach 
and to defend its teaching against error but the proper scope and 
use of that right the article contends 
it says vatican interventions in such cases have been 
improperly and unjustly exercised and flout rights recognized 
in modern societies by such practices as these both prosecuting 
and judicial authorities are combined the accused has no access to 
documents touching on charges the proceedings are in secret there 
is no right of appeal 
in brief the institutional structures and procedures are 
unfair to start with the article says 
it says that for a professional theologian to be so 
stigmatized by the churchs highest authorities brands the person 
as not to be trusted in the very profession to which he has 
devoted his life 
that is extremely serious business and puts currans past 
present and future work under a cloud his theological and to 
some extent his personal reputation sullied the writers say 
this was done on the basis of a rationale that is new and 
disturbing and that will not survive historical and theological 
scrutiny mcbrien and mccormick contend 
they say catholic higher education could repair some of the 
damage to itself if a prestigious catholic university such as notre 
dame boston college or georgetown university offered curran a 
theology professorship 
but the administrations are intimidated by the actual or 
potential opposition mcbrien and mccormick write 
they say the single reason given for the punishment was public 
dissent meaning only disagreement with an officially 
formulated position even if as in currans case the position 
was not considered absolute or infallible 
as an upshot to that case and others ratzinger last june with 
papal approval banned public dissent by theologians from any 
teaching of the churchs magisterium the pope and bishops whether 
regarded infallible or not 
declaring that ratzingers position represents a denial of the 
legitimacy of public dissent in principle mcbrien and mccormick 
say 
the legitimacy of dissent from noninfallible teaching is not 
an episcopal grant or concession rather such legitimacy is 
rooted in the imperfection and contingency of human knowledge

this sunday 60 minutes starts its 23rd 
season having been no 1 in the ratings twice last month in the 
nielsen top ten club 13 consecutive seasons and a solid 
moneymaker for cbs 
it still starts with a ticking stopwatch still usually has 
three features a show and by the reckoning of don hewitt its 
executive producer and founding father still earns a tidy sum each 
year 
there were years when we made 70 million years we made 50 
million years we made 40 million he said what we made last 
year i dont know i swear to god 
but when it began in 1968 sharing tuesdays on an 
everyotherweek basis with cbs news hour it had no sponsors 
and literally no ratings he recalls 
in those days mike wallace and harry reasoner were the shows 
only correspondents it has them and three others now and andy 
rooney was 10 years away from furrowing his bushy eyebrows near the 
end of each weeks show and asking viewers didja ever wonder 
about 
hewitts brainchilds was shifted to sundays in 1972 and has 
been a sabbath staple since save for a summer run on fridays in 
1973 it didnt lack viewers when it began even though it lacked 
ratings 
it just wasnt counted by nielsen hewitt said because cbs 
authorities wouldnt sell advertising time on it and ordered it 
aired as sustaining or without sponsors such shows arent 
rated 
as one executive explained things to him hewitt said cbs brass 
didnt want the low ratings they expected for the new show and the 
news hour to pull down the primetime average of the networks 
entertainment shows 
he forgets the executives name but recalls him saying i 
dont even want to let a sponsor buy them no matter what 
money we make from them it aint worth pulling down the average 
for cbs 
times have changed a bit since then the networks once commanded 
a 90 percent share of the nations prime time audience 
now with more than 20 percent of that audience gone elsewhere 
theyre scrapping for every cent and viewer they can get facing 
such viewing and advertising alternatives as cable independent 
stations and videocassettes 
theyre trying to look different with shows like abcs cop 
rock and twin peaks and letting the language get a little 
rowdier as on cbs uncle buck 
but 60 minutes the nations highestrated prime time series 
in the 197980 season when network tv was at its peak still 
retains its basic format despite some notable if occasional 
personnel changes 
the most notable was last years departure of correspondent 
diane sawyer to jovially bicker with sam donaldson on abcs 
primetime live and see if she could get by on a reported 16 
million annual stipend 
the basic format consists of investigative stories personality 
profiles and the occasional light piece such as morley safers 
report this sunday on parisian art galleries where one can buy 
genuine fake art 
but the format may be undergoing a slight change 
when the persian gulf crisis was ignited by iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait the series began airing latebreaking reports 
on the crisis including one by cbs anchorman dan rather once a 
60 minutes regular 
last sunday it also had a profile of gen h norman 
schwarzkopf commander of us forces sent to the middle east that 
story was done by an outsider of sorts david martin cbs 
respected pentagon reporter 
60 minutes seldom has started with the days hot news 
because there was a newcast on sunday ahead of us and that was 
enough hewitt said 
but we never had something like this the gulf crisis and 
its continued uncertainties to contend with before he said 
so now he said i think what well probably do more often 
than not is to run some headlines at the top of the show giving 
the latest gulf crisis news and other reports in brief 
will the headlines become a regular part of the show 
i dont know hewitt said whenever it warrants it if 
theres enough news that people want to know about it 
the dapper ebullient producer who turns 68 in december and 
says he has an unbreakable contract to run the show until hes 
74 was asked the annual question 
did he expect 60 minutes to run this long 
i didnt expect it to run 23 weeks let alone 23 years he 
said

as they try to avail themselves of the best 
growth opportunities for the 1990s many mutualfund investors 
pride themselves on taking an international approach 
thats probably a smart idea many financial advisers agree but 
they add that global funds may be an even more promising choice 
than their international counterparts 
whats the difference between the two in the terminology of the 
mutual fund business international commonly describes a 
portfolio made up of securities from outside the united states 
in a global fund by contrast managers mix together both 
american and foreign investments 
professional investors these days have a strong incentive to 
operate with a global approach since both stocks and 
interestbearing securities of many national origins now trade in 
what is fast becoming a continuous roundtheworld marketplace 
the profits of american businesses and the levels of us 
interest rates are increasingly determined by events and trends 
that take place overseas 
many observers now argue that growth rates may be greater over 
the next several years in europe for example than they are in 
this country 
the lure of global investing is a hot fund theme in 1990 
notes the united mutual fund selector an investment advisory 
service 
given the trends of the 80s the odds favor an increasingly 
unified world marketplace in the 90s naturally this bodes well 
for mutuals with the ability to capitalize upon business action 
wherever it occurs 
despite the current recession fears and oilprice worries 
gripping most of the worlds stock markets some analysts see 
dramatic opportunities in the years ahead 
facilitated by satellite telecommunications money goods and 
services flow around the world with fewer restrictions than ever 
before observes sheldon jacobs publisher of the monthly letter 
the noload fund investor 
with global markets integrated there will be unprecedented 
economies of scale not only in manufacturing but in research 
materials sourcing and other areas 
global funds have an edge over internationals some analysts 
argue because the united states stands a good chance of 
participating handsomely in the rewards of this growth 
america will fare ok in this new world jacobs maintains 
its a myth that we are in decline 
the fund industry has seized on these prospects to create more 
than two dozen global funds in recent years with many more 
expected to be added to the ranks 
in a sampling of them that jacobs examined the portion of the 
portfolio devoted to us holdings ranged from 14 percent to 61 
percent 
since the people who run these funds have such differing views 
about where to allocate their assets it is only logical that the 
results achieved will vary significantly from one global fund to 
another 
furthermore managers of these funds have to cope not only with 
questions of timing and security selection but also with political 
risk and currency risk the greater the number of choices to be 
made the greater the possibility that some individual decisions 
wont work out well 
also the experts caution a global portfolio may not provide 
much protection from any sort of economic or financial calamity 
that sets in worldwide 
concludes the united mutual fund selector even though a 
funds operation and philosophy are worldwide in scope several 
other factors should be considered before jumping on board these 
factors include the costs to buy shares the performance record 
expense ratio and quality of holdings

sometimes people have sought to use prayer as a partisan 
weapon presuming to enlist god on their side against others but 
thats not the case in prayers readied for wide american use this 
weekend about the persian gulf crisis 
prepared on an interfaith basis christian moslem and jewish 
the prayers seek not gods partiality but his guidance its sought 
to get people to straighten up themselves 
o god illumine our way our hearts and our minds in this 
hour of darkness reads a moslemcomposed part of the prayers 
teach our leaders humility wisdom and good judgment 
the old narrow tendency to attempt to tie god to a particular 
side in human conflicts got one of its most incisive and memorable 
putdowns from abraham lincoln in the civil war 
disagreeing with appeals for prayers that god side with union 
forces lincoln said that wasnt his concern for i know the lord 
is always on the side of right 
lincoln added but it is my constant anxiety and prayer that i 
and the nation should be on the lords side 
that is the emphasis of three prayers being distributed among 
churches mosques and synagogues across the nation for use this 
weekend in regard to the international standoff with iraq over its 
seizing of kuwait 
save us from weak resignation to violence reads a 
christiancomposed part of the prayers teach us that restraint 
is the highest expression of power that thoughtfulness and 
tenderness are marks of the strong 
the prayers were distributed by the us interreligious 
committee for peace in the middle east through national and 
regional religious offices of christian jewish and moslem bodies 
for use sept 1416 
how long o loving god will we continue to kill in your 
name reads a jewish part of the prayers how long will we 
refuse to register the unalterable fact that all human creatures on 
this earth are brothers and sisters 
ronald j young of philadelplhia executive director of the 
interreligious committee said he was encouraged and surprised by 
the wide pickup on this intiative by organizations of all three 
religions 
the prayers are going to be used in congregations all over the 
country young said it bespeaks a mood in this country of hope 
that the crisis can be cooled down 
on a deeper level the common spirit of the prayers 
demonstrates the oneness of the god we all profess to serve 
one of the three prayers was written by a christian one by a 
jew and one by a moslem but the prayers are not identified by 
religion young provided that information in explaining the project 
help us all to defuse this crisis peacefully before it plunges 
us into a whirlpool of sensless suffering bloodshed and war 
reads a moslemcomposed portion o god guide us to your ways 
the ways of righteousness and peace 
accompanying the distribution was a call to prayer that 
acknowledges religion sometimes appears to contribute to middle 
east conflicts but adds 
we believe the deepest sources in our traditions provide 
inspiration and wisdom for resolution of these conflicts 
the call was issued by dawud assad president of the council of 
mosques the rev bryan hehir roman catholic international affairs 
consultant the rev dale l bishop head of the middle east office 
of the national council of churches and rabbi arthur hetzberg 
vice president of the world jewish congress 
help us to love our enemies not by countenancing their sins 
but by remembering our own goes a christiancomposed portion 
o god as moslems jews and christians we acknowledge that 
thou hast made of one blood all the nations of the earth thou dost 
love all of us as if all were but one 
the sponsoring committee made up of 1200 christian moslem and 
jewish members was formed in 1988 to support an active us role 
in encouraging peace between israel palestinians and arab states 
that remains primary young said but the constituency also 
felt the need for a joint voice on the persian gulf crisis 
although differences in religion often are blamed for conflicts 
presbyterian leader william p thompson said such troubles are 
caused by human deviations from religious principles not adherence 
to them 
thompson associate secretarygeneral of the world conference on 
religion and peace added the sacred writings of all of the 
great religions commit themselves to peace 
a jewish part of the joint prayers over the gulf crisis goes 
o god help us to overcome the rationalizations that 
ultimately end in justification of actions which inevitably lead to 
bloodshed and suffering 
grant us the ability to find joy and strength not in the 
strident call to arms but in stretching out our arms to grasp our 
fellow creatures in the striving for justice and truth

contending they have been excluded from positions 
in the southern baptist convention moderates have organized a 
fellowship of their own but stopped short of forming a new 
denomination 
a threeday consultation of about 3000 concerned baptists was 
held here two months after fundamentalists in june solidified their 
control of the 149 millionmember denomination 
the consultation set up a mechanism called the baptist 
cooperative missions program to handle contributions apart from 
denominational channels and also elected a 60member interim 
steering committee on future steps 
this is the first time in baptist history that any group of 
folks has been systematically excluded said the rev david sapp

democrat theo mitchell is making scant 
headway in his bid to become the nations second black elected 
governor and some south carolina democrats complain the candidate 
has done little to help himself 
mitchells campaign also has had to compete for attention with a 
statehouse bribery scandal that so far has brought the indictments 
of five state legislators 
the only issue anyone wants to talk about is ethics said 
lynn stokes a veteran of other democratic campaigns 
democratic activists say mitchells campaign suffers from poor 
organization and a lack of publicity 
hes making little or no headway said charles t bud 
ferillo a democratic consultant 
mitchells campaign has not demonstrated any seriousness 
said samuel tenenbaum a key democratic fundraiser who has 
contributed 1000 to the mitchell camp 
mitchell however maintains his campaign is in good health 
i am elated at the momentum he said i dont understand 
what the commotion is all about 
mitchell a lawyer and state senator who has spent 16 years in 
the general assembly is hoping to follow the path of virginias 
gov l douglas wilder who last year became the nations first 
elected black governor 
but with less than 60 days before the nov 6 general election 
mitchell faces long odds in his attempt to defeat firstterm 
republican gov carroll campbell 
earl black a professor at the university of south carolina and 
an expert on southern politics said a landslide campbell victory 
would devastate democrats who have long dominated south carolina 
politics 
no republican in south carolina has ever had a sendoff like 
that black said 
some democrats say mitchell has done little to help himself 
if i were running the campaign i would have press conferences 
every week on some issue said stokes you have to draw a 
crowd 
activists say the campaign seems to have no organization beyond 
a few people at its greenville headquarters 
youve got to establish a grassroots campaign its a 
hackneyed phrase but its true said a democrat who is involved 
in another statewide campaign mitchell could be in the poconos 
bluefishing for all i know 
mike hart who manages mitchells campaign bristles at such 
talk insisting that the campaign has the assistance of several top 
democrats including former gov dick riley and charleston mayor 
joe riley 
in addition hart said mitchell has coordinators in each of the 
states 46 counties the campaign also has three top coordinators 
we have a massive undertaking going on hart said 
ms stokes and several other democrats said it may be impossible 
for campbell to get reporters to focus on any story that does not 
relate to the bribery scandal in which three state lawmakers have 
pleaded guilty 
democratic state rep david beasley imposing his own grading 
system on a potential mitchell press conference said the bribery 
scandal takes what initially would be a b story and it makes 
it a d story 
det bowers who is managing democratic lt gov nick theodores 
reelection bid said mitchell must make stronger efforts to get 
attention in the midst of the scandal 
any challenger has to be innovative and creative and youve 
got to be more creative to slice through that bowers said 
mitchell said he does not want to publicize all campaign 
appearances for safety reasons he also said some reporters are 
biased in favor of campbell and refuse to give him attention 
some reporters have written condescendingly about the 
campaign he said 
mitchell has several times questioned the racial motivation 
behind the federal bribery investigation and those accusations 
have received some press attention 
only one of the five indicted lawmakers is black but six more 
present and former legislators last week were identified as 
conspirators in the scandal five of whom are black a black 
circuit judge who is currently suspended was also named none of 
the seven has been charged 
mitchell has said he turned down a lobbyists offer of a 
campaign contribution in exchange for a vote on a betting bill and 
believes he was targeted in the fbi sting because he is running for 
governor 
certainly its a disproportionate number of black legislators 
that were targeted he said last month 
republicans say the main problem with mitchells gubernatorial 
bid is that he is too liberal for the states voters state gop 
chairman barry wynn said mitchell is out of touch with what we 
think is mainstream south carolina 
mitchell meanwhile describes himself as a supporter of 
fundamental mainstream values and the godgiven rights of 
all people including workers women and homosexuals 
he accuses campbell of trying to take political advantage of 
the bribery scandal in proposing ethics reforms he also says the 
governor has catered to the wealthy and privileged at the 
expense of poor elderly and workingclass people 
with the traditional labor day campaign kickoff now past 
democrats say mitchell must begin moving earnestly very soon 
if you arent within close striking distance about 30 days 
before the election its very difficult to win bowers said 
by oct 1 youve got to be within several points

what scares pam dawber more doing her own 
stunt work on the side of a highrise building or returning to a 
situation comedy 
she conquered the challenge of rappelling down the side of a 
40story building for the cbs movie the face of fear to be 
shown sunday but the memory of the murder of a costar in the 
series my sister sam holds a lingering dread as she prepares 
for a new cbs sitcom 
recalling the slaying of rebecca schaeffer who played miss 
dawbers teenage sister in my sister sam the actress says she 
worries the new series will bring the crazies out of the 
woodwork 
suddenly it will start again she said the threats the 
letters im more sensitive to it because of what happened to 
rebecca 
miss schaeffer 21 was shot to death july 18 1989 by a man 
who was waiting outside her west hollywood apartment robert john 
bardo 19 of tucson ariz described by police as an obsessed fan 
of miss schaeffer goes to trial oct 15 for firstdegree murder 
that tragedy still in her mind miss dawber faced new emotions 
during her work on the face of fear 
she first thought the movie would be easy because a lot of the 
action seemed to involve stunt doubles escaping down the outside of 
a 40story building 
when i read the script i thought this isnt going to be bad 
theres going to be so much stunt work that i wont be working that 
much she laughed we ended up doing most of our own stunts 
during the filming miss dawber and costar lee horsley were 
suspended by ropes on the outside of a building they were never 
more than six stories high but still high enough to give you a 
case of acrophobia 
i think they originally thought most of the work would be done 
by stunt people but in teaching us to rappel kenny bates our 
stunt coordinator found lee and i are both comfortable with 
heights she said and both of us enjoyed it as we learned how 
to do it he bates said look this will look much better if you 
two do most of your own stunts 
so we tried it we had to climb out the window and hang 
off a ledge we truly rappelled down into space that was the thing 
that unnerved me even in the studio on a set we were still three 
stories high it frightened me enough to stop and ask what am i 
doing 
doing a thriller movie in the role of a police forensic 
psychologist is a change of pace for miss dawber until now noted 
for situation comedies including mork amp mindy 
the reason i found the role attractive is the roles i get the 
roles im offered im usually the nice girl or the mom she 
said this is a assertive woman she really forces the 
story along 
in the face of fear horsley is a mountain climber who 
suffers a devastating fall that leaves him afraid of heights a 
more unsettling side effect is that hes developed psychic 
abilities with the help of miss dawber and the police he is about 
to identify a serial killer 
the killer wants to silence horsley and traps him and miss 
dawber at the top of the highrise building the only escape is 
down the outside where miss dawber helps horsley overcome his fear 
of heights 
farhad mann directed from a script by dean r koontz and alan 
jay glueckman based on the novel by koontz 
miss dawber was not happy the long shooting schedule kept her 
away from sean her 2yearold son with her husband actor mark 
harmon 
there were times when id leave home before sean woke up and 
id come home and hed be asleep she said its just not the 
way i want to live my life 
the actress said she will be more selective in her projects so 
she isnt separated as much from her child 
despite the crushing memory of how my sister sam ended miss 
dawber thinks a halfhour comedy series offers the best working 
conditions to combine work and family she isnt talking about her 
new series until the network approves the concept like her other 
sitcoms it will be a fourcamera show filmed before a live 
audience 
id like for it to be a little more adult than what ive done 
before she said i think its a nine oclock show it depends 
on whether they like it but id rather see it a little more 
sophisticated 
its so hard to describe a situation comedy its all about 
casting its all about the characters its all about the jokes 
and stories i can just imagine that in the original pitch meeting 
for cheers it didnt sound very exciting theres this bar and 
people never leave it

democrat dianne feinstein and 
republican pete wilson are battling for the minds of 
middleoftheroad voters in the california governors race 
both stress issues on which they differ with most activists in 
their own party 
feinsteins latest television commercial features shots of her 
being booed loudly by delegates to the california democratic party 
convention last april for stating her support of the death penalty 
that stand was one of the principal reasons the former san 
francisco mayor lost the state party endorsement in the primary 
but it put her in step with the majority of california voters 
she also has endorsed an inmate labor program sponsored by 
retiring republican gov george deukmejian that is adamantly 
opposed by her organized labor supporters 
similarly wilson a twoterm us senator and former san diego 
mayor refuses to rule out raising taxes as conservatives in his 
party wish 
am i taking a nonewtaxes pledge wilson asked one 
conservative audience no i cant do that i cant responsibly 
tell you never i can tell you that raising taxes to fund 
government programs will not be my first choice as it has been 
that of mrs feinstein it will be my grudging last resort 
the feinsteinwilson race is a top national priority with both 
parties california will gain seven new seats in congress in the 
1991 reapportionment increasing the state delegation to 52 seats 
the only chance republicans have to prevent a gerrymander by the 
democratcontrolled legislature is the threat of a gop governors 
veto the difference between a compromise negotiated between a gop 
governor and democratic legislature and a reapportionment 
controlled entirely by democrats could be eight to 10 house seats 
spending in the governors race may exceed 25 million and the 
candidates have been running dead even 
so far wilson has failed to capitalize on his enormous 
fundraising advantage and feinstein has been unable to sustain 
the excitement her candidacy sparked when she became the first 
woman to win a major party nomination for governor of california 
smear commercials marked the summer phase of the campaign 
a feinstein commercial cited 243000 in campaign contributions 
wilson received in the past decade from savings and loan executives 
california cant afford a politician like pete wilson as 
governor feinsteins commercial concludes 
wilson accused feinstein of hypocrisy saying she and her 
husband own a savings and loan which received federal bailout 
funds feinsteins husband has a minority interest in an oregon 
savings and loan 
hes lying about me feinstein replied 
wilson and feinstein are wellsuited for a battle for the 
independent undecided and middleoftheroad voters 
wilson has a stronger environmental record than most 
republicans supporting growth management and coastal zoning 
restrictions and opposing offshore oil drilling 
feinstein has stronger ties than most democrats to business 
leaders in part through her husband multimillionaire investment 
banker richard blum 
wilson and feinstein who both celebrated their 57th birthdays 
in recent weeks have had roughly parallel careers as big city 
mayors wilson served 11 years as mayor of san diego before his 
election to the us senate in 1982 and feinstein served nine 
years as mayor of san francisco 
as mayors both stressed consensus and compromise and collected 
vocal critics on both the left and right but both won repeat terms 
by landslide margins 
there is a maked difference in style between the two contenders 
there is a star quality about feinstein who is often described as 
charismatic wilson with bland good looks and a plodding speaking 
style is the very antithesis of charisma 
feinsteins political career is defined principally by one 
dramatic event when she was thrust into the mayors office by the 
assassination of thenmayor george moscone and brought what was 
then a troubled city together 
wilsons political career is one of methodical lowprofile 
consensus building 
but while feinsteins charisma creates excitement especially 
among women voters pollster mervin field says it also is her 
biggest negative voters report a higher comfort level with wilson 
field said distrust of feinstein is the no 1 reason wilson 
voters cite for supporting the republican field also said the 
gender gap in feinsteins favor among women voters is almost 
exactly matched by a similar gap in mens preference for wilson

every wednesday the democrats who represent 
texas in congress eat lunch in the private dining room of the 
speaker of the house 
the entree like the politicking and gossiping varies each 
week but cornbread and ice cream are always served 
they were the favorite foods of sam rayburn the bonham farmer 
and teacher who began a record 17year tenure as house speaker 50 
years ago sunday 
tough and gritty warm and loyal rayburn was a statesman in 
washington and friend in the 4th district of texas after he 
presided over the 1952 democratic convention the first to be 
televised he became known to millions of americans as mr 
democrat to friends and colleagues he was mr sam 
he was the greatest man i ever served with in congress said 
former speaker carl albert whose oklahoma district was just across 
the red river from rayburns he had wisdom he had courage he 
had judgment 
i dont think well ever see his like again said hg 
dulaney one of only 38 staff workers rayburn hired during his 48 
years in congress dulaney who went to work for rayburn in 1951 
has been in charge of the sam rayburn library in bonham since 1957 
the library is dedicating a new statue and plaza to celebrate the 
rayburn anniversary 
rayburn had enormous power as speaker and few democrats would 
break ranks with him on a vote at his strongest rayburn told 
members of the house appropriations committee not to question 2 
billion being secretly spent in 1944 only he and a handful of 
others knew it was to develop an atomic bomb 
there really hasnt been a speaker even approaching rayburns 
power since him said donald bacon a washington journalist who 
in 1987 completed a biography that rayburn associate db hardeman 
started 30 years earlier 
part of that is because of changes in the way congress 
operates bacon said and part he said was because in rayburns 
waning days members came to congress who were better educated 
more independentminded and less willing to accept strong direction 
from within the house hierarchy 
rayburn died of cancer in 1961 at age 79 but there are 
reminders of him all over washington portraits and statues of him 
dot capitol hill president lyndon johnson his protege dedicated 
the mammoth rayburn house office building in 1965 
and the texas lone star is still emblazoned near the ceiling of 
the room in the capitol where rayburn hosted the socalled board 
of education rayburn invited colleagues to h128 after each 
days legislating to drink gossip and trade information 
harry truman was in the room on april 12 1945 when he was 
summoned to the white house upon the death of franklin d 
roosevelt jesus christ and general jackson the new president 
said as he left 
rayburn in the 1920s was a regular in a similar bureau of 
education hosted by john nance garner the democratic leader from 
south texas who later became vice president and nicholas 
longworth the ohio republican who was house speaker 
the nation was struggling out of the depression and world war ii 
was looming when speaker william b bankhead of alabama died of a 
stomach hemorrhage sept 15 1940 
rayburn was sworn in the next day only the second man in the 
history of the house to be elected its leader without opposition 
his service as speaker was twice interrupted when republicans held 
the majority of house seats in 194648 and 195254 
he had arrived in congress in 1913 after working his way through 
east texas normal college and serving in the texas house where in 
1911 he was elected speaker 
a student of garners and baileys rayburn would become the 
house architect of new deal legislation johnsons patron and the 
physical embodiment of the congress to millions 
rayburn understood people and he knew how to make people work 
for him and to work with each other bacon said 
he was a legislator he passed laws but the content of those 
laws concerned him less than getting them passed bacon said 
today a leader has to be concerned both with content and 
legislative procedure 
in later years rayburn boosted the young congressional careers 
of texans lloyd bentsen jack brooks and jim wright 
his was an art of gentle persuasion he believed very strongly 
in a mans commitment and his word bentsen said 
congressional sessions were shorter and less demanding 50 years 
ago and rayburn spent the long recesses on his farm in bonham 45 
miles north of dallas his only marriage failed after a few weeks 
but he was devoted to his large family of brothers and sisters 
nieces and nephews 
his rural background and patient belief that most problems 
worked themselves out over time added to rayburns stature in 
congress bacon said 
when rayburn was coming up in the 20s 30s and 40s we still 
thought of ourselves as a relatively simple people with little 
ambition beyond our own shores bacon said in an interview he 
certainly represented what we like to think is an american attitude 
and spirit of good will and honesty

federated department stores inc and allied 
stores corp have won an extension until feb 28 of their exclusive 
right to file a plan for emerging from chapter 11 reorganization 
but creditors and us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr who 
granted the permission tuesday said they will watch closely to 
ensure that federated and allied do not ease efforts to get out of 
reorganization 
the chapter 11 proceedings give the companies the bankruptcy 
courts protection from creditors 
i recognize that this extension is a long one aug told 
lawyers for federated and allied and their creditors this 
extension isnt a sign to ease up 
federated and allied told the judge they were not ready and need 
to concentrate on the upcoming christmas retailing season 
without the exclusivity privilege the companies creditors 
would have the right to file their own proposed reorganization 
plans for the judge to consider 
it is the second extension aug has granted the cincinnatibased 
companies which together operate 251 stores in 27 states and 
employ about 100000 people the companies originally had until may 
13 to file the reorganization plan the deadline would have been 
today if aug had not granted tuesdays extension 
aug told creditors lawyers tuesday that if he sees lack of 
progress he would reconsider whether federated and allied should 
have exclusive rights to file the reorganization plan 
creditors complained they know little of the retailers 
progress federated and allied had promised to file by last month 
their projections of longterm business prospects but the report 
now is not expected until early october 
aug directed lawyers for federated and allied to give him status 
reports every 60 days on the reorganization efforts 
no one more than this management wants to get out of chapter 
11 company lawyer david heiman told the judge the management 
has worked very hard for eight months to establish a foundation for 
emerging from reorganization 
federated and allied filed chapter 11 petitions jan 15 listing 
77 billion in debts much of it inherited from torontobased 
campeau corps heavy borrowing for its leveraged buyouts of allied 
in 1986 and federated in 1988 
aug is to hear arguments sept 27 on whether a committee of 
allied bondholders should be allowed to proceed with a threatened 
lawsuit the committee said the prospective defendants include 
campeau corp its american retailing subsidiary federated stores 
inc former allied officers and directors and banks including bank 
of montreal banque paribas and citibank 
the bondholders contend that up to 1 billion in proceeds from 
allieds 1989 sale of the ann taylor store division and 1988 sale 
of brooks brothers was fraudulently conveyed from allied to buy 
worthless stock or to pay off bank debt 
the bondholders allege that the transactions stripped assets 
from allied to the detriment of its investors 
the committee has notified federated and allied of intention to 
file the lawsuit the companies responded by asking aug not to 
allow the lawsuit to go forward federated and allied said the 
issue should be negotiated and that a lawsuit could delay progress 
of the companies reorganization 
ellen werther a lawyer for the bondholders committee told aug 
tuesday that the committee is ready to negotiate but believes it 
should have the option of filing suit in order to resolve the 
dispute

japans trade surplus edged up 37 percent in 
august to 349 billion from 337 billion a year earlier the 
finance ministry announced wednesday 
it was the third time this year that the nations trade gap has 
widened compared with a year earlier the surplus had declined for 
11 consecutive months until march 
ministry officials attributed the widening of the trade gap to 
increased exports but said they expect the surplus to trend lower 
at least in part because strong japanese domestic demand has 
spurred imports of a variety of products including manufactured 
goods 
domestic demand corporate investment in plant and equipment 
and personal consumption have helped fuel 46 straight months of 
economic growth in japan 
exports climbed 26 percent in august to 2239 billion from a 
year earlier while imports rose 24 percent to 1890 billion the 
ministry said 
ministry officials noted that the surplus in august shrank 353 
percent from the previous month when it totaled 539 billion 
on a regional basis the trade surplus with the united states 
japans largest single trading partner shrank 6 percent to 283 
billion as exports fell 32 percent while imports fell 13 percent 
a ministry official attributed the decline to the slowdown of 
the us economy 
japans surplus with the 12nation european community dropped 
162 percent to 113 billion while the surplus with asia soared 
753 percent to 157 billion 
ministry officials said the impact of the middle east crisis 
began affecting japans trade with iraq and kuwait during the month 
japans exports to iraq plunged 783 percent from a year earlier 
to 911 million while imports from that country mostly crude oil 
dropped 306 percent to 8186 million 
exports to kuwait fell 866 percent while imports from kuwait 
were down 323 percent kuwait was invaded by iraq on aug 2 
there is no doubt that the impact of the middle east crisis 
has started making itself felt said the ministry official who 
briefed reporters on the trade statistics 
he said the middle east conflict didnt affect the price of oil 
in august as far as trade statistics were concerned because oil 
prices averaged 1633 a barrel in the month down from 1719 a 
year earlier 
from september on however rising oil prices will hit japan 
boosting its import bills he said 
the ministry used an average exchange rate of 14889 yen in 
calculating exports and 14890 yen for imports 
japan calculates its trade figures on a customsclearance basis 
in which freight and insurance charges are included in imports but 
not in exports

apparel manufacturer leslie fay cos has cast 
off the frumpy oldfashioned image that clung to its skirts for 
decades in the process it has reinvented the market for 
moderately priced womens apparel a segment that retailers had 
been taking for granted 
customers shopping for 100 dresses had not been courted 
actively by store operators who preferred to exert their 
promotional muscle on more glamorous and pricey apparel yielding 
fatter profit margins 
trendy upscale fashions and eyecatching designer collections 
traditionally have been deemed better lures for shoppers even if 
expensive duds dont actually hook customers retailers reasoned 
they yank people in the door 
in some stores priceconscious customers had been virtually 
ignored left to rummage through crowded racks of rumpled clothing 
about three years ago john j pomerantz chairman and chief 
executive officer of the company his father founded in the 1940s 
set out to persuade his department store clients they were making a 
mistake 
necessity spawned the strategy leslie fay enjoyed good growth 
during the 1980s but the sales gains were misleading because they 
reflected an explosion in new stores 
we thought we were doing great but we didnt have a real 
plan when all of a sudden the stores stopped building pomerantz 
admitted 
when the retail building boom died out retailers looking for 
ways to maximize profits latched on to the idea of selling 
merchandise under their own names to reap higher returns they also 
tried to elevate their stores so they could sell a greater 
proportion of costlier goods 
we were doubly attacked we were attacked by the private label 
and we were attacked by the upgrading getting into higher fashions 
and more sophisticated garments pomerantz recalled 
apparently pomerantz has convinced many retailers that it pays 
to pay attention to what budgetminded shoppers want it helped 
that retailers love affair with private labels turned sour 
shoppers showed they preferred national brands also cashstrapped 
stores decided it was too costly to emphasize inhouse lines 
pomerantz and his colleagues found from contacting consumers 
directly that the way stores displayed leslie fay dresses and suits 
devalued the label wearers of leslie fay clothing liked its 
quality but felt it was fuddyduddy 
one of the results of this corporate soulsearching was the 
development of instore boutiques a grander version of the special 
sections set aside in department stores for single typically more 
expensive brands 
all of our clothes were just in a sea of merchandise so we 
decided we had to differentiate ourselves pomerantz explained in 
an interview at leslie fays new york headquarters the whole 
idea of the boutique means the merchandise is presented the way you 
feel it should be presented 
it took a lot of persuasion to get retailers to foot the bill 
for the boutiques and at first many balked maas brothers in 
florida was the first to try the concept which took off now there 
are hundreds of leslie fay boutiques within department stores 
mainly away from big cities 
in transforming leslie fay into a super brand the company 
consolidated its moderate lines under the leslie fay name and 
licensed the name for use on shoes and other items 
it tapped new designing talent to update styles to appeal to a 
younger set and embarked on its most ambitious advertising campaign 
ever the aug 26 new york times magazine carried a splashy ad 
touting leslie fay women a pitch refinement that has helped 
enhance the image of a line long associated with staid matrons 
having achieved much of what he set out to accomplish in the 
midlevel apparel range pomerantz has set his sights on bolstering 
the companys clout in the better bridge and designer parts of the 
business 
moderate dresses and suits the point at which prices start in 
department stores range from 80 to 120 the better category 
runs from 125 to 190 bridge is around 250 to 275 and the 
designer category generally is above that 
the plan to move up market will bring leslie fay far from its 
roots when fred pomerantz started the company in the mid1940s he 
applied what he had learned about fit and sizing from making world 
war ii uniforms the company named for his daughter pioneered the 
petite catgegory 
leslie fay has changed through acquisition and internal growth 
its name has stayed the same although its namesake has virtually 
nothing to do with the company and devotes her time to charity 
work its divisions include various specialized segments from the 
flagship leslie fay labels to the tony albert nipon designer 
collection to head sportswear 
denizens of new yorks garment district look on leslie fay as 
one of the industrys grand dames while securities analysts rate 
the company favorably 
as is in the retail industry the men are being separated from 
the boys the strong are getting stronger and the weak are dropping 
by the wayside id put leslie fay in the strong category said 
edward f johnson of prescott ball amp turben 
the companys finances are on an even enough keel to withstand a 
spending slowdown according to johnson they wont be immune to 
a pullback by the consumer but they should do better than others 
he said 
testament to its financial wellbeing was that leslie fay 
managed to survive two leveraged buyouts in the 1980s 
the first was for 58 million in 1982 and the second for 168 
million bought out investors in the first lbo leslie fay went 
public again in 1986 at 18 a share a level the stock hasnt 
achieved since it recently has traded at around 1050 a share 
sales and profits have grown steadily the growth came despite 
upheaval in retailing instigated largely by the campeau 
corpowned federated and allied department store chains which 
filed for bankruptcy in january 1990 
leslie fays earnings grew 158 percent last year to 2576 
million on a 152 percent sales gain to 7863 million through the 
first half of this year sales rose 86 percent to 3892 million 
while income was running 88 percent above last year at 1075 
million pomerantz predicts sales will exceed 880 million this 
year and the profit will reach a record level 
the years of repositioning have brought successes but pomerantz 
isnt satisfied saying the company has further to go in carrying 
out its plans 
were not even there yet he said 
as for where there is pomerantz has a clear if ambitious 
idea 
i think what we want to do is be the best apparel maker in 
america with the ability to create apparel for every woman in the 
country no matter what her pocketbook is no matter what her 
physical size might be

ames department stores inc on 
wednesday reported a secondquarter loss of 1525 million but 
store officials said the loss before nonrecurring charges was 
significantly smaller than expected 
the loss for the discount store chain which filed for 
protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in april 
was 415 per share the store lost 111 million or 38 cents a 
share in 1989s second quarter 
ames said this years secondquarter loss reflected 731 
million in nonrecurring charges including adjustment in amounts 
of accounts payable during the bankruptcy claims filing process a 
reserve for inventory markdowns and a writedown of certain 
management information systems installed as part of the zayres 
store consolidation 
the 794 million loss before nonrecurring charges was 
significantly less than we had anticipated because of 
betterthanexpected summer clearance sales said stephen l 
pistner ames chief executive officer 
ames reported total sales for the quarter of 5633 million a 
33 percent decline from last years adjusted total the 1989 
adjusted sales excluding sales from 221 stores closed during this 
years second quarter totalled 852 million 
pistner said the store started the second quarter in a poor 
instock position on seasonal merchandise and had suspended 
circular advertising the store resumed sending weekly circulars on 
july 29 because of dramatically improved stock positions and vendor 
shipments pistner said 
we essentially restarted the business during the quarter he 
said our most important priorities were to restore the flow of 
merchandise to our stores and to resume the advertising program we 
restored both

northwest airlines has applied to the us 
transportation department for special authority to enter the 
welltraveled australian market 
the application filed tuesday was made in the form of an 
emergency exemption it says the route should be reopened to 
applicants because it understood hawaiian airlines is preparing to 
abandon its australian service northwest said hawaiian is not 
booking flights to sydney after sept 21 
the northwest application did not specify flight frequencies 
schedules or airplane types that it would operate while the 
airline would prefer to fly nonstop between los angeles and sydney 
northwest spokesman robert gibbons said it also would be interested 
in service out of honolulu 
australia is the only major market in the pacific region that 
northwest does not serve in addition to hawaiian airlines united 
continental and american airlines have flights to and from 
australia 
american received its route authority last year from the 
transportation department northwest which had proposed nonstop 
service between los angeles and sydney lost out when an 
administrative law judge for the transportation department 
concluded that northwest already had a substantial presence in the 
pacific region and that for competitive reasons the available 
australian route should go to american 
its a good market particularly as a leisure market said 
northwests gibbons we didnt feel we should be excluded from an 
entire continent because we were big in japan those are two 
entirely separate markets 
meanwhile northwest chairman al checchi met tuesday with 
transportation secretary samuel skinner but neither the 
transportation department nor northwest would comment on the talks

oil futures prices were lower at midday today in 
the wake of a report showing the us supply of crude was up 
after the market had closed on tuesday the american petroleum 
institute issued its weekly report which said supplies of crude 
oil heating oil and gasoline were all higher 
in late morning trading today on the new york mercantile 
exchange light sweet crude had fallen 41 cents to 3035 per 
barrel for october delivery 
unleaded gasoline fell 20 cent to 9340 cents per gallon on 
october contracts while home heating oil fell 143 cents to 8160 
cents per gallon on october contracts 
contracts for later months were mixed on the petroleum futures 
but most of them were lower 
the october contract for natural gas was up to 1535 per 1000 
cubic feet compared with tuesdays close of 1525 
the oil futures market moved higher at the outset of trading 
today reflecting passimism about a quick end to the persian gulf 
crisis 
the market opened up a little bit because of the story that 
the iranian religious leader said that those opposed the us 
presence in the gulf would be fighting a holy war said 
annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc 
the ayatollah ali khamenei today said that moslems who die while 
fighting the us in the persian gulf would go to heaven as 
martyrs his comments came two days after iran and iraq restored 
diplomatic ties for the first time since their extended war of the 
1980s 
the market reacted quite nervously to that in london hittle 
said the new york market market opened up but then it came 
down i think maybe because of the api statistics 
the api reported distillate stockpiles rose from 1267 million 
barrels to 1317 million barrels for the week ending sept 7 while 
distillate production and imports were down the stockpile of 
distillates which include heating oil had been 1198 million 
barrels a year earlier api said 
crude oil imports were up to 69 million barrels per day from 
68 million barrels per day for the week while crude stockpiles 
were up to 3743 million barrels from 3722 million barrels a 
year earlier crude imports had been running at 65 million barrels 
per day while the stockpile had been 3386 million barrels 
gasoline stocks stood at 2111 million barrels up from 2105 
million barrels a week earlier but down from 2184 million barrels 
a year earlier gasoline imports were at 261000 barrels per day 
up from 192000 barrels per day a week earlier but down from 
272000 barrels per day a year earlier 
meanwhile gasoline prices at the pump were also up according 
to the latest figures from the american automobile association 
aaa reported late tuesday that a gallon of selfserve regular 
unleaded rose 21 cents to 1294 per gallon nationwide since last 
wednesday the average retail price was 219 cents higher than aug 
1 the day before iraq invaded kuwait and sent oil markets into a

lower in early trading today on the chicago board of trade as 
players took profits then took to the sidelines to await this 
afternoons monthly government crop report

trading was expected to contain a significantly larger corn crop 
estimate than last month but little change in the soybean harvest 
projection 
a survey of 32 grain analysts yielded an average corn crop 
estimate of 797 billion bushels compared with last months usda 
projection of 785 billion 
the analysts soybean crop projections averaged out to 184 
billion bushels unchanged from the governments august estimate 
john frazier director of agricultural commodities trading with 
gerald inc said the early decline in prices also reflected 
disappointment that president bush made no mention in his speech to 
congress tuesday of offering food export credits to the soviet 
union

we expected it to be dull anyway because this is report day 
but this is ridiculous he said

with the contract for delivery in september offered at 267 a 
bushel and the december contract at 283 corn was cent to 1

house speaker thomas s foley said today he 
expects budget negotiators from the bush administration and 
congress to agree by weeks end to slice 50 billion from the 
federal deficit 
i tend to be optimistic well reach a conclusion this week 
foley dwash told reporters 
negotiators returned to work at andrews air force base in 
suburban maryland for a sixth straight day hoping to overcome what 
they conceded were substantial remaining differences 
their mood turned optimistic tuesday as they moved toward 
agreement on a deal that could include higher medicare premiums and 
alcohol taxes and lower pentagon spending the package would save 
50 billion next year and 500 billion over the next five years 
according to officials involved in the talks the compromise 
plan was likely to include 25 billion in new taxes for next year 
including higher levies on alcohol and some luxury items such as 
fancy cars 
both sides said they were ready to accept larger monthly 
premiums for higherincome medicare recipients several proposals 
remain alive all pegging to family income the amount the elderly 
pay each month for medicare coverage of doctors bills the current 
rate 2860 monthly could increase as much as fourfold under one 
plan 
it would be the first time medicare benefits were linked to 
income 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
we fully expect there to be an agreement on a deficitreduction 
package 
in his speech to a joint session of congress tuesday night 
president bush said that in the absence of an agreement both 
houses should allow a straight upordown vote on a complete 500 
billion deficit reduction package not later than sept 28 
asked to elaborate today fitzwater said the administration 
would submit its own package for such a vote if talks break down 
in a related development the general accounting office said 
today that congress and the administration should not use the 
weakening economy or the persian gulf crisis as excuses to avoid a 
significant deficitreduction plan this year 
the congressional auditing agency offered the advice as it 
issued a report saying the deficit could reach a staggering 400 
billion next year if the economy slides into a recession 
in his speech bush urged the negotiators to reach agreement by 
citing the blows the middle east crisis has dealt to the us 
economy 
to my friends in congress together we must act this very 
month before the next fiscal year begins oct 1 to get 
americas economic house in order bush said the gulf 
situation helps us realize we are more economically vulnerable than 
we ever should be 
sen pete domenici rnm one of the negotiators predicted a 
deal is likely within three days i think now even though we 
have a long way to go i begin to see some daylight he said 
were on the path said house budget committee chairman leon 
panetta dcalif but he suggested the odds of success were only 
5050 
one official who asked to not be identified said democrats and 
republicans have agreed to increase taxes and fees by 25 billion 
next year and 130 billion over five years 
the two parties concurred that beer and wine taxes should be 
increased and that levies on luxury items such as expensive cars 
should rise the official said details remained unresolved 
a major split remained however over which other taxes to 
boost democrats saying they were protecting the lower and middle 
classes wanted a 10 percent surtax on the incomes of people 
earning more than 500000 annually 
they also were insisting on higher energy taxes including an 
11centpergallon increase in the current 9cent gasoline tax 
republicans were demanding a cut in the capital gains tax rate 
which they argue would raise revenues by prodding people to sell 
real estate and other property subject to the tax 
the two sides have dramatically narrowed their differences over 
defense cuts the official said they are discussing reducing the 
303 billion defense budget by 10 billion to 11 billion next year 
and by 170 billion to 200 billion over five years 
major differences remain over how deeply domestic programs 
should be pared participants said with proposals ranging between 
90 billion and 130 billion over five years 
unless a deficitcutting package is in place by oct 1 the 
grammrudman law will impose 100 billion in cuts on the 12 
trillion federal budget reductions of that degree would stagger 
most federal programs within weeks officials agree

a taxpayer bailout of commercial banks similar 
to the savings and loan rescue may be necessary if the economy 
slips into a recession congressional budget experts told congress 
today 
were on thin ice but the pants are still dry 
congressional budget office director robert reischauer told the 
senate banking committee 
he agreed with an earlier assessment by congressional auditors 
that the 132 billion federal deposit insurance corps bank 
insurance fund could face insolvency 
the general accounting office in the darkest assessment yet of 
the nations banking system said tuesday declining real estate 
values and risky bank loans might necessitate a taxpayer bailout 
for banks if the economy sours 
the fund is too thinly capitalized to deal with the potential 
for bank failures in the event of a recession said comptroller 
general charles bowsher such an event could exhaust the fund and 
require a taxpayer bailout 
asked today if he agreed with that assessment reischauer said 
there is a possiblity there yes 
even assuming the economy remains stable he said the country 
can expect 600 to 700 banks to fail over the next four years at a 
net loss to the government of 5 billion to 6 billion a year 
unless bank insurance premiums are raised that would reduce the 
annual balance of the fund to 4 billion he said 
legislation removing caps on how much the fdic can charge for 
deposit insurance was introduced today in both the senate and house 
by sen donald reigle dmich and rep frank annunzio dill 
government figures do not yet show a recession but many 
economists contend the economy turned downward when unemployment 
rose in july and again in august 
not since its birth during the great depression has the 
federal system of deposit insurance for commercial banks faced such 
a period of danger and uncertainty bowsher told the senate panel 
tuesday we have a lot of situations that could wipe the fund 
out 
with 129 bank failures so far in 1990 fdic chairman william 
seidman has estimated the insurance fund will incur a net loss of 
at least 2 billion this year atop losses of 51 billion in 1988 
and 1989 
bowsher said the situation is much worse including several 
billions of dollars in losses that banks have yet to report 
bowsher said the insurance fund could already be insolvent 
at least 15 of this years bank failures have been among the 
nations 200 largest banks an additional 20 of the largest 200 are 
expect to fail or require bailout assistance in the next year 
bowsher said he said total cost to the government would be 44 
billion to 66 billion 
in addition the gao said the fdic has a contingent liability 
of 8 billion for troubled loans now held by the acquirers of 
alreadyfailed banks in texas 
altogether more than 1100 of the nations 13200 commercial 
banks holding some 33 trillion in federally insured deposits are 
in financial difficulty the auditors said 
a recession would exacerbate their problems and could lead to 
their failing as well as the failure of other banks the gao 
auditors said in a 124page report 
utah sen jake garn the ranking republican on the senate 
banking panel said the banking crisis could be so severe that 
congress might have to reconvene in november to address it rather 
than wait until next year for the bush administrations 
recommendations 
deciding how to come up with the 63 billion the administration 
says it will have to spend on the sampl bailout in fiscal 1991 
beginning oct1 is a major factor behind the budget stalemate and 
president bushs reneging on his no new taxes pledge 
estimates of the total cost of the thrift cleanup over the next 
40 years have ranged from 500 billion to 1 trillion or 500 to 
10000 for every american family

edward lowe industries inc the maker 
of kitty litter brand cat box filler said wednesday the company 
has agreed to sell its marketing and manufacturing operations to an 
investment group 
terms of the sale were not disclosed the buyer is a group led 
by good capital co inc of new york and knightsbridge inc of 
chicago 
philip l smith a former chairman and chief executive officer 
at pillsbury and general foods corp wiake daily insulin injections 
to survive 
symptoms appear after the immune system has destroyed most of 
the insulinproducing beta cells of the pancreas 
scientists do not know what triggers that onslaught but they 
have found that the immune system begins attacking several specific 
targets long before the disease is diagnosed 
the new study identifies one of those targets as a beta cell 
enzyme called glutamic acid decarboxylase the substance is also 
found in brain cells where it helps make a chemical messenger 
brain cells use to communicate said steinunn baekkeskov 
its role in beta cells is not clearly understood said 
baekkeskov assistant professor of microbiology immunology and 
medicine at the hormone research institute of the university of 
california san francisco school of medicine 
she did the work with colleagues at the institute and scientists 
at the yale university school of medicine and in denmark they 
report the results in thursdays issue of the of the british 
journal nature 
the discovery should aid research into the substance by leading 
to much more abundant supplies of it either from brain tissue or 
from genetic engineering she said 
further research on the enzyme may lead to therapies that 
prevent diabetes by stopping the harmful immune system attack 
without suppressing the immune system generally she said 
but that potential depends on whether the attack on the enzyme 
plays any role in causing the disease which is not yet known she 
said 
other future research can follow up indications that a blood 
test based on the enzyme can help identify people on the way to 
developing diabetes she said 
the test looks for proteins of the attacking immune system 
called antibodies that are specifically aimed at the enzyme the 
antibodies appear in 80 percent of newly diagnosed diabetics and 
they have been detected up to several years before symptoms of the 
disease appear researchers said 
antibodies to other targets appear before the diagnosis too 
but antibodies against the enzyme may be the best predictor of 
later diabetes commented mark atkinson assistant professor of 
pathology at the university of florida college of medicine in 
gainesville 
the enzyme antibodies must be studied in more people to better 
assess their predictive power he said 
dr george eisenbarth of the joslin diabetes center in boston 
said combining the enzyme antibody test with other antibody tests 
may improve the ability to predict insulindependent diabetes 
currently there is no proven way to prevent the disease in 
people who show diabetesrelated antibodies given the anxiety 
caused by a positive test result baekkeskov said early prediction 
probably will not be a significant benefit until a prevention 
method is found 
but eisenbarth said early prediction is useful for finding 
people to participate in studies of therapies to prevent the 
disease 
the american diabetes association recently endorsed predictive 
blood tests for close relatives of insulindependent diabetics as a 
means of identifying possible participants for prevention studies

toxic waste for disposal within their borders than they ship out 
the net importer states as they call themselves say they 
might sue the us environmental protection agency to enforce its 
own toxic waste regulations or as congress to change laws 
they want epa to crack down on states that have failed to build 
disposal sites or to make reciprocal arrangements for handling of 
toxic waste generated inside their borders 
all states must share the pain of hazardous waste disposal 
said william child illinois environmental agency manager 
epa officials said all 50 states and the district of columbia 
met last octobers deadline for submitting proposed plans under a 
1986 program but only 38 were approved by the federal agency 
russ wyer epa director of waste management said the states had 
delivered a strong message that he intends to take back to 
washington 
we will evaluate sanctions that could start being imposed in 
1991 wyer said the agency is still sorting the good states from 
the bad states 
under epa rules the agency could withhold superfund cleanup 
funds from those states that have failed to build toxic waste 
disposal sites or reach an agreement with another state in their 
region for a site 
but wyer said that just 20 states are qualified to receive 
superfund money in the first palce and that the epa was not 
prepared to withhold funds from a cleanup program that involves 
public health

manufacturing usa the companys automaking arm 
the base cost will be 7999 up from 7399 
the introduction of the model at nissans smyrna tenn plant 
rounds out a new generation of cars and trucks offered by the 
japanese manufacturer since 1988 
with the introduction of seven new models over the past two 
years nissans commitment to design and technology leadership is 
clear said robert thomas vice president and division manager 
for nissan motor corp in the usa the companys sales arm 
nissan wants to upgrade the image of the sentra to attract more 
affluent customers without losing its core market of entrylevel 
buyers thomas said we would like to get basically the best of 
the buyers that need to price in the 8000 to 12000 range 
almost 25 percent of the market is in that range and those are the 
buyers that we need to get thomas said 
to that end nissan redesigned the sentra and is offering more 
models with new features such as antilock brakes 
this new sentra allows us to change the sentra imagery of the 
last few years thomas said

the sentras as well as pickup trucks are built by 3700 
workers at smyrna 40 miles southeast of downtown nashville 
workers finished producing the 1990 sentras july 5 and then 
switched machinery to produce the redesigned new model 
the two and fourdour sentras have a 16liter fourcylinder 
engine with 110 horsepower the twodoor ser model has a 
20liter 140horsepower engine 
the sentra had an internal launch aug 6 but was not shown to 
the public until wednesday 
the smyrna plant could produce 180000 units a year but will 
build about 165000 of the 1991 model benefield said 
sentra whose basic design has been unchanged in five years is 
the last nissan model to undergo a redesign in the last two model 
years 
among other models nissans 240sx line will have a new 
frontend appearance a 16valve engine and fourwheel drive 
steering in some 1991 models 
the stanza will be basically unchanged while the maxima will 
upgrade its standard audio system include quieter air conditioning 
and newstyle leather interior in some models 
the 300zx lineup adds optional drivers side air bags the model 
also adds a twoseater coupe without ttops 
nissans fourdoor pathfinder makes rear antilock brakes

moroccos creditor governments have reached an 
agreement that will allow the north african country to reschedule 
foreign debt payments by up to 20 years the french finance 
ministry said wednesday 
it is the first time the lenders have offered such favorable 
terms to a highly indebted middleincome country previous 
recipients of such concessions have been much poorer than morocco 
the agreement was reached at a meeting tuesday of the paris 
club a group of officials from creditor governments that meets 
occasionally in the french capital to examine debt rescheduling 
requests from cashstrapped countries 
the ministry said the creditor governments agreed to let morocco 
spread repayments on part of its official development aid loans 
over 20 years and rescheduled debt service payments on other 
credits over a 15year period 
the ministry gave no indication of the amount of rescheduled 
debt 
morocco is the most debtburdened country in north africa and 
the middle east after egypt with total foreign debt estimated at 
20 billion 
the paris club rescheduling agreement marks the implementation 
of a strategy initiated at julys economic summit meeting in 
houston 
at that time leaders of the seven biggest industrialized 
countries asked the paris club to lengthen its repayment periods 
for middleincome countries that have implemented strong economic 
reform programs 
moroccos last appearance before the paris club was in october 
1989 when creditor governments agreed to roll over some 940 
million of debt over 10 years including a fiveyear grace period

concerned about the fiscal impact of the gulf 
crisis the government wednesday presented a 1991 budget proposal 
calling for a cut in the deficit and a 65 percent rise in spending 
the budget envisions government spending of 1278 trillion 
francs or about 240 billion up from 12 trillion francs or 
about 235 billion in 1990 
louis le pensec the government spokesman told reporters the 
government had trimmed its proposed spending plan for next year by 
8 billion francs or 15 billion below the initial spending 
target 
he said this cutback was made as a precaution against 
uncertainties about the world economy and the price of oil in the 
wake of the persian gulf crisis 
the draft budget calls for the deficit to fall to 80 billion 
francs or 15 billion from 90 billion francs or 169 billion 
projected for 1990 
the budget will cut the tax rate on reinvested corporate profits 
to 34 percent from 37 percent in a move that will save an estimated 
8 billion francs for companies 
to encourage companies to spend the saving on productive 
investment as opposed to financial speculation the draft budget 
boosts the tax rate on financial capital gains by companies to 23 
percent from 19 percent 
another key measure will cut the top value added tax rate to 22 
percent from 25 percent 
le pensec said the cut will take effect sept 13 for cars and 
sept 17 for other products this reduction will help to offset 
inflationary pressure from rising oil prices which are projected 
in the budget at 25 per barrel 
le pensec said the budget anticipates an annual inflation rate 
of 28 percent up from the 25 percent that had been forecast for 
both 1990 and 1991 in april before the iraqkuwait crisis 
rekindled inflationary fears 
gross domestic product is expected to rise 27 percent down 
from april forecasts of 32 percent growth

japanese purchases of us trophies such 
as rockefeller center and columbia pictures had slacked off until a 
tokyo tycoon bought pebble beach co with its exquisite golf 
courses and lone cypress tree 
but dont be deceived by fewer highprofile deals the japanese 
appetite for us investment remains powerful despite japanese 
government pressure to tone down purchases and a nearly 40 percent 
drop in the value of stocks in that country this year 
in fact the japanese are making more us investments than 
ever and more sophisticated ones as they become confident enough 
to look past bluechip targets 
theyre becoming insiders in the united states said jack 
barthell a managing partner of the los angeles accounting firm 
kenneth leventhal amp co which closely tracks japanese investment 
nowhere is that more apparent than in real estate leventhals 
specialty having moved from office buildings to hotels to resorts 
and golf courses the japanese are now developing property often 
in partnership with us companies here and abroad barthell said 
while their total real estate investment fell by 11 percent from 
1988 to 1989 to 148 billion the volume of transactions was 
way up barthell said 
the japanese also are moving from primary investment areas such 
as honolulu los angeles san francisco and new york to other 
metro areas and the suburbs 
a leventhal study showed that fourfifths of total investment 
was in the primary areas in 1985 by last year the figure was 
about onethird 
were finding the very distinct move from the archetypical 
downtown trophy office tower to developing singlefamily 
residential in the suburbs or even apartments barthell said 
another new target zone is europe where japanese real estate 
investment last year was twice the level of 1988 and nearly 4 
times that of 1987 according to clark whitehill a british 
accounting firm 
a prominent example of the trends is the japanese subsidiary 
shuwa investments corp which owns 27 billion in us real 
estate shuwa led the charge into office towers buying the itt 
corp headquarters in new york the us news and world report 
building in washington the arco plaza in los angeles and the 
quaker tower in chicago 
but during the past year shuwa made different kinds of 
headlines announcing plans to build luxury apartments in los 
angeles forming a 154 million partnership with los angelesbased 
tishman west cos in a london office building 
many observers say the japanese were surprised last year by the 
harshness of us reaction to highprofile deals those included 
mitsubishi estate cos 846 million purchase of a controlling 
stake in new yorks rockefeller center and sony corps 34 
billion purchase of columbia pictures entertainment inc 
despite the negative publicity the japanese still appear ready 
to buy us landmarks if the circumstances are right 
those acquainted with this months deal for pebble beach where 
a round of golf can cost 175 and the scenic 17mile drive winds 
past the oftenphotographed lone cypress say competition was 
vicious between two final bidders both japanese 
finally businessman minoru isutani bought the monterey property 
for more than 800 million from a partnership including beverly 
hills billionaire marvin davis 
but davis asking price was much higher some say 12 billion 
and isutani is a special case because he owns an empire of golf 
clubs and sporting goods companies in japan and abroad he can 
exploit pebble beach with crossmemberships and marketing tieins 
of all sorts 
so even the topdollar price for pebble beach is not interpreted 
as a sign of a new rush for megadeals 
the situations where a guy walked around manhattan or waikiki 
with a wad of money in his pocket and bought the first overpriced 
property are gone said daniel schwartz managing director at 
ulmer brothers inc a new york investment bank specializing in 
deals involving the japanese 
research at ulmer brothers shows the trend extends beyond real 
estate to investing in and buying out us businesses in the first 
half of 1990 the company counted 103 such mergers and 
acquisitions that compared with 74 in the first half of 1989 and 
47 in the same period in 1988 
at the same time the average deal size fell from 162 million 
in 1988 to 51 million this year that reflects the fact that the 
japanese increasingly are taking minority stakes in us 
businesses often to provide new capital schwartz said 
a lot of us companies have found themselves in trouble and 
the ones with money are overseas the japanese and europeans he 
said 
the japanese also have become quicker to back away from 
overpriced deals schwartz noted whitman corp had hoped to get 
700 million for its hussmann corp commercial refrigerator unit in 
st louis then pulled it off the market when sanyo electric cos 
bid came in substantially lower he said 
similarly hilton hotels corp removed its forsale sign 
this year after bids came in far below the 120 per share some 
analysts expected several japanese companies including the 
leisure and real estate conglomerate eie international had been 
interested 
nowadays japanese investments in midwest steel automotive and 
other manufacturing industries are being praised by such groups as 
the indiana chamber of commerce for upgrading the economy of what 
once was the rust belt 
even in hawaii where japanese investments totaling 77 billion 
have many residents worried that the character of their small state 
will be ruined some deals are welcomed 
in one such case japanese brewing giant suntory ltd bought 
control of the princeville resort on kauai in june after the 
australian owner qintex went bankrupt that allowed construction 
to resume on a stalled luxury hotel project 
still the huge island resort deals have drawn more protests 
than praise and theyve been strengthened by a trend many 
hawaiians find disturbing japanese companies buying property in 
honolulus older neighborhoods to develop large singlefamily homes 
in reaction honolulu this year passed a law requiring 
nonresident aliens to report real estate deals sponsors said it 
will help the city develop regulations to control speculative 
foreign investments similar measures have been proposed at the 
state level 
the japanese with their traditions of formality deference and 
courtesy were keenly aware of american critics even before the 
deals for rockefeller center and columbia barthell noted 
but should they be some say the criticism is largely 
unwarranted and emotional 
thats especially true when the assets being purchased are 
property not technology or trade secrets said david germany 
senior economist for the morgan stanley amp co securities firm in 
new york 
theyre not taking away the farm theyre taking away 
ownership of a place where rich people play golf germany said 
if we cant sell pebble beach what can we sell

in the bidding staterun skoda is planning to become a joint stock

grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade ahead of a government crop

higher and wheat futures finished narrowly mixed in light trading

unchanged from the governments august estimate as expected 
growing conditions have been largely favorable in the midwest

entertainment industry interests via its stable of record companies 
including rca and arista on wednesday revised upward its previous

partner to launch another us record label woessner said

company spokesmen and strike leaders said

offshore contractors council to organize a ballot on union 
recognition and the refusal to reinstate 1500 workers who were 
fired for striking

disaster in the piper alpha explosion and fire in july 1988 which 
killed 167 men

a federal appeals court on wednesday reversed 
its own ruling and affirmed the conviction of kansas city developer 
john a kroh jr on 13 bank fraud charges 
in a 63 ruling the full eighth us circuit court of appeals 
overturned an earlier threejudge panels ruling that had reversed 
the convictions on all 13 counts 
kroh former president of kroh brothers development co once 
one of the largest developers in the kansas city area was 
convicted in 1988 of conspiracy to submit false statements to 
federally insured banks making false statements to federally 
insured banks wire fraud interstate transportation of money in 
execution of a scheme to defraud and possessing such money 
kroh was sentenced to concurrent maximum sentences on all 
counts the longest of which was 10 years 
his trial focused on his efforts to get 23 million in loans 
for himself and his brother george kroh from three lending 
institutions according to testimony the krohs submitted inflated 
financial statements to get the loans 
kroh brothers was one of the areas biggest real estate 
companies until it collapsed into bankruptcy in february 1987 in 
1986 kroh brothers owned 170 properties worth 500 million to 1 
billion 
in his appeal kroh contended that the jury was misled by 
federal prosecutors who used a guilty plea by george kroh to imply 
that john kroh was guilty too john kroh also maintained that 
prosecution witnesses were allowed to discuss as fact an alleged 
checkkiting scheme by john kroh that was never proved 
the appeals court said wednesday that it found all of john 
krohs contentions to be without merit noting that george krohs 
guilty plea was not presented in an inflammatory way and was not 
unduly emphasized 
it is obvious from the evidence that john kroh in a desperate 
scheme to keep kbdc afloat was knowingly defrauding banks and that 
george kroh was actively participating in the fraudulent scheme 
the court said 
dissenting were chief judge donald p lay and circuit judges 
frank j magill and theodore mcmillian they said the majority was 
wrong in allowing the government to use as one of its chief points 
the guilty plea of george kroh 
john kroh did not get a fair trial the dissent said this 
dissent is written vigorously with the hope that trial judges 
exercise great care and oversight when the government attempts to 
use guilty pleas of coconspirators when the governments 
obvious purpose in calling a coconspirator is not to adduce 
necessary evidence but simply to introduce a guilty plea which 
directly implicates a defendant the plea should be excluded 
john kroh is detained at the federal work camp at duluth minn 
where he has served about 20 months george kroh served about two 
months of a threeyear sentence and was released before his 
brothers trial

gulf states utilities will not get a second chance 
to convince state regulators that its customers should pay an 
additional 14 billion in nuclear plant construction costs the 
texas supreme court ruled wednesday 
consumer representatives praised the decision while the 
beaumontbased utility said it will continue fighting 
we have several legal avenues open to us and we will do 
whatever is necessary to keep this open said susan gilley gsu 
spokeswoman 
she said the utility will file a motion for a rehearing before 
the state supreme court and if that fails will appeal to the us 
supreme court 
the public utility commission in an earlier rate case had 
allowed gulf states to put into electric rates 16 billion of 
construction costs at the river bend nuclear power plant in 
louisiana 
the commission left 145 billion in costs pending at the time 
gulf states wanted to return to the puc to try to add these 
costs to customers bills 
but that move was challenged by some southeast texas cities 
served by the utility who said it was unfair for the utility to 
have another chance to prove those expenditures were prudent 
construction costs 
a trial court agreed with the cities but that decision was 
overturned by the austinbased 3rd court of appeals 
on wednesday the texas supreme court agreed with the trial 
court and the cities 
we agree that the public utility regulatory scheme set forth 
by the legislature provides that once is enough justice lloyd 
doggett wrote in the 72 majority 
grace casstevens an attorney who represented several towns that 
fought gulf states said the courts decision was exactly what we 
had been urging 
this is a real victory for ratepayers said another 
attorney jim boyle who represented the coalition of cities for 
affordable utility rates in the case said 
the supreme court agreed that consumers should not have to pay 
for imprudent costs of building a nuclear power plant these costs 
must be borne by the stockholders boyle said

a late flurry of buying helped stock prices post 
a moderate gain today in a quiet session 
analysts said traders appeared to respond positively to the 
tough line taken by president bush in his televised comments 
tuesday night on the crisis in the persian gulf 
bush seemed to commit the united states to whatever measures 
might be necessary to thwart iraqs effort to annex kuwait 
however investors were evidently in no rush to bid up stocks 
until they could see more evidence of the likely future course of 
the economy 
the monthly report due out friday on the producer price index of 
finished goods is expected to show some of the unsettling effects 
of the surge in oil prices that followed iraqs invasion on aug 2

oil companies are pleased to hear president bush 
calling for more domestic exploration but they said wednesday its 
going take more than words from washington before they step up 
their drilling 
the american petroleum institute said bushs support for 
increased exploration and oil company tax breaks echoes some of 
what the industry has been asking for but it remains to be seen 
whether congress will go along 
in a televised speech tuesday night bush asked lawmakers to 
speed the development of oil reserves in alaska and increase 
incentives for oil and gas exploration 
in general he was saying what we would like to hear because 
our industry is in the doldrums said james merna spokesman for 
the independent petroleum association of america but he just 
didnt come up with the specifics 
environmental groups did not wait for specifics to blast bushs 
call for more oil wells including the arctic national wildlife 
refuge in alaska believed to contain the nations largest 
untapped onshore reserve of crude oil 
hes an old oil man and all he can think of in terms of the 
shortage is to drill more said dru schmidtperkins conservation 
analyst for the energy conservation coalition in washington 
bush shows few signs of supporting the conservation measures 
that are touted by environmentalists as the solution to cutting 
us dependence on foreign oil ms schmidtperkins said 
the oil industry says more exploration is part of the answer to 
reducing americas addiction to overseas crude but despite the 
rapid rise in oil prices that followed iraqs invasion of kuwait on 
aug 2 and the subsequent boycott of their oil there has been no 
rush to find more oil 
the major oil companies say they would need to see higher oil 
prices in a more stable market for a sustained period before they 
would bolster their drilling plans majors account for a small 
proportion of the wells that are drilled domestically but they 
tend to go after larger pools of oil in more expensive projects 
well have to look at prices today plus what is a reasonable 
outlook for prices in two to five years and even longer said 
michael e thompson a spokesman for amoco corp many of these 
projects are five or 10 or 20year projects 
the major oil companies have not even been able to see yet what 
the persian gulf crisis will do to their earnings in the short run 
he said 
smaller independent oil companies drill about 85 percent of the 
nations wells according to ipaa which represents smaller 
companies its members could use some tax breaks to get out of the 
economic slump that set in when the price of oil collapsed in the 
mid 1980s 
independent oil operators used to borrow cash for drilling but 
many of the companies and the banks that loaned them money have now 
gone under said lloyd n unsell acting president of ipaa the 
number of independent producers has fallen from about 13000 to 
4500 since the bust and unsell said tax incentives might be 
necessary before investors will decide to pump money into oil deals 
although unsell hopes bushs remarks and the persian gulf 
standoff might change the minds of those in congress who oppose the 
industry he called it a shame you have to have a crisis to get 
the government to consider some of the energy options we have here 
at home that have been begging for several years 
the oil industry believes congress has tilted toward the 
environmental side when oil from overseas stayed so cheap for so 
many years even though companies say they can produce oil without 
undue harm to the environment 
ms schmidtperkins points to the massive oil spill caused by 
the exxon valdez as evidence to the contrary 
drilling in places like the arctic is extremely dangerous 
she said theyll go in there and drill like crazy and if they 
find oil theyll have to find a way to get it out of there

sears roebuck and co on wednesday unveiled a 
frequentbuyer program aimed at boosting retail sales by rewarding 
shoppers who charge merchandise on their sears credit cards

release 
sears said it succesfully had tested the bonus club concept at 
16 stores in the baltimore and pittsburgh areas since late 1989 
sears the nations largest retailer is fighting to boost its 
retail sales and reverse a slide in market share

national contract negotiations between general 
motors corp and the united auto workers union on wednesday were 
percolating according to a uaw official but there was no word 
on how much progress was being made 
things are moving said the official who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity he refused to provide details 
there were reports that uaw president owen bieber and gm 
chairman robert stempel met wednesday morning but sources on both 
sides of the bargaining declined to confirm or deny that the 
highlevel meeting took place 
talks bogged down monday over the critical issue of job 
security but picked up tuesday and wednesday the official said 
the union has said for months that guaranteeing employment for its 
members is the top issue in the current round of talks 
gm spokesman john maciarz had no comment on the talks wednesday 
he said however that he knew of no official news blackout 
sometimes especially late in the bargaining process a news 
blackout is an indication that talks are moving rapidly toward 
agreement 
negotiators were working against a midnight friday national 
contract expiration the same time as uaw contracts with ford motor 
co and chrysler corp die more than 450000 active workers 
300000 of them at gm are covered by the three agreements 
talks between the union and ford and chrysler have been put on 
hold pending the outcome of the gm negotiations the union wants to 
use a contract ratified by gm workers as a pattern for agreements 
with ford and chrysler 
at gm negotiators have been focusing on economic issues in the 
final days of talks uaw officials said tentative agreements have 
been reached on nearly all noneconomic issues including legal 
assistance and military leave provisions 
analysts say a strike remains a likely possibility but the 
specter of japanese competition in the auto market looms large in 
the talks even a short strike could cut inventories of cars below 
optimum levels and push customers toward japanese products which 
now account for nearly 30 percent of the newcar market

arco alaska inc and its parent 
company atlantic richfield co will pay the state about 285 
million under an agreement to settle part of a 13yearold suit 
over oil royalties gov steve cowper said wednesday 
the payment settles involvement by arco in what became known as 
the amerada hess case after the first company on an 
alphabetical list of defendants 
alaska officials contend the state was shorted 902 million in 
royalties for oil from the prudhoe bay and kuparuk river fields 
between 1977 and 1986 
the state charged the oil companies often undervalued the north 
slope crude therefore paying the state less than it should have 
received 
cowper said it would be difficult to calculate what the state 
may have lost by agreeing to settle out of court because the 
procedure would require a number of projections including 
anticipating the likely outcome of appeals 
if your question is how much the state gave up youd have to 
be a fortuneteller the governor said 
the state is continuing its case against the nine or 10 other 
defendants and a trial is expected in about a year cowper said 
the first company to settle amerada hess corp paid the state 
310000 last year 
the settlement announced wednesday ends a long and arduous 
process of negotiations with arco the governor said indicating 
the settlement has been in the works since march 
the reason the case was settled was that it was clear to arco 
that the states case was in good shape he said we do have 
ongoing negotiations with other companies 
twentyfive percent of the payment will go into the alaska 
permanent fund with the rest headed for a statutory budget reserve 
the governor said 
arco said in a statement that the payment would result in an 
aftertax charge of 25 million in the companys third quarter 
besides the payment the agreement provides a methodology for 
calculating future oil royalties on most of the companys current 
alaskan north slope leases the statement said 
this methodology is is intended to reduce the potential for 
future conflict and provide an effective means of resolving 
issues said william e wade jr vice chairman of arco alaska 
as a result of the settlement of negotiations substantial 
progress was made not only in resolving the royalty issues in 
dispute but also in promoting the development and nurturing of 
better communications and constructive working relationships 
between arco and the state of alaska he said in the statement

president accused of numerous fraud schemes were expelled from 
the national association of securities dealers wednesday and fined 
a total of 250000 
without admitting or denying any wrongdoing corna and co inc 
and its owner and president david a corna agreed to the 
disciplinary action as part of a settlement with the nasd a 
selfregulating organization empowered by congress to oversee the 
overthecounter securities market

unauthorized trades in clients accounts on hundreds of occasions 
between 1985 and 1989 playing fast and loose with its records 
including creating two bogus customer accounts falsifying 
documents and not cooperating with an nasd investigation 
parking is an illegal scheme to conceal the true ownership of 
securities by buying them with the understanding that the original 
owner will buy them back with no loss to the person they were 
parked with 
the nasds cleveland business conduct committee said the 
conduct at issue represents some of the most serious violations of 
the federal securities laws and the rules of the association that 
can be a committed by a member 
the disciplinary committee also accused corna of forging the 
signatures of several customers and former employees 
the firm was censured expelled from membership in the nasd and 
fined 100000 corna also was censured barred from associating 
with any nasd member in any capacity and fined 150000

moving to end allegedly unfair pricing by 
transpacific shipping firms the federal maritime commission on 
wednesday announced it has levied 205 million in penalties 
against nine companies 
james j carey the commissions acting chairman said the 
penalty settlement is by far the largest in the agencys 29year 
history 
it is five times larger than any previous penalty and indeed 
larger than the commissions annual budget of some 15 million 
carey said 
the commissions action is aimed at ending a practice in the 
shipping industry of filing tariffs with the commission then 
privately paying rebates to attract cargo business commission 
sources said 
the primary value of this matter lies elsewhere than in 
dollars carey said this settlement and its effects will 
significantly change for the better the ocean transportation system 
in the pacific trade

grain analysts predicted a sharp drop in corn futures prices 
after the government released a harvest projection wednesday that 
exceeded nearly everyones expectations 
corn futures posted modest losses on the chicago board of trade 
ahead of the monthly agriculture department report while soybean 
prices rose and wheat finished narrowly mixed 
on other commodity markets nearterm cotton futures rose 
sharply oil futures were mixed precious metals advanced cattle 
futures fell and most pork futures rose 
in lightvolume grain trading in chicago wheat futures settled 
1 cent lower to cent higher with the contract for delivery in 
september at 266 a bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower 
with september at 239 a bushel oats were unchanged to 1 cents 
lower with september at 111 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 3 
cents higher with september at 628 a bushel 
after the close the usda released a crop report estimating the 
1990 us corn crop at 812 billion bushels up 8 percent from last 
years crop and 3 percent more than the government forecast a month 
ago 
analysts prereport expectations averaged 797 billion bushels 
vs last months usda estimate of 785 billion and last years 
harvest of 753 billion bushels 
grain analysts said the surprisingly high number apparently 
reflected the ideal growing conditions that prevailed in the 
midwest this summer until the past two weeks when the weather 
turned unusually dry the crop report was based on crop conditions 
as of sept 1 
richard feltes director of commodities research at the 
chicagobased futures brokerage refco inc said 1990 will go down 
as one of only a handful of years since 1950 in which precipitation 
in the corn belt states during june july and august exceeded the 
norm 
he said the usda was very bold to raise its corn production 
estimate so dramatically with only a small fraction of the crop 
harvested 
this suggests that the crop on subsequent reports could be 
even larger feltes said were going to have to find a lower 
price to encourage consumption 
walter spilka of smith barney harris upham amp co said corn 
futures probably would open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower 
thursday in reaction to the report 
but spilka said the usda forecast may be too optimistic in light 
of the recent dry weather he said next months corn estimate may 
be smaller not larger than wednesdays 
the crop may end up near 805 billion bushels spilka said 
normal rainfall should return to the corn belt in the latter 
half of next week according to a national weather service forecast 
released after the close 
the usda estimated soybean production at 184 billion bushels 
unchanged from the governments august estimate as expected 
steady rain in the mississippi delta region has helped the 
soybean crop there this week but hurt earlyblooming cotton 
resulting in a sharp increase in october cotton futures on the new 
york cotton exchange 
some traders had expected the delta to produce cotton early 
enough to be delivered against the october contract but those hopes 
have been washed out with the rain said ernest simon cotton 
specialist with prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
cotton futures settled 05 cent lower to 173 cents higher with 
october up 173 cents at 7390 cents a pound 
crude oil and gasoline futures rose moderately but heating oil 
futures ended mixed on the new york mercantile exchange in volatile 
trading that followed the latest reports from the persian gulf 
light sweet crude oil finished 21 cents to 69 cents higher with 
october at 3097 a barrel wholesale heating oil was 73 cent 
lower to 18 cent higher with october at 8259 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 23 cent to 41 cent higher with october at 
9384 cents a gallon 
higher crude prices fueled inflation fears and helped lift gold 
and silver futures on new yorks commodity exchange 
gold settled 150 higher across the board with september at 
38210 a troy ounce silver was 23 cents to 24 cents higher with 
september at 4801 a troy ounce 
profittaking pressured cattle futures on the chicago mercantile 
exchange but pork futures settled mostly higher boosted by strong 
gains in pork bellies after a weekly exchange report showed a 
largerthanexpected drawdown of frozen stocks last week 
live cattle futures ended 22 cent lower to 10 cent higher with 
october at 7885 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent to 33 
cent lower with september at 8760 cents a pound live hogs were 
30 cent lower to 22 cent higher with october at 5067 cents a

a high school band played and k mart 
corp chairman joseph e antonini beamed as a tarpaulin dropped 
wednesday revealing a new storefront logo that will mark the 
discounters remodeled outlets 
the big red k on the pale gray facade will signify the stores 
that have been done over in k marts 23 billion 5year 
renovation plan antonini told a news conference in the parking lot 
of the oak park prototype store 
the familiar turquoise mart following the k has been replaced 
with a white script mart angled upward within a bright red k 
workmen unveiled a similar logo on the streetside sign as antonini 
and others spoke 
we thought the signature within the k was a good counterpoint 
to the aggressiveness and assertiveness of the k said ken love 
partner and creative director at anspach grossman portugal inc 
of new york which designed the logo 
a few customers paused with their carts in the lot to watch the 
new symbol unveiled 
looks more compact looks neater said dolores gildenpfenig 
comparing the new logo to the one that has remained virtually 
unaltered since the former ss kresge co opened the first k mart 
discount store in 1962 in garden city mich 
her husband harold gildenpfenig said the couple were frequent 
shoppers at the oak park k mart and a new logo would make little 
difference 
the change in the logo isnt the essential thing its the 
message that the company is doing something different said mike 
wellman k mart vice president of marketing who was among 
executives mingling in the parking lot 
k mart had announced its plans earlier in the year to remodel 
all its stores along the lines of the oak park store with its 
brighter lights and wider aisles 
anthony camilletti of the berkley store design company jon 
greenberg amp associates said jga designers talked with k mart 
officials while helping to design the oak park store last year 
about developing a storefront that would incorporate a new logo 
it will have a direct impact that there is something different 
about this store they will most definitely recognize a 
difference camilletti said 
the new retail identity symbol will appear on existing 
stores as they are refurbished and on all newly built stores the 
retailer currently operates 2331 k mart stores throughout the 
country

the canadian auto workers union on wednesday 
rejected an offer made by ford motor co of canada as a strike 
deadline loomed on friday 
the offer doesnt go close to forming the basis of a 
settlement said union leader bob white adding that a strike by 
12800 ford workers at midnight friday night looked inevitable 
ive been here before and ive seen things move quickly but 
you would have to be extremely optimistic to think that we could do 
this by friday midnight white said during a break in 
negotiations 
even if we fall into a strike we will stay here the last 
thing we want to do is walk away 
the union has a 40 million strike fund to support a long 
strike white said 
company spokesman jim hartford declined to provide details of 
the offer but said it covered economic elements such as wages 
vacations and costofliving allowances 
we believe it can form the basis of a settlement hartford 
said wednesday morning 
the talks began aug 5 after the union picked ford as its strike 
target any contract reached will serve as the model for later

in a case that breaks legal ground advanced 
micro devices corp has lost a patent infringement lawsuit brought 
by another computer chip company brooktree corp of san diego 
a us district court jury on tuesday found that the 
sunnyvalebased amd violated three of brooktrees patents and also 
infringed on the companys rights to protect chip layout designs 
under a 1984 law 
the judge and jury in san diego have not yet set damages 
brooktree has asked for more than millions of dollars said 
company president james bixby 
amd said it was shocked by the ruling and planned to appeal as 
soon as damages were determined it also has its own patent 
infringement suit pending against brooktree 
we did not copy brooktrees designs said amds president 
and chief operating officer anthony previte amd absolutely does 
not condone violations of intellectual property rights 
the brooktree suit has been closely watched as the first major 
test of the semiconductor chip protection act of 1984 which made 
illegal the use of photographic techniques and other methods to 
copy the intricate circuitry of computer chips 
brooktrees 1988 suit initially accused amd of illegally copying 
the layout of its chips it was then expanded to include 
infringement of three patents after brooktree received them the 
following year 
the suit covers chips known as color palettes which control the 
display of colors on computer screens color palettes make up less 
than 1 percent of amds business 
amd entered the market for palette chips first but brooktree 
later introduced an improved design amd emulated brooktrees 
approach but said it did so through a legal procedure known as 
reverse engineering

oil futures rose in choppy trading wednesday 
and after five straight closes over 30 per barrel traders 
wondered whether crude was settling into a higher range of prices 
thats what everybodys wondering are we starting to form a 
base here said annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with 
shearson lehman brothers inc 
light sweet crude for october delivery closed 21 cents higher at 
3097 per barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
crude has closed over 30 per barrel every day since sept 6 
despite a lack of major news from the middle east that would be 
perceived as bullish 
so far there has been no repeat of the sharp tumble that 
knocked oil out of the 30 range three days after it hit that 
plateau last month for the first time in nearly five years 
on wednesday oil opened higher on news that irans spiritual 
leader the ayatollah ali khamenei considers the mideast struggle 
against the united states to be a holy war that will enable moslems 
who are killed to go to heaven as martyrs 
it fell as traders contemplated an earlier report indicating 
us supplies are adequate for the time being then rallied in the 
afternoon when speculators decided it was time to start buying 
october futures again 
the spread between october and november contracts became narrow 
enough that some speculators decided to hedge their bets by selling 
november oil and buying october oil hittle said 
they think the spread will widen she said 
crude oil contracts for later months also moved higher 
wednesday with the rises progressively larger further into the 
future 
that was a sign that traders think the oil crisis might persist 
although for the near term there will be enough crude on hand to 
meet demand hittle said 
during much of wednesdays trading prices were held down in 
response to the american petroleum institutes report a day earlier 
indicating that supplies of crude gasoline and home heating oil 
were higher than in the previous week 
among other petroleumbased products traded on the merc 
unleaded gasoline for october closed up 24 cent at 9384 cents per 
gallon and later contract months were up 
home heating oil was down 44 cent at 8259 cents per gallon 
while later months were mixed 
natural gas for october rose to 1543 per 1000 cubic feet

frozen for nearly 100 years in the same 
position his ear pricked up to the sound of a gramophone nipper 
the rca dog is coming to life and gaining a smartalecky sidekick 
in television commercials airing for the first time sunday the 
internationally known rca mascot and his new companion will promote 
a new line of home theatre color television models and a lineup 
of 8mm camcorders rcas parent company announced wednesday 
the two dogs will serve as an appropriate balancing act as 
we continue to expand our customer base said martin j holleran 
president and chief executive officer of thomson consumer 
electronics american sales and marketing divison 
the younger dog is the focus for the new designs and advanced 
features of todays rca products while nipper represents rcas 
traditional values of reliability and ease of use he said 
thompson is a frenchowned company that bought the rca and ge 
home electronics lines from general electric co in 1987 
executives of thompson wrestled with the idea of bringing nipper 
back for advertisements for several years said spokesman greg 
zehner 
its just that we couldnt figure out how to make him work 
best he said it was too dated 
ammirati amp puris a new york advertising firm suggested earlier 
this year that the company use a live dog to represent nipper and 
find a lookalike puppy to play the more modern role 
we knew we had to update him so we invented this little 
whippersnapper to be his foil said david fowler an associate 
creative director at ammirati amp puris who worked on the new 
campaign 
nipper was created in the 1890s by london painter francis 
barraud barraud depicted the terrier listening to his masters 
voice emanating from a gramophone he sold the painting to the 
gramophone co after replacing the cylindertype phonograph with a 
disc version 
in 1900 the north american rights to the painting were acquired 
and nipper was used to launch the consolidated talking machine co 
later to become the victor talking machine co rca purchased victor 
and the rights to use nipper in 1929 
rca in turn was bought by ge in 1986 ge continues to use the 
rca name for some products but it sold the rca and ge names for 
home electronics to thomson 
he is one of the oldest advertising syumbols in the world 
fowler said the cocacola symbol is the only better known symbol 
in the world than the dog and the horn 
before bringing nipper back ammirati conducted a survey to 
judge his name recognition and popularity 
we went all over the country asking whether they like him 
whether we should keep him fowler said and people told us 
are you kidding of course you have to use nipper 
we didnt bring him back simply for nostalgic benefit because 
nostalgia is anathema to electronics we brought him back because 
hes a good symbol 
the agency found the dogs for the ads in a new york animal 
shelter run by animal trainers the new nipper was insured for 
500000 before seven days of filming this summer fowler said 
two of the commercials will debut sunday night on abcs 
americas funniest home videos fowler said each of the spots 
contains three vignettes demonstrating rca product features nipper 
and his sidekick will also appear in print advertising and on the 
companys brochures 
in all the advertisements the puppy plays the part of the 
adventurous wisecracking offspring who always gets the best of 
nipper 
hes sort of a smart aleck a hot dog a little hot shot 
fowler said hes like you he has all the answers and hes not 
afraid to talk about them the big dog is more staid like your 
father 
we hope they can tell the companys story for the next 100 
years fowler said

interest in continental airlines holdings inc the department said 
wednesday

continental airlines through a 525 million stock purchase 
under the deal approved by the department scandanavian airlines

stock and will be given three seats on the holding companys 
15member board 
however sas agreed to not buy more than 22 percent of 
continentals voting stock for three years it cannot own more than

continentals voting stock

continental stock for 315 million and will pay another 21

company resigned last month as chief executive officer of 
continental and has been replaced by hollis harris former 
president of delta airlines 
some continental shareholders have filed lawsuits in delaware 
chancery court asking that the transactions among continental jet 
capital lorenzo and sas be blocked they argued the deals were 
entered into in breech of fiduciary duties owed to continental 
and continental shareholders

american airlines filed a suit wednesday to 
overturn a government decision allowing united airlines landing 
priorities at the nations busiest airport 
a scheduling battle between two of the largest us carriers 
intensified when the federal aviation administration announced 
earlier in the day approval of new scheduling proposed by united at 
chicagos ohare international airport and blamed american for 
causing delays 
faa officials said that some evening flights into chicagos 
ohare international airport would be subject to substantial delays 
over the next two weeks until the new agreement takes effect oct 
1 
they blamed american saying the airline in a new schedule 
pulled out of an operating agreement and increased arrivals at 
chicago during early evening hours 
the approved plan allows united to move some of its flights 
ahead of american flights 
this outrageous action by the faa gives united already the 
dominant carrier at ohare an unfair and illegal competitive 
advantage said anne mcnamara americans senior vice president 
and general counsel 
the faas decision blessed a sweetheart deal struck behind 
closed doors in august between the faa and united and allows the 
chicagobased carrier to leapfrog americans schedule at ohare at 
critical times of the day she said 
united praised the faa action saying its schedule was designed 
to reduce delays and congestion at chicago the chicagobased 
airline in a statement accused american of making efforts to 
prevent those improvements 
the american suit filed in the us court of appeals in 
washington seeks to overturn the faa decision affecting united 
flights saying it represents unlawful agency favoritism and gives 
united an unfair competitive advantage the faa was given until 
monday to respond to the complaint 
faa officials said the situation was caused when american 
airlines pulled out of an operating agreement announcing it would 
increase arrivals between 7 pm and 830 pm substantially 
exceeding airport capacity 
delays at ohare a major crossroads for flights around the 
country often cause delays at other airports as well 
but the faa said the agreement with united would reduce arrival 
peaks and associated delays at ohare after oct 1 
until then the public can continue to expect substantial 
delays at ohare the faa said 
the faa said united after learning of the new american 
schedule asked for and received permission to move its incoming 
flights in the early evening hours away from the new american 
arrival times 
american spokesman john hotard said american had been losing 
money and passengers to united because of uniteds scheduling in 
one example united moved a chicagowashington flight from 805 
pm to 740 pm 10 minutes ahead of an american flight to 
washington 
at a crowded airport like chicago very susceptible to delays 
and weather the guy who takes off second and lands second is the 
guy who gets stacked up hotard said 
he said the original times used by the two airlines were fair 
because sometimes we take off first sometimes they take off 
first

one year after spending 121 billion to expand 
internationally oryx energy co said tuesday it would buy out its 
founding pew family in a cash and stock deal worth about 14 
billion 
oryx using cash generated by higher oil prices said it will 
pay 5375 per share or 9675 million for 18 million shares of 
common stock owned by the glenmede trust co which represents the 
interests of the wealthy philadelphia family 
the company also will swap 73 million shares of preferred stock 
glenmede holds for the same number of common shares the trust said 
it will sell the stock in a public offering as soon as it is 
practical at the buyout price the offering could bring the 
trust another 3924 million 
as part of the deal john g pew jr and albert e piscopo 
senior vice president of the trust have resigned as oryx 
directors company spokesman david clarke said the trusts 
holdings represent 27 percent of oryx 
oryx shares were down 25 cents to 5367 in tuesdays trading 
on the new york stock exchange the announcement was made after the 
close of business 
we entered into the transaction as a result of the difference 
between glenmedes investment objectives including its desire for 
higher current yields and our plan to reinvest cash flow for 
growth said oryx chairman robert p hauptfuhrer 
oryx earned 139 million last year but said falling oil prices 
in the second quarter caused it to lose 3 million in the 
threemonth period 
glenmede acts as trustee for the charitable trusts established 
by the pew family the decision to sell out does not reflect lack 
of confidence in oryx trust president thomas langfitt said 
until last september oryx was mainly a domestic producer but 
on sept 13 1989 the company announced it would buy british 
petroleum cos holdings in the north sea indonesia dubai 
ecuador colombia gabon and italy 
the deal eventually valued at 121 billion made oryx the 
worlds largest independent oil company 
to pay for the stock oryx said it had arranged for 18 billion 
in credit to replace a 14 billion line it said it would reduce 
the debt within a year because of increased cash flow from higher 
oil prices 
oil currently is trading around 30 per 42gallon barrel 
depending on the grade inflated by the persian gulf crisis but 
hauptfuhrer said oryx could have afforded the deal before the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait 
assuming a reference price of 21 per barrel set at the july 
opec meeting we are confident that we can accomplish our financial 
objectives hauptfuhrer said a price would translate into about 
23 per barrel of west texas intermediate crude he said 
this will enable us to continue to apply advanced 
technologies such as our horizontal drilling program to find and 
develop new reserves hauptfuhrer 
light sweet crude oil for october delivery settled 54 cents 
lower at 3076 per barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
contracts for later months were also down 
the company has been one of the leaders in using horizontal 
drilling in the pearsall field of south texas turning the 
almostplayedout area into one of the hottest domestic oil plays 
oryx is the name taken in 1989 by sun exploration amp production 
co after it was spun off by the radnor pabased sun co in 1988

architectdeveloper john c portman jr met 
wednesday with a group of creditors and his executive vice 
president said afterward that an agreement could be reached within 
two weeks to resolve a debt crisis 
we are optimistic that we are moving forward to a conclusion 
and expect to announce in 10 days to two weeks an agreement 
on significant principles said sam williams executive vice 
president of the portman companies 
portman has been meeting for more than a month with about 20 
creditors to deal with debt that reportedly tops 16 billion 
williams said the meetings are focusing only on unsecured debt 
which he said amounts to about 5 percent of the companys 
obligations he refused to say how much money is involved 
swiss bank corp and citibank two of the creditors 
participating in the daylong meeting in atlanta issued a brief 
statement saying that progress was made and that further sessions 
will be scheduled 
williams declined to say exactly what was discussed at the 
meeting other than that it involved backing currently unsecured 
loans with collateral 
he maintained that the portman organization which has major 
projects in atlanta new york san francisco singapore and other 
cities is solvent and in good shape 
were healthy he said weve been in business 30 years 
and will be in business 30 more the financing on our major 
projects is firmly in place there is no threat to the concrete and 
steel buildings of the portman companies 
williams confirmed that the portman organization did not make a 
sept 1 payment to equitable life assurances society of the united 
states on a 3326 million mortgage for his flagship peachtree 
center office complex in atlanta he described it as a technical 
default done in consultation with equitable but declined to 
elaborate 
jonathan miller a spokesman in new york for equitable declined 
to comment this week on the negotiations with portman 
williams said portmans current situation stems from tightened 
banking regulations since the savings and loan crisis 
almost every real estate company in america will have to deal 
with it williams said 
portman has borrowed heavily as he launched several major 
projects over the last three years including a 60story office 
tower now under construction in atlanta 
williams rejected the suggestion that the debt is excessive 
the permanent mortgage debt we have is not out of line with 
the projects the company has developed and built over the 
years williams said the problem is trying to convert the 
unsecured debt into a collateral position
