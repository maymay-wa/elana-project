burundi president pierre buyoya has 
visited the area in northern burundi where at least 5000 people 
were killed last month in tribal violence radio burundi reported 
sunday 
the staterun radio said buyoya during his weekend tour 
commended doctors for helping the wounded in the districts of ntega 
and marangara the sites of the massacre of thousands of people of 
the majority hutu tribe in the warfare that began aug 14 
an estimated 55000 people fled into neighboring rwanda to 
escape the violence that claimed 5000 lives according to 
government estimates other sources have said the death toll was 
much higher 
radio burundi in a brief item monitored in nairobi said buyoya 
claimed the killings were caused by dissident hutus who infiltrated 
into the north to provoke attacks against the minority tutsi tribe 
buyoyas government had made the same allegation earlier 
the tutsis comprise only 15 percent of burundis population of 5 
million but control the tiny central african nations government 
and army about 84 percent of the population are hutus 
some burundi refugees in rwanda have said hutus initiated the 
killings by attacking tutsis in ntega but soldiers were responsible 
for most of the massacres that spread into marangara they said the 
troops began killing hutus in reprisal for the slain tutsis 
burundis government has acknowledged its military forces became 
involved but claims soldiers killed fewer than a dozen people and 
restored peace in the area by aug 17 
the two tribes are longtime enemies following a hutuled coup 
attempt in the former belgium colony in 1972 the tutsi massacred an 
estimated 100000 hutus

snow dusted parts of 
yellowstone national park on sunday giving firefighters a break in 
their battle against forest fires and people evacuated from park 
headquarters and several towns returned home 
federal officials said they would double the number of soldiers 
sent to battle the fires that have charred more than a third of the 
22 millionacre park 
after months of drought and heat temperatures only reached the 
mid30s sunday with humidity as high as 90 percent some sections 
of the park were dampened by light showers saturday 
the colder temperatures are going to raise the humidity and 
with the higher humidity the wood will absorb some of that 
moisture itll be less likely to burn although the fire shouldnt 
have much trouble said joe halliday chief naturalist for the 
west district of yellowstone 
winds were expected to stay in a more manageable range of 15 to 
30 mph well below the gusts above 50 mph that had driven the 
flames the previous two days 
fires have charred 883000 acres of yellowstone since june in 
what firefighters call the worst fire season in the west in 30 
years 
about 80 canadian air crew members hired to help drop fire 
retardant arrived in coeur dalene idaho for training 
light snow and low temperatures also helped firefighters in 
idaho where wind gusted to 60 mph and montana where evacuated 
residents of some ranches and small communities were allowed to 
return home 
rain and lower temperatures dampened fires in colorado but 45 
mph wind gusts whipped a boulder county fire to 1830 acres and led 
six families to evacuate heavy rains later sunday stalled the fire 
and residents were allowed to return home fires in the routt 
national forest were left unattended because the weather was too 
cold and wet for firefighters 
and in northwest oregon the state department of forestry shut 
down millions of acres of stateprotected forests in an 
unprecedented effort to curb the number of fires caused by human 
carelessness 
given the number of humancaused fires were seeing every day 
this is the most viable option we have right now said forestry 
department spokesman doug decker 
altogether 133 million acres or 83 percent of the states 
forests have been closed decker said 
a fire also burned in northern california where a mountain 
blaze whipped by hot winds burned 2000 acres of brush and timber 
near the town of grass valley 
there were no reports of injuries but authorities described the 
blaze as a wall of fire a halfmile long that was headed toward 
affluent lake wildwood a residential area of about 2000 homes 
and in washington a rapidly expanding fire started by an 
illegal campfire spread rapidly to more than 300 acres in olympic 
national park high country sunday 
thin smoke from the yellowstone fires has drifted as far east as 
pennsylvania and new york at an altitude of 15000 to 20000 feet 
the national weather service said sunday 
a couple days ago most of the smoke was over the midwest and 
it has now gradually drifted eastward said brian smith of the 
severe storms center in kansas city mo its just going to have 
a thin hazy appearance and might create some colorful sunsets but 
its not expected to present any health problems because its so 
far up 
the 263400acre north fork fire in yellowstone remained about a 
mile from park headquarters at mammoth hot springs said 
spokeswoman marty tobias that fire also has threatened west 
yellowstone mont and destroyed several buildings at old faithful 
geyser 
park officials saturday ordered all families and nonessential 
employees to leave mammoth near the parks north entrance but 
they were allowed back after conditions improved tobias did not 
know how many people decided to return 
the improved weather allowed park officials to reopen 
yellowstones west entrance and the road from there to madison 
junction and old faithful the rest of the park remained closed to 
visitors 
ten miles northeast of mammoth residents of jardine mont 
also were allowed to return tobias added they were evacuated 
saturday when fire threatened the only exit road 
evacuated residents of cooke city and silver gate mont at the 
northeast gate to yellowstone were allowed to return home sunday 
and the highway leading into the area was reopened said fire 
information officer nick tafoya 
a mile from yellowstones headquarters firefighters sprayed 
protective foam sunday on buildings at the young adult conservation 
corps camp where fire destroyed a tent 
basically with this cold front thats moved in its going to 
put us kind of in a holding pattern well see how it goes from 
there tobias said lets just drop this wind and well be in 
business 
however brian morris a forest service spokesman in west 
yellowstone said its not going to be with us too long we 
expect warmer weather and a drying trend this week 
about 9000 people are fighting the fires in yellowstone deputy 
defense secretary william taft iv said 1200 marines from camp 
pendleton calif and two army battalions will join the 2300 army 
soldiers from fort lewis wash fighting the fires 
so by the end of next week we will see a doubled 
representation by the military in this effort taft said

doom for our hopes said rep john lewis dga former chairman 
of the student nonviolent coordinating committee 
lewis who received an honorary doctorate at a convocation 
saturday opening williams colleges 196th academic year said the 
american people must elect leaders with the moral capacity of 
the rev martin luther king jr if civil rights are to improve with 
time 
we have lost some of our finest leaders but we are still very 
involved in that same movement for liberation said lewis who 
was jailed 40 times and severely beaten during the sixties for 
leading peaceful marches and demonstrations throughout the south 
our struggle is not for one day or one week or one year but 
for a lifetime if thats what it takes 
among thos honored saturday was rosa l parks whose refusal to 
surrender her seat to a white passenger on a montgomery ala bus

a record 916 people tackled mount 
mckinley during the mountaineering season says the national park 
service which is thinking about putting another outhouse on north 
americas tallest mountain 
sanitation on the 20320foot mountain has been a growing 
concern said ranger roger robinson 
according to robinson 562 of the 916 people who registered to 
climb mckinley this spring and summer reported reaching the summit 
last year 817 climbers tested themselves against the mountain 
only about a third finished the climb 
two people died climbing mckinley this year robinson said 
don henry a 71yearold connecticut lawyer this year became 
the oldest person known to have made the top 
robinson attributed some of the increased mountaineering to 
foreigners who decided attractive currency exchange rates made this 
the year for the climb they had long wanted to make 
climbers began arriving in april and some waited until late 
july but most planned their trips for may and june 
were trying to get more people to come in july robinson 
said rangers attempting to deal with the environmental effects of 
increased activity want use of the mountain to be spread out 
the park service asks climbers to use plastic bags for human 
waste and put the bags in crevasses but officials dont know how 
many comply robinson said there are two latrines on mckinley one 
twothirds of the way up the peak the park service hopes to 
install an outhouse at 17000 feet next year

pope john paul iis customary message 
of peace and reconciliation could be a controversial one when he 
visits mozambique a southern african nation wracked by 12 years of 
civil war drought and systematic destruction of public facilities 
a newsletter issued last year by frelimo the governing marxist 
party called the former portuguese colonys roman catholic bishops 
enemies of the people after they suggested the government meet 
with guerrillas of the mozambican national resistance 
but cardinal alexandre dos santos says he hopes the pope will 
call for reconciliation when he visits the country sept 1619 
president joaquim chissano who was visiting the pope in the 
vatican when the bishops made their plea said it was impossible to 
negotiate with the guerrillas who he charged mutilate children 
burn schools and hospitals and massacre villagers 
the guerrilla movement known as renamo denies such charges and 
says it is fighting to replace the marxist government with a 
democratic one 
we hope the pope will say something about peace since we are 
in this situation of war said dos santos who became a cardinal 
in june we dont see how we can end this struggle without 
reconciliation it is necessary to have dialogue with these 
people 
foreign minister pascoal mocumbi said the government hopes the 
pope will not appeal for negotiations with renamo he said no one 
had the right to suggest that the government should talk with 
terrorists with those who commit massacres those who have 
been roundly condemned not only by mozambique but by the 
international community 
job chambal director of the governments department of 
religious affairs is overseeing the return of some church property 
confiscated when frelimo came to power at independence from 
portugal in 1975 
he said of the bishops our quarrel with them is not the fact 
that they called for negotiations any mozambican is free to think 
that the one thing that worried the government was to say that 
the government as well as renamo are responsible for the war 
chambal said the plan to return all confiscated church property 
used for worship came coincidentally three months before the popes 
visit 
we were not trying to please the pope he said its a way 
of showing we dont belong to an evil empire 
since 1982 when the late president samora machel held meetings 
with church leaders the government has sought to ease tension 
between the churches and frelimo 
the government invited the pope to visit mozambique in his 
capacity as head of the vatican state and it is sharing expenses 
with the local church 
its very expensive but its very important chambal said 
the willingness of the pope to come to mozambique means theres 
been a very big improvement because people have understood what it 
means when we say we have a socialist state 
we are marxists but all of us in government have some 
religious background said chambal who was reared a 
presbyterian we still have some religious feeling even our 
revolutionary songs have a religious taste but our children will 
be more marxist and teach their children to be marxists 
he said the government wants children to be influenced only by 
the state until they are 18 when they can choose whether to go to 
church but this policy is not enforced in the years immediately 
after independence some churches were closed services were 
interrupted and religious activity was officially discouraged 
now churches operate freely both cathedral services and prayer 
meetings in the bush are packed on sundays 
the frelimo revolutionaries accused roman catholic bishops and 
priests of cooperating with the portuguese colonial government and 
opposing independence in return for a favored position as a state 
church 
the cardinal says some portuguese clergymen supported 
colonialism but denies the mozambican roman catholic church as a 
whole was against independence 
all churchstate problems are not resolved cardinal dos santos 
said but he maintained the government does not understand the 
churchs goals 
they suppose we want only to teach those who want to be 
religious leaders he said we also want to prepare the people 
for running the country 
dos santos said that of mozambiques 145 million people 2 
million are catholics

the floor no longer moves beneath tania aebis 
feet the view from her window these days offers more than a vista 
of waves and billowing sail and she no longer spends week after 
week alone 
life has changed for the young woman whose father sent her off 
at age 18 to sail alone around the world because she wouldnt do 
her homework 
instead of standing by the tiller ms aebi now spends hours in 
front of her computer keyboard putting down the memories of months 
at sea and ports of call 
but after working nearly a year on her book ms aebi still 
finds writing about myself is harder than sailing 
the lessons of her 2year 27000mile voyage are coming slowly 
im ruminating about it ms aebi now 21 said recently 
from her home in newport ri its not like my lifes a neat 
pattern yet it probably never will be 
nonetheless her life is starting to follow a more conventional 
path the boat recently was sold shes newly wed to a man she met 
on the other side of the planet and ms aebi and her father have 
bridged the personal gulf that sent her sailing around the globe 
before i left he lost hope in me she confided he 
thought i was a total dud he was an explorer and i did none of 
that 
father proposed the whole thing to me and didnt give me a 
whole lot of options 
in 1985 ernst aebi a wellknown surrealist painter who lives 
in manhattan suggested to his bicyclemessenger daughter an 
intriguing scheme in lieu of a college education he would buy her 
a boat to sail solo around the world 
ms aebi a difficult student who graduated from an alternative 
high school agreed her father says she was shanghaied soon 
the 26foot sloop varuna was ordered and on may 28 1985 the 
neophyte sailor hoisted the sails and was on her way out of new 
york harbor 
many thought she wouldnt make it 
but by the time ms aebi floated through the panama canal and 
reached the galapagos islands she had learned how to use the 
heavens as her map her seamanship would later be tested when the 
boat capsized during a mediterranean storm and when it collided 
with a freighter 
at the south pacific island of american samoa ms aebi gave a 
hitchhiker an 80mile lift to another island a generous oversight 
that ultimately cost her a pair of worlds records 
the people who keep the books say as a result of that gesture 
the voyage couldnt be classified as singlehanded ms aebi would 
have been the youngest person and the first american woman to sail 
solo around the world 
but if she lost something in the south pacific she also found 
something olivier berner a fellow adventurer and solo sailor from 
switzerland who was sailing to new guinea in search of gold 
he changed course and sailing his own boat accompanied her to 
malta when ms aebi returned to new york last nov 6 berner was 
here to welcome her the couple were married six months later 
with the elation of accomplishment now displaced by the effort 
of writing her memoirs ms aebi says she has no regrets about the 
records she almost captured or the years away from her home 
friends and family 
ill never be 18 again she said that trip gave me an 
opportunity for 2 years to not worry about the future except for 
getting to the next port i knew what i had to do which was 
ultimately get back to new york 
but does the prosaic pale after a life before the mast 
life cant be a bore when you have a deadline she said with 
a laugh and there are too many things i want to do learn a 
couple of more languages read a lot of books and get older 
still her future remains a big question mark 
ive seen a lot and ive met a lot of people doing different 
things so i see theres a whole world of opportunity out there i 
guess i have bigger horizons 
ms aebis next adventure will be a more conventional drive 
across the country in a van with her husband another solo voyage 
doesnt figure into her plans but neither does settling down 
i could have bought a house last week she said but when 
it came down to paying the mortgage and being attached to one 
particular thing i just couldnt do it i dont need a house i 
could get a boat

is listed in good condition 
thompson hasnt given any permission to anyone to talk to

president maung maung on saturday bowed to 
massive prodemocracy protests and announced that the ruling party 
would relinquish its 26year monopoly on power and hold multiparty 
elections 
an emergency session of parliament on sunday approved multiparty 
elections in about three months and appointed a group of elders to 
supervise polling 
but key opposition leaders pressed for more political 
concessions including an interim government to cope with burmas 
growing chaos and sporadic protests continued 
millions of people have taken to the streets since march to call 
for democracy in burma 
the parliament authorized the council of state burmas highest 
governent body to hold elections in as early as 45 days or the 
postpone them beyond the tentative threemonth date if necessary 
it also empowered the council to make necessary changes in the 
constitution to reflect a multiparty system enlarge an elections 
supervision commission if necessary and formulate election rules 
named to the elections supervision commission were three retired 
civil servants a retired army brigadier and a former member of 
parliament all are more than 70 years old 
on saturday speaking before 968 delegates at a special party 
congress maung maung acknowledged that the party made major errors 
and said the interests of the people were paramount 
 
power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely he 
said in a speech carried by the stateowned radio rangoon as 
members of the ruling party for a long period they tended to 
forget the interests of the people and lose public confidence 
the westerntrained lawyer pledged fair and free elections as 
soon as possible he said he would not be a candidate 
the broadcast announcer said the decision was unanimously 
adopted by the delegates of the burma socialist program party 
maung maung urged government employees who have gone on strike 
in sympathy with the massive prodemocracy movement to return to 
their jobs and revive his stalled government 
the government move was another retreat in face of the sometimes 
bloody nationwide uprising the movement has prompted the 
resignation of two hardline presidents the lifting of martial law 
and virtually unimpeded political activities that earlier would 
have drawn long prison terms or worse 
western observers noted that the antigovernment surge came 
without any outside support or meaningful resort to arms although 
demonstrators often have compared their movement with those of 
other asian countries 
they were inspired by the triumph of peoples power in the 
philippines they were encouraged by the establishment of 
democracy in south korea last year us rep steven solarz 
dny said after returning from rangoon earlier last week 
in washington the state department took a cautious stance 
its still not clear the date or the manner of the elections 
that would be held or whether the governments move will satisfy 
the desires of the people spokesman dennis g harter said 
maung maungs government originally planned to meet monday to 
consider a referendum on a general election and a multiparty system 
on friday opposition leader former prime minister u nu who was 
toppled from power in a 1962 military coup by ne win defied 
burmas authoritarian rulers and declared the formation of a rival 
government and elections oct 9 
but three top members of the rival goverment resigned saturday 
and reliable sources said u nu had not consulted them about the 
announcement 
although u nu 82 is respected by a large number of burmese 
diplomats say his age makes it unlikely that he will be anything 
more than a symbol of continuing opposition to authoritarian 
diehards 
aung san suu kyi an opposition figure and daughter of the 
deceased national hero aung san told reporters that saturdays 
announcement was a positive step but said it could take up to 
two years to form parties to contest in general elections 
under the present economic and political situation an interim 
government will be the best solution it interim government would 
deal with economic problems and also hold general elections she 
told newsmen 
many opposition figures demanded that an interim government be 
set up immediately 
every minute the economic political and security situation 
deteriorates one opposition lawyer said immediate formation 
of an interim government is the only solution the country wont 
hold up until these general elections 
ne win resigned as head of the ruling party in july citing in 
part widespread street protests in march and june 
riots flared when the party chose as his successor sein lwin 
who is widely hated for his brutal suppression of dissidents 
troops fired into crowds of protesters and the government said 112 
people were killed western diplomats said the number was much 
higher 
sein lwin resigned aug 12 after 17 days in power and maung 
maung was named to replace him maung maung was burmas first 
civilian leader in 26 years

two of the largest us computer manufacturers 
have won the first round in a fight with the air force to be 
reimbursed at taxpayers expense for their legal costs in 
challenging pentagon contracting procedures 
the general services administrations board of contract appeals 
in an aug 17 opinion obtained late last week decided that digital 
equipment corp and wang laboratories inc were entitled to some of 
the more than 1 million they are seeking but did not say how much 
rather in a partial victory for the air force the board 
ordered the firms to segregate legal expenses incurred in 
pursuing the portion of the original challenge that they won and 
said they could recover only those costs 
if the two sides cant reach a settlement the board said 
additional proceedings will be held to fix the award 
the air force had asked the board to reject completely digitals 
claim for 830330 and wangs demand for 210000 
the sixpage opinion written by administrative judge vincent a 
labella and endorsed by two other judges marks the latest chapter 
in a twoyearold battle over what has been called the computer 
contract of the century 
the air force intends to buy about 20000 minicomputers for use 
by all the armed services at cost of up to 45 billion the 
contract is expected to be awarded in the next month or so 
digital and wang like most other industry firms expressed an 
interest in bidding on the contract in early 1987 but before the 
bidding deadline passed they filed a challenge with the gsa board 
charging that the air force had rigged the competition 
the companies complained specifically about a requirement the 
computers operate on a unix or unixcompatible program unix is a 
proprietary system developed by american telephone amp telegraph co 
and widely licensed to other vendors 
the air force says unix compatibility is essential if the 
military is ever to standardize its computer systems 
the gsa board in its initial ruling last october backed the 
air force for the most part concluding that unix had become an 
industry standard the decision here is not unlike a 
determination to specify either vhs or beta video recorders it 
said 
but the board also said the air force should have spelled out in 
greater detail how it intended to use an atampt test program to 
determine contract compliance 
the air force did that in november when it issued two pages of 
amendments to its solicitation before restarting the competition 
digital and wang citing their partial victory then filed requests 
for reimbursement of all legal expenses stemming from the challenge 
digital said failure to reimburse would discourage future 
challenges and result in loss of effective enforcement of the 
procurement laws 
the loser would be competition and thus ultimately the 
taxpayer the company said 
air force lawyers countered that digital and wang had lost 
this case after prevailing on a single insignificant issue as 
evidence they pointed to the two companiess withdrawal from the 
competition in january 
the board disagreed saying that only after the air force 
corrected its solicitation were digital and wang able to determine 
whether they should compete on the governments terms 
their challenge produced the benefit of full and open 
competition which is the touchstone and objective of procurement 
law it said 
air force attorney kevin vincent said the boards decision was 
wrong but that the air force had not decided what to do next 
wang spokesman joseph roy indicated that the air force and the 
companies had begun discussing a possible settlement as urged by 
the gsa board 
a spokesman for digital failed to return a phone call friday

three members of congress are urging the 
national park service to abandon its plan to tear down the rustic 
shacks on remote dunes of cape cod mass that have inspired 
artists and authors including playwright eugene oneill 
the park service argues that the 18 dune shacks do not have 
architectural significance and therefore should not be placed on 
the national register of historic places 
three massachusetts democrats sens edward m kennedy and john 
f kerry and rep gerry e studds who represents the cape are 
joining state and local officials in a fight to save the primitive 
huts from destruction 
these buildings represent a unique aspect of american history 
and culture that should be preserved for future generations they 
wrote william penn mott director of the national park service 
last week we believe the dune shacks are indeed historic 
structures 
the shacks nestled in a twomile strip of dunes in truro and 
provincetown at the far end of the cape were originally built by 
the coast guard as shelters from harsh coastal weather they became 
part of the park services domain in 1961 when president kennedy 
created the cape cod national seashore 
the shacks preservation has become an emotional issue in recent 
years because the expiration of onetime leases signed when the 
national seashore was created usually for the owners lifetime or 
25 years 
preservationists want the federal government to declare the 
shacks historic treasures and allow a private organization to 
mantain them for public use 
a study commissioned by the park service concluded that the 
primitive structures do not qualify for national register 
protection but critics say the study focused on the buildings 
lack of architectural importance and ignored their historical and 
cultural significance that some proponents compare to that of 
walden pond home of henry david thoreau 
with local support growing in favor of preserving the shacks 
the massachusetts historical commission is expected to vote 
wednesday in boston to urge federal officials to save the 
buildings the park service said it will issue a statement at that 
meeting 
i am hopeful that they will decide that in years to come many 
more people will have the same oppportunity for inspiration that 
the dune shacks have offered eugene oneill harry kemp norman 
mailer and many others studds said

the typical harvard freshman spends 
nearly 41 hours a week in class or studying doesnt go to sleep 
until after 1 am and sometimes loses effectiveness because of 
weariness depression and stress according to a recent study 
keith w light a doctoral candidate in education at harvard 
asked 63 firstyear students to log their days 15 minutes at a time 
for one week in march and one week in april 
we assume that because theyre coming to harvard they have 
their acts together in every way he said i dont think thats 
true having been a proctor adviser living in a freshman dorm for 
three years 
the study was intended to determine if a timelogging exercise 
might be useful to new students and their advisers in helping the 
students make better use of their time 
ive always been interested in the freshman experience of 
getting used to college life light said it seems to be that 
the actual use of time not only affects a firstyear student 
academically but also their sense of fulfillment and enjoyment in 
the experience 
fiftysix percent of the students said on at least one day that 
they were too weary to be productive thirtyseven percent said 
depression frustration or stress made them unproductive 
in addition to logging each periods activities students were 
asked to indicate which ones were most valuable and which were a 
waste of time television was listed as a common timewaster but 
more students mentioned at least once that a class or a lab was a 
waste of time 
fortyfour percent said they wasted time watching television on 
at least one day during the survey period but 62 percent thought 
classes were a waste of time and 54 percent felt labs were little 
help just 6 percent reported that they wasted time on drinking or 
a hangover at least once during the survey period 
the students said they devoted an average of 583 hours a day 
or 408 hours a week to academics including class time study 
time and lab time students generally spend about 15 hours a week 
in the classroom light said 
light said he did not seek a random sample for his survey but 
he got a good crosssection of the freshman class by simply asking 
students in two sections of one dormitory to participate 
he said the 63 respondents from the 1600member class was about 
twice the minimum sample group for a survey 
its a carefully done study but its modest light said 
were not trying to draw too many earthshattering 
generalizations but get to something that will help them put their 
time togther 
seventythree percent said in retrospect they would have changed 
the way they spent a day 
while many students could tell you yes i do procrastinate 
and yes i dont get enough sleep sometimes and i know if i 
studied without heavy metal rock music in the background i might 
be able to concentrate the exercise seems to be able to give 
students a more realistic views of how they spend their time 
light said 
during school nights the students got an average of 75 hours 
of sleep on a school night but not by going to bed early 
seventyfive percent of the students said they didnt get to bed 
until after midnight and 61 percent said they were usually up past 
1 am even at 3 am some 12 percent were awake 
light conducted followup interviews with 24 students and said 
most of them found the exercise useful in evaluating the way they 
spend their time this fall officials asked light to make the 
exercise available to all freshmen who might find it helpful

that was a rough way to leave a child like that she said

soviet union and china it would be healthy for world peace 
and stability carlucci told the young presidents organization 
meeting in this british colony

and ideological differences

approve export licenses for satellites manufactured by the us 
hughes aircraft co to be launched by china with its long march

of those in the united states but he did not specify amounts 
he said he and chinese premier li peng had discussed the impact 
of the chinese launches on the us defense industry and the 
possibility of china adjusting the price and number of its launches

tamil extremists hacked to death 12 
people including five children and the government implemented a 
plan to try to end ethnic violence in two provinces officials said 
sunday 
five others were seriously injured in the attack saturday in the 
eastern village of suhadagama said a military spokesman who spoke 
on condition of anonymity suhadagama is about 150 miles south of 
colombo the capital 
the spokesman quoted witnesses as saying about 20 tamil 
militants stabbed the victims with pickaxes swords and daggers 
the dead included four tamils who were married to sinhalese 
women the spokesman said their wives were not hurt he said 
the insurgents were blamed for a similar attack two weeks ago in 
which 11 sinhalese farmers were butchered in neighboring 
polonnaruwaq district 
tamil rebels want to set up a separate nation in sri lankas 
north and east provinces the insurgents claim both provinces as 
their traditional homeland and have been attacking villages to try 
to chase away sinhalese and moslem settlers 
tamils are mostly hindu and make up 18 percent of the islands 
16 million people they claim they are discriminated against by the 
predominantly buddhist sinhalese who comprise about 75 percent of 
the countrys population 
in july 1987 india and sri lanka signed a peace accord aimed at 
ending five years of bloodshed india sent an estimated 50000 
troops to sri lanka to try to enforce the agreement 
india became involved in the conflict because it is the regional 
power and because more than 60 million tamils living in southern 
india are sympathetic to the rebels cause 
a key provision of the agreement calls for the merger of the 
north and east provinces the union then will be governed by an 
elected provincial council that would take over most administrative 
and political duties now handled by the federal government 
the government of president junius r jayewardene announced the 
merger on saturday and said it believes a provincial council will 
be chosen by january the rebels have had no response 
the tamil separatist campaign launched in 1983 has claimed at 
least 8500 lives including more than 550 indian soldiers india 
says its troops have killed at least 1000 tamil insurgents

families of the 290 people killed in the us 
downing of iran air flight 655 are unlikely to receive compensation 
during the remaining months of the reagan administration officials 
say 
president reagan pledged to offer compensation soon after the 
uss vincennes shot down the plane over the persian gulf but the 
plan still faces two steep hurdles the bureaucratic and legal 
obstacles caused by a lack of communications between the united 
states and iran and its continued unpopularity on capitol hill 
i think were a long way from payments actually being made if 
they ever actually are said rep les aspin dwis chairman of 
the house armed services committee 
its a hard sell up here on capitol hill theres not a lot of 
support up here for iran he said and in addition you have a 
lot of questions who do you actually pay how do you get them the 
money how do you make sure it goes to the families and not to the 
government of iran 
the case involves the destruction of iran air flight 655 shot 
down july 3 by the navy cruiser vincennes in the strait of hormuz 
shortly after taking off from bandar abbas all 290 persons aboard 
were killed when the vincennes fired two missiles in the mistaken 
belief that the unidentified plane was an iranian military f14 
us officials expressed regret and reagan decided july 11 to 
offer compensation to families of the victims but the plan quickly 
ran into opposition in congress legislators were reflecting a 
decade of public unhappiness with iran and its leader ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini dating back to irans taking of american 
hostages 
a navy investigation headed by rear adm william m fogarty 
found last month the shootdown was due to a series of 
stresscaused human mistakes made by a crew in combat for the first 
time 
but the fogarty report also laid some blame on iran criticizing 
that country for permitting a commercial airliner to fly over a 
navy warship that had been engaged in a firefight with iranian 
gunboats 
while the navy was investigating the state department began 
trying to answer the myriad of questions raised by reagans 
announcement 
for example the questions of who gets the money is unanswered 
the united states and iran have no diplomatic relations and iran 
has not yet even furnished a manifest with the names of the 
passengers 
another question is how much to pay 
one congressional official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the amounts range from 50000 to 250000 per victim 
congress will carefully scrutinize any plan the state department 
develops 
sen strom thurmond rsc said im willing to consider 
compensation but i dont want one penny to go to the government of 
iran 
sen james exon dneb said the fogarty report underscores the 
need for compensation but we have to be careful that none of the 
money goes to the government 
while the united states is offering compensation us officials 
point out that the soviet union has refused to pay anything for two 
incidents in which the soviets shot down korean airline planes in 
one incident in 1978 two passengers were killed and in the 
other in 1983 269 people were killed including 60 americans

the scrawled note by michael dukakis about a 
controversial prison project turned out to be prophetic this 
spells mucho trouble lets discuss msd 
later the massachusetts governor penned another message to his 
legal counsel on a plan to build a prison in the tiny central town 
of new braintree no further action until we discuss msd 
the democratic presidential nominee had correctly predicted the 
storm of controversy that would surround the plan but his 1985 
notes displayed something else about dukakis that has become more 
visible on the campaign trail his instinctive caution when he 
smells trouble 
that has been the dukakis management style through recent 
largely crisisfree years as governor the style born of a 
firstterm disaster has been an easy one to adopt in a state with 
a boom economy and little opposition from republicans 
but on the campaign trail as the presidential race tightens and 
he comes under relentless criticism by vice president george bush 
dukakis has given indications that he wants to turn more aggressive 
that was much in evidence when he rehired john sasso the 
campaign chief who was ousted after releasing the tape that led to 
delaware sen joseph bidens withdrawal from the presidential race 
dukakis took some heat for the decision but he got his way and 
fallout was minimized by his timing he made the announcement at 
the start of the long labor day weekend 
i dont think he sees himself as a great risktaker he 
doesnt place a high value on that said martin linsky a 
lecturer at the john f kennedy school of government who was a 
republican colleague in the state legislature 
dukakis cautious approach to the sasso affair reflected lessons 
he learned in 1975 when trying to keep a strong campaign promise 
of no new taxes he held out until forced to impose tax 
increases and spending cuts that angered both the right and left 
going down the street with him the verbal abuse he would take 
from people was quite unbelievable said thomas p oneill iii 
son of the former house speaker and dukakis lieutenant governor in 
1975 i really think he had such confidence in his ability to 
handle the deficit problem that that would have an overriding 
effect on the public relations end of the problem 
joseph grandmaison chairman of the new hampshire democratic 
party managed dukakis 1974 campaign for governor and recalls a 
politician much more willing to make snap decisions then than he is 
now back in the early 70s he was far more likely to look at a 
situation and come to an immediate conclusion about what was the 
best way to proceed he said 
the lesson was clear said paul garrity the former judge who 
pushed the administration into the boston harbor cleanup project 
once burned twice shy 
after he won back the governorship in 1982 dukakis kept a tight 
rein on news emanating from the governors office and from the many 
state agencies no press release bearing dukakis name went out 
without being personally checked by the governor press aides kept 
lists of good and bad reporters broken down by those whose 
coverage favored or hurt the administration 
hes taken more seriously the communications aspect of 
government linsky said 
the muchheralded transformation of dukakis from his early years 
in office to his two recent terms was not entirely complete linsky 
said dukakis once again this year finds himself wrestling with a 
state budget shortfall although the crisis isnt as serious as in 
dukakis first term he has had to sign a cigarette tax into law to 
help raise tax revenues 
one of the ways to think about the pattern of not dealing with 
revenue problems until fairly late in the game is that if he 
doesnt want it to be a problem he doesnt see it as a problem 
linsky said 
in 1986 dukakis used the hunkerdown approach to distance 
himself from disclosures that state officials had approved a 
10000 payment to silence a student who charged a state college 
president with sexual assault 
the governor recalled first hearing about the alleged assault 
and the payoff in january 1986 he said he told a top state 
education official to get on it and take care of it but 
dukakis did nothing further to investigate until the story 
intensified six months later 
for more than a year dukakis let two top administration 
officials handle questions on the new braintree prison issue even 
amid charges later refuted that dukakis had granted a personal 
favor to friends who owned the prison site 
he also kept a back seat when a prison furlough program that he 
deeply believed in came under fire when a convicted murderer on 
furlough terrorized a maryland couple he reversed the furlough 
policy as public opinion was reaching a crescendo 
but a cautious approach to governing that kept dukakis out of 
trouble in massachusetts hasnt translated into safety on the 
campaign trail 
early this month bush scored political points by coming to 
polluted boston harbor to highlight an example of what he called 
the consequences of excessive delay dukakis was forced to defend 
himself by saying that after a decade as governor something was 
finally being done to clean the harbor

iraqs use of poison gas against its kurdish 
minority is prompting concern that other nations bogged down in 
armed conflict might resort to the silent killer in violation 
of a universally accepted ban on use of chemical weapons 
according to us officials there is little question that 
iraqs use of mustard gas against iranian forces influenced irans 
decision to end their eightyear old persian gulf war last month 
almost immediately after the ceasefire took effect iraq 
launched an offensive against its kurdish minority as suspected 
collaborators with iran tens of thousands of kurds were forced to 
flee into southern turkey 
last week about nine days after the first reports of iraqi 
chemical warfare began to circulate secretary of state george p 
shultz said he was convinced the allegations were true 
shultz accused the iraqis of unjustifiable and abhorrent 
behavior the senate then unanimously approved stringent economic 
sanctions against iraq 
iraqs minister of state for foreign affairs saddoun hammadi 
met with shultz on thursday and called the charges absolutely 
baseless 
but well before the latest iraqi assault on the kurds a number 
of united nations investigations concluded that iraq and to a 
lesser extent iran had engaged in chemical warfare since 1984 
the state department has sharply criticized iraq from time to 
time and unanimous un security council resolutions have done the 
same but the international reaction generally has been muted and 
unsustained possibly reflecting the lack of global sympathy for 
irans fundamentalist islamic regime 
last may iran complained that the absence of punitive measures 
against iraq was having a disastrous effect indeed a un 
report issued two months later said that use of chemical weapons 
against iran was intensifying and has become more frequent 
the 1925 geneva convention banning use of chemical weapons 
which was signed by 105 nations was seen as a major step toward 
humanizing armed conflict and assuring that the horrors of poison 
and nerve gas attacks in world war i would never be repeated 
that optimistic view has been changed by the persian gulf war 
and its ghastly aftermath foreign affairs analysts say they are 
now concernd that other warweary nations may conclude that the 
benefits of using chemical weapons may outweigh the costs 
some us officials privately share the conclusion of steven 
rose a neurobiologist at britains open university who was quoted 
in time magazine as saying that despite a major act of genocide 
the fact is iraq has got away with it 
elisa harris of britains royal united services institute 
agrees with that assessment according to time she said other 
third world countries might follow iraqs example believe that they 
might not have to pay a high political price 
the geneva convention outlaws use of asphyxiating poisonous 
or other gases and of bacteriological methods of warfare that can 
cause vomiting choking and skin irritation or worst a speedy 
death 
in 1915 when exposed to germandeployed lethal chlorine near 
the belgian town of ypres 5000 french troops were killed and 
10000 others injured in a single afternoon world war i claimed an 
estimated 91000 soldiers dead and 12 million wounded of gas 
attacks by both sides 
although 60 million are said to have died during world war ii 
chemical weapons were not used possibly because of the deterrent 
effect of knowing that all sides had extensive chemical arsenals 
president nixon banned manufacture of chemical weapons in 1969 
but president reagan ordered its resumption last december in the 
belief that a new deterrent was needed 
the united states and the soviet union have discussed ways to 
limit chemical weapons and the issue is being debated by a 
40nation conference on disarmament 
but progress toward agreement has been slow and the state 
department is worried there may be a trend toward greater 
proliferation of chemical weaponry

charged friday they were harassed by israeli border guards at 
jordans allenby bridge crossing and denied access to the west

top government officials touring 
yellowstone national park expressed shock at the extent of forest 
fire damage and promised changes in firefighting policies and more 
soldiers to battle the flames 
theres no way you can capture the thing like being here 
agriculture secretary richard lyng said just look at it 
devastating look at the natural beauty thats been interfered 
with 
i think its devastating weve said before its a 
disaster interior secretary donald hodel replied when asked his 
impressions during the stopover saturday at yellowstone 
the extent of the burned area weve just driven through is 
more than you can imagine hodel added 
officials who briefed them were not optimistic about getting the 
situation in hand anytime soon 
the potential for controlling these fires is not very great 
lyng said this is a terribly difficult situation 
montana gov ted schwinden who along with wyoming gov mike 
sullivan joined the washington officials on the visit was somber 
after hearing a briefing on the fire situation 
schwinden said the officials were told there are three 
breaks you can get as firefighters one is a break in the weather 
a break in the topography and a break in fuels 
i asked if theres no break in the weather are there breaks 
in fuels or topography and they havent worked to this point so 
unless we see some major precipitation i think well see a 
substantial spread of the fires 
unless there is generous snow this winter the area could 
actually continue to have fire problems next summer a veteran 
forest ranger said 
we periodically have fires that will hold over through the 
winter and start up again in the spring skip starkey a fire 
management specialist and 11year veteran of the forest service 
told reporters during saturdays official tour 
while the weather may not cooperate additional human resources 
will be sent into action officials said 
the pentagon had earlier supplied about 2300 army soldiers from 
fort lewis wash 
deputy defense secretary william taft iv announced at old 
faithful that they would be joined by two marine battalions 1200 
men from camp pendleton calif and two additional army 
battalions 
so by the end of next week we will see a doubled 
representation by the military in this effort taft said 
we have a fair amount of air equipment here and 
helicopters taft added well be bringing in more of that 
too 
canadian firefighters also will be pressed into service thanks 
to congressional approval last week of enabling legislation lyng 
noted 
hodel promised at a west yellowstone news conference that the 
interior department would make changes in its fire suppression 
policies to avoid a similar situation in the future that brought 
applause from an audience of townspeople who have been highly 
critical of the way the summers fires have been handled 
hodel and others however reiterated their assertion that 
nature not mismanagement was to blame 
you know its ok for people if they want to blame somebody 
for what has been a dreadful natural experience lyng said but 
ive been involved all summer with this drought and i can tell you 
that wherever you go in the north american continent you see the 
effects of the worst drought that weve ever had and this fire is 
one of them 
hodel added this year if theyd been able to foresee the 
kind of conditions weve got they would have been fighting every 
fire from the beginning 
in fact all the destruction weve driven through was a fire 
that they fought from the beginning and couldnt control it 
hodel said referring to the north fork fire which destroyed 
buildings at old faithful geyser and threatened west yellowstone 
and park headquarters at mammoth hot springs 
i think the key is to get these fires out and then review 
whats going on hodel said

life at the fire camp for 
the clovermist forest fire might not be quite as comfortable as 
home but now the firefighters can at least see whats going on in 
the rest of the world 
the camp sits on a sagebrushcovered plateau near the crandall 
ranger station along the western border of the shoshone national 
forest 
until saturday firefighters with time off from the fire lines 
on the 322000acre fire relied on a videotape collection of movies 
to while away the hours 
now theyve got a television satellite dish and can tap into 
just about anything being broadcast said bill mack who works for 
rezek equipment co a san bernardino calif company that 
provides fire camp services and which helped arrange for the dish 
this is just so the guys will have something to watch said 
carl hopkins who work for aquaone another california company 
that normally provides shower and water purification equipment to 
fire camps and decided to throw in the satellite dish 
while its not unusual for fire camps to have televisions and 
videocassette recorders for entertainment hopkins said he hasnt 
heard of any other camps getting their own satellite dish 
this is kind of an experimental thing agreed mack 
the signal from the dish runs to a 40inch television set in the 
grand a large canvas tent equipped with 17 log benches and a 
woodburning stove for the cold wyoming nights 
live television isnt the only benefit enjoyed by the 
clovermist firefighters theres a truckbased laundry service 
that processes two tons of clothes each day hot and cold showers 
a small library and a tent phone booth with two directdial phones

the foreign ministers of the 101nation 
nonaligned movement sunday criticized the united states south 
africa and israel and expressed support for nicaragua 
in a statement at the end of their fourday annual conference 
the ministers charged that the situation in south africa and israel 
has worsened considerably and reiterated a call for sanctions 
against both 
the conference which was attended by 95 of the 101 members 
condemned south africa for acts of genocide against its black 
population and a policy of state terrorism 
the ministers expressed their indignation and dismay that 
certain western nations continued to aid and abet apartheid 
economically financially politically and diplomatically 
they said they regret that efforts by the un security council 
to impose sanctions on south africa were blocked by american and 
british vetoes 
the ministers called on the united nations to take over 
temporary supervision of the israelioccupied territories to 
protect palestinians from the acts of terrorism and atrocities 
by israel more than 260 palestinians have been killed in the 
10monthold uprising and thousands have been detained five 
israelis also have died 
the nonaligned movement friday drafted a resolution supporting 
the palestine liberation organizaions plan to declare an 
independent palestinian state in the occupied territories the 
ministers called for the nonaligned movement to financially aid 
the palestinians 
the resolution emerged from a session by the conferences 
ninemember palestine committee which includes the plo cuba 
senegal india yugoslavia zambia zimbabwe algeria and 
bangladesh 
on another subject in the final statement the ministers 
expressed support for the leftist sandinista government of 
nicaragua a member of the nonaligned movement and demanded an 
end to the financing of the usbacked contra rebels 
in a separate document the ministers said prospects for the 
world economy were gloomy and that the prolonged crisis in 
the international economic situation was widening the gap between 
the developed and the nonaligned and other developing countries

reversal of the flow of resources from developing to developed 
countries and an increased access to the markets of the developed 
countries 
the conference also adopted a special nicosia declaration 
which mandates a special committee appointed by the conference to 
take steps to streamline the organization of the movement 
many of the delegates to the conference criticized the 
nonaligned movement for becoming stagnated and losing its 
credibility 
the conference ended with the choice by consensus of yugoslavia 
one of the founding members of the movement in l961 as the host 
of next years summit conference of nonaligned states this 
automatically gives it the chairmanship of the movement for the 
next three years 
yugoslavia emerged as a compromise when two other declared 
candidates indonesia and nicaragua failed to win a consensus

unless nature is generous with 
moisture in the coming months fires in yellowstone national park 
could continue to burn until next summer a veteran forest ranger 
says 
we periodically have fires that will hold over through the 
winter and start up again in the spring says skip starkey a 
fire management specialist and 11year veteran of the us forest 
service 
certainly there is a possibility for that to happen he 
says it would depend on what kind of snow we get this winter 
what kind of rain we get this fall and next spring 
starkey based at the bozeman headquarters of the gallatin 
national forest in montana escorted a group of reporters and 
photographers saturday during a visit to the park by interior 
secretary donald hodel agriculture secretary richard lyng and 
assistant defense secretary william taft iv 
although there have been technical advances in fighting forest 
fires including infrared aerial photography computer modeling and 
sophisticated weather analysis starkey said 
firefighting is not an exact science by any stretch of the 
imagination theres still a lot of art to it 
he pointed out various fire patterns in the lodgepole pine 
stands along the 30mile stretch of road between west yellowstone 
and old faithful in some areas flames skipped randomly blackening 
some trees and sparing others the fire crowned other sections 
of forest by jumping from treetop to treetop and in other areas 
lessintense flames crept along the ground leaving an ashen forest 
floor but trees that were still green and healthy 
you dont get a continuous complete burn all over in a 
forest fire he explained its like a mosaic 
starkey said many of the dead trees on the forest floor were 
killed not by flames but by lodgepole pine beetles and with its 
shallow root system the lodgepole pine can easily be blown over in 
a stiff wind 
this provides a major source of fuel for advancing fires but 
the lodgepole pine actually depends on fires to release its seeds 
from their cones starkey explained 
during the drive between old faithful and west yellowstone rain 
began to fall 
this sprinkle isnt going to help except it raises the 
humidity starkey said spots dont ignite as easily 
theres less of a chance it will result in a fire 
this is the biggest benefit from a day like this you can get 
in there and work close to the fire the fire is less able to 
generate explosive behavior 
but the rain continued and grew from a mere sprinkle to a 
respectable drizzle 
thats the kind of weather i like starkey said id like 
to see about two weeks of this

the head of the nations space flight program 
cautioned sunday that nasa might not be able to launch space 
shuttle discovery on the first attempt late this month 
i think that when we get do get to a launch date on the latter 
part of this month it wouldnt surprise me at all if it took us 
two or three times to get airborne said rear adm richard truly 
the head of the shuttle program 
truly who is nasa associate administrator for space flight 
said that if two recent successful simulations of crew and launch 
systems had been the real thing a launch would not have taken 
place because of weather and winds 
were going to wait until we have it right and then were 
going to do it said truly a twotime shuttle astronaut i 
think the american people expect that of us and thats what were 
going to do 
appearing on abctvs this week with david brinkley truly 
shied away from revealing a date for the launch of the first 
shuttle since the challenger exploded on liftoff in january 1986 
except to say it probably will be late in september 
it will be the last week in september unless there is a 
hiccup he said 
truly said the date will be announced after a twoday flight 
readiness review at cape canaveral fla on wednesday 
he said there has been no administration pressure to have the 
shuttle program restart before the election for whatever political 
advantage that might give to george bush 
ive felt a lot of stresses in the last 2 12 years said 
truly but thank god thats not one of them 
asked what he would say if such a call came from a high 
official truly replied id say not on my watch

bourgeois capitalists set up tents 
beside leftist guerrillas and yves st laurent showed couture gowns 
at the annual celebration of french communism 
hundreds of thousands of people attended the weekend fete de 
lhumanite in this working class suburb north of paris it opened 
with the fashion show friday and closed sunday with a speech by 
party boss georges marchais 
lhumanite is the french communist newspaper a similar fair for 
the italian communist party daily lunita took place in campi di 
bisenzio outside florence 
the french festival was reminiscent of huge country fair 
complete with carnival rides kewpie dolls and acres of food 
but ideology was everywhere 
bumper cars faced stands emblazoned with a huge 
hammersandsickles glasnost tshirts referring to the soviet 
campaign for greater openness were a hot item game prizes 
included a free trip for two to the soviet union 
stands offering russian caviar and tea served from samovars 
competed with hundreds of others serving brittany crepes alsatian 
choucroute and every sort of french regional dish 
an african national congress booth sold buttons of the south 
african guerrilla groups jailed leader nelson mandela nearby 
were stands where representatives from the dutch electronics firm 
phillips and the german hightech corporation telefunken pitched 
their newest products 
the customers are not our usual ones but there are so many 
people here we cant really afford to miss this said an 
encyclopedia salesman who had a volume opened to an entry on karl 
marx and a sign saying he accepted credit cards 
the variety of booths this year is greater than ever and may 
reflect an effort by the party to modernize its stodgy doctrinaire 
image to conform with changes in french society 
since socialist president francois mitterrand reinvigorated his 
party after his election in 1981 french communism has been in 
steep decline once capable of winning a quarter of the popular 
vote the partys official candidate andre lejoinie garnered only 
68 percent of the vote in presidential balloting last spring the 
lowest score since the party was founded in 1920 
analysts blame the fall on several factors including the 
inability of the party to adapt to modern society where the number 
of blue collar workers has significantly diminished reducing the 
ranks of traditional communist faithful 
voters now tend to be better educated more sophisticated and 
less doctrinaire 
like everywhere in europe the communist party in france the 
agent of modernization for decades is now obsolete said the 
french newspaper le monde in an article sunday under a headline 
the identity crisis of the communist worker 
but one communist worker daniel gauter disagrees a bus driver 
from the southwestern town of angouleme and secretary of the local 
party gauter is hopeful that the upcoming district elections will 
show an increase in communist strength 
at his fair booth saturday night gauter served two girls a 
plate of steaming snails and talked to them about the elections 
one of those girls was unemployed and doesnt vote gauter 
35 said afterward she said she would vote with us at the end of 
this month and i think she will 
anyway he said she likes our party

parliament on sunday yielded to weeks of 
massive nationwide protests and approved holding the first 
multiparty elections since 1960 
the legislature appointed a group of elders to supervise the 
polling and set a target date for about three months from saturday 
when president maung maung announced the ruling burma socialist 
program party would relinquish its 26year monopoly on power 
despite government concessions opposition leaders continued to 
press for an interim government to cope with burmas growing chaos 
and demonstrations continued in the capital 
maung maung issued a stern warning to demonstrators who have 
taken to the streets by the millions since spring in their fight 
for democracy 
people are now fed up with this lawlessness and are expecting 
the government to take effective action maung maung said i 
therefore warn those responsible for the lawlessness to cease such 
activities 
in some areas of burma he said students and buddhist monks 
were setting up rival local governments creating a grave and 
dangerous situation for those responsible 
it is essential to remove them immediately he said 
he called on demonstrators to get back to work and on civil 
servants to reactivate the stalled machinery of government in 
addition he attacked the recent formation of a rival government by 
former prime minister u nu 
maung maung called sundays decision a milestone in burmese 
history 
it will be evident in 20 years time whether the decision was 
correct or not he told the 489member parliament 
while authorizing elections in about three months parliament 
also held out the possibility that they could be postponed or held 
as early as november 
parliament empowered the council of state the highest 
government organ to change the constitution to permit a multiparty 
system enlarge the elections commission if necessary and formulate 
election rules 
named to the elections supervision commission were three retired 
civil servants a retired army brigadier general and a former 
member of parliament the men all over 70 years of age are 
generally regarded as neutral although not especially prominent 
at least four are not members of the ruling party 
the parliament session was held under tight security and 
delegates slept in the building saturday night the area was 
cordoned off with barbedwire fences and road blocks manned by 
troops 
the multiparty elections would be the first in burma since feb 
6 1960 when u nus clean antifacist peoples freedom league won 
a massive victory over an armybacked party u nu was overthrown by 
the military on march 2 1962 the coup led by gen ne win 
ushered in rigid oneparty rule 
maung maung urged burmas 22 million voters to use their 
potent weapon the vote to choose the right representatives 
power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely 
maung maung told the party congress saturday quoting the 19th 
century british historian lord acton when one has power one 
wallows in its luxury and when one has no power one thirsts for 
it 
the westerntrained lawyer and author the countrys first 
civilian leader in 26 years said he would not run in the elections 
and the powerful military will not lobby for any party in the 
general elections 
a western diplomat in rangoon said the burmese people were 
highly skeptical of the recent government moves 
they dont trust the government to keep this promise of 
elections said the diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
they perceive it as another trick 
meanwhile 218 dependents of diplomats and nonessential 
staffers including 59 americans left rangoon sunday on a special 
thai airways international flight to bangkok thailand 
yuji kurokawa counselor at the japanese embassy said there 
were 102 japanese aboard including eight officials three burmese 
married to japanese 32 united nations officials and their 
families and some west germans and britons he said the americans 
included embassy dependents and aid officials 
more than 230 people flew out friday as a precautionary move 
all the people who wanted to come out have come out and 
there will be no more evacuations for now kurokawa told the 
associated press 
in recent weeks the government has made one concession after 
another 
ne win resigned as head of the ruling party in july citing 
widespread street protests in march and june as a factor in his 
decision 
when sein lwin a hardliner widely hated for his brutal 
suppression of dissidents was chosen to succeed him riots 
erupted troops killed 112 protesters the government said but 
western diplomats said the number was much higher 
sein lwin resigned aug 12 after 17 days in power and maung 
maung was named to replace him martial law was lifted and 
activities that before would have drawn prison terms or worse were 
allowed

pakistani embassy in the afghan capital kabul on sunday killing 10 
people and injuring about 40 others tass said

the lives of some 10 people including women and children tass 
said according to preliminary information another 40 kabul 
residents were injured

in peshawar pakistan near the afghan border six people were 
injured when a bomb went off in a crowded marketplace near a 
garment shop said a police spokesman 
no one claimed responsibility for the explosion but pakistan 
blames such terrorist activities on the soviettrained afghan 
secret service khad peshawar in the headquarters of the 
anticommunist afghan guerrilla movement 
the usbacked insurgents are fighting to overthrow the 
sovietbacked government of president najib 
rocket and other blasts have become almost daily in kabul the 
afghan capital since the soviet troop withdrawal began on may 15

withdrawing the estimated 115000 soldiers it had stationed in 
afghanistan leaving the fighting to afghan government forces

the federal and state prison population grew 
by 4 percent in the first six months of 1988 to a record 604824 
inmates with female prisoners increasing at a far higher rate than 
males the federal bureau of justice statistics said sunday 
the justice department agency said the sixmonth increase of 
23240 prisoners would require adding 900 new prison beds every 
week 
lawrence greenfeld bureau director of correctional statistics 
attributed the increase partly to stricter parole supervision with 
a higher number of parole violators being returned to prison and a 
wider use of mandatory minumum sentences for repeat drug offenses 
and other serious crimes 
the gain in female prisoners reflects a trend toward more 
frequent drug convictions among women than men greenfeld said 
he said the sixmonth increase in all federal and state 
prisoners fit the pattern of similar growth in the past two or 
three years resulting from revised sentencing guidelines by the 
states 
the largest percentage increases from jan 1 through june 30 
occurred in rhode island which reported 179 percent more inmates 
the district of columbia had 136 percent more and new hampshire 
128 percent the bureau said 
california which added 5146 inmates for a 77 percent increase 
during that period accounted for 22 percent of the nationwide 
growth in the prison population and housed nearly 12 percent of all 
federal and state prisoners the report said 
another record reported by the bureau was the number of 
prisoners with sentences of more than one year 237 per 100000 
us residents compared with 139 such prisoners at the end of 
1980 
the bureau said the number of female inmates grew 67 percent so 
far this year compared with 39 percent for males 
since 1980 the number of female prisoners has increased 130 
percent to a total of 30834 last june 30 male prisoners increased 
by 81 percent in the same period to a total of 573990 the bureau 
said 
during the full year ended june 30 state prison populations 
grew by 62 percent reaching 555666 inmates while the number of 
federal prison inmates increased by 32 percent to a total of 
49158

pope john paul ii appealed sunday for 
reconciliation racial harmony and human rights in southern africa 
a region teeming with tribal racial and political problems 
john pauls first full day on his tour of the region was crammed 
with events beginning with a meeting with the countrys seven 
roman catholic bishops and ending with a session with diplomats 
in between he celebrated a 2hour mass before more than 
200000 people met with members of the laity and spoke to 30000 
youths at a jammed sports stadium 
his comments did not have the political edge that they did 
saturday when he arrived here for 10 days of travel through five 
blackruled countries that are neighbors to whiteled south africa 
on saturday the pope talked of powerful political economic and 
ideological forces that endanger the stability of the region and 
who fomented ethnic and tribal conflicts 
though he did not identify any country he clearly linked south 
africa to his comments when he said they were true for the grave 
issue of apartheid pretorias system of racial segregation 
in a symbolic gesture toward the south african catholic church 
the pope invited the former archbishop of capetown to join his 
official party for the rest of his fivenation africa tour 
and in another development aimed at creating what the vatican 
called an atmosphere of conciliation a spokesman welcomed 
mondays meeting between south african president pw botha and his 
mozambican counterpart joaquim chissano 
chissanos government alleges that south africa supports an 
11yearold guerrilla insurgency in mozambique 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro told reporters that cardinal 
owen mccann 71 archbishop emeritus of capetown would travel on 
to botswana lesotho swaziland and mozambique on the popes plane 
mccann who is white is considered a moderate 
politics did not figure in john pauls talks with diplomats 
instead he urged the officials to use their influence to help 
africa with its food problems refugees and development 
the countries of africa themselves must be in charge of their 
own development and historic destiny he said outside aid is 
urgently needed but it will only be helpful in the long term if 
the essential force of growth and development is truly africa 
the pope celebrated mass from a scaffold altar the size of a 
small house at barrowdale park race course tens of thousands of 
people many from the neighboring countries of south africa 
malawi zambia and tanzania sat on the ground in the infield 
thousands more crowded the vip stands 
parish choirs sang traditional hymns to the accompaniment of 
animal skin drums and trumpets made from antelope horns 
before the mass began three women carrying on their heads clay 
pots filled with water climbed the steps of the towering altar and 
kneeled before the pope 
waterfilled pots are traditional symbols of welcome and 
hospitality in southern africa 
as john paul accepted the gift the crowd which included 
president robert mugabe applauded and chanted in shona the 
tribal language of 70 percent of zimbabwes 85 million people

the house faces renewed antidrug amendment 
battles this week including votes on proposals to fine drug users 
10000 and induce states to take away their right to drive 
as lawmakers resume amending their allinclusive drug fighting 
bill on wednesday they also must decide whether to retain a 
sevenday waiting period for handgun purchasers along with an 
optional police background check 
rep bill mccollum rfla will try to eliminate the gun 
control language from the 375page bill that would add some 2 
billion to the nations 39 billion war on drugs 
his proposed substitute would establish a system for gun sellers 
to run a check by phone or other means to determine if a purchaser 
is a convicted felon 
congress also is wrestling with a number of other domestic and 
foreign issues this week abortion insider trading job leave 
sanctions against south africa child care welfare reform and 
textile import curbs 
the house drug bill likely will receive a final vote thursday or 
friday last week those favoring the harshest possible penalties 
won amendment battles that attached provisions for a federal death 
penalty denial of government benefits for twice convicted drug 
users and court admission of evidence seized illegally by police 
acting in good faith 
attorney general richard l thornburgh interviewed sunday on 
nbctvs meet the press said he supports the change in 
evidence rules because time and again because of some technical 
shortcoming the failure to dot an i or cross a t an 
important drug kingpin or other criminal can be turned loose 
he said he also supports provisions affecting government 
benefits but opposes a change that would authorize the cia to 
conduct covert operations against drug operations overseas 
rep charles b rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics said on the same show the death penalty was 
morally wrong and would not deter bums that are dealing in 
drugs who attach little value to human life 
he said it also would make it more difficult to obtain 
extraditions of drug suspects from countries opposed to the death 
penalty 
speaker jim wright dtexas expressing his personal opinion 
told reporter last week he supports the handgun waiting period 
i cant see that its an infringement on the rights of any 
lawabiding citizen to have a simple waiting period he said 
if youve got to have a gun right this minute youve got to 
have some violent intent a responsible person wouldnt mind 
waiting seven days 
the national rifle association has told lawmakers that criminals 
would obtain guns regardless of the waiting period and that only 
lawabiding citizens would suffer from the delay 
rep mickey edwards rokla will propose civil penalties of up 
to 10000 per violation against those found to be in possession of 
small personal use amounts of marijuana cocaine and other 
controlled substances 
proof of guilt for a civil offense only requires clear and 
convincing evidence while a criminal conviction demands proof of 
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt 
conflicting amendments will be offered that could affect the 
drivers licenses of anyone convicted of drug offenses including 
possession 
rep glenn m anderson dcalif would provide up to 125 
million over three years to states with drug enforcement programs 
that include license suspension or revocation for convicted drug 
offenders 
mccollum will counter with a plan to require withholding a 
portion of us highway money from states failing to enact 
suspension or revocation provisions 
the senate must decide what to do with a 140 billion social 
programs spending bill that has but one area of disagreement 
between the two houses abortion 
senators previously passed the legislation with an expansion of 
the medicaid program to cover abortions for rape and incest 
victims the house last friday refused to accept that provision of 
the labor education and health and human services spending bill 
the senate is expected to give final approval and send the house 
a bill that would freeze this years textile and apparel imports at 
1987 levels and allow 1 percent annual growth thereafter it would 
bar increases in nonrubber footwear import levels 
proponents say the measure which president reagan is expected 
to veto would save jobs in the importravaged textile and apparel 
industries critics contend the industry is no longer suffering 
in the house passage is expected for an insider trading measure 
which for the first time would make it possible for securities 
firms to be fined for violations committed by their employees it 
also would increase prison terms and fines 
some key measures wont reach the house floor this week 
supporters of a bill to guarantee unpaid jobprotected leave for 
new parents have postponed a planned vote this week as they 
continue to negotiate compromises 
the senate foreign relations committee has scheduled a wednesday

flood waters began to recede sunday 
and the government said it has received 236 million in aid to 
fight the destruction and disease caused by the worst floods in 
memory 
thousands of lives were threatened by diarrhea caused by 
drinking water contaminated with sewage and garbage washed up by 
raging flood waters health officials said 
more than 200000 people have contracted the disease and at 
least 123 have died from it said the officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity the disease kills by dehydration 
as river levels began to fall after two weeks of flooding many 
residents returned to their homes said officials at the flood 
control center they said they expect the water level to drop 
quicky starting monday 
the floods covered threequarters of the nation and 53 of the 
countrys 64 districts with a population of 30 million said 
information minister mahbubur rahman 
he said 866 people have died of drowning snakebites and 
disease the government figure is considered low and newspapers 
estimate at least 1532 people have died 
the world has responded promptly and generously to our appeal 
for help to the flood victims rahman told reporters 
he said the united states pledged 150 million in aid on 
saturday in addition to 26 million committed earlier more funds 
and relief supplies have arrived from japan the soviet union the 
european economic community india pakistan and saudi arabia 
among others he said 
the soviet union has offerred 100 tents 1000 blankets and 100 
tons of medicine he said 
danielle mitterrand wife of the french president francois 
mitterrand will visit the floodaffected areas during her fourday 
tour starting monday 
rahman estimated the damage from flooding would exceed 14 
billion and that 6000 to 10000 tons of grains stored in 
warehouses were damaged or destroyed by water 
the government of hussain muhammad ershad is struggling against 
a shortage of helicopters and boats to get food and medicines to 
people stranded in the countryside 
hundreds of volunteer organizations many run by christian 
missionaries are aiding in the massive relief effort but 
reporters have visited areas where the first relief supplies did 
not arrive until saturday 
we are pooling all our resources to ensure relief but we do 
not have sufficient volunteers to reach all the places in a short 
while rahman said 
he said however that the country has enough food to meet 
immediate needs and that the government would ensure that nobody 
dies of starvation during the floods 
rahman said he hoped the flooding of the past few weeks would 
be natures last big slap to this impoverished nation this year

consider yourself warned 
a hefty helping of granola or wholewheat bread could contain 
enough natural lsd to produce mild high the dragons of fairy tales 
really may have existed and a violent collision between earth and 
a swarm of comets is overdue 
welcome to the weird and wonderful world of the british 
association for the advancement of science which concluded its 
annual meeting at oxford university 50 miles northwest of london 
the association was established in 1831 to promote general 
interest in all branches of science 
while it still produces some of the most important and advanced 
research in britain its annual meetings are also a forum for more 
farfetched concepts designed to stimulate debate 
for example eating eight to 10 slices of wholewheat bread or a 
large bowl of granola or bran flakes in one sitting may induce a 
mild euphoria because of wheats natural lsd content said dr 
david conning director of the british nutrition foundation 
lsd a popular hallucinogen in the 1960s is produced naturally 
by ergot a common fungal infestation of wheat that may survive 
food processing conning told the meeting 
he said a highbran diet could result in a daily consumption of 
100 micrograms of lsd or four times the minimum dose needed to 
produce an effect on an inexperienced user of the drug 
david unwin of the palaeontological institute in moscow told the 
conference the dragons of fairy tales may have existed he said 
they were flying dinosaurs with 16foot wingspans and dominated the 
skies 140 million years ago 
speaking of dinosaurs walter alvarez a professor at the 
university of california at berkeley said the only possible 
explanation for their extinction 65 million years ago was a 
sixmile wide asteroid hitting earth with an explosive force equal 
to 100 million megatons of tnt 
as proof alvarez cites the amount of the metallic chemical 
iridium in rocks laid down at that time iridium is rare in the 
earths crust he said and the high levels found in rocks of that 
era must have come from an extraterrestrial source 
dr victor clube an astrophysicist at oxford university warned 
that a collision between earth and a swarm of comets is overdue and 
will certainly happen within 100 years in a worstcase scenario 
it will produce effects similar to a nuclear war he warned 
meanwhile mans best friend got a new look at the meeting 
dr willem hackmann of oxfords museum of the history of science 
exhibited a computerized watchdog that uses ultrasound or 
highfrequency sound waves to detect intruders 
hackmann said the watchdogs snarl gets louder and louder as the 
intruder approaches but he admitted the sound is more like a 
rumbling thunderstorm than a canine bark there are hopes of 
improving that he said 
oxfords professor michael brady said a robot guide dog for the 
blind is in the early stages of development but still needs 
refinements 
the robot which also uses ultrasound could now guide a blind 
person along an uncluttered street but would have trouble 
separating individual objects or people in crowded areas brady 
said 
currently robots arent as smart as a yearold sheep he 
lamented

unions vowed sunday to shut down 
the capital and argentinas main cities to protest the governments 
use of force to break up an antigovernment rally 
the strike which will affect schools banks public 
transportation and government offices is set for monday 
the labor unions said the walkout was in response to a police 
breakup of a rally on friday that was part of a national strike to 
protest president raul alfonsins economic reforms 
thirtyseven police officers were among the 113 people injured 
when police used tear gas rubber bullets and water cannon to 
disperse a crowd of 20000 union members 
the unusual and ferocious attack unacceptable in a democracy 
was perpetrated by forces of repression more interested in beating 
innocent demonstrators than guaranteeing the security of people and 
property the general labor confederation said sunday 
teachers bank clerks bus drivers construction workers public 
employees and other groups in the capital buenos aires and in the 
cities of cordoba rosario and mar del plata said they would stay 
off their jobs in support of the strike 
the strike also has been endorsed by the centerleft peronist 
party and leftist communist socialist intransigent and christian 
democrat parties 
alfonsin said in a statement that his government would guarantee 
the security of the services of public transport throughout the 
country 
the presidents centerright radical civic union says security 
forces intervened in fridays rally to stop fighting and vandalism 
that already had broken out 
alfonsins program of economic reforms are aimed at curbing 
inflation that has soared to 440 percent in the past year and a 14 
percent unemployment rate personal incomes have declined for three 
straight years 
the unions contend the antiinflation plan alfonsin introduced 
in august does not allow wages to keep pace with costofliving 
increases and that the government must resort to repression to 
support an economic program that is unpopular 
the 35 million union members also oppose alfonsins efforts to 
sell off inefficient state industries which employ tens of 
thousands of union members

a new battle is brewing at the site 
of one of the souths greatest victories in the civil war this 
time pitting federal historians trying to preserve the battlefield 
against local officials who want to make the land available for 
commercial development 
the conflict centers on the battlefield where gen stonewall 
jackson led 14000 confederate troops in a threeday siege in 1862 
eventually forcing the 12500man union army to give up the 
norths largest surrender of the war 
the battlegrounds location along a highway just outside harpers 
ferry national historical park makes it ideal for development 
harpers ferry is at the easternmost tip of west virginia just an 
hours drive from the washington metropolitan area and its booming 
real estate market 
national park service officials however want to preserve it as 
it was during the civil war 
it all happened right there said donald campbell harpers 
ferry national park supervisor its a highly significant piece 
of american history its certainly the most important battlefield 
in the state of west virginia 
its just inappropriate to go in there and start digging with 
bulldozers young soldiers fought and died for their country on 
that land 
the jefferson county commission however recently zoned the 
privately owned land for highdensity housing commission president 
garland moore said the panel didnt see any reason to hold back the 
land 
the federal and the state governments own a large hunk of 
jefferson county already moore said you cant keep taking 
land off the tax books and expect to survive 
there was a lot of civil war activity in jefferson county if 
we set aside every piece of land in jefferson county that civil war 
troops fought on we wouldnt have anything left 
the park service cant control what is done with land outside 
its jurisdiction and therefore must appeal to the county and state 
governments to fight development campbell said 
preserving anything is up to the people campbell said if 
the people want it preserved history will be preserved if they 
dont history will be lost we can only raise the issue 
the dispute at harpers ferry is not the only battle over 
development at a civil war site around washington plans to 
construct a shopping mall outside the manassas battlefield national 
park in northern virginia site of two important battles have 
drawn strong opposition 
moore said the commissions zoning ruling on the harpers ferry 
site is not necessarily permanent were certainly willing to 
listen he said 
the park service and the harpers ferry town government already 
have enacted easements sharply restricting construction in sight of 
the historic town where abolitionist john brown conducted his 
infamous raid in 1859 when west virginia was still part of 
virginia the town much of it preserved in precivil war 
condition is one of the states top tourist attractions 
we adopted the plan to restrict ourselves said harpers 
ferry mayor bill brawley the mass majority of the people like 
what we have we dont want townhouses or apartment houses in the 
town 
but brawley said attempts to build in the area surrounding the 
park have provoked a continuing battle between local government 
and the park service 
they dont want any development anywhere brawley said

newly crowned miss america gretchen 
elizabeth carlson a classical violinist and stanford university 
student with hopes of law school said sunday she plans to become a 
corporate executive 
im definitely an overachiever she told reporters 
this wasnt luck said miss carlson entered in the pageant 
as miss minnesota said of her selection as miss america 1989 she 
added that she is not superstitious and brought no goodluck charms 
to the pageant 
miss carlson 22 of anoka minn performed a spirited violin 
solo titled gypsy airs she has been studying violin for 17 
years winning national and state competitions and performing a 
solo with the minnesota orchestra 
after winning a preliminary talent competition last week she 
confidently told reporters parts of her performance were 
exquisite 
pageant officials took pains this year to emphasize that the 
judges were looking for an articulate educated dynamic role 
model and not a beauty queen 
miss carlson was crowned early sunday by her predecessor kaye 
lani rae rafko the selection of miss america 1989 was delayed 
almost 12 minutes when judges had to cast new ballots to break a 
tie for second runnerup 
during the delay miss carlson said id lost confidence 
i really thought it was all over at that point i saw a judge look 
down at a book and look at a picture and shake their head and i 
thought oh no its me 
miss carlson is several credits away from graduating from 
stanford with a degree in organizational behavior she said she 
would like to attend harvard law school and become a successful 
corporate executive 
for the next year she will tour the country promoting not only 
the miss america scholarship program but also the products of the 
pageants corporate sponsors including underwear orange juice 
pantyhose and hair coloring 
miss rafko a registered nurse used her reign to promote the 
nursing field 
miss carlson said she would like to focus on education for the 
children of tomorrow specifically she would like to see 
children receive more education on values teaching children to 
be less narcissistic 
today children tend to be more in love with themselves instead 
of being in love with other people she said 
when asked what kind of miss america she would make miss 
carlson laughed and replied a short one she stands 5foot3 
miss carlson a greeneyed blonde of swedish descent admitted 
she lightens her hair with hair coloring but said contestants 
should not be allowed to change their bodies through cosmetic 
surgery as some have 
miss carlson said that when she was 16 she weighed about 128 
pounds she now weighs 108 
when i used to be fat my brothers used to call me blimpo 
she said i wanted to go out with the star basketball player 
at school and he said shes such a nice girl but shes just a 
little too plump 
so i went on this major diet and lost all this weight and then 
he wanted to go out with me but i said no 
miss carlson also said she would like to see the miss america 
pageant include a scholarship category the competition now has 
talent swimsuit evening gown and interview categories 
leonard horn pageant executive director said its not a new 
suggestion the problem is that grade point average doesnt always 
mean that much there are a lot of successful people whose gpa 
wasnt that enviable 
the last miss minnesota to win the title of miss america was 
dorothy benham in 1977

yellowstone national park 
superintendent bob barbee says critics of the parks fire policy 
who blame the policy for major forest fires are directing a 
lynchmob hanghim mentality at him 
critics have an hysteric view that the area is on fire because 
of a misguided fire policy he said in an interview saturday 
such a view that the entire american west is on fire because of 
a fire policy is ridiculous 
barbee was disputing recent comments by firefighters and 
residents of park gateway communities that the yellowstone fires 
could have been put out early if he had let firefighters use heavy 
equipment such as bulldozers and chain saws 
the national park fire management policy calls for minimal use 
of motorized and heavy equipment 
barbee said he absolutely feels fine that interior secretary 
donald hodel supported yellowstones fire management practices 
during his tour of the fires saturday 
but hodel said sunday in boise idaho that the park services 
16yearold let burn policy didnt work under this years 
extremely dry conditions 
the old policy has to be reviewed and altered hodel said at 
the boise interagency fire center which coordinates fire 
suppression throughout the country nobody who has seen it 
operate this year could say it was a success 
during the 16 years 16000 fires burned a total of about 30000 
acres in the park hodel said but currently nearly 900000 acres 
of yellowstones 22 million acres are involved in flame 
well see a new policy in place before the beginning of the 
next fire year he said until then each new fire will be 
suppressed with all the equipment and manpower available 
barbee said he and other firefighting professionals have 
nothing to apologize for 
the very idea staggers me that people boo the efforts made to 
control the fires he said the best firefighting technology in 
the world is being used here 
barbee said he is sorry that people cannot accept the fact 
that conditions are so extreme and make firefighting difficult 
tourism will not decline in yellowstone because of the fires 
barbee insisted he said people will continue to visit the park to 
see the thermal features such as the geysers and the wildlife 
barbee said that in the past the park has not purposely lit 
fires to get rid of dead lodgepole pines that have helped fuel the 
fires because it isnt a practical method to get rid of dead trees 
under normal weather conditions lodgepole pines which covered 
80 percent of the park before the fires do not burn quickly and 
easily he said and yellowstones rugged terrain does not make 
it easy to control planned burns he added 
anyone who thinks planned burns would have prevented the present 
fire problems he said is chewing lotus seeds

a book published earlier this year predicts 
that a prelude to the end of the world will begin this week with 
millions of the faithful suddenly silently called to heaven and 
global disasters following 
the prospect increased attendance sunday at some churches the 
book has been a bestseller and some people have even quit their 
jobs in preparation for the end 
the lord is coming back im looking at it about any time 
now jerry mclamb 37 of coats said sunday he and workers at 
his automobile engine shop had rushed to complete customers orders 
last week 
will it happen im not a datesetter but im not a fool 
either said the rev max allman of peoples memorial christian 
church in burlington who urged worshipers in a sermon sunday to 
check out their priorities 
he said he knew of several people who had quit their jobs in 
recent weeks or taken leaves of absence in preparation and his 
church attendance has doubled in recent weeks 
this has made them understand that in a flash this could all 
be over he said 
the excitement stems from a prediction made by edgar c wisenant 
in his book 88 reasons why the rapture will be in 1988 
wisenant a former nasa rocket engineer uses mathematical 
calculations and biblical interpretation to pinpoint the beginning 
of the end to the 48 hours of this years jewish new year 40 
years and 120 days after israel became a nation on may 14 1948 
the jewish celebration runs from sunset sunday to sunset tuesday 
thats when the fires and famines are supposed to begin 
plagues and sickness like aids said geneva whitley 66 of 
bentley the plagues will end in november 1995 when christ 
returns wisenant says 
interest in the event has mushroomed so much that lately some 
christian bookstores have reported being unable to keep wisenants 
book in stock 
weve sold well over 1000 since the second week in july 
said joanna hicks coowner of the sign of the fish bookstores in 
the raleigh area 
some stores received free shipments of the 2 paperback last 
week from its publisher the world bible society of nashville 
tenn and were giving them away 
ive spent over 200000 personally in trying to get the word 
out to the faithful the bible societys publisher norville 
olive told the news and observer of raleigh 
barry blinson of wendell said he paid more than 1000 for books 
and for advertising time on a christian radio station in raleigh 
to warn people 
but not everyone who believes in the return of jesus christ says 
that his visit is at hand 
i just dont feel that the lord is ready to destroy the 
earth said chris avery whose husband is pastor of the hill 
street baptist church in asheville 
she said missionary baptist churches like many mainstream 
denominations teach that jesus will return and christians will go 
to heaven but we arent looking for it like that 
setting dates for the second coming of christ began as early as 
the 14th century said jim megivern chairman of the religion 
department at the university of north carolina at wilmington he 
called it calendarizing or taking the bible to its most 
literal extremes by certain interpreters of biblical prophecy 
james efird professor at duke universitys divinity school 
said history has recorded numerous instances where people awaited 
christs coming 
in the early 1900s he said a group of jehovahs witnesses 
dressed in white and stood on the mount of olives to greet him and 
around 1844 new york preacher william miller gathered a group of 
adventists in white robes twice to await the end of the world

william shakespeare once suggested killing all the 
lawyers as a way to rid society of squabbling and avarice 
lawyer bill berger and artist ricardo martinez have some rather 
irreverent suggestions on how to dispose of the bodies 
their book what to do with a dead lawyer is a compilation 
of drawings offering various scenarios to that end 
the legal profession is inclined to take itself too

about a dozen gang members held a man to 
the ground as he was stabbed to death during a rap concert where at 
least 13 people were either knifed or beaten police said sunday 
three of the stabbing victims were listed in critical condition 
deputy police chief otto geiger said investigators believe one 
gang was responsible for much of the violence at the nassau 
coliseum during saturday nights jam 88 which featured eric 
b and rakim kool moe dee and doug e fresh 
the killing was the latest in a series of violent incidents at 
rap concerts around the nation including two stabbings during a 
rundmc concert at the nassau coliseum last month 
geiger said metal detectors were used at the door and he did 
not know how the knives were taken into the arena where about 100 
private security guards and 100 nassau county police officers 
patrolled the audience of about 10000 
every precaution was taken to ensure the safety of those 
persons attending the concert said coliseum spokeswoman hilary 
hartung however there seems to be a small element in society 
that attends this type of concert solely for the purpose of 
creating problems for those who come to enjoy the show the nassau 
coliseum will not condone this type of behavior and will thoroughly 
investigate the future of rap concerts 
julio fuentes 19 was stabbed in the heart when he refused to 
relinquish the goldplated chains he was wearing geiger said 
he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at the nassau 
county medical center in east meadow

giving credibility

prime minister hussein musavi came under 
attack by opposition leaders sunday and warned the parliament that 
a vote of noconfidence in his new government will hamper irans 
postwar recovery 
for the sake of the country we must all try to be 
flexible said musavi addressing the 270member majlis or 
parliament before it began discussing his 21man cabinet 
according to tehran radio 
the radio monitored in nicosia said four members of the 
opposition criticized the new government while five representatives 
praised it 
the official islamic republic news agency said the confidence 
vote set earlier for sunday would be postponed a day 
the irna report said the majlis will listen to remarks of the 
governments representative in defense of the cabinet ministers 
before casting their votes for or against the cabinet 
divisions that have plagued the iranian leadership for years 
sharpened after tehrans abrupt july 18 acceptance of the un 
security councils ceasefire resolution in the 8yearold war with 
iraq iran agreed to the ceasefire after a string of military 
defeats 
diplomatic sources said musavi opposed the ceasefire which 
began aug 20 the acceptance was believed to have been 
masterminded by hashemi rafsanjani speaker of the parliament and 
irans military commander the second most powerful figure in iran 
after khomeini 
the parliamentary debate sunday was on the government musavi 
announced in july after parliamentary elections in april and may 
irna said the debate focused on the ministries of the interior 
the islamic revolutions guards corps agriculture labor and 
social affairs as well as post telegraph and telephones 
the prime minister warned if his ministers do not win a vote of 
confidence their offices will remain virtually vacant until 
presidential elections scheduled for next year 
musavi 46 submitted his resignation to president ali khamenei 
on monday claiming that as many as eight of his ministers faced 
noconfidence votes in parliament 
he retracted his resignation tuesday night after khamenei 
rejected it and ayatollah ruhollah khomeini publicly rebuked him 
for making the surprise move at such a critical juncture while iran 
was negotiating a peace settlement with iraq 
musavi a radical who favors tight state control of the economy 
opposes bringing in foreign companies to help iran rebuild he has 
warned that would drive iran its economy bled dry by the war deep 
into debt 
he is opposed by khamenei who has close links with the merchant 
class and conservative clerics and rafsanjani the leading 
advocate of ending irans isolation by improving links with the 
west 
some western economists estimate reconstruction will cost iran 
around 40 billion iran has foreign reserves estimated at 5 
billion but owes around 2 billion dollars 
iran like iraq is expected to boost its oil production 
currently restricted by an organization of petroleum exporting 
countries to pay its reconstruction bill but that would drive oil 
prices down

kurdish refugees at a camp near this 
eastern city cited a litany of ailments they said they suffered 
when the iraqi army drove them from their villages with poison gas 
my whole body itches one of my eyes is blinded i have 
trouble breathing iskender omer 58 said sunday 
he said he and other refugees left the town of zahor in northern 
iraq 20 days ago when iraqi planes began dropping chemical bombs on 
their village 
they made very little noise these bombs a yellow smoke 
emanated from them and a foul garliclike smell was in the air 
he told the associated press from his bed in one the 500 tents set 
up to house the refugees 
mustard gas is distinguishable by its garliclike smell 
he and his 30yearold son halil iskender said many people from 
their village died because they were closer to where the bombs 
fell the two said they saved themselved by throwing themselves 
into an irrigation canal 
the united states has accused iraq of using chemical weapons 
against its kurdish minority the us senate on friday approved 
economic sanctions against iraq 
turkey which has given sanctuary to about 60000 kurds fleeing 
the iraqi attacks said friday no evidence of chemical weapons use 
was found in screening the sick and injured among the refugees 
the turkish government set up a clinic with 10 doctors and 25 
nurses in the camp which houses 8000 refugees 
doctors say they have not determined that any of the deaths 
among the refugees or the symptoms of illnesses among the refugees 
were caused by poison gas 
these people have been on the road for days they suffer from 
exhaustion and various infections including eye infections said 
dr sinan seyfioglu 
seyfioglu believes their findings from the refugees neither 
confirm or deny the use of chemical weapons 
this does not mean iraq did not use poison gas but if these 
people had been exposed i dont believe they could make it over 
here he said 
but kurdish guerrillas in the camp near diyarbakir said they 
would still be in iraq fighting if they did not have to escape from 
chemical bomb attacks 
they showed a 3yearold boy isa ismail and said scabs 
covering his entire face are the result of poison gas 
where we come from birds no longer fly even the animals are 
dead said cemal salih wearing the baggy brown pants which is 
the uniform of the peshmergas the kurdish guerrillas 
we ran without burying our dead he said he said along 
with others that he was willing to go back and show the dead 
bodies to observers if it were possible

you dont stop social processes with crime or by force he 
said speaking through by telephone from the besieged palace to the 
only santiago radio station that not been taken over by the 
military gunfire and explosions could be heard in the background

it we can feel it allende is here

tens of thousands of iraqis paraded past 
the us embassy on sunday to denounce a us senate call for 
sanctions in response to iraqs alleged use of poison gas against 
kurdish rebels 
usa shame shame the protesters chanted in english as 
they marched past the embassy members of the ruling arab baath 
socialist party exhorted them through loudspeakers 
we will never forget us evil read one banner no to 
intervention in our affairs read another in both arabic and 
english 
down with the us knesset said another banner referring 
to close us ties with israel whose parliament is called the 
knesset 
about 20000 marchers filed past the embassy for two hours 
the crowd was orderly even cheerful and there was no apparent 
threat to the embassy one ranking us diplomat stood on the 
sidewalk a few feet from the march and watched it move by 
iraqi president saddam hussein said in a statement sunday that 
the us senate aims to divert the attention of the international 
media from the uprising in the occupied territories 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip have been rioting 
against israels military occupation for the past nine months 
saddam said the fighting with the kurdish insurgents lasted 
at most two days and no serious battles were involved he 
reiterated the charge that the tens of thousand of kurds who fled 
across the iraqi border to turkey and iran were forced by kurdish 
rebels who were seeking publicity for their cause 
kurdish rebels said that as many as 60000 iraqi troops attacked 
their positions in the northern mountains after the aug 20 
ceasefire with iran in the eightyear gulf war the rebels of the 
kurdish democratic party said 2000 kurdish civilians were killed 
and 5000 wounded many in chemical weapon attacks 
the us senate voted friday to demand economic sanctions 
against iraq after secretary of state george shultz declared that 
iraq used chemical weapons outlawed under a 1925 geneva treaty 
against its northern kurdish population 
the measure still before the house would have to be signed by 
president reagan before taking effect it was designed to make it 
difficult for iraq to obtain international credit to pay off its 
estimated 60 billion war debt 
well before the latest iraqi assault on the kurds a number of 
united nations investigations concluded that iraq and to a lesser 
extent iran had engaged in chemical warfare since 1984 
let the american knesset and its masters understand that iraq 
is not a country that can be subject to threats iraq which seeks 
sincere and honorable relations with all is ready to spit on all 
insincere approaches said an editorial in althawra urging 
iraqis to take to the streets 
it was not signed but it carried the tag line often used by 
president saddam hussein himself to hell with the villains 
the army newspaper alqadissiyeh denounced the senate vote with 
banner headlines 
the attacks were the strongest on the united states since the 
two countries restored relations in 1984 they were severed after 
the united states supported israel in the 1967 middle east war 
hussein also said sunday he turned down an offer by unidentified 
people in washington to trade 100 usmade artillery pieces for an 
advanced soviet tank iraq had during the war 
in a speech broadcast on staterun television the president did 
not specify who offered the 175mm guns for the t72 tank but said 
his intelligence chief conducted negotiations for them in 
washington he hinted the talks took place in 1982 after some 
countries banned arms sales to iraq 
the united states banned arms sales to both sides during the 
war although administration officials violated that policy by 
selling arms to iran in an effort to improve relations and free 
american hostages held in lebanon 
in a related development the iraqi news agency reported that 
11517 kurds accepted the iraqi governments offer of amnesty for 
supporting iran in the persian gulf war and any other actions 
against the government 
the report quoting unidentified officials said kurds were 
pouring through the gates of the borders 
newspapers in neighboring kuwait also attacked the senate vote 
editorials in progovernment papers said the us campaign was 
inspired by the zionist lobby in the united states 
the kuwaiti papers said arab states could replace any funding 
denied through international institutions because of a us veto

sixthlargest city which declined in only one year between 1979 
and 1986 
we dont love our children enough said dr rosalind 
griffin a detroit psychiatrist with a homicide rate like this 
it can be said that we dont cherish or think of them as the 
future 
the free press citing a computer study it commissioned of fbi 
crime statistics from 1979 through 1986 and related research said 
detroits juvenile homicide rate during that period was 27 per 
100000 residents 
chicago was second at 19 per 100000 followed by los angeles 
with 16 per 100000 the overall rate for the nations 10 largest 
cities was 13 per 100000 
detroits juvenile homicide rate reached 41 per 100000 in 
1986 the latest year for which figures were available that rate 
was more than three times the 1986 rate in the 10 largest us 
cities 13 per 100000 
detroit also had the highest overall homicide rate 47 per 
100000 residents among the 10 largest cities in 197986 dallas

frederic v malek george bushs recent choice 
as deputy chairman of the republican national committee resigned 
sunday on the heels of a report that he compiled figures on the 
number of jews in the bureau of labor statistics under orders from 
thenpresident richard nixon 
malek announced his resignation in a statement in which he did 
not deny compiling the figures but did deny he was responsible for 
the demotion of any officials in the department he said he didnt 
want the campaign to be distracted by the controversy 
malek had acknowledged to the washington post that he had 
compiled the figures 
malek had been picked by bush to manage the republican national 
convention in august he later moved to the deputy chairs slot 
with daytoday responsibility for the partys fall campaign his 
resignation was effective immediately 
bush issued a simultaneous statement saying fred malek made 
this decision to step aside because he did not want this campaign 
to be caught up in allegations about something that happened many 
years ago and that some might try to use against me 
the post reported sunday that former president nixon had ordered 
malek in 1971 to investigate what was described in notes as a 
jewish cabal at the agency 
at the time malek was nixons white house personnel chief and 
had been assigned to evaluate the bls staff because nixon thought 
the bureau was interpreting unemployment data in an unfavorable 
light 
on july 27 1971 malek reported to hr bob haldeman 
nixons chief of staff that 13 of 35 top bls officials were 
jewish post reporters found the memo last week in the archives of 
nixons presidency 
less than two months after maleks memo to haldeman two senior 
officials who were jewish were ousted from their posts and moved to 
less visible positions in the labor department they were peter 
henle then chief economist for bls and harold goldstein then 
director of current employment analysis 
malek said in his statement this is an extremely difficult 
decision for me because of my instincts to stay on and defend 
myself against these false and outrageous charges however my 
desire to see the campaign continue to focus on the issues and my 
strong and unwavering support for the vice president have moved me 
to take this action 
bush said of malek i know him to be a most honorable man 
without a trace of bigotry in his makeup 
malek who graduated from harvard business school and became a 
millionaire before age 30 came to washington with the nixon 
administration he recently worked as a senior executive for the 
marriott corp 
the bush campaign was criticized last week because of 
revelations in the weekly washington jewish week newspaper that 
several members of an ethnic advisory panel for the bush campaign 
had links with antisemitic or fascist organizations 
one of them jerome brentar resigned as cochairman of the bush 
88 coalition of american nationalities for his active defense of 
retired ohio autoworker john demjanjuk convicted in israel as a 
nazi war criminal

gov bill clements will help dedicate a state 
historical marker monday to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 
first working integrated circuit which started an electronics 
revolution and changed the face of science 
the anniversary comes as texas itself is in the midst of a broad 
attempt to become the nations center for computer chip 
manufacturing and development 
integrated circuits which have come to be known as computer 
chips and are the brains behind everything from microcomputers to 
musical greeting cards first were demonstrated on sept 12 1958 
in a laboratory at texas instruments inc headquarters 
the historic marker to be unveiled in a 9 am cdt ceremony 
honors jack st clair kilby who first demonstrated his idea that 
basic building blocks of elecronics capacitors transistors and 
resistors could be built out of a single semiconductive material 
the discovery helped eliminate the expense and time needed to 
handsolder electronic circuits 
kilby who will attend mondays ceremony constructed a crude 
working model from a material called germanium he later helped 
invent a handheld calculator developed to show the commercial 
potential of the integrated circuit 
kilbys first integrated circuit had nine components in a space 
onesixteenth of an inch wide by sevensixteenths of an inch long 
now 180 billion integrated circuits later more than 700000 
components can be crammed onto a chip 
texas itself is hitching its economic hopes to computer chip 
development and manufacturing 
ti announced last thursday that it would spend 30 million in 
the next six months to a year developing a prototype production 
line at its dallas headquarters for futuregeneration risc chips 
four other top chipmakers plan to help texas become a world 
center of chip development 
within about an hours drive of each other in austin 
international business machines corp motorola inc cypress 
semiconductor corp and advanced micro devices inc all are 
developing risc chips each has established or will establish major 
research design and development facilities in the area 
craig ensley vice president of fouryearold austinbased 
crystal semiconductor told the dallas morning news that texas 
gains in chipmaking are proof the semiconductor industry is 
shifting its focus from the west coast to texas 
theres no question that by the mid1990s texas will be the 
dominant center of gravity of the semiconductor industry in this 
country ensley said 
in volume of chip production and number of wafer factories 
texas is second only to california and far ahead of any other 
state according to instat inc a semiconductor industry 
statistical source in scottsdale ariz 
the volume and variety of chips being made surpasses the days 
two decades ago when the semiconductor industry in the state could 
be described in two words texas instruments 
ti now makes everything from the most basic glue logic chips 
to the most advanced 1 millionbit dynamic random access memory 
or dram chips at its 21 silicon wafer factories in sherman 
dallas houston and lubbock 
glue logic chips are devices that hold electronic circuits 
together and permit memory chips and microprocessors to 
communicate semiconductors now account for 46 percent of tis 
sales and once again are setting records in unit and dollar volume 
in carrollton europes leading semiconductor company sgs 
thomson microelectronics has resurrected what used to be known as 
mostek corp and is running its plant there six days a week in 
irving japans hitachi semiconductor is set to begin producing 
dram chips 
silicon valleybased companies are found all over national 
semiconductor corp in arlington cypress semiconductor in austin 
advanced micro devices in austin and san antonio and vlsi 
technology in san antonio 
there also are a pair of texasbred startups crystal 
semiconductor in austin and dallas semiconductor the two ventures 
make specialpurpose chips that can be found in machinery from 
digital tape recorders to gasoline pumps 
texas also can boast the us chipmaking industrys only two 
cooperative research efforts sematech and microelectronics and

auto analysts say general motors corp is using 
fewer outside parts suppliers while keeping more of its 40 billion 
annual parts production within the company 
improved unionmanagement relations and the strong hand of gm 
president robert stempel are behind the shift away from 
outsourcing long a target of united auto workers union 
criticism 
in every single plant labor and management are sitting down 
together and reviewing problems and putting programs in place 
said donald ephlin a uaw vice president and head of the unions gm 
department that never happened before 
gm continues making more of its own parts than do ford motor co 
or chrysler corp the no1 automaker was producing 72 percent of 
its own parts as recently as may compared with 54 percent at ford 
and 39 percent at chrysler according to the university of 
michigans office for the study of automotive transportation 
a year earlier gm was planning to reduce internal parts 
production to 50 percent by 1992 said david cole director of the 
university office gms apparent reversal has drawn new criticism 
from some of the outside parts makers it once relied upon 
smaller suppliers will go out of business and larger ones will 
shift their work toward ford and chrysler said the chief executive 
of one major supplier who asked that his name not be used 
a spokesman for gms components division which employs 200000 
workers denied the automaker deliberately had brought more parts 
production back within the gm fold 
the components group is fighting for every piece of business 
it can get jerry bishop said were fighting for it within gm 
and outside gm 
stempel however made his position on the issue clear last year 
during his first news conference as president saying my 
objective is to get competitive not to outsource and close 
under stempel gm has looked beyond the immediate bottom line of 
the cost of parts said maryanne keller a new yorkbased industry 
analyst 
gm officials earlier accepted this simplistic rationalization 
that went were paying 28 an hour for labor and outside 
companies are paying 8 an hour so no wonder were not cost 
competitive she said 
now they have a broader view of the cost equation that a lot 
of the problems result from bad organization and bad management 
philosophy keller said that means they have it within their 
own power to cure the problems and in many cases without spending 
a lot of money 
top gm officials were unavailable for comment but a uaw member 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said chairman roger smith 
expressed his support for gms new approach at a meeting two weeks 
ago with union officials 
a lot of what smith talked about was family about the fact 
that workers are family and suppliers are not and that from now 
on family is going to be taken care of first the uaw member 
said
