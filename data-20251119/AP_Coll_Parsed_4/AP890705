a death row inmate freed after serving eight 
years for a murder he did not commit was turned over to federal 
immigration authorities wednesday for hearings on his deportation to 
canada prison officials said 
jerry bigelows release was cleared last month by the state 
supreme court when it ruled 61 not to review the states appeal of 
a lower court decision to acquit bigelow of a murder for which he 
was once sentenced to death 
bigelow 28 a native of canada who had been on death row at san 
quentin since 1981 was released to immigration and naturalization 
service officials at about 9 am and taken to san francisco said 
prison spokesman lt cal white 
now he will face a deportation hearing and eventual return to 
canada said tony marian director of the detention and 
deportation section of the ins 
bigelows lawyer robert bryan said bigelow would not oppose 
deportation to canada and could be deported as early as thursday 
bryan said canadian authorities have indicated they plan to 
prosecute bigelow for a 1980 prison escape he said bigelow had 
served only one month of an 18month robbery term before fleeing 
but bryan said he hoped canada would take into account the years 
bigelow spent on death row for a murder he was later found not to 
have committed 
formal deportation charges had not been filed against bigelow 
but marian said common charges include illegal entering the country 
overstaying a tourist visa or committing certain serious crimes 
bigelow has never been admitted to the united states for permanent 
residence marian added 
a bond hearing was planned before an immigration judge for 
thursday morning said marian bonds are set to ensure an 
individuals appearance in court and in some cases to protect 
public safety marian said adding that authorities had not yet set 
a bond amount for bigelow 
if bigelow can post bond he will be scheduled for a deportation 
hearing in the future marian said if he cannot or does not want to 
post bond bigelow will be scheduled for a deportation hearing in 
a matter of days he said 
bigelow was serving a canadian sentence for robbery when he 
escaped and fled to california he now faces possible deportation to 
canada to finish his sentence white said 
bigelow was convicted of the merced county murder of john cherry 
then 26 bigelow and michael ramandanovic were picked up hitchhiking 
by cherry who was shot to death in a cornfield 
bigelow defended himself at his first trial was denied a 
courtappointed lawyer to assist him and was convicted and 
sentenced to death 
although state law requires all death sentences to be appealed to 
the state supreme court bigelow asked the court to dismiss his 
appeal the court refused bigelow then tried twice to commit 
suicide 
in 1984 the court overturned his conviction and death sentence 
calling his trial a sham because of the failure to appoint a lawyer 
bigelow remained on death row while facing retrial 
a jury in monterey county where the retrial had been moved 
because of publicity came back with an innocent verdict on the 
murder charge in may 1988 
citing inconsistencies in the case superior court judge harkjoon 
paik refused to record the acquittal verdict and ultimately declared 
a mistrial that would have allowed bigelow to be tried again for 
murder 
but the 6th district court of appeal later unanimously upheld the 
acquittal

alaskas attorney general asked exxon on 
wednesday to allow the state to question its employees under oath 
about how potentially significant documents on the exxon valdez oil 
spill were destroyed 
attorney general douglas baily said the destruction of 
computerized files at exxon co usa headquarters in houston was 
potentially a loss of devastating proportions to the 
investigation of the nations worst oil spill 
i assume that exxon is as interested as we are in allowing the 
public to have the full access the full knowledge of exactly what 
it was that led to the destruction of those documents baily said 
at a news conference 
exxon is under state and federal court orders to preserve its 
records of the march 24 tanker spill in prince william sound 
company officials have said the documents were destroyed 
accidentally but that other copies may exist 
i have no idea at this point whether it was deliberate or 
whether it was unintentional but i think theres a big question out 
there in the minds of the public as to whether it was deliberate or 
accidental baily said 
the court orders prevent parties planning litigation against 
exxon from undertaking depositions and other forms of pretrial 
discovery until the courts can settle the issues and procedures 
involved baily said 
the attorney general is giving exxon until noon thursday to 
respond to his request he said he got no reply from exxon officials 
wednesday 
in the event that they do not agree to that stipulation we 
will ask the court to alter its order so we can undertake that 
limited discovery at the present time baily said adding that 
quick action was essential 
bailys news conference came after exxon headquarters in houston 
had closed for the night and calls there went unanswered late 
wednesday 
a former exxon computer technician kenneth a davis told the 
new york times last week that he inadvertently destroyed the files 
davis alleged that his superiors negiligent protection of the 
records caused the accident 
davis was fired june 8 the day after the destruction was 
discovered the times reported 
the destroyed material included internal memos and 
wordprocessing documents from exxon shipping co which owns the 
exxon valdez and exxon usa the newspaper said 
baily said the documents cover a twoweek period about six to 
eight weeks after the spill a time when exxon was determining how 
to defend its actions 
loss of the documents could affect others who may become involved 
in lawsuits against the oil company such as fishermen businesses 
and alaska natives hurt by the spill he said 
if the documents cannot be recovered there are a variety of 
sanctions that could be imposed by the courts against exxon but 
their severity would depend on what the documents held baily said

for 8yearold nicholas naudain marching in 
a fourth of july parade was fun but exhausting even though the route 
was only around the rooftop garden of the citys only emergency 
shelter for families 
my feet are tired he said after the festivities began 
tuesday atop raphael house in the rundown tenderloin neighborhood 
but he quickly added that the event was not boring 
in another independence day celebration volunteers distributed 
soup carrot cake and more than 100 watermelons to homeless people 
in a makeshift campground in front of city hall 
about 125 people turned out for the raphael house party which 
included balloons streamers and a 20member marching band flags 
waved cymbals crashed and batons twirled as the parade began a 
flagraising ceremony followed and then everyone joined in for a 
spirited rendition of the starspangled banner 
they usually go all out on celebrations they really do said 
nicholas mother terry naudain 34 who is staying at the shelter 
for the second time since 1982 
after marching in the parade as part of a cardboard fire engine 
nicholas summed up the meaning of independence day 
to me its to have a good time dont worry about nothing 
red white and blue balloons and streamers created a patriotic 
mood on the rooftop which was filled with blooming petunias 
gladiolas and geraniums 
rosa armas who lived at the shelter with her three young 
children last winter returned for the party 
this is like our family she said i dont have family 
here they love to come here 
maria phillips 53 who lives a couple of blocks away said she 
attends the celebration every year 
its just beautiful she said its a perfect place here 
because they do an awful lot for the people its only an emergency 
situation and its better than being out on the streets 
at city hall picnic reginald carnegie 38 said he was impressed 
by the hospitality 
ive been a lot of places and this is one of the few around 
that tries to do anything for the homeless people said carnegie 
who arrived in san francisco from florida last week and rented a 
room nearby

the institutional revolutionary party which 
has ruled mexico for all its 60 years on tuesday recognized its 
first defeat in a gubernatorial election the government news agency 
notimex said 
the party acknowledged that the conservative national action 
party had won in baja california in sundays regional balloting 
luis donaldo colosio president of the governing partys national 
executive committee made the announcement in mexico city 
since its founding in 1929 the party has never lost a 
presidential election it lost its first senate seats in the july 6 
elections 
ernesto ruffo the national action candidate and margarita 
ortega of the governing party known as pri each had claimed 
victory in the baja california race the electoral commission has 
until sunday to announce official returns 
i feel like the governor because of the support of the 
people ruffo 37 a former mayor of ensenada said earlier he 
claimed he was leading mrs ortega by a 32 margin with roughly 
half the ballots counted 
ruffo also claimed his party known as pan was winning the races 
for mayors in the baja california cities of tijuana and ensenada 
mrs ortega 38 had claimed she was winning by a 9 percent 
margin with 87 percent of the votes counted and that her partys 
candidates were leading in those two mayoral races 
pri also claimed it was winning a majority in the state 
legislature which has 15 elected members plus four chosen though 
proportional representation 
opposition parties had said that if such claims were backed by 
the electoral commission they would consider the election stolen 
the electoral commission independent voting observers and pan 
all agreed there were numerous irregularities in the voting such as 
theft of ballot boxes obstruction of opposition observers and the 
early closing of some polling places 
sundays elections in baja california and four other mexican 
states were considered a test for president carlos salinas de 
gortari who has promised clean elections in mexico even if it 
means losses for the pri 
two of the other states holding elections zacatecas and 
campeche are traditional pri strongholds but in michoacan the 
leftist democratic revolutionary party led by native son and former 
presidential candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas was claiming victory 
the democratic revolutionary party claimed it had won at least 14 
of michoacans 24 seats in the state assembly 
in ciudad juarez throngs of disgruntled pan members staged a 
90minute demonstration monday night at the local election board to 
protest massive irregularities in the chihuahua state elections for 
mayors 
pan spokesman gustavo elizondo and other party leaders cited at a 
news conference dozens of reports of voters having their thumbs 
stamped with presumably indelible ink that could be washed off 
allowing them to vote more than once

activists planning a statebystate legislative 
campaign for abortion rights say they have little hope that a deeply 
divided supreme court will protect their interests 
we will do everything we can to make this the issue of the 
coming elections said molly yard president of the national 
organization for women we will seek to build a political army all 
across the country 
the aim she said tuesday is to convince legislators they will 
pay a heavy price for supporting antiabortion laws 
the high courts willingness to scrap the constitutional right to 
abortion it established 16 years ago appears now to hinge 
precariously on the vote of sandra day oconnor the only woman in 
the nations history to serve as a supreme court justice 
abortion rights groups say they have little reason to hope she 
will vote to bar states from enacting tougher and tougher laws to 
limit abortions 
she never met a regulation she doesnt like said sarah 
weddington the lawyer who successfully argued the 1973 case of roe 
vs wade that legalized abortion 
we cant look to the courts for our protection on this any 
more said patricia ireland of the national organization for women 
those assessments were prompted by the high courts ruling monday 
that barely stopped short of letting states outlaw abortions 
in a series of 54 votes the justices ended their 198889 term 
by removing some of the shackles that barred states from regulating 
most abortions for 16 years in its next term beginning in october 
the court could give states even broader power 
the court agreed to study three new abortion disputes giving it 
a new opportunity to overturn roe vs wade in 1990 
there is no longer a majority on the court to support roe 
said janet benshoof of the american civil liberties union 
abortion opponents happily agreed 
roes days are numbered said randall terry of operation 
rescue 
oconnor is one of five justices who have expressed hostility to 
the 1973 ruling in 1983 she said its central premise permitting 
greater state control as a womans pregnancy proceeds has no 
justification in the law or logic 
but if the 16yearold structure is tottering oconnor has not 
yet announced a willingness to topple it 
the time is not ripe to discard it she said choosing instead to 
uphold missouri regulations limiting abortion rights on narrower 
grounds 
she voted for example to let states require various medical 
tests to determine whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is 
viable or capable of surviving outside the womb 
the courts 1973 ruling allowed states to make it a crime to 
abort a viable fetus but the justices then drew the viability line 
at 24 weeks 
the tests ordered by missouri are to be performed when 
viability is possible oconnor said 
that could add 150 or more to the cost of an abortion but 
oconnor said that does not impose an undue burden on a womans 
abortion decision 
justice antonin scalias separate concurring opinion expressed 
frustration with the caution of his fellow conservatives on the 
court 
it thus appears that the mansion of constitutionalized abortion 
law constructed overnight in roe vs wade must be disassembled 
doorjamb by doorjamb and never entirely brought down no matter how 
wrong it may be scalia wrote 
others on the court surely ready to dismantle the 16yearold 
ruling are chief justice william h rehnquist and justices byron r 
white and anthony m kennedy 
the addition of kennedy to the court last year has shifted the 
balance of power on abortion and other issues as well 
kennedy oconnor and scalia are appointees of former president 
reagan who also elevated rehnquist to chief justice to lead the 
swing to conservatism white named by former president kennedy 
votes with them on many key cases

doctors and lawyers may not be scoring crack in 
the ghettoes but some of them are using drugs illegally and drug 
czar william j bennett says theyd better get control of their 
professions 
these are people who make a lot of money who exercise a lot of 
influence in society bennett said in an interview theyre role 
models doctors and lawyers they have a special kind of status one 
stands for health one stands for lawfulness theres no good excuse 
here 
bennett said he wants law firms and hospitals to conduct drug 
testing if management thinks an abuse problem might exist he said 
he plans to include such a suggestion in his national drug strategy 
due in early september 
about onethird of the physicians who lose their licenses are 
tossed out of the profession because of illegal use of drugs 
according to one official both the american medical association and 
the american bar association run programs for their drug and 
alcoholimpaired colleagues 
dr bryant galusha of the fort worthbased federation of state 
medical boards estimated that at least 35 percent of the medical 
disciplinary actions reported are related directly or indirectly to 
controlled substances the vast majority of the cases involve a 
doctors personal drug abuse he said 
in 1986 galusha said the federation was notified of 2302 
disciplinary actions against physicians nationwide of those 458 
resulted in license revocation 528 in suspension and 335 in 
probation he said 
aba officials said they had no similar records on lawyers in 
trouble 
bennett who held separate meetings recently with aba president 
robert raven and the amas chief executive officer dr james h 
sammons said such professionals should meet the same standards hes 
trying to set for athletes one strike youre in trouble and two 
strikes youre out 
if youre serious about this thing you dont just go battering 
down doors in the inner cities said bennett director of the 
office of national drug control policy to those who have been 
given much much is expected 
the aba and the ama are voluntary organizations that do not have 
the power to discipline their members by lifting credentials and 
neither raven nor sammons indicated he would advocate bennetts 
two strikes youre out policy 
instead they espoused treatment for drug abusers keeping 
records on those who seek help for such problems might make them 
hesitant to seek treatment they added 
while heads of some law firms might be considering drug testing 
raven said he doesnt believe its necessary especially in the 
larger firms 
you have people watching each other raven said if a 
person has a serious problem either in alcoholism or in drugs 
thats going to be reflected in their work their attendance their 
punctuality everything else 
however dr dorynne czechowicz of the national institute on drug 
abuse said even people who are trained to discover such problems 
have a difficult time recognizing drug or alcohol abuse by patients 
the key problem for the legal profession is whether an attorneys 
drug use is causing a client to be neglected or a case mishandled 
raven said 
in many states now they have procedures where they can move in 
and protect the client and thats very important he said at the 
same time he said concern for a clients welfare might hinder 
immediate action against the attorney 
galusha said medical boards have been criticized for not revoking 
more doctors licenses because of incompetency but he said the 
boards faced with extreme legal hurdles to prove incompetency 
often will target the physicians use of controlled substances as an 
easier way to revoke the license 
the public must come first not the physician he said 
the extent of drug abuse among professionals is unclear surveys 
by the nida check whether respondents are employed but not what 
jobs they have 
the addiction rate for all groups of people and all kinds of 
substances including alcohol is about 10 percent said dr 
douglas talbott who says his drug treatment facility in atlanta has 
treated more physicians than anyone in the free world 
among health professionals the addiction rate is 17 percent to 
19 percent he said with only 10 percent to 15 percent of those 
people addicted solely to alcohol

not a single family benefited during the first 
10 years of a 134 million usegyptian program to provide housing 
for lowincome people near cairo according to the agency for 
international development 
a new report to congress by aid inspector general herbert l 
beckington complains about us aid operations in egypt at 23 
billion a year egypt gets more us aid than any country except 
israel 
the project begun in 1978 at helwan about 18 miles south of 
cairo was to cost 160 million shared equally by the two 
governments by march 31 1988 the united states had spent 71 
million and egypt 63 million and not one family had occupied an 
apartment the report said 
john riddle a spokesman for the agency said that since 
beckingtons report was written 205 families have moved into 158 
apartment units the project had been planned to include 4000 units 
the united states will stop paying money into the project after 
sept 30 riddle said 
the aid report said questionable management decisions were 
responsible for problems in the housing project there were disputes 
about who would be eligible to get a house and planners apparently 
never considered how money was to be collected from the occupants 
the report said 
riddle said the united states is spending 10 million egyptian 
pounds about 39 million to hire local contractors for what he 
called a lessons learned analysis of the project 
the money is coming from the sales of us goods sent as aid to 
egypt money from such sales usually goes into a joint account 
managed by the two governments 
beckington also complained about the agencys system for checking 
on the 34 billion worth of goods sent to egypt since 1975 
aid had not verified the arrival in egypt of more than 283 
million in aidfinanced commodities through april 30 1988 the 
report said adding that the problem has persisted although it was 
mentioned in previous reports 
it also faulted aids accounting for more than 11 million in 
egyptian currency collected from sales of medical products 
the report submitted to congress every six months covered oct 
1 1988 to march 31 of this year 
beckington praised as wellmanaged the project to improve the 
power station at the aswan high dam to which the agency is 
contributing 140 million the dam was built with soviet help during 
the 1960s after the united states rejected the project 
the egyptian government has not submitted required reports 
beckington said so his agency cannot say if egypt is contributing 
the equivalent of 12 million as promised 
despite aid given by the united states and the soviet union 
egypt is in poor economic condition its citizens have an average 
income of about 680 a year and one of the third worlds largest 
foreign debts 43 billion 
the government of president hosni mubarak is falling behind on 
its payments unless it makes a payment on the 45 billion military 
debt to the united states by november us law requires that 
further aid be halted

every time president bush goes out in 
his 28foot speedboat fidelity a small navy of power boats 
accompanies him 
bush is constantly on the 28foot cigarettebrand racing boat 
during his vacation periods and local boaters regard his sleek 
bluehulled craft with white and red trim as a familiar sight 
the president was headed for his boat on tuesday in fact when 
he was told by secret service agents of former president reagans 
horseback riding accident in mexico 
television crews following bush caught a picture of the president 
on his boat talking on the telephone but white house aides denied 
that was how he learned of reagans accident instead he was just 
talking to a staff member 
just as reagan relaxed by riding horses bush takes obvious 
pleasure in bouncing through atlantic waves in his boat with a 
specially designed hull for ocean racing 
the smaller boats pursuing the presidential craft everywhere it 
goes include several coast guard cutters two secret service power 
boats both products of drug raids and a half dozen or so power 
boats leased by news agencies also sightseeing boaters often come 
along for the ride just to catch a glimpse of the president behind 
the wheel 
but boats are kept at a safe 250 yards behind bush by coast guard 
cutters those inching closer receive stern warnings over 
loudspeakers 
bush bought his boat in 1973 for 15000 a fraction of the cost 
of new cigarette boats which can run well over 100000 bush sold 
stock in the fidelity printing co of houston to pay for the boat 
thus the name fidelity 
with twin 185horsepower inboard engines the boat can zip along 
at speeds up to 50 mph and bush seems to enjoy hitting the 
throttle zipping between rocks and leaving the chase boats far 
behind in his spray 
as he told a wellwisher in town the other day i hope we get 
out on the water do some fun stuff 
bush did fun stuff for the duration of his fiveday 
independence day holiday here 
boating shared billing with jogging tennis swimming and 
frequent golf games and reporters covering the vacation white house 
often felt they were covering sporting events 
one who didnt think boating with the president of the united 
states was fun stuff was french president francois mitterrand 
bush tried repeatedly to get mitterrand out on his boat when the 
french leader was his guest here in may however mitterrand who 
reportedly gets seasick declined at one point bush brought the 
boat around in a final effort to get the french leader out for a 
spin 
bush wound up going out himself leaving mitterrand behind to 
work on a speech 
bush has promised residents of this seacoast resort he would be a 
good neighbor and said he would drive his boat slowly at 
least in the narrow channel leading into downtown kennebunkport 
but he doesnt observe any speed restrictions in the open 
atlantic off his compound that sits on a peninsula walkers point 
jutting out into the sea 
in fact one of bushs favorite tricks is to unnerve his guests 
by bringing his boat full throttle into the cove by his house 
seeming to head straight toward a stone wall and cutting his 
engines at the very last moment 
then he brakes the boat in a tight circle and in a fury of spray 
and centrifugal force brings the craft to a docile stop right 
alongside his wooden dock 
but bush didnt go out in his boat on monday when he treated 
neighbors to a 15minute fireworks display from his property 
the president stayed ashore with what aide marlin fitzwater 
termed 200 of his closest friends 
fitzwater and many other senior white house aides who didnt 
make the cut watched the fireworks from a tour boat that bobbed in 
the atlantic along with hundreds of smaller craft to watch the 
presidential pyrotechnics 
several dozen reporters were also on the boat which was paid for 
by the republican national committee 
at first white house aides did not disclose who had paid for the 
boat and when it turned out to be the rnc a number of reporters 
refused to get aboard 
others who took the trip insisted on paying for their share 
in any event bush was out again on tuesday evening boating for 
several hours in heavy seas one final fling at fun stuff before 
returning to washington and the work of governing a nation

a suspended roman catholic priest says hell 
continue leading his unsanctioned african american catholic 
congregation contending that washingtons archbishop has failed 
to deal with racism within the church 
the rev george a stallings is forbidden to preach celebrate 
mass or administer any of the roman catholic churchs sacraments 
including baptism weddings or holy communion church spokeswoman 
eileen marks said tuesday 
the suspension was imposed by cardinal james hickey archbishop 
of the washington diocese 
but stallings said tuesday he will continue to hold sunday 
services for his new congregation adding the suspension only 
affects my duties with the roman catholic church 
the cardinal has failed to deal with racism in the catholic 
church and hasnt responded to issues i have brought to his 
attention he said in an interview with whur radio 
stallings celebrated the african american churchs first worship 
ceremony in the chapel of a washington law school on sunday 
marks said hickeys letter to stallings in which he imposed the 
suspension said the sunday service was a public act of 
disobedience 
hickey said stallings act in establishing a separate group was 
a step toward separating yourself from the unity of the catholic 
church 
the letter from the cardinal said the decision to suspend 
stallings was made partly to help him turn away from a 
destructive course of action marks said hickey wants to leave 
open the possibility of communication with stallings despite the 
suspension 
stallings said he created the new congregation also known as the 
imani temple because he believes the catholic church is not 
responsive to the cultural and spiritual needs of black parishioners 
sundays ceremony was attended by about 500 people and included 
traditional catholic prayers and liturgy along with elements 
borrowed from african and southern black revival traditions black 
representatives of other faiths including baptists and muslims 
attended to show support for stallings move 
stallings who announced plans for his separate congregation last 
month said sunday the church cant throw me out and even if 
they do throw me out i have my own opinion they have theirs

with growing fears of a possible recession the 
federal reserve is likely to further loosen credit policy and drive 
a variety of consumer and business loan rates lower many private 
economists predict 
analysts believe fixedrate mortgage loans will soon dip below 10 
percent and other consumer loans will drop by onehalf percentage 
point before the summer is over as the central bank struggles to 
keep the aging economic recovery alive 
the fed has a plate full of statistics suggesting that a wise 
insurance policy against a recession would be to make another easing 
move said robert dederick chief economist of northern trust co 
of chicago 
the forecasts of a looser credit policy came as fed officials 
gathered for the start today of two important days of closeddoor 
meetings to map monetary strategy for the rest of the year 
decisions made by the federal open market committee composed of 
members of the federal reserve board in washington and five of the 
12 regional fed bank presidents will not be revealed until july 20 
when federal reserve chairman alan greenspan delivers the central 
banks midyear policy update to congress 
the fed in march 1988 launched a credittightening effort which 
drove interest rates up by 3 full percentage points in an effort to 
dampen growing inflationary pressures by reducing borrowing demands 
but last month in a major policy shift the central bank sent a 
key interest rate the federal funds rate down by 025 percentage 
point to around 950 percent the funds rate is the interest that 
banks charge each other for overnight loans 
many private economists believe the fed will decide to lower the 
funds rate by another 025 percentage point in july similar small 
declines would be likely in the following months if the economic 
statistics show that the earlyyear spurt in inflation is moderating 
and the economy is remaining sluggish the economists say 
the central bank has been struggling to engineer a soft 
landing where growth slows enough to dampen inflation but without 
causing a recession 
last weeks big drop in the stock market was blamed on growing 
fears that the country is headed for a downturn later this year 
based on statistics showing weak consumer spending and a big slump 
in factory orders 
the economy is slowing more rapidly than expected and underlies 
the need for the fed to act promptly to ease monetary policy said 
jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers failure to act soon may turn the soft landing into 
a recession 
lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser at the wefa group an 
economic consulting firm said the fed cannot ignore the various 
signs showing we have a very sluggish economy 
clearly the risk of a recession is higher but my guess is that 
the fed believes we can get by without one through gradual moves 
to lower rates chimerine said 
mortgage rates are already falling fixedrate mortgages which 
peaked at 1124 percent in late march dropped to a nationwide 
average of 1007 percent last week according to a survey by the 
federal home loan mortgage corp 
david wyss chief financial economist at drimcgraw hill another 
forecasting firm predicted that 30year mortgages will soon fall 
below 10 percent and decline to around 95 percent by september 
other economists forecast a further onehalf percentage point 
drop in banks prime lending rate which was cut to 11 percent in

the typical dairy cow of the 21st century will 
be a much larger producer by todays standards and might even turn 
out some kinds of tailormade milk according to agriculture 
department scientists 
h duane norman animal research leader at the departments 
agricultural research service facility in beltsville md said 
herds that yield as much as 40000 pounds of milk per cow annually 
about 4651 gallons can be expected in the next century 
nationally 1988 milk production averaged 14213 pounds per cow 
or about 1653 gallons 
weve had individual cows already that produced 50000 
pounds norman said in the current issue of agricultural research 
magazine in 1945 we had 25 million dairy cows in the united 
states today we have about 10 million but the milk yield per cow 
is up from 4600 pounds to an average of 14000 pounds today 
the most controversial development is bovine somatotropin or 
bst the socalled bovine growth hormone that is awaiting clearance 
by the food and drug administration before it can be used by dairy 
farmers 
cows produce bst naturally in their pituitary glands and it can 
be made synthetically several companies are working on versions of 
the chemical 
another beltsville scientist henry f tyrell said bst typically 
would boost a cows milk output by 15 percent although on a 
shortterm basis it could rise by as much as 50 percent 
id say well see basically a continuation of the same trends 
of the last 50 years tyrell said what i see is more emphasis 
on tailoring milk to meet specific product demands 
genetically it is possible to change the relative proportions of 
proteins in milk the casein albumin and globulins 
part of the reason cheeses are different from each other is the 
various proteins in the milk tyrell said its in this area 
altering the proportions in the milk for specific products that 
well see a change 
vernon g pursel a reproductive physiologist at beltsville said 
he and others have been working for a year on targeting components 
to the mammary glands of farm animals and that could mean some 
rather exotic results 
depending on what gene you insert you could have some of the 
rare medical proteins produced in the mammary gland pursel said 
these special proteins could be extracted from the milk and 
purified 
one example he said is the bloodclotting factor used to treat 
hemophilia a rare protein that some day might be extracted from 
milk 
during the past year weve transfered a gene for a mouse 
protein into pigs if the mouse gene functions correctly the mouse 
protein will be present in the milk produced by our transgenic 
pigs pursel said 
the next step he said will be to connect the regulatory part of 
the mouse gene to part of a gene for rare medical protein so it can 
be produced in the milk 
the final step will be to transfer such a gene into the dairy 
cow pursel said if the regulatory part of the mouse gene 
works it could also be used to modify the composition of the milk

a newly discovered bee with a long tongue is 
turning out to be a friend of rabbiteye blueberry producers says 
the agriculture department 
the department said monday that honey bees cant pollinate 
rabbiteye blueberries because their tongues are too short but the 
new bees tongue is longer and can reach into the blueberrys flower 
for nectar 
as it probes the flower with its long tongue the bee also buzzes 
it to loosen a cloud of pollen said jerry a payne an entomologist 
with the departments agricultural research service 
when the bee moves on it carries pollen from one blueberry 
flower to another achieving pollination payne who works at the 
agencys southeastern fruit and tree nut research laboratory byron 
ga said in a report issued here that poor crops of rabbiteye 
blueberries often result from poor cross pollination 
the groundnesting bee habropoda loboriosa was found during a 
threeyear study with auburn university in alabama the bee is 
prevalent in the southeastern united states where rabbiteye 
blueberries are grown on approximately 5000 acres 
payne said the bee which has been named the southeastern 
blueberry bee is larger than a honey bee but smaller than a bumble 
bee the female has a black face minus a creamcolored dot that 
distinguishes the male only the female gathers pollen 
depending on the season consumers pay from 2 to 5 a pint for 
rabbiteye blueberries 
we dont know much about the bees nesting habits payne 
said therefore we dont have any way yet to reintroduce it if 
nests are destroyed so we advise growers not to use insecticides 
when blueberries bloom

the agriculture department has asked for public 
comments for designing the 1990 feed grains program 
officials say that one of the main items will involve how much 
land farmers will be required to set aside in order to qualify for 
price supports and other benefits on 1990 crops of corn sorghum 
oats and if designated barley 
the 1985 farm law requires the annual setaside to be at least 
125 percent and no more than 20 percent of a producers acreage 
base when corn inventories exceed the level of 2 billion bushels at 
the beginning of the season the setaside was 20 percent for 1989

the national education association is drawing 
criticism from the bush administration for its resolution opposing 
many plans that let parents choose which public schools their 
children will attend 
such plans should not be mandated by the states or federal 
government according to a resolution adopted tuesday by the union 
however the group did not oppose the idea if it is adopted by local 
school authorities 
the union said it continues to support alternative programs 
for specific purposes such as magnet schools designed to promote 
desegregation 
education undersecretary ted sanders said through spokesman tom 
lyon the vote was very disappointing all students deserve access 
to a quality education and choice will make that happen but 
apparently the nea doesnt even understand the concept 
the president and the education secretary have called choice 
the cornerstone for rebuilding american education parents want 
choice students need it now sanders said 
the resolution adopted by the 8500 delegates at the neas 
annual representative assembly indicated the organization is 
concerned about whether all students can receive free highquality 
education under a choice program mandated by a state or the federal 
government 
bush administration education officials had hoped that more 
moderate forces within the nea would prevail 
sanders and education secretary lauro cavazos have argued that 
allowing parents to choose their childs school will force schools 
to compete and improve 
however opponents say schools could become weakened or 
resegregated as students leave some choice programs do not provide 
transportation for students and most wind up draining funds from the 
schools left behind they contend 
delegates representing the nearly 2 million nea members had 
considered proposals ranging from strong opposition to a relatively 
moderate statement opposing choice programs that foster inequities 
or substandard education for some students 
the nea on tuesday also announced the creation of four learning 
laboratories in school districts in memphis tenn chaska minn 
marshalltown iowa and westerly ri 
the four districts will experiment with ways to give teachers and 
other local personnel more control over their schools on the 
premise that reform without teacher input is bound to fail 
school boards and superintendents are cooperating with the 
effort which will bring the districts 280000 this year in grants 
and technical aid from the nea each experiment is expected to last 
at least five years and eventually serve as a model for other 
districts 
since beginning its convention sunday the nea also has decided 
to 
ask television stations and newspapers to put the names of 
states on their weather maps the proposal came from the montana 
delegation in the interest of improving geographic literacy 
oppose channel 1 a television news program with commercials 
designed for classroom use that has been denounced by several other 
educational organizations 
wage an aggressive campaign for better teacher pay including 
television spots press conferences and newspaper and magazine 
articles 
recommend a series of policies for the national board for 
professional teaching standards which is developing standards for 
voluntary teacher certification

a fugitive chinese student leader stood on the spot 
where british troops opened fire on american civilians at the dawn 
of the american revolution and compared that boston massacre to 
events in tiananmen square 
both said shen tong marked the beginning of a nations struggle 
for independence 
shen a 20yearold beijing university biology student escaped 
from china while on the governments most wanted list 
as part of their traditional independence day celebrations the 
ancient and honorable artillery company of massachusetts invited 
shen and other chinese students to set a floral goddess of democracy 
in front of the old state house 
the statue created of plastic foam covered with white flowers 
was a replica of the one chinese students erected in tiananmen 
square 
standing among the uniformed artillery members shen read his own 
declaration of independence 
on this spot british troops opened fire on peaceful 
citizens shen said people died people were hurt but it 
sparked the american struggle for independence 
exactly one month ago in my country troops controlled by the 
li peng regime opened fire on a peaceful civilian protest i do not 
believe that the tiananmen square massacre was the end of the 
democracy movement in china 
it was the beginning a beginning that will lead to a new 
china a china governed by the people and for the people 
elsewhere seven chinese students at the university of tulsa 
announced at a flagraising ceremony they want political asylum in 
the united states 
we feel very strongly if we go back this year next year or 
any year we really face big danger said guohua zheng a 
25yearold graduate student in petroleum engineering at the 
oklahoma school the immigration and naturalization service had no 
immediate comment 
in boston the chinese students were a new twist on the 
traditional fourth of july celebrations by the artillery company a 
militia founded in 1638 
the old state house was erected in 1713 as the seat of the 
british colonial government on march 5 1770 five unarmed 
americans were killed there while demonstrating against the british 
six years later the artillery companys thomas crafts read the 
declaration of independence from the balcony of the old state house 
on tuesday lt col joseph a milano read the declaration the 
artillery company joined by several other militias in colonialera 
costumes then held a moment of silence for those who died in 
tiananmen square and for american servicemen who died in wars 
milano said he personally paid for the statue but declined to say 
how much in cost just say it was about a dollar for every flower 
and there werent less than 2000 he said 
milano said he has visited china three times since 1983 and 
decided to invite the chinese to take part in the american ceremony 
because he was moved by the historical similarities 
it was american patriots at that time and now its a very 
similar thing milano said we brought china to boston 
shen who will not say how he escaped from china used the 
ceremony to protest the presumed arrest of a friend student wang 
dan 
shen made it clear he is not advocating the armed revolt embraced 
by the american colonists 
for a thousand years in china its always been one dynasty 
changing into another dynasty one violence into another violence 
shen said this movement is different it is nonviolent

taking seats beside their former communist 
jailers in the new parliament solidarity legislators savored the 
historic moment and immediately took the government to task for 
mishandling the economy 
not only did the free trade union movement claim the spoils of 
its june election victory on tuesday it also saw the discredited 
government of prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski formally resign 
in his first speech as a deputy solidarity veteran jacek kuron 
lashed into rakowski for helping precipitate an economic crisis in 
which the governments chaotic policy caused only social unrest 
rakowski looked on uncomfortably from a balcony 
kuron who spent nine years in jail for opposition activities 
noted that communist authorities refrained from increasing prices 
during the election campaign then ordered price rises after the 
humiliating electoral defeat 
despite running uncontested rakowski and other key members of 
the ruling communist coalition were denied seats in the new 
parliament 
in the june balloting solidaritybacked candidates won all but 
one of the races the opposition was allowed to contest theirs 
became the first opposition movement to enter an east bloc 
parliament since the postwar communist takeover 
there were two great moments in my life the august 1980 
agreements that created solidarity and today said solidarity 
leader lech walesa who did not run for office but sat in places of 
honor with communist leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
with the economy in shambles many analysts say the same 
government that crushed solidarity with martial law 7 years ago had 
few options but that which it chose reinstating the union in april 
and trying to work with it 
shortages in basic commodities are worse than ever inflation is 
averaging 100 percent per year and servicing the 39 billion foreign 
debt is becoming more problematic 
price increases in the last two weeks alone raised the cost of 
sugar cigarettes alcohol gasoline refrigerators and washing 
machines 
the value of the dollar polands most valued currency 
fluctuated wildly before stabilizing after the government announced 
a monthlong wage and price freeze as of july 1 
in postwar poland governmentmandated price increases have 
touched off labor unrest that has toppled regimes and last august 
led authorities to agree to negotiate solidaritys reinstatement 
unclear now is whether solidarity will help the government by 
assuming part of the responsibility for seeking a way out of the 
economic crisis 
the union is asking western leaders for 10 billion in new aid 
that would allow poland to continue on its path of reform 
encouraging free market mechanisms and closing moneylosing 
industries without labor turmoil 
on tuesday rakowskis cabinet formally submitted its resignation 
to the sejm or lower house of parliament which now counts 161 
solidarity deputies among its 460 members the new senate where 
solidarity won 99 of 100 seats later convened 
walesa had a place of honor at the front of the sejm for the 
opening session sitting a few yards away was jaruzelski 
when the senate met the two sat sidebyside at the front of the 
chamber and seemed to joke with one another 
but as leaders of the two chambers were elected and sworn in an 
intense political struggle persisted over who they will elect as 
president when they meet in joint session that election may not 
take place until after president bush visits next week 
jaruzelski said friday that he did not want the post and 
recommended interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak but jaruzelski 
was believed to be reconsidering at the urging of some party members 
jaruzelski the communist party chief crushed solidarity with a 
1981 military crackdown jailing thousands of solidarity activists 
including many of the new senators and deputies walesa was interned 
for 11 months 
the presidency has been strengthened under polands newly amended 
constitution with the president in charge of the army and foreign 
relations and empowered to name a prime minister to form a new 
government 
stanislaw stomma at 81 the eldest senator convened the chamber 
one is obliged to state the truth in this solemn moment that the 
breakthrough we are experiencing is to a major extent the work 
of the solidarity 
sociologist mikolaj kozakiewicz of the communistallied peasant 
party was voted speaker of the sejm on tuesday and law professor 
andrzej stelmachowski a solidarity adviser close to walesa was 
chosen senate leader 
the sejm is the main lawmaking chamber the senate will supervise 
its activities and have the right to veto any sejm acts 
under the april agreement that reinstated solidarity the ruling 
communist coalition was guaranteed 65 percent of the seats in the 
sejm

the tokyo stock exchanges key index more than made 
up the previous days losses today while the dollar fell against 
the japanese yen for the third consecutive day 
the dollar closed at 14020 yen down 075 yen from tuesdays 
14095yen finish it opened at 14120 yen and fluctuated between 
13985 yen and 14125 yen 
the dollar now has fallen 375 yen in three trading days 
today investors were selling dollars and buying west german 
marks which resulted in the yens gain against the dollar said 
toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new japan securities co 
the yen has been bought back since monday when the result of 
sundays election for the tokyo metropolitan assembly came out he 
said adding that most investors had sold dollars too heavily before 
the election anticipating the losses by the ruling party 
on sunday the governing liberal democratic party won just 43 of 
128 seats in the assembly losing 20 seats 
kanai said investors still were reluctant to buy yen before 
elections july 23 for half the seats in parliaments upper house 
but the dollarbuying incentive is even weaker before the 
release of the us unemployment report on friday which japanese 
investors think will determine us monetary policy he said 
many investors are anticipating an easing of us interest rates 
which makes dollardenominated investments less attractive to 
foreign investors 
on the stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues a 4604point loser tuesday gained 11933 points or 036 
percent closing at 3330971 
trading was directionless and inactive said masahiro 
umemori an analyst with nomura securities japans largest 
brokerage 
although the nikkei rose today the market lacks energy because 
japanese investors feel insecure about making major moves ahead of 
the july 23 election he said 
the governing party is expected to suffer setbacks in the wake of 
an influencepeddling scandal that forced former prime minister 
noboru takeshita to resign an unpopular sales tax and allegations 
that new prime minster sousuke uno kept paid mistresses 
other dealers said the yens rise against the dollar had 
reassured investors and contributed to the indexs rise 
trading was thin with first section volume estimated at 650 
million shares up from tuesdays 550 million among gainers were 
steel shipbuilding and construction issues

the producer of the film the thin blue line is 
hurt and upset that the man whose murder conviction was thrown 
out after it was questioned in the movie is suing him for rights to 
his life story 
randall dale adams lawsuit filed two weeks ago claims producer 
errol morris lost his rights to adams life story in ecember 1988 
when he failed to exercise a twoyear option purchased from adams 
for 10 in december 1986 
morris left 10 in adams commissary account in jail randy 
schaffer adams lawyer said late tuesday a carton of cigarettes 
was what that amounted to 
adams was convicted of murdering a dallas policeman and served 12 
years in prison before an appeals court overturned the conviction 
the court acted after the release of the movie in which another 
inmate all but confessed to the slaying adams was freed in march 
and prosecutors declined to retry him 
i worked very very hard for a number of years to see that 
justice was done in this case and to see that randall adams walked 
out of prison morris said 
the producer said his profits from the film which was not widely 
distributed were nil and added that he is still paying off 
debts from the movie 
morris said he is willing to renegotiate the rights to adams 
story there is a desire on my part to settle this quickly and 
without acrimony he said 
schaffer said morris doesnt seem to be the problem in current 
negotiations aimed at given adams clear title to any future rights 
to his story he said morris had sold all rights he owned including 
those of adams to mirimax productions co also listed as a 
defendant in the lawsuit 
we just want to clear up who owns the rights schaffer said 
schaffer said his 40yearold client is not seeking royalties 
only a declaration that he owns the right to his own life story so 
he can pursue offers estimated in the neighborhood of six 
figures

industrial nations are pledging 
billions to save this nations fragile democracy but philippine 
democracy is under siege not only by armed opponents but by forces 
of mismanagement and corruption 
delegates from 25 countries and international organizations 
meeting in tokyo pledged 35 billion for 1989 to be channeled into 
the philippines multilateral aid initiative a usinitiated plan 
to revive an economy devastated by 20 years of misrule under ousted 
president ferdinand marcos 
the figure could reach about 14 billion by 1992 president bush 
has asked congress for an additional 200 million in annual aid over 
the next five years as the american contribution 
but western diplomats believe president corazon aquinos 
government must tackle formidable problems if the money is to be 
effective 
these include an illdisciplined military a cumbersome 
inefficient bureaucracy ineffective courts and a burgeoning 
population that threatens economic gains 
western and filipino experts give the administration high marks 
for restoring business confidence liberalizing imports disbanding 
state monopolies and removing the taxexempt status from government 
enterprises 
but critics fault mrs aquino for failing to display the vigorous 
leadership necessary to exploit the opportunities that filipinos 
enjoyed after toppling the marcos administration in february 1986 
western diplomats say the government has been unable to spend 
between 2 and 4 billion in foreign aid because of inefficiency and 
bottlenecks in the bureaucracy 
there are a number of favorable trends said one western 
diplomat on condition of anonymity but theyve got a long way to 
go the system is fragile 
abroad much attention has focused on the communist new peoples 
army the ruralbased 23000strong force that has waged a 20year 
insurgency to establish a marxist state 
rebels operate in 65 of the 73 provinces and have killed up to 65 
policemen and soldiers in the manila area this year 
but the most serious armed threats have come not from the 
insurgents but from disaffected members of the military who have 
launched six coup attempts against mrs aquinos government 
analysts believe the insurgency persists in part because most 
filipinos have not benefited from the promise of economic and social 
justice 
about half the countrys 58 million people live below the 
governments definition of poverty on less than the equivalent of 
150 a month for a family of six 
unemployment declined from 9 percent in 1987 to 85 percent last 
year but government figures show that onethird of the labor force 
worked less than 40 hours a week 
while most filipinos struggle economically there are widespread 
rumors of official corruption true or not they create the 
perception that a privileged few benefit from the new administration 
last year mrs aquino promised that at least one wellknown 
public figure would be charged with corruption the promise remains 
unfulfilled 
experts say a major factor holding down living standards is the 
lack of an effective population control program a sensitive issue 
in a roman catholic country 
the asian development bank has warned that economic gains in the 
philippines ae threatened by a continuing rapid growth in the 
labor force 
the population is growing at about 25 percent annually that 
means 750000 new jobs must be created each year 
in a study the bank also faulted the administration for the slow 
pace of land reform aimed at redistributing property to 3 million 
landless peasants 
the yearold program has virtually ground to a halt because of 
scandals in the department of agrarian reform after delaying for 
weeks mrs aquino recently replaced her land reform secretary 
because he authorized purchase of property at grossly inflated 
prices 
public disaffection is also growing over a feared breakdown in 
law and order in manila after a spate of almost daily police 
killings and spectacular bank robberies 
coupled with this is a growing feeling that with a backlog of 
300000 cases in the court system filipinos cannot rely on the 
justice system to protect their rights 
the government blames communist rebels for most of the police 
killings but last month defense secretary fidel ramos acknowledged 
widespread criminality in military ranks 
manila newspapers quoting unnamed intelligence sources said 
many of the bank robberies in manila are carried out by 10 gangs of 
soldiers and former soldiers who are shielded from arrest by their 
officers 
few blame mrs aquino personally but even supporters believe 
that she must shake off her relaxed detached style in the face of 
intractable problems 
the president must now scratch off her slow gradualist 
evolutionary style wrote her former spokesman teodoro benigno 
what is needed for her is todare the fates and move 
decisively

a fisherman who cast his line for a catch 
he could sink his teeth into instead reeled in a fish that could 
sink its teeth into him 
the threepound piranha greg dellaria caught at a stone quarry 
near this southwest ohio town later devoured every goldfish in a 
bait shop tank where dellaria had stored the fish 
hes got teeth as big as your bottom ones the 32yearold 
fisherman said last week 
dellaria said he and some friends were fishing for bass on june 
26 when he caught the piranha in about three feet of water it 
blew my mind ill tell you that he said 
dellaria put the piranha in a tank at a friends bait shop to 
keep it alive but the friends wife had a baby the next day so the 
bait shop was closed for three days 
when dellarias wife finally picked up the fish four days later 
she was told that it ate all of his goldfish cleaned him out 
dellaria said 
by then doug maloney fish management supervisor for the state 
fish and wildlife district 5 office in xenia confirmed that the 
fish was indeed a piranha 
they were really surprised dellaria said everybody was 
saying piranhas dont get that big but i guess if they get old 
enough and people feed them enough they do 
the fish and wildlife experts theorized that someone bought the 
piranha in a pet store and released it into the stone quarry 
the piranha lived for several days in a beverage cooler filled 
with water before it died dellaria says he will have his catch 
mounted

the current family practitioner whenever he leaves town

in late june in choteaus weekly newspaper bushman said she has 
received a couple of responses that she is tracking 
the idea of posting a reward was suggested by the corporate 
office of lutheran health systems which leases the 14bed hospital 
and its adjoining nursing home bushman said 
the corporate office got good responses from several other small 
hospitals that offered rewards and hired doctors within 90 days 
bushman said

in a second peace overture since seizing 
power last week the military junta led by lt gen omar hassan 
ahmed elbashir has decreed a onemonth unilateral ceasefire in the 
war with southern rebels 
the junta tuesday night proposed a general amnesty for all 
sudanese who have taken up arms against the government since may 
1983 when the rebellion led by turncoat army col john garang began 
in three southern provinces 
the proposed amnesty in effect would cover the 5000060000 
rebels of garangs sudan peoples liberation army 
the juntas actions stretched the cessation of hostilities in the 
southern regions of upper nile bahr elghazal and equatoria into a 
third month 
both sides stilled their guns in may and june in response to a 
unilateral ceasefire proposed by garang to allow the united nations 
to move 120000 tons of relief supplies to the south to ward off 
famine this summer 
the new unilateral ceasefire which took effect tuesday and the 
proposed amnesty were announced in separate statements from the 
command council of the national salvation revolution 
the 15member council overthrew the civilian government of prime 
minister sadek elmahdi friday in an apparently bloodless coup 
the council said elmahdis failure to end the civil war was 
among principal reasons for the coup it pledged to make peace in 
the south its top priority saying it would scrap all efforts begun 
by elmahdi and make a fresh start 
elbashirs subsequent actions appeared to bear this out in a 
saudi newspaper interview published monday said he had invited 
rebel leader garang to come to khartoum for peace talks 
inviting garang to khartoum is an initiative meant to 
demonstrate good intent elbashir 45 told the newspaper okaz 
tuesday nights announcement ordered a onemonth truce in all 
war zones and fighting scenes beginning immediately 
despite elbashirs repeated peace vows spokesmen for the sudan 
peoples liberation army have refrained from comment saying it was 
closely watching developments in khartoum 
the armed forces official newspaper reported today that 
elbashir told the ethiopian ambassador that he wanted to send a 
delegation to addis ababa ethiopias capital to meet with garangs 
representatives 
alguwat almusalaha said the rebel command replied tuesday night 
that they were ready to talk with representatives of the junta the 
newspaper said no date was set for the delegation to go 
the rebels have their political headquarters in addis ababa 
ethiopia has backed the rebels with money arms and training 
facilities since they began their armed insurrection demanding 
greater autonomy and a better economic deal for southerners 
after lengthy hesitation elmahdis government which took 
office in 1986 opened peace talks with the rebels in addis ababa in 
may a new round was to have begun tuesday also in the ethiopian 
capital 
it junta said it expected the general amnesty would be enacted 
soon this should not take long because elbashirs council has 
dissolved parliament 
besides chairing the council elbashir made himself premier 
defense minister and military commanderinchief he has promised to 
form a cabinet of civilians under the juntas tutelage 
the junta also announced tuesday that 15 southern politicians who 
worked for elmahdis government were arrested on charges of 
corruption 
this brought to 45 the number of political figures the military 
said they have arrested since the coup the detainees include 
leaders of political parties which have since been disbanded but 
not elmahdi 
the cairo newspaper alahram quoted elbashir as saying in an 
interview that the prime minister who led the umma party remains 
at large 
he said elmahdi had attended the wedding of a relative in a 
khartoum suburb thursday night and was not at home when troops 
arrived after midnight to detain him 
elbashir also told alahram he used just 300 soldiers and 10 
tanks to seize power he said the guard force at general 
headquarters and many other military units immediately pledged 
loyalty to his movement and that most political party militias had 
surrendered to the army

a seattle man was fatally shot on an 
amtrak train and grieving relatives are questioning security 
measures that would allow a man to board with a handgun

and crew cars of the amtrak silver star said polk county sheriffs 
sgt roy mcguirt 
he got on that thing thinking he was safe said the victims 
brother bill boole the man served in three wars and never got 
wounded then he goes up to a person like that and gets shot for no 
reason that is the tragedy of this country 
boole said the federal government should require everybody who 
boards public transportation to be searched for guns 
claude paige 69 of fort lauderdale gave his 32caliber 
revolver to an amtrak employee immediately after the shooting monday 
paige was charged with seconddegree murder mcguirt said

for the first time on the train and were drinking in the trains 
lounge just before the shooting 
nelson said paige was talking to himself and had a revolver 
tucked in his right front pants pocket just before the shooting 
after noticing the gun nelson said he left boole and paige and 
returned to his seat 
moments later nelson said boole left the lounge and walked into 
the vestibule with paige following nelson said he heard a gunshot 
and saw boole fall to the floor 
it may have been the first passenger murder on the federally 
subsidized rail system said pat duricka an amtrak spokeswoman in 
washington dc 
no one can recall something like this happening she said 
paige was held in the polk county jail in lieu of 15000 bail

a greedy grouper whose seemingly 
insatiable appetite for his expensive tankmates made him famous 
celebrated independence day by swimming free in his new home the 
ocean 
eighteen months ago a footlong 3pound brownspotted jewfish 
a member of the grouper family was plucked from the waters off the 
florida keys terry haley owner of an aquarium store in lansing 
ill bought it and took it north 
he fed the fish five pounds of smelt every other day but 
evidently that wasnt enough for flazey the fishs name short for 
fat and lazy 
between meals he snacked on 5000 worth of exotic fish that 
shared his aquarium that took six months flazey even tried to 
consume a twofoot shark 
the fish grew to 3 feet and 35 pounds haley grew tired of 
replacing costly tropical fish 
so flazey was returned to the ocean monday released from a thick 
yellow net off fort lauderdale haley had flown the fish south 
several days before 
wearing scuba gear the store owner accompanied his famous charge 
into the waves and patted him one last time flazey then drifted 
away 
it was nice of him to hang around for a while haley said 
newspaper and television photographers captured the poignant 
parting from a nearby florida marine patrol boat 
haley said it was hard to watch flazey disappear into the 
darkness 
i feel kind of bad to tell you the truth he said its 
hard to explain even though its a fish its like any other pet 
you care for 
flazey traveled to the site in a 50gallon tank aboard a 24foot 
boat owned by noyes marine life the fort lauderdale aquarium 
supplier that caught the fish and sold it to haley 
the store owner said he got phone calls from folks who didnt 
want to see flazey released fearing he might be caught by an 
angler but haley decided to return the grouper to his natural home 
if we had never taken him out of the ocean he would have had 
just as equal a chance for survival haley said hell do fine 
shortly after letting flazey go haley seemed a bit wistful as he 
thought of his former pet 
itd be great to know where he is right now he said hes 
probably looking at the menu

institutional revolutionary party has accepted defeat in a 
gubernatorial race 
luis donaldo colosio president of the partys national executive 
committee said results compiled by the party showed the 
conservative national action party pan candidate had won sundays 
race in baja california state 
since its founding in 1929 the party known by its spanish 
initials as pri has never lost a presidential election so 
dominating mexican politics that its name became synonymous with 
government 
only a year ago did the party suffer its first senate losses in 
michoacan state and the mexico city federal district 
sundays elections in five states were seen as a major test of 
whether after seven months in office president carlos salinas de 
gortari would make good on his promise to recognize opposition 
victories and clean up the electoral process 
a presidential spokeswoman said salinas passed the test 
the president made the decision to plunge into the democratic 
game she said speaking on condition of anonymity it is an 
unprecedented change in the history of mexico 
it marks the beginning of a new step in the political life of 
the country this opens new channels for political competition 
in mexico and living together in a multiparty system 
official vote results are to be released sunday but colosios 
statement was considered de facto recognition of the pri loss in 
baja california 
salinas the presidential spokeswoman said is the first 
president in the contemporary era of mexico who has the courage and 
the ability to recognize a defeat of his own party at the state 
level 
jesus antonio rivera president of pans state committee in baja 
california said he received the news of the victory with total 
joy 
the victorious ernesto ruffo a former mayor of ensenada and the 
pris margarita ortega had each claimed victory in the gubernatorial 
race 
opposition parties had said that if the pri claim of victory were 
backed by the electoral commission they would consider the election 
stolen 
the pri in recent years has been increasingly criticized for 
alleged widespread votemanipulation rigging of elections and 
repeated balloting irregularities 
the party had in the past maintained its strength through a 
network of labor unions and organizations of farm workers 
government employees and other groups that turned out the vote in 
exchange for jobs political posts access to funds and other perks 
elections last july showed pris power was fading 
united behind a single candidate for the first time cuauhtemoc 
cardenas the left held salinas to 50 percent of the vote the pri 
held onto its congressional majority but lost the twothirds needed 
to rubber stamp constitutional reforms 
the electoral commission independent voting observers and pan 
all agreed there were numerous irregularities in sundays voting 
such as the theft of ballot boxes obstruction of opposition 
observers and the early closing of some polling places 
two of the other states holding elections zacatecas and 
campeche are traditional pri strongholds but in michoacan the 
leftist democratic revolutionary party led by cardenas was claiming 
victory 
the democratic revolutionary party claimed it had won at least 14 
of michoacans 24 seats in the state assembly 
in ciudad juarez across the border from el paso texas throngs 
of disgruntled pan members staged a 90minute demonstration monday 
night at the local election board to protest massive irregularities 
in the chihuahua state elections for mayors 
pan spokesman gustavo elizondo and other party leaders said 
dozens of voters reported having their thumbs stamped with 
presumably indelible ink that could be washed off allowing them to 
vote more than once

a police ban on fireworks at the annual fourth of 
july block party thrown by reputed mobster john gotti failed to 
dampen the spirits of thousands of revelers or keep the nighttime 
skies dark 
gotti has thrown an independence day bash for some 20 years at 
the site of his hangout the bergin hunt and fish club and ended 
the party with a blaze of pyrotechnics 
a warning from the local police precinct failed to stop the show 
last year and police commissioner benjamin ward vowed his 
department wouldnt be embarrassed again 
but tuesday night the presence of scores of police failed to 
stop men on rooftops from sending off rockets to the cheers of 
crowds on the streets shortly before taunts of pigs go home 
and we want the works were heard 
police who had told the partys organizers fireworks would be 
illegal without a permit said the rocketthrowers apparently were 
mavericks they issued one summons for possession of illegal 
fireworks but made no arrests 
officers lined barricades on each side of the block and closed 
off streets for four blocks in every direction except to cars 
driven by local residents 
gotti gotti gotti the crowd cheered as their host the 
48yearold reputed head of the gambino crime family emerged 
briefly from the club that authorities call his headquarters 
gotti is under indictment in the attempted murder of a union 
leader but grateful locals had no trouble downing his hamburgers 
grilled under the supervision of two of the hosts brothers 
hes got a good heart said sal ceffali who attended with 
his wife and two grandsons he takes care of people in the 
community added his wife sally youre not afraid to walk 
around at night

george shibley a defense attorney who 
represented robert f kennedys assassin sirhan sirhan and helped 
defend 12 hispanics in the zoot suit murder case of the 1940s 
has died of cardiac arrest at 79 
shibley died tuesday at good samaritan hospital where he had 
undergone heart surgery june 8 
he was a supporter of kennedys presidential campaign when the 
senator was shot to death in 1968 in los angeles hours after winning 
the california democratic primary 
but he took on sirhans case after mary sirhan appealed for help 
when her son was sentenced to death 
sirhans sentence was reduced to life in prison when the 
california supreme court ruling in an unrelated case said the 
state constitution prohibited the death penalty the state has since 
restored capital punishment 
in the 1940s the lawyer who had graduated from stanford 
university only a few years before helped defend 12 young hispanics 
in the murder of a mexican immigrant in what came to be known as the 
zoot suit case because of the long baggy suits worn in the 
barrio the case became the basis of a movie and play 
newspapers of the era fanned prejudice against the defendants 
who were convicted despite the efforts of seven defense attorneys 
but shibley who had filed a rash of objections during the trial 
successfully appealed 
depending on how you look at it the case made me famous or 
infamous shibley recalled in 1986 it also made the forces of 
law and order hate me

soviet union should have notified them when the plane entered their 
airspace 
in an interview with tass yazov said investigators were en route

it is difficult to say why it was not shot down why it was not 
detected yazov said a largescale investigation should be 
carried out

immediately after takeoff on the training flight prompted the pilot 
to eject 
as the pilot himself explained the afterburner spontaneously 
switched off during the takeoff and the plane began to decelerate

probability developed and the plane continued its flight 
the mig23 flew over some of western europes most densely

information about the plane as it overflew their territories and why 
they had to wait for 10 hours tuesday to get a first reaction to the 
crash through the official tass news agency 
there was an extreme slowness in information belgian foreign 
minister mark eyskens told reporters after he summoned soviet 
ambassador felix bogdanov 
my conclusion corroborated by the soviet ambassador is that 
information systems have to be improved between the two blocs he 
said adding belgium will raise the issue with its nato allies

former president reagan once said there is 
nothing so good for the inside of a man as the outside of a horse 
he may not feel that way today following his fourth of july toss 
from a horse at a ranch in mexico that resulted in minor bruises and 
abrasions 
reagan spokesman mark weinberg said the horse reagan was riding 
bucked on a rocky downhill slope throwing the 78yearold former 
president to the ground 
weinberg said reagan called the incident my own private 
rodeo adding that hes an excellent rider and he held on quite 
a while 
although tuesdays ride may have been a rough one reagan has 
generally found serenity on the back of a horse 
thats how he charges his batteries said former reagan 
spokesman jim lake in a 1980 newspaper interview he doesnt go 
out and drink or carouse or party or entertain he likes to go up 
there in the loneliness of his 677acre ranch riding his horses 
building his fences being with his wife i think its his sense 
of personal accomplishment and achievement his physical handling of 
the world 
aides have said that reagan did much of his thinking about the 
problems a president might face in the days prior to his successful 
1980 campaign while riding a horse around his ranch 30 miles west of 
santa barbara 
reagan took up riding when he was a young sportscaster in des 
moines iowa in the 1930s and pursued it enthusiastically right 
through his presidency he would often take off one afternoon a week 
to go riding at the marine base in quantico va 
as california governor reagan rode several times in the annual 
trek of the rancheros vistadores a 65miles ride that was started 
as a way for men who enjoy the atmosphere of the old west to get 
away for a few days 
in 1976 when he made his illfated presidential run reagan told 
reporters his secret service guards were joining him on rides 
i give them riding lessons he said 
during his eight years as president reagan on a horse was a 
familiar sight serving as a reminder to the nation that its elderly 
president was in robust health 
in september 1985 reagan joked about taking his first horseback 
ride since undergoing colon cancer surgery two months earlier 
he told reporters my horse and i had a chance to get 
reacquainted and i had time to reflect once again on an old truth 
from the cavalry there is nothing so good for the inside of a man 
as the outside of a horse

afghan jet fighters bombed guerrilla 
positions around kabul and the eastern city of jalalabad today a 
day after the government claimed the resistance was preparing a 
major offensive 
also today at least eight rockets slammed into kabul killing at 
least five people said an official of the sovietbacked government 
two rockets hit a residential area 1000 yards from the 
continental hotel in northwestern kabul where most visiting 
foreigners including journalists live there were no immediate 
reports of casualties near the hotel 
diplomatic sources and witnesses said the dawn air strikes on the 
guerrilla positions near kabul were the most intensive in weeks but 
there was no immediate report of casualties 
the supreme defense council reporting the bombings around 
jalalabad said its forces were combatting with high morale and 
inflicting retaliatory blows to defend the city which has been 
under guerrilla siege since march 7 
the statement gave no word on casualties 
the government official who demanded anonymity said the air 
force and artillery units battled the usbacked guerrillas 
jalalabad 
the city is 75 miles east of the capital and 45 miles west of the 
border with pakistan where many of the guerrillas are based 
the fighterbombers were seen flying off from kabul and nearby 
baghram air base in formations of two and three for the paghman 
mountains northwest of the capital the mountains serve as a 
sanctuary for resistance fighters 
thirty to 35 planes took part in an operation that began at dawn 
and continued for 90 minutes witnesses said 
afghan government officials were not available for immediate 
comment 
some of the aircraft headed for the eastern province of 
nangarhar where the guerrillas launched their first major attacks 
three weeks after the soviet union completed its troop withdrawal 
from afghanistan on feb 15 
jalalabad scene of fierce battles between the resistance and 
government troops is the capital nangarhar and the countrys fifth 
largest city 
it is considered of strategic importance because of its proximity 
to pakistan where the most powerful guerrilla groups are based 
the government claims it broke the rebel siege on jalalabad last 
month but official kabul radio has reported fighting around the 
city for the past two weeks the radio said guerrillas on tuesday 
fired artillery and rockets into residential areas of jalalabad 
killing four people including two children and wounding eight 
including two soldiers 
the government said tuesday that moslem rebels were planning 
simultaneous massive attacks on kabul and other major cities 
and asked the united nations to intervene to stop the impending 
bloodbath

foreign minister abdul wakil said the guerrillas were planning to 
launch the assault in midjuly 
wakil said the rebels were being aided in their planned attack by 
us and pakistani army officers he did not elaborate 
the grave consequences of the attack which will include 
bloodshed killings and destruction will be shouldered by the 
pakistani militarists and overseas designers of the attack wakil 
said in a statement tuesday 
the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan seized power 
in an april 1978 coup in december 1979 the soviet union intervened 
to prop up the marxist regime

cambodian resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk today ruled out a separate peace agreement with the 
vietnameseinstalled government in phnom penh and promised to keep 
fighting 
he told a news conference that vietnams promised september 
withdrawal of its troops is a farce 
and sihanouk clung to his khmer rouge allies saying any 
settlement must include the communists who killed perhaps a million 
of their countrymen while they were in power 197578 
i tell you very clearly that i will not go to phnom penh 
sihanouk said at his mansion in beijing one of several 
homesinexile 
i refuse to cooperate with hun sen on a bilateral basis he 
said of cambodias prime minister 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in 1978 to oust the khmer rouge 
has said it will pull the last of its troops out in september 
however sihanouk claimed that 130000 vietnamese soldiers will 
remain disguised as cambodian soldiers and peasant militia 
he insisted that no settlement can be reached until all 
vietnamese have left including 1 million vietnamese civilian 
settlers and until hun sen agrees to a coalition including the 
khmer rouge 
the problem will not be solved after the 30th of september 
sihanouk said 
no one can stop the resistance from fighting it is not because 
we dont have compassion for our people he said we are not for 
war we are fighting for peace but peace without independence is 
meaningless 
in talks in may hun sen had proposed changes to make the 
cambodian constitution more acceptable to the prince and suggested 
that sihanouk return to phnom penh as head of state after the 
vietnamese withdrawal 
hun sen has refused to accept khmer rouge participation in a 
postvietnamese coalition government including sihanouk and a third 
resistance group led by noncommunist son sann 
sihanouk who was held under house arrest when the khmer rouge 
were in power appeared in may to flirt with the idea of dropping 
his communist allies however he said today such a move would put 
the oxen before the cart 
we must concentrate on fighting the vietnamese he said he 
said critics focus on khmer rouge atrocities but ignore amnesty 
international reports alleging torture and murder by hun sens 
government 
sihanouk is under international pressure including from 
southeast asian nations that support him to reach an agreement 
before the vietnamese withdraw but he said he is not optimistic 
the prince rejected hun sens proposed constitutional amendments 
as cosmetic saying they would leave the government very 
vietnamesestyle communist 
he said the resistance is preparing its own draft to present at 
july 24 peace talks in paris it will provide for a liberal 
parliamentary democracy modeled on france with a president chosen 
by direct popular election for a sevenyear term

secretary of state james a 
baker iii today arrived for talks on achieving peace in cambodia 
once vietnam completes the scheduled withdrawal of its forces in 
september 
baker and his colleagues from the association of southeast asian 
nations are anxious to avoid an outbreak of civil war among four 
contending factions in cambodia after the vietnamese are gone 
baker arrived in this tiny sultanate after a oneday visit to 
japan he plans meetings with his colleagues from aseans six member 
states brunei indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and 
thailand 
the association concluded its annual meeting tuesday and is 
comparing notes with the united states and other outside parties in 
talks thursday through saturday 
an asean communique issued tuesday night called for a 
comprehensive settlement to the cambodian conflict to achieve that 
goal france has suggested a meeting among the contending factions 
later this month in paris 
the southeast asian group has been active in bringing the various 
cambodian factions together for settlement talks but it is far from 
certain that goal can be achieved 
in beijing cambodian resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk 
today ruled out a separate peace agreement with the 
vietnameseinstalled government led by hun sen and pledged to keep 
on fighting with his khmer rouge allies hun sen suggested that 
sihanouk return as head of state after vietnam withdraws but 
rejected khmer rouge participation in a new government 
baker and the asean countries say an effort must be made to 
prevent a return to power of the khmer rouge whose bloody 3year 
rule in the 1970s claimed the lives of 1 million cambodians the 
khmer rouge were ousted by vietnamese invading forces a decade ago 
a reported bush administration plan to provide lethal aid to 
noncommunist forces in cambodia has touched off heated debate in 
congress these forces have been receiving nonlethal us aid since 
1985 
defending the proposal for lethal aid rep stephen solarz 
dny chairman of the house subcommittee on asian affairs says 
the khmer rouge could take power once again and turn cambodia into 
an asian auschwitz 
but sens claiborne pell dri chairman of the foreign 
relations committee and alan cranston dcalif have proposed 
legislation to ban us military aid to the noncommunist factions 
all representatives at the conference want a political settlement 
in cambodia before the vietnamese forces pull out 
china could play a key role in determining the outcome in 
cambodia because it is the major supplier of aid to the khmer rouge 
china had been distancing itself from the khmer rouge but us 
officials aboard bakers plane said chinas willingness to cooperate 
with the aseanled effort in cambodia is less certain following the 
political victory last month of hardliners in beijing over more 
moderate forces 
china was one of the topics of discussion between baker and 
japanese prime minster sosuke uno in tokyo the two countries appear 
to have much the same view of the chinese situation

hundreds of people filed past the floweradorned 
open casket of andrei a gromyko today to bid farewell to the man 
who steered soviet diplomacy through the cold war and detente 
diplomats and commoners lined the sidewalk for several blocks 
under gray skies as they waited to enter the turquoisecolored 
central soviet army house in north moscow 
a blackandwhite portrait of gromyko featuring the dour face 
that earned him the nickname grim grom hung at the entrance 
because gromyko held no public office when he died he received a 
private funeral but the official media gave accolades to the man 
who served as foreign minister for 28 years and retired gracefully 
from the presidency nine months ago when mikhail s gorbachev eased 
him out of power 
gromyko died sunday at age 79 
his name is connected with the huge successes of soviet foreign 
policy directed at the relaxation of international tension and 
consolidation of world peace vitaly i vorotnikov premier of the 
russian federation told 300 mourners at novodevichy cemetery before 
gromyko was buried 
vorotnikov a member of the ruling politburo was the most senior 
soviet official at the 15minute ceremony 
gorbachev and eduard a shevardnadze who suceeded gromyko as 
foreign minister were on an official visit to france 
as a drizzle wet mourners gromyko was buried among the ornate 
graves of the soviet elite at novodevichy the most prestigious 
soviet resting place after red square a military honor guard fired 
a salute as workers shoveled soil over his red and black coffin 
gromykos son anatoly who followed in his fathers foreign 
policy footsteps and heads a kremlin think tank on african affairs 
shook his head solemnly as he held the hand of his veiled weeping 
mother lydia 
prominent soviet writers actors cosmonauts and political and 
military figures are buried in novodevichy buried there are such 
soviet leaders as nikita s khrushchev nikolai a bulganin and 
vyacheslav m molotov 
as he lay in state earlier gromykos body was surrounded by his 
29 medals displayed on red cushions among the awards were hero of 
socialist labor and the countrys highest civilian honor the order 
of lenin which he received six times 
the cause of gromykos death was not announced but a soviet 
source said today he had been hospitalized for three weeks and died 
when his aorta burst he had been diagnosed as having circulatory 
problems five years ago the source said on condition of anonymity 
gromyko became foreign minister after serving as ambassador to 
the united states during world war ii to the united nations and to 
britain in a halfcentury of public service 
he was a fixture in world diplomacy for decades helping forge 
the alliance that won world war ii joining in founding the united 
nations and participating in superpower talks that shaped the modern 
world 
but when gorbachev rose to power in march 1985 he eased gromyko 
out of the ruling elite steering kremlin foreign policy toward a 
new nonconfrontational approach 
some soviets have said gromyko shared the blame for foreign 
policy mistakes such as the 1979 soviet intervention in 
afghanistan the confrontational approach he represented was 
reflected in another nickname mr nyet 
those attending the funeral echoed the reserved respect expressed 
by the soviet leadership 
he represented old times said navy officer andrei n 
pochtarev now we must have a new approach times have changed 
longtime soviet ambassador to washington anatoly f dobrynin now 
an adviser to gorbachev told reporters as he arrived to pay his 
respects he was leading and working during a very difficult time 
in our history he has done his best

among the rail disasters reported under the policy of glasnost or

mountains near the city of ufa

trains collided near alma ata kazakhstan touching off an explosion

china has ordered major jointventure hotels in 
beijing to unhook satellite dishes that receive foreign news 
broadcasts mainly from cable news network hotel officials said 
today 
some hotels also receive the us armed forces radio and 
television service and the japan broadcasting corp 
anyone with a satellite dish can receive the programming and 
hotels do not pay the networks or chinese government for the service 
an official at beijings travel and tourism bureau said satellite 
service was ordered cut because it is unfair 
it is not universal in beijing hotels the chinese hotels do 
not have this service said the official who identified himself 
only as sun 
but vito maggiolo cnn managing editor in beijing said our 
guess is that they are concerned that the hotel staff is seeing it 
china is engaged in an intensive propaganda campaign to discredit 
western news accounts of a sevenweek student movement for democracy 
and a military crackdown on june 34 
chinese media have said nearly 100 soldiers and police died in 
the crackdown and that thousands were injured while about 100 
civilians died and nearly 1000 were injured chinese witnesses and 
western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as 
high as 3000 
sun said the order to cut cable reception was issued in january 
but was enforced only in the past few days after the government 
realized hotels had not heeded the first order 
hotels in shanghai and guangzhou said they have not been ordered 
to cut satellite reception 
beijing hotel officials agreed the government order was issued 
about six months ago but said there have been no previous attempts 
to enforce it 
the great wall sheraton was the first to cut its satellite 
service last month it restored the service briefly this week 
reportedly because it realized other hotels were ignoring the order 
but cut it again less than 24 hours later 
the jiangguo hotel chinas first jointventure hotel suspended 
service friday the day after cnn broadcast a videotape of exiled 
student leader wuer kaixi saying he will never give up the struggle 
for democracy in china 
a hotel circular a few days later blamed technical difficulties 
for the loss of programming 
at least four other beijing hotels the shangrila palace 
kunlun and holiday inn lido have cut satellite service 
questions and complaints from hotel guests elicited a variety of 
responses from blank looks to talk of mysterious technical problems 
we are upset about it but what can we do we have to accept 
it we cannot fight it a jianguo hotel official said on condition 
of anonymity 
sun said hotels that refuse to follow the order will not be 
punished but added that hotels in china should obey chinese law 
joint ventures in china are between the government and private 
foreign companies

two former ptl aides accused of diverting 
11 million from the evangelical empire built by jim bakker had 
authorization to use ministry credit cards and take out cash 
advances their lawyer argued today 
brothers david and james taggart went on trial today on federal 
charges they failed to pay 487000 in income taxes on the amount 
from 1984 to 1987 and spent the money on such personal items as a 
condominium jewelry luxury cars and clothing 
the case is expected to bring out allegations of high living in 
the inner sanctum of ptl before bakkers downfall in a sex and money 
scandal in 1987 
but special prosecutor joseph bender told the jury the case is 
not about jim and tammy bakker or whether defendants collected 
exorbitant salaries or bonuses 
its about the income the defendants failed to pay taxes on 
he said 
in his opening remarks defense attorney ben cotten argued 
this case is not about taxes we concede at the outset there are 
some taxes owed by david and james this is a case about 
authorization intent and doubt 
cotten said witnesses and documents would show that his clients 
had authorization from the highest levels of the tv ministry to use 
ptl funds 
prosecutors allege that david taggart 32 who was bakkers 
personal aide and his 35yearold brother james ptls former 
interior decorator used ptl credit cards to get big cash advances 
and used blank ptl checks to pay american express bills 
if convicted each could be sentenced to 25 years in prison and 
fined more than 1 million 
a grand jury indicted the brothers in december the same day ptl 
founder bakker and his former top aide richard dortch were 
indicted on charges of mail and wire fraud for allegedly diverting 
more than 4 million of ptl money to their own use and conspiring to 
defraud ptl contributors 
bakker and dortchs trial is set for aug 28 however a hearing 
was scheduled today on whether to move the trial because of heavy 
publicity 
us magistrate paul taylor wanted to hold the hearing behind 
closed doors but several news organizations appealed and an 
appeals court overruled him 
the witness list in the taggart trial looks like a whos who 
of tv evangelism 
the prosecution may call evangelists jerry falwell john wesley 
fletcher rex humbard and rex humbard jr defense witnesses could 
include bakkers daughter tammy sue chapman and the rev aimee 
cortese a former ptl board member 
the taggarts bought a 660000 condominium on fifth avenue in new 
york and a 317000 home in charlotte in 1986 they gave each other 
jaguars as christmas presents at a cost of nearly 90000

the idaho statesman boise idaho on the supreme courts 
abortion ruling 
the supreme court opened the back door monday and began chipping 
away at roe vs wade the controversial suit that spawned a 1973 
decision to legalize abortions 
the justices ducked the core issue refusing to consider whether 
or not women have a constitutionally protected right to an abortion 
instead they chose the more lengthy painful process of taking 
away abortion rights one rule and one regulation at a time 
the deeply divided court did not enlighten or direct our troubled 
nation either by its opinions or the reasoning used to reach them 
its muddled message will divide us further by raising the specter 
that abortions once again will be available to some but not all

philadelphia daily news on the abortion ruling 
its easy to see why the supreme court of the united states took 
so long to announce its opinion in the latest abortion case it took 
that long to juryrig a majority out of some of the most specious 
reasoning in the annals of making the law fit the desired conclusion 
although the parties in the suit and others who chose to join the 
fight based much of their arguments on the right to privacy chief 
justice william h rehnquist and his accomplices found that line of 
reasoning entirely too clear too far from the conclusion they 
wanted to reach 
instead they used the astonishing conclusion that the 
constitution does not specifically mention the magic words 
trimester and viability seldom has such an intelligent 
group used such pinheaded logic 
the claim that the old law is undisturbed is an inelegant 
judicial lie there will be legislation introduced in this state and 
others to make abortion as uncomfortable risky and expensive as 
possible 
the difference between before monday and after is that the 
enemies of privacy now know that the fix is in

the tennessean nashville tenn on the abortion ruling 
it was tragic to see the us supreme court knock its first chip 
out of the 1973 roe v wade ruling that guarantees women the right 
to an abortion 
there is no doubt that the courts ruling will give impetus 
to the antiabortion forces people in every state will push for the 
most restrictive state laws the courts will allow 
lawmakers should remember that safe abortions have always been 
available and always will be available to women with the money 
to pay for them the states cant write a law that cant be bypassed 
with enough dough 
wealthy women will be able to shop around for a sympathetic 
physician or travel to a state with less restrictive laws but what 
about women who cant afford to take off work and leave their 
families for a sudden vacation to new york what about women who 
dont have adequate health care and certainly cant afford to shop 
around for a doctor who will give the necessary approval 
those women the poor and middleincome the uninsured and the 
unemployed the young will do what they did before roe theyll 
seek out illegal unsafe abortions some of them will have their 
babies and give them up but some of them will just give up their 
lives

the miami herald on the supreme courts abortion ruling 
the worst fears of prochoice advocates did not materialize in 
the fractured and fractious reagan courts abortion ruling but 
the antiabortion repression of the pre1973 years now has a 
detectable heartbeat that it has not had since roe vs wade for 
womens liberty and equality that inchoate viability is indeed 
evident ominous and chilling 
if abortion were not already a heated issue the supreme court 
now has made it whitehot the courts longawaited decision on a 
missouri law challenging the epochal 1973 roe vs wade decision 
guarantees years more of political turmoil and emotional litigation 
it in effect told women that they leave their control of their 
lives at the door if they must consult a public clinic or hospital 
 
while the prohibition on using tax money for actual abortions can 
be defended the prohibition on counseling at public facilities 
cannot moreover this prohibition will deprive poor and rich woman 
alike of their choice of doctors because so many physicians practice 
at public hospitals 
such a willingness by the court to permit legislative tinkering 
is a clear invitation to the states to reduce abortion rights 
inchmeal what strictures will the court next approve will it allow 
legislatures to ban sterilization or dispensing of birthcontrol 
information at public facilities even for paying patients and if a 
legislature now may mandate fetalviability tests will it next be 
permitted to mandate procedures to outlaw abortion beyond the first 
trimester or altogether

a soviet nuclear submarine that caught fire 
last week off norway leaked small amounts of radiation and its 
reactor may have come close to a meltdown a norwegian scientist 
said 
traces of radioactive iodine 131 were found in a water sample 
taken two days after the june 26 fire aboard the echo ii class 
vessel 70 miles off norways coast in the norwegian sea state 
researchers said tuesday 
knut gussgard director of the norwegian nuclear energy safety 
board said the submarine apparently suffered what is called a 
loss of coolant accident which is what can lead to a meltdown 
gussgard said the radioactive iodine is a byproduct of nuclear 
fission which means the core must have leaked coolant exposing 
uranium fuel rods that may have burst or even began to melt 
support for the possibility of a meltdown came from finn 
ugletveit of the norwegian radiation hygiene institute the 
chances that this kind of radiation came from anything but the core 
are slim he said 
ugletveit whose institute conducted the radiation tests said 
the radioactive iodine 131 was diluted by seawater and we expect 
it to disappear completely very quickly all other air and water 
tests showed no radiation 
tass on monday said four sailors were hospitalized and were being 
examined for possible radiation poisoning but the news agency said 
today that the four were healthy and have no excess radiation 
tass quoted lt gen igor sinoplanikov of the soviet defense 
ministry as saying a decontamination of the submarines crew was 
carried out june 28 the day the vessel returned to soviet naval 
base at murmansk this was done to dispel fears of the sailors and 
their relatives sinoplanikov said 
in a message to the norwegian government recieved on friday 
moscow said the reactors primary cooling system leaked but the 
systems design guaranteed the security of the reactor the 
norwegian news agency ntb reported 
gussgard said the size of a submarine reactor is about 2 percent 
of a power plant such as chernobyl which caused an environmental 
disaster after a 1986 nuclear accident 
a submarine reactor is so small that we probably wouldnt see 
an environmental catastrophe but if there was a meltdown off 
norway we might experience radiation levels similar to those that 
passed over norway and sweden after chernobyl he said 
chernobyl fallout contaminated livestock and fish in parts of 
norway and sweden as well as parts of eastern europe 
with two accidents in three months among the 100 nuclear 
submarines of the soviet north fleet base near norway gussgard said 
a major accident no longer seems theoretical 
on april 7 a soviet mike class nuclear submarine sank off 
norway killing 42 soviet sailors

roman catholic groups said wednesday 
the government is engaging in political revenge in its investigation 
of an opposition lawmaker who visited north korea 
the church groups accused the government of trying the case in 
the media against suh kyungwon a national assemblyman charged with 
violation of national security laws for visiting the communist 
nation 
the government maintains that contact with north korea must be 
made only through official channels 
the agency for national security planning the intelligence arm 
of the government was expected to question cardinal stephen kim in 
the case suh a catholic told south koreas roman catholic prelate 
about his trip after he returned 
the cardinal said he regarded suhs conversation about the trip 
as private and felt his moral obligation as a priest required him to 
remain silent 
laws are no longer laws but political reprisals or violence if 
laws run counter to human nature and justice said a statement 
issued at a news conference wednesday by catholic groups which 
included the justice and peace committee of the korean catholic 
church 
the article in the national security law forcing a father to 
inform against his son a priest against a believer a reporter 
against his news source and people against each other is 
fundamentally against human ethics and the spirit of laws said 
the statement 
the opposition party for peace and democracy to which suh 
belonged said it lodged a protest tuesday with prime minister kang 
younghoon accusing the government of exploiting the affair to 
discredit the leading opposition party 
suh is under arrest after turning himself in june 25 for 
traveling to see north korean leader kim il sung in august 1988 to 
discuss unification of the peninsula the government bans 
unauthorized travel to north korea and maintains dialogue must be 
conducted through official channels 
prosecutors concerned that both suh and north korea kept his 
visit secret for 10 months broadened the investigation to look into 
three other trips suh has taken overseas since 1985 
sources said the agency for national security planning was 
looking into the source of campaign funds suh received for his april 
1988 election and into money an aide allegedly received for him from 
a north korean agent in west germany 
warrants were issued for eight people including suhs 
girlfriend who were charged with failing to report his trip to 
authorities all but one who was hospitalized were in jail 
several dozen have been summoned for questioning 
the peninsula was divided north and south at the end of world war 
ii the north invaded the south in 1950 to start the bloody 
threeyear korean war a peace treaty was never signed and the two 
koreas remain bitter enemies 
also wednesday riot police clashed with students staging an 
antigovernment rally at dongkook university that drew about 200 
demonstrators 
the clash came a day after hundreds of students battled riot 
police in rallies called to support a seoul student im sukyoung 
who visited north korea for the 13th world festival of youth and 
students which ends july 8 
the government said she would be arrested and charged with 
national security violations when she returns home

for 10 years famed kung fu novelist and 
publisher louis cha has been wielding the might of his newspaper in 
support of communist chinas reform program 
now he feels a man betrayed betrayed by chinese leader deng 
xiaoping who ordered the killing of unarmed protesters in beijing 
and by the peoples liberation army who carried out the order 
sitting in his ornate office decorated with pillars covered in 
gold leaf and imitation french renaissance furniture cha appears to 
be a profoundly disturbed man 
i am very very sad he said in an interview my hopes for 
my country to be strong to have steady progress are weak now i 
see bad things in the future 
cha 65 belongs to a large group of chinese living overseas who 
for decades have carried atorch of patriotism for their motherland 
some sent back thousands of dollars for their families others 
designed buildings in china still others returned to help the 
countrys development cha for his part wrote 
from the early 1950s when he published his first novel cha has 
pumped out 36 volumes of rollicking kung fu adventures in ancient 
china 
in addition in the 30 years since he started the newspaper ming 
pao with four friends and the royalties from his successful novels 
cha has written hundreds of editorials on his country and on the 
future of the british colony of hong kong 
in that time his paper has grown from two pages to about 42 
from a gutsy voice of the patriotic opposition to one of the leading 
intellectual chineselanguage papers in the world 
cha who is from the southern chinese city of hangzhou began his 
life as a journalist for ta kung pao a procommunist newspaper then 
based in shanghai 
he left the mainland in 1948 a year before the communist 
takeover and came to hong kong to open the papers office in the 
british colony 
like many young chinese of his generation cha supported the 
goals of the communists and worked to communicate them in the pages 
of the partybacked paper 
but then came 1957 and with it chinas first big political 
movement the antirightist campaign thousands of intellectuals 
were purged and imprisoned for criticizing the government 
i was disillusioned with the communists distorting the truth 
he said so i quit and started my own newspaper in 1959 ming 
pao hit the stands 
in the 1960s as china collapsed into the ultraleftist cultural 
revolution cha opposed the campaigns against intellectuals and 
highranking cadres such as deng and former head of government liu 
shaochi 
communistbacked organizations in hong kong issued death threats 
several bombs were delivered to the paper although none went off 
cha was placed under police protection 
when deng seized power in 1978 and announced a reform program to 
open china to the outside world and develop its economy cha backed 
him with all his editorial might 
chas usefulness to the chinese government was heightened when 
after a 23year absence he returned to the mainland in 1981 and met 
with deng a fan of chas novels and other top leaders 
during the early days of the student movement in april chas 
paper praised the government for not cracking down on the students 
but on may 20 martial law was ordered cha resigned from his 
post on the chinese legislature and sent letters of protest to 
beijing urging deng to talk with the students 
on june 34 cha stayed home with his wife and watched the 
account of the massacre on television 
a few days later he appeared on local tv with tears in his eyes 
and condemned the violence 
who could have expected that the magnificent ideals would 
vanish into thin air in less than one month he wrote in an 
editorial june 11 is it that the encouragement we had and the 
belief we held in the past ten or more years are nothing but an 
illusion nothing but a fond dream 
china began to criticize chas paper 
on july 1 the peoples daily scolded ming pao for 
rumormongering president yang shangkun called cha an old 
anticommunist according to cha 
cha is not optimistic about the future he has canceled plans to 
retire to hangzhou and is considering leaving hong kong for another 
country 
if i stay here after 1997 i am afraid they will settle their 
accounts with me and it will be dangerous he said i am worried 
for me and for my wife 
as for his paper cha believes the communist takeover will see 
more censorship whether forced or selfimposed and he fears for 
the rest of hong kong as well 
our fates are tied to one another now as china goes hong kong 
will follow he said 
and finally louis cha fears for his motherland 
they have set my country back years by killing the beautiful 
old hundred names he said using the chinese expression for common 
people for that they should never be forgiven

1910 was raised on the northwest side but the family returned to

officials who refused to let stolars whole family leave 
i was an alien there for all the 58 years i was there stolar 
said it was a crime they didnt let me out 
simon met stolar during a trip to moscow in 1980 and contacted 
soviet officials and us diplomats in efforts to secure stolars

gorbachev allowed stolar his wife son daughterinlaw and two 
grandchildren to leave for israel

the first israeli film on the palestinian 
uprising brings three generations of jews to the green fields of the 
occupied west bank and says they failed to recognize when senseless 
killing becomes the norm 
director isaac zepel yeshuron pronounces his protagonists an 
israeli living in the united states his berkeleyeducated wife and 
their soldier son guilty of accepting violence as the only way to 
handle the rebellion in which more than 540 arabs have died 
the level of that violence steadily increases in the film from 
beatings to the chilling climax of murder that left some viewers 
crying after this weeks premiere 
this is the aim of yeshuron who wants to break that mechanism 
of both knowing and ignoring created by people who wish to have a 
bearable life 
this movie was made so that things would become known he 
said in an israel radio interview this week 
yeshurons green fields is one of three new israeli movies 
devoted to the israelipalestinian conflict that were screened at 
the jerusalem film festival where 130 films from 44 countries are 
being screened june 29july 8 
yehuda judd neemans actionpacked streets of yesterday 
portrays an israeli named raz becoming entangled in an international 
intrigue involving palestinian guerrillas israels mossad 
intelligence agency and west germanys secret service raz is an 
israeli peace campaigner who helps an arab friend belonging to a 
palestinian guerrilla group in the end his friend is shot to death 
and he is on the run as an accomplice 
end of the orange season by director lihi hanoch takes the 
viewer on a journey with iconoclastic israeli rock singer shalom 
hanoch and his friends through the tense summer of 1988 it is a 
compendium of protest music generated when the stonethrowing revolt 
reached its peak and israeli politicians campaigned in national 
elections that ended in stalemate 
green fields is the most gripping of the israeli entries 
which include a retrospective on the immigration of iraqi jews and a 
comedy on kibbutz life it is favored to win the 20000 award for 
best israeli director and producer and the 10000 prize for the 
most promising israeli filmmaker 
the braverman family grandparents son shmulik on a visit with 
his american wife and soldier rami are on their way to an army 
ceremony in the occupied west bank 
hitching a ride in a jewish settlers van the bravermans end up 
in a palestinian village under curfew where masked stonethrowing 
youths rule the streets 
as the first stone hits the car all taboos come loose and the 
bravermans act like israeli soldiers battling the almost 19month 
rebellion 
they beat up a palestinian youth forcing him to remove a 
makeshift stone barricade then they tie him to the hood of their 
car to avoid being stoned almost killing the youth in the process 
rami erupts in violence after capturing another palestinian who 
tried to grab a gun the jewish settler then calmly shoots the arab 
in the leg 
the bravermans escape and find themselves in the wilderness of 
the west bank shmulik armed with his sons rifle forces two arabs 
out of a passing jeep he needs to escape 
this is a crime one of the palestinians keeps repeating 
until shmulik driven mad shoots and kills him 
in addition to shmuliks blind violence yeshuron condemns the 
grandparents for whom business was as usual 
he also attacks the wife who cries not for the persecution of 
the arabs but for her husband and her marriage falling apart in 
front of her eyes 
rami he concludes did not recognize that point in space and 
time beyond which the killing starts

kass 
several people were trampled in the incident said district 
police spokesman sgt joe gentile they were treated at the scene 
for minor injuries 
the annual fireworks show had been in doubt for most of the day 
because of rain and only about 20000 people attended the 
traditional parade down constitution avenue on tuesday afternoon 
however the rain let up in time to permit the fireworks which 
were the finale to an outdoor concert by the national symphony 
orchestra on the capitol grounds at the other end of the mall 
altogether police reported about a dozen arrests tuesday mostly 
for disorderly conduct and vending violations 
the sparse parade crowd was cheerful about the weather donning 
plastic sheeting umbrellas and makeshift trashbag ponchos to watch 
the marching bands and floats go by 
everybody was smiling and being more congenial because we had 
the bad weather as a common denominator said john shaw who came 
from augusta maine with his wife sue 
street vendors were less pleased 
david gomez who came from atlanta to sell plastic american flags 
which he carted around on two wooden placards said its not as 
many people as id like to be out here it took him two hours to 
sell 10 flags

salary as a school secretary in crystal springs texas by working 
two to three weeks each summer in the minnesota sugar beet fields 
we have bills to pay like everybody else but its sad this 
year because weve had so much difficulty finding a home 
city officials acknowledge the housing market is tight but they 
say providing new housing is beyond the communitys means and will 
require state and federal assistance 
we have neither the resources nor the inclination to build 
housing for transients housing that would only be occupied for 
a few months each year said mike mcdonald city zoning 
administrator it would be unfair to local residents to pay for 
such housing 
in the meantime migrant workers overwhelm a homeless shelter 
operated by sister justina violette who believes the city is not 
doing enough to provide affordable housing for migrants and other 
lowincome people who stay in the area from may through july this 
year they began arriving in march 
as many as 70 migrants spend the night in the crowded shelter 
and another 20 sleep in a 16 by 32foot army tent on the lawn 
outside others sleep in their cars and pickups in the centers 
parking lot and some sleep under trees in an adjacent city park 
gallegos 40 and her family have been coming to the crookston 
area for 35 years and have never had difficulty finding a home to 
rent this year they were forced to seek shelter at sister justinas 
center 
migrant workers mostly hispanic texans have been making the 
1500mile trek to the red river valley and this northwestern 
minnesota town of about 8500 for decades they are paid to thin and 
weed sugar beets that are grown for local processing plants workers 
can earn as much as 90 a day 
but farmers use mechanical thinners now and chemicals are 
replacing labor for controlling weeds said armando cuellar migrant 
labor counselor for the minnesota department of jobs and training 
that means less demand for workers except in a drought year like 
last season when chemicals did not work as well last years high 
demand may have lured migrants to the valley this year with false 
hopes cuellar said 
as many as 5000 workers this year are in the valley in minnesota 
and north dakota said richard fitzsimons executive director of the 
red river valley sugarbeet growers association 
about 1900 people looking for work have registered with the 
department of jobs and training in crookston and east grand forks 
cuellar said last year at this time 600 to 800 workers had signed 
up cuellar was unable to estimate how many migrants would be able 
to find steady work 
ive been here 13 years and this is the most available labor 
ive had cuellar said this is an unusual year the 
chemicals have worked very well because the weather has been 
perfect thats meant less field work 
in the past growers provided housing for the workers on their 
farmsteads 
however strict new federal regulations have made that more 
difficult in recent years leaving migrants with nowhere else to go 
but into the communities 
sister justina accuses some crookston residents of being 
prejudiced in their treatment of the hispanic workers she notes 
some landlords require large damage deposits and longterm rental 
contracts for migrants 
people in small towns are used to seeing only one color she 
said i dont think they realize how beautiful a rainbow is the 
minute they see someone of a different color they look down on 
them 
mcdonald said he does not see the problem as being racial in 
nature 
this never was a racial issue he said i see it as a group 
issue weve got a large number of people coming into a system that 
is illequipped to deal with them

prime minister yitzhak shamir today 
turned back a challenge to his leadership by hardliners in the 
likud bloc who opposed his election plan for peace negotiations 
but in reaching a compromise shamir accepted the positions of 
his rivals and may have burdened his middle east peace initiative 
with conditions that make it unacceptable to palestinians 
in a rousing speech before the partys central committee shamir 
endorsed opponents demands that east jerusalem arabs be excluded 
from voting and that the violence of the palestinian uprising be 
ended as a precondition for peace negotiations he also pledged to 
continue jewish settlements and said israel would not accept a 
palestinian state or the participation of the plo 
moshe katzav a shamir backer said the compromise was to include 
the principles in the speech without voting on amendments to put the 
hardline stands into the peace initiative 
but trade minister ariel sharon who had led the opposition said 
on israel radio after the meeting this decision is binding on the 
representatives of the likud in the cabinet 
the plan was approved 206 on may 14 by the coalition cabinet 
which includes the leftofcenter labor party 
the compromise was a victory for shamir who had threatened to 
resign if the rebel faction voted against his plan 
but it may have limited his room for maneuver in future 
negotiations shamirs policy speech which included four points 
demanded by the rebels was adopted with an overwhelming show of 
hands in support 
officials have said the peace plans lack of specifics was 
designed to appeal to palestinians by leaving controversial points 
to later negotiations 
but the points raised in shamirs speech especially his pledge 
to continue jewish settlements and exclude east jerusalem arabs 
were certain to alienate palestinians 
the settlements will continue said shamir rebuffing us 
requests that jewish settlements are an obstacle to peace i want 
to send heartfelt warm blessings to settlers in judea samaria 
west bank and gaza and i tell you your suffering is not in vain 
be strong 
the election plan which has us support calls for choosing 
palestinians in the occupied lands to negotiate an autonomy plan 
with israel after three years separate talks would be held on the 
final status of the west bank and gaza strip palestinians and the 
plo have criticized the proposal saying it does not lead to their 
goal of an independent state 
demanding an end to the palestinian uprising shamir said 
there will be no negotiations as long as there is violence we 
shall wipe it out 
the nearly 19month uprising has led to the deaths of more than 
540 palestinians and 23 israelis 
bending to the demand of his rivals that arab east jerusalem not 
be allowed to vote in the elections shamir said jerusalem is not 
part of the initiative jerusalem is the eternal capital of our 
people and our state 
a key palestinian demand has been giving the vote to 140000 arab 
residents in the citys eastern sector which was captured from 
jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
shamir drew loud applause and chants when he called on the united 
states to end its dialogue with plo leaders who he said have not 
deviated one inch from their criminal ways 
chaim morad a sharon backer said the challenge was meant to 
ensure shamir will not be pushed by the united states into making 
too many compromises to achieve peace the prime minister is being 
pushed too far to the left he said we want him to be able to 
stand up to the americans and say i cant do any more my party 
wont let me 
shamirs media adviser yossi ahimeir said the prime ministers 
plan was intended to outmaneuver his rivals by making his speech the 
issue of the vote thus avoiding a direct challenge to the peace 
plan 
since introducing the elections proposal in april shamir has 
repeatedly said he would not give up land in the occupied west bank 
and gaza or agree to negotiate with the plo 
but he had also insisted on no changes in his election plan 
the united states has supported the plan as a way of getting the 
stalled middle east peace process moving and has tried to sell the 
plan to the plo and arab states 
but secretary of state james a baker iii has called on israel to 
accept the usbacked policy of trading land for peace as a way of 
persuading the palestinians to agree to the vote 
before todays committee vote avi pazner shamirs spokeman 
said that the challenge was serious it is a real political test 
for shamir and his peace plan one goes with the other pazner 
said in an interview 
aides said privately that a vote against shamir could have 
jeopardized the plan and forced shamir to resign

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and president 
francois mitterrand appealed today for an immediate ceasefire in 
lebanon and an end to arms deliveries to lebanese groups involved in 
the conflict 
in a statement after two days of talks the leaders said they 
supported attempts by the arab league to settle the lebanese civil 
war but also said their countries were available to help with other 
efforts to reach a peaceful settlement notably in the framework of 
the united nations security council 
france and the soviet union are among the five permanent members 
of the security council 
the statement said gorbachev and mitterrand are convinced that 
lebanon must remain sovereign independent united with its 
territorial integrity respected 
it said they called for an immediate ceasefire rigorously 
respected as an indispensable condition for the establishment of a 
constructive interlebanese dialogue aiming at national 
reconciliation and peaceful building of a country founded on a 
balance of the interests of all lebanese communities 
the 14yearold civil war in lebanon a former french possession 
has pitted christians against moslems and druse militias since the 
latest outbreak of fighting in march druse forces and syrian troops 
in lebanon have battled the christian army of gen michel aoun aoun 
has demanded the withdrawal of the syrians in lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate 
the soviet union is the main arms supplier for syria as well as 
iraq which has been arming the christian forces 
the statement followed gorbachevs meeting with french 
intellectuals and students at the sorbonne in which he challenged 
them to help create a new more peaceful world 
seated in a red velvet chair in the packed sorbonne amphitheatre 
gorbachev said the new soviet political and economic system he is 
fashioning would be a fusion of socialism and democracy 
its more difficult than we thought at the beginning but its 
working the country is changing rapidly and irriversibly he 
said speaking through a translator to an audience of 2000 that 
included philosopher bernardhenri levy and regis debray a former 
presidential adviser and author 
members of the soviet delegation earlier this week said the visit 
to the sorbonne the university of paris founded in the 12th 
century would underline a new understanding between france and the 
soviet union 
for the last decade french intellectuals many of them former 
leftists have condemned communist totalitarian regimes since the 
publication of alexander solzhenitsyn gulag archipelego 
gorbachev called for protecting the global environment halting 
moral decline and for cooperation between men of culture science 
and art in france and the soviet union to solve the political and 
social problems of the time 
gorbachev began the second day of his visit to france by laying a 
wreath on the tomb of frances unknown soldier beneath the arc de 
triomphe and paying a call on paris mayor jacques chirac 
at a state dinner tuesday the first day of his threeday visit 
the soviet president declared his readiness to defend human rights 
and called for a united europe for moving beyond the eastwest 
schism that grew from the cold war 
the postwar period is over gorbachev said at the gala 
dinner today a way toward a stable peace is opening before us 
based not on a balance of forces but on a balance of real and 
correctly understood interests 
on tuesday the soviet president met with mitterrand and then 
visited the place de la bastille where 200 years ago this month an 
angry mob stormed the prison and launched the french revolution 
which swept away the french monarchy 
in his dinner toast gorbachev said the soviets feel like 
participants in this months festivities celebrating the french 
revolutions bicentennial in part because perestroika also is a 
revolution 
perestroika or restructuring is the name given to gorbachevs 
4yearold drive to revamp soviet society and economy in his 
remarks the 58yearold leader noted that perestroika also includes 
a keener understanding of the importance of human rights long an 
irritant in eastwest relations 
since gorbachev became soviet leader in march 1985 he has 
repudiated the vast apparatus of state terror put in place by 
dictator josef stalin 
he has also allowed wider expression of dissenting views 
including public challenges to the monopoly on power held by the 
ruling communist party 
he told mitterrand that like france the soviet union is now 
ready to defend the rights of individuals and entire nations

a federal judge today fined the united mine 
workers and two union officers an additional 720000 for violating 
his ban on forming convoys to slow down trucks delivering coal 
also today an explosion damaged a mcclure warehouse owned by the 
strikebound pittston coal group state police said no injuries were 
reported 
it was not clear whether whether the 230 am blast was related 
to the fourmonth strike against the company by 1900 miners in 
virginia west virginia and kentucky police said the explosion was 
under investigation 
us district judge glen williams on june 26 fined the umw and 
two officers 240000 for organizing convoys of cars and trucks to 
block coal traffic and threatened fines of 120000 for each day 
the traffic jams continued 
williams said the union violated his order for six days with 
bumpertobumper traffic on roads used by coal haulers most of 
those in the convoys have been umw members from other states on 
sympathy wildcat strikes 
state police special agent larry waddell testified that troopers 
wrote nearly 200 tickets for impeding traffic last week 
despite all the massive ticketing its all just sort of 
whistling dixie the judge said he raised the daily fine to 
550000 for further violations 
umw attorney mike passino said the union will appeal the fines 
which now total 960000 jackie stump president of the unions 
virginia district said the fines are excessive 
on tuesday the union garnered support from united farm workers 
president cesar chavez 
your struggle is our struggle chavez told more than 5000 
striking miners and supporters at a rally and your victory is our 
victory and victory for every worker in this country 
chavez said the umws commitment to nonviolence during the 
strike and the use of civil disobedience has captured the attention 
of organized labor 
people know about it in the workplace even on the west 
coast he said of the labor dispute that began april 5 the public 
and all organized labor will be on the umws side as long as 
nonviolent tactics persist chavez said 
pittston miners had been working without a contract for 14 months 
when they went on strike over wages benefits and working 
conditions the walkout has spawned sympathy strikes by 37000 
miners in the midwest and appalachia 
pittston president michael odom said the company is feeling no 
pressure to return to the bargaining table the sympathy strikes in 
have zero effect on us odom said he added that pittston 
continues to operate with replacements

oliver l north today drew a threeyear 
suspended prison term and a 150000 fine for his role in the 
irancontra affair youre not the fall guy the judge said in 
sentencing the former white house aide 
us district judge gerhard a gesell placed the former national 
security council assistant on two years probation and ordered him 
to perform 1200 hours of community service administering a new 
program to help innercity youth avoid involvement in drugs 
gesell cited norths distinguished career as a marine officer 
before he became a staff member at the white house during the reagan 
administration 
he told north that during the irancontra affair i dont think 
you were a leader at all he said north was really a lowranking 
subordinate who was carrying out the instructions of a few cynical 
superiors 
north who has said he will appeal his conviction on three 
counts had faced a maximum of 10 years imprisonment and fines 
totaling 750000 
in presentencing remarks north denied the prosecutions 
contention that he lacked remorse saying i grieve for what has 
happened and i truly regret it every day 
speaking in a soft voice north said he had served his country 
for 20 years i would never knowingly do anything to hurt it or 
its institutions i have made many mistakes i have been convicted 
of serious crimes he said 
pronouncing sentence gesell told north 
along the way you came to accept the mistaken view that 
congress couldnt be trusted that the fate of the country could 
be left to a small inside group not elected that was free to act as 
they chose while publicly professing to act differently 
but gesell said that even though north was following orders 
youre not the fall guy for this tragic breach of the public 
trust 
the judge told north that i believe you still lack a full 
understanding of how the public service has been tarnished by his 
activities but gesell added jail would only harden your 
misconceptions 
gesell also barred north from holding federal office 
the navy said it was suspending payment of norths 23000 marine 
corps pension immediately but was asking the congressional general 
accounting office for legal authority to restore it 
north his lawyers his minister and other members of his 
entourage left the courthouse through a side door he made no 
comment to the crowd waiting outside 
a group of supporters yelled pardon north now as north was 
droven off in a van 
john keker norths chief prosecutor refused to speak with 
reporters after the sentencing driving away immediately 
kekers boss independent counsel lawrence e walsh who had 
sought a prison term for north issued a terse statement saying 
sentencing is uniquely a matter for the judgment of the trial 
judge we had a full opportunity to present our views we have no 
further comment 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president 
bush had no comment on the sentencing noting the case was headed 
for an appeal as for a presidential pardon for north fitzwater 
said we havent discussed a pardon theres been no discussion 
it hasnt ever been discussed 
mark weinberg spokesman for former president reagan declined 
comment on the sentence 
denise anderson forewoman of the jury that convicted north in 
may told cbs news yes i think it was a fair sentence as a 
matter of fact im so happy i can hardly talk ive been praying 
for this 
north and his attorney urged the judge to consider the suffering 
the former presidential aide has already endured because of 
extensive publicity surrounding the case and the continued threat of 
assassination by a terrorist group led by abu nidal 
i ask only that you consider these things when you weigh the 
sentence north said noting the disruption of his familys life 
north asked that you be lenient so that they may have a chance to 
rebuild their lives 
north remained at the defense table for a few minutes after 
gesell concluded the sentencing he then walked over to his wife 
betsy who was sitting in the front row kissed her on the cheek and 
whispered in her ear the two then smiled broadly 
the 45yearold retired marine lieutenant colonel was found 
guilty may 4 of aiding and abetting the obstruction of congress by 
helping write a false chronology of a 1985 arms shipment to iran he 
also was convicted of destroying sensitive government documents and 
accepting a 13800 home security system from arms dealer richard v 
secord 
gesell imposed a threeyear suspended sentence on north for 
aiding and abetting the obstruction of congress placed him on two 
years probation and fined him 100000 
the judge gave north a twoyear suspended sentence and a 35000 
fine for destroying or altering government documents he also 
imposed a oneyear suspended sentence and a 15000 fine for 
accepting an illegal gratuity from secord whose irancontra trial 
is pending 
in describing the community service he ordered gesell said he 
hoped north would become conscious of certain values you and your 
associates appear to have overlooked in the elite isolation of the 
white house 
gesell said the community service would take advantage of norths 
considerable administrative and organizational skills he directed 
that north perform 800 hours on the project the first year and 400 
during the second year of the probationary period 
north testified at his trial that he had acted at the direction 
of his superiors including thenpresident reagan defense attorney 
brendan v sullivan jr argued against imprisoning his client 
but independent counsel walsh recommended a prison term for 
north arguing in court pleadings that the former national security 
council aide lied at his trial and has shown no remorse for his 
crimes 
the defense team led by sullivan said in court papers that the 
prosecutions request for imprisonment demonstrates that it will 
stop at nothing in its effort to crush oliver north 
the defense said walsh had not presented a shred of support 
to the accusation that north lied to win acquittal of a charge he 
pocketed 4300 in travelers checks entrusted to him by contra 
leader adolfo calero 
we urge the court to reject the prosecutors efforts to 
obtain a prison sentence by smearing oliver north the defense 
said in a brief filed monday 
in its sentencing memo the defense said that sending north to 
prison would only encourage high government officials to let 
subordinates take the blame for legally or politically risky 
ventures 
the defense cited norths heroism as a platoon leader during the 
vietnam war and his efforts to free us hostages when he worked at 
the national security council it urged gesell to give this record 
of service great weight in choosing the appropriate sentence for 
oliver north 
a sentence of imprisonment would be cruel and unjust the 
defense said such a sentence would be deeply and fundamentally 
unfair 
north during six days of testimony at his trial said his 
efforts secretly replaced those of the cia when congress barred the 
agency from helping the nicaraguan rebels 
i was not stepping in i was brought in basically it 
was a handoff youve got the ball now run with it he testified 
north admitted to jurors that he lied to congress by denying he 
was helping the contras 
i was raised to know the difference between right and wrong 
north told the jury i knew it wasnt right not to tell the truth 
on those things but i didnt think it was unlawful 
north was acquitted of nine other charges including allegations 
he lied to congress by denying he was covertly helping the rebels 
following the verdict north said he would fight and fight 
hard for as long as it takes to prevail in the courts on appeal 
since his conviction north has continued to appear on the 
lecture circuit reportedly being paid 25000 an appearance

the louisiana legislature where 
antiabortion sentiment is overwhelming went into special session 
wednesday but abortion failed to make the agenda because of the 
states financial problems 
gov buddy roemer refused to amend his instructions for the 
sixday tax session to include abortion in light of mondays us 
supreme court decision that allows states to place more restrictions 
on abortions 
he said there was too little time to deal with the subject but 
said he wants legislative committees to look at possible revision of 
the states laws 
in florida gov bob martinez said wednesday he will call a 
special legislative session to consider legislation further 
restricting abortions 
louisianas antiabortion forces are so strong that the state is 
expected to be among the first to tackle new abortion legislation 
rep alphonse jackson a democrat and a prochoice leader 
predicted that antiabortion forces will be able to pass anything 
they want 
there is no question that the prolife forces are in charge of 
this legislature jackson said they will prevail 
louisiana has laws similar to the ones in missouri that the 
supreme court upheld on monday blocking the use of state money or 
faciliites for abortions 
unlike missouris laws however the ones in louisiana remained 
in effect during the challenge in washington so no abortions were 
performed at the states charity hospitals or by state employees 
since the supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade ruling legalizing 
abortions louisiana has passed stacks of restrictive legislation 
but only one other law has stood the constitutional test it 
requires that parents be notified if their children try to obtain 
abortions 
louisiana also passed a provision that all pre1973 laws making 
abortions criminal go back on the books if the supreme court ever 
reverses roe v wade 
jackson chairman of the house committee that would hear abortion 
bills said the abortion issue cannot come up until the 1990 regular 
session unless the governor calls another special session 
there are no plans for that said pj mills the governors 
chief of staff he would do so if there was a public necessity

a bomb exploded today under a tour bus carrying 
sailors of the soviet fishing fleet injuring 20 of the fishermen 
and damaging two other buses with soviet visitors police said 
the explosion occurred when the fishermen were boarding the bus 
after shopping in a lima suburb police and witnesses told radio 
stations 
no group claimed responsibility for the bombing but police 
blamed the maoist shining path guerrillas group which has targeted 
soviet citizens and diplomats in the past 
gen oswaldo diaz salvador lima police chief said two young men 
carefully placed a package under the bus and then raced off as the 
bomb exploded 
bomb experts said the explosion was caused by about 12 pounds of 
dynamite two other buses with soviet fishermen aboard were damaged 
by the explosion which occurred at 10 am police said 
eight of the 20 sailors were seriously injured police said 
witnesses said the explosion maimed the sailors legs and lower 
bodies 
diaz salvador said the bombed bus was carrying 49 people when the 
attack occurred and 35 sailors were on two smaller buses the buses 
were owned by a tourism service 
in 1986 a guerrilla was killed after breaking into the grounds 
of the soviet embassy when the bomb he was carrying exploded 
also in 1986 several soviet fishermen were injured when a bomb 
went off in a store frequented by the sailors in the port city of 
callao 
lima is a resupply point for the soviet fishing fleet operating 
off the west coast of south america 
the shining path views the soviet government as traitors to true 
marxism and regards the soviets as enemies because they have been a 
major supplier of arms to peru for the two decades more than 15000 
people have been killed in perus nineyear guerrilla insurgency

the state department said wednesday it was 
deeply concerned about allegations that namibias guerrilla movement 
tortured prisoners and said it had asked for an accounting from 
neighboring african governments 
some of the 150 people freed after years of imprisonment said 
many others were tortured and beaten to death while held in 
underground pits in neighboring angola they said they were among 
thousands of dissidents imprisoned by the southwest africa peoples 
organization swapo during its guerrilla war for independence from 
south africa 
the state department has been in the forefront of pushing for 
independence for the territory elections are scheduled in november 
several freed prisoners estimated swapo still holds more than 
2000 detainees 
guerrilla leaders say they held just 201 dissidents and have 
released them all the un high commissioner for refugeees says it 
accepts the swapo figures although a relatives committee in 
namibia has given un officers the names of more than 300 missing 
swapo members 
asked about the situation richard boucher a state department 
spokesman said we are deeply concerned about the allegations of 
mistreatment of namibians by swapo weve asked for a full 
accounting of the status of all detainees 
boucher said two un groups were investigating 
we have raised the question of accounting for all swapo 
detainees with several countries in the region and have asked them 
to use their influence with swapo to ensure the safe repatriation of 
all swapo detainees to namibia the us official said 
we again call upon the concerned parties and governments to 
encourage swapo to make a full accounting of the detainees 
boucher said the state department was not dealing directly with 
swapo the major black nationalist group in namibia and likely to 
take control of the emerging nation

christian army commander gen michel aoun to remove sovietmade 
mediumrange missiles he reportedly obtained from iraq that could 
hit the syrian capital damascus

wednesday on tuesday syrianallied moslem forces reopened gateways 
linking the enclave in east beirut and north of the capital with the 
rest of lebanon relaxing the fourmonth siege of 1 million 
christians 
the police spokesman said only a few bursts of machinegun 
fire were reported along beiruts dividing green line and the 
mountain range southeast of the capital 
syrian artillery in moslem west beirut intermittently shelled the 
christian ports of jounieh amsheet and byblos to prevent aoun from 
receiving iraqisupplied war materiel no casualties were reported

about 12 million has been paid out to vietnam 
veterans poisoned by agent orange since the us supreme court 
cleared the way for the program last year according to a report 
issued wednesday 
during the next year an additional 50 million to 60 million 
will likely be handed out said the report 
as of june 30 more than 6000 vietnam veterans or their 
survivors in every state had received a cash payment from the agent 
orange veteran payment program established to distribute funds to 
disabled veterans and their survivors the program is required to 
prepare an annual report on the distribution of funds and the 
report released wednesday was the first 
disabled veterans received their first installments with 
payments ranging from 250 to 2000 said deborah greenspan an 
attorney for the overseer of the fund she said the veterans would 
receive the payments annually for several years but couldnt be 
more specific she said families of deceased veterans received a 
single payment generally about 3400 
another 8000 individuals including 4000 children will

a tanker spilled tons of thick crude oil 
into the ocean off norway and environmental experts liked what they 
saw 
us and norwegian scientists dumped 9200 gallons of oil into the 
north sea from the tanker esso bergen over the weekend the object 
was to study the slick so that cleanup techniques could be improved 
researchers who tracked the oil as it spread over six miles 
judged the experiment a great success 
the us department of interior paid much of the projects 
600000 pricetag private companies and the norwegian government 
also backed the experiment 
it was conducted off western norway because the united states 
virtually never allows such experiments to take place said ocean 
engineer mark reed 
norway permitted the oil to befoul its waters so scientists could 
study special buoys for tracking spills and ways to combat oil 
pollution it has permitted smaller spills in the past for cleanup 
training 
researchers collected 500 samples of the slick tried chemicals 
for breaking down crude oil trailed the floating oil from aircraft 
and studied its effect on fish and birds reed said by radio from 
norwegian research ship endre dyroey 
in norway we realize that the only way to learn how to prevent 
damage from an oil spill is to conduct experiments on a real one 
said roar bjerknes of the trondheim marine technology company 
oceannor 
one american scientist told me it was great to be able to come 
to norway and be allowed to create an oil slick said bjerknes 
whose company led the test 
the americans took a keen interest due to a series of spills of 
the us coast including this springs valdez alaska accident 
permission to dump oil of norways coast was not granted lightly 
by this nation noted for strict environmental rules 
morten hauge of norways pollution control board said this 
record research spill was allowed only after public hearings and 
risk analyses he said cleanup equipment stood by in case the slick 
got out of hand 
the oil was spilled 70 miles from land and was too far out to 
sea for there to be any risk of it reaching the coast he said 
the fourday experiment tested about 40 us and norwegian 
electronic buoys designed to track slicks and beam information to a 
computer via satellite said reed an engineer with the applied 
sciences associates based in rhode island 
the main contract was from the interior department to test 
three types of surface drifting buoy that send signals via the argos 
satellite system said reed who helped develop the system 
the test was a day shorter than planned because natural forces of 
the ocean broke down the slick faster than expected said reed 
it seems to have been a great success we will look at the 
data and relate it to the way the slick drifted so we can tell where 
an oil slick is headed during a real accident he said 
bjerknes said chemists from the norwegian continental shelf 
institute and biolgists form the directorate for natural resource 
management checked the effect of the slick on sea water and life as 
it drifted for 40 miles before breaking up 
norways pollution board tested its new pollution spotting 
airplane and calibrated its data against that gathered by a similar 
aircraft from the dutch ministry of transport and public works 
norwegian environmental experts sent to alaska after the recent 
catastrophic oil spill in which officials were critical of delays in 
the cleanup effort 
i think the us has realized that they made a lot of 
mistakes bjerknes said the americans are making a real effort 
to no longer be the third world country of oil spill cleanups he 
said

chinese legislators on wednesday said that ousted 
communist party chief zhao ziyang tried to enlist the congress in 
his fight against hardline leaders who crushed student 
prodemocracy protests 
delegates to the standing committee of the national peoples 
congress also condemned one of their number for supporting zhaos 
effort 
the legislators speeches made in a closed meeting but carried 
by the official xinhua news agency gave the first details of zhaos 
failed power struggle against hardliners led by senior leader deng 
xiaoping party officials who ousted zhao on june 24 said only that 
he made the mistake of supporting the turmoil and splitting the 
party 
one congress delegate also lashed out at the us congress for 
voting for trade and aid sanctions against china following the 
armys june 34 attack on the protesters in which hundreds and 
possibly thousands of people died 
it is a violation of the international law as well as a slander 
and attack on the chinese people and chinese government xinhua 
quoted fu hao a delegate from northwestern chinas shaanxi 
province as saying 
it quoted another delegate song rufen of sichuan province as 
saying that after premier li peng declared martial law may 20 to end 
the student protests people from zhaos think tank came out from 
behind the scenes and advocated opposing martial law and down 
with the puppet government 
they also demanded a special session of the national 
peoples congress song said the very next day zhao ziyang 
also suggested that an emergency meeting of the congress standing 
committee be held 
song and several other delegates accused fellow legislator hu 
jiwei of supporting zhao hu enlisted the help of a research 
institute run by chinas first private hightechnology company the 
stone corp in collecting legislators signatures on a petition for 
an emergency congress session 
hu said he collected 38 signatures but fellow legislators 
accused stone of signing some names of people who did not support 
the petition 
some people with ulterior motive manipulated behind the scenes 
to achieve their own secret political goals beijing radio quoted 
legislator zhang chengxian as saying at wednesdays session 
comrade hu must bear responsibility for this 
a warrant reportedly has been issued for the head of stone wan 
runnan but sources in hong kong say he has fled china 
the congress standing committee a smaller body that acts for the 
nearly 2000member congress between its annual sessions began a 
special session last week but has expressed support for the 
crackdown on the protesters like zhao many students had hoped the 
congress would meet before the hardliners consolidated their 
position and would challenge martial law 
several legislators did call for some of the political reforms 
demanded by the students including strengthening of chinas new and 
incomplete legal system 
xinhua quoted tibetan delegate ngapoi ngawang jigme a longtime 
supporter of the communist government as saying that china had a 
good constitution and laws but did not implement them well 
resulting in corruption 
other delegates called for quicker action in drafting laws china 
began establishing a body of civil law only in the late 1970s and 
many areas remain uncovered 
local and provincial governments announced new efforts to combat 
official corruption another demand of the students it remained to 
be seen how thoroughly the reform moves would be carried out or 
whether they were efforts to placate an increasingly dissatisfied 
public 
the peoples daily newspaper said officials had cracked the 
biggest corruption case in beijing during 40 years of communist 
rule arresting six people for allegedly defrauding a government 
research institute of 105000 
also on wednesday hotel officials said the government has 
ordered major jointventure hotels in the capital to unhook their 
satellite dishes which receive foreign news broadcasts including 
cable news network china is engaged in an intensive propaganda 
campaign to discredit western news accounts of the crackdown on the 
sevenweek prodemocracy movement 
the japanese embassy said that soldiers stopped and boarded three 
buses carrying a japanese youth delegation and confiscated film they 
shot of soldiers guarding central beijings tiananmen square 
tiananmen was the center of the student protest movement 
it was not a big deal said embassy official hideo tarumi

in his first public show of remorse a 
convicted killer told a judge wednesday he was sorry for the 1987 
shooting rampage that killed six people and wounded 10 at two palm 
bay shopping plazas 
im sorry that all this happened william bryan cruse sobbed 
anything else prompted circuit judge john antoon who had 
said he wanted to hear from cruse before drafting a sentencing order 
thats all that i can say cruse added as he choked back 
tears 
the brief exchange came at the end of a 3hour hearing at which 
lawyers for both sides argued for and against imposition of the 
death penalty which was recommended by the jury that convicted 
cruse 
the alternative is a sentence of life in prison without parole 
for at least 25 years formal sentencing for the 61yearold former 
librarian is july 28 
the judge is being supercautious in this case of mass murder 
said state attorney norm wolfinger he is protecting the record 
getting everything down and frankly asking for assistance in 
writing his order 
cruse was convicted april 5 of 32 counts of murder attempted 
murder and kidnapping 
cruse sat quietly at the defense table he has been held in the 
brevard county jail since the morning after the rampage on april 23 
1987 
his temporary insanity defense was rejected by the jury but he 
has been diagnosed as mentally ill while this in itself is not a 
trial defense under florida law cruse lawyers argue it should be a 
major factor in deciding whether he should be executed or imprisoned 
but chief trial prosecutor chris white argued the net result of 
his mental illness was limited to his belief that other people 
considered him a homosexual 
he appreciated what he was doing the consequences of what he 
was doing and that it was wrong white said in summing up the 
states arguments that cruse should be electrocuted 
the shootings were part of a cold calculating premeditated 
plan and were carried out in heinous atrocious and cruel fashion 
white said 
assistant public defender marlene alva said there was evidence 
that he suffered from a mental illness and part of that was the 
belief that people were out to malign him that he felt morally 
justified because of his twisted and psychotic mind 
she argued that cruses actions were the result of a boilingover 
of pentup resentments and emotions rather than a master plan 
against palm bay 
cruse bought guns and ammunition but did not know his victims 
ms alva noted 
and she added shooting people is not heinous atrocious and 
cruel under the law 
the state is asking the court to find that these victims 
suffered great pain there is no evidence of that she said

hundreds of soviets lined up wednesday under gray 
skies to pay their last respects to andrei a gromyko the voice of 
soviet foreign policy from stalin to gorbachev 
the line to view gromykos floweradorned open casket stretched 
several blocks from the turquoisecolored central soviet army house 
in north moscow a blackandwhite portrait of gromyko featuring 
the dour face that earned him the nickname grim grom hung at 
the entrance 
he represented old times said navy officer andrei n 
pochtarev as he waited on a sidewalk now we must have a new 
approach times have changed 
because gromyko was retired there was no ceremony in red square 
and his funeral was low key president mikhail s gorbachev was in 
paris on a state visit as was gromykos successor eduard a 
shevardnadze 
only six of the 12 full members of the ruling politburo went to 
the viewing and one attended the burial service later at moscows 
prestigious novodevichy cemetery 
gromyko lay in coffin on a bier at the center of the army 
buildings red banner hall twentynine medals he received during 
his long career were displayed on red cushions sloping to the floor 
from the casket among the awards were hero of socialist labor and 
the countrys highest civilian honor the order of lenin which he 
received six times 
red carnations lay on the coffin and a mountain of flowers and 
wreaths swelled up from the floor a dozen soldiers stood guard and 
a band played somber music 
senior diplomats from embassies in moscow traveled to the army 
building to join soviets in bidding farewell us ambassador jack 
matlock stood for a minute in front of the coffin before moving on 
to express his sympathies to gromykos widow lydia son anatoly 
and daughter emilia 
at novodevichy there were only brief remarks by a moscow city 
official a farm machinery builder first deputy foreign minister 
alexander a bessmertnykh and vitaly i vorotnikov a politburo 
member and premier of the russian federation also present was 
alexandra p biryukova a candidate politburo member 
his name is connected with the huge successes of soviet foreign 
policy directed at the relaxation of international tension and 
consolidation of world peace vorotnikov told about 300 mourners 
at the cemetery the second most prestigious burial ground after red 
square many of the soviet elite are buried at novodevichy 
including nikita s khrushchev nikolai a bulganin vyacheslav m 
molotov and anastas i mikoyan 
bessmertnykh a gromyko protege and specialist on ussoviet 
relations credited gromyko with helping conclude important arms 
control agreements with the west 
they were achieved thanks in large measure to the deep 
political shrewdness creative approach and persistence of the 
soviet foreign minister bessmertnykh told the mourners 
as a light rain fell a military honor guard fired a salute to 
gromyko workers shoveled soil onto his red and black coffin 
anatoly gromyko who heads a kremlin think tank on african 
affairs shook his head solemnly as he held the hand of his weeping 
mother 
gromyko who died sunday at the age of 79 was a fixture in world 
diplomacy since the time of josef stalin he helped forge the 
alliance that defeated nazi germany and the axis in world war ii 
joined in founding the united nations and participated in superpower 
talks some soviets have said gromyko shared the blame for foreign 
policy mistakes such as the 1979 soviet intervention in afghanistan 
he was foreign minister for 28 years was a member of the 
politburo and served as president a ceremonial post until 
gorbachev gave it new significance and took it for himself in 
october 
gorbachev gradually eased gromyko out of power as soviet foreign 
policy took a less confrontational approach in april gromyko lost 
his last post membership on the communist party central committee 
gorbachev gave a sober assessment of gromykos career monday

while her husband took care of official business 
wednesday raisa gorbachev visited the newly renovated louvre and 
admired the striking bronze and marble sculptures at the rodin 
museum 
applauding tourists welcomed the soviet first lady at both spots 
and she stopped several times to shake hands with with admirers 
the museum visits were mrs gorbachevs only public appearances 
wednesday apart from her husband of 36 years president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
they are staying in a palace for foreign heads of state near the 
expensive stores of the rue du faubourg st honore but mrs 
gorbachev has made no shopping forays perhaps to avoid criticism at 
home for extravagance 
her lifestyle is resented by many soviet citizens who must cope 
with shortages that make basic goods like soap and matches difficult 
to find a member of the new soviet legislature even likened mrs 
gorbachev to napoleons wife and claimed her influence would doom 
her husband 
during their last visit to paris soon after her husband became 
kremlin leader in 1985 mrs gorbachev enjoyed a parade of minks 
satins and other luxury clothes at the fashion house of pierre 
cardin and sipped champagne at the closerie des lilas a writers 
haunt on the left bank 
on her tour wednesday she was accompanied by danielle 
mitterrand wife of president francois mitterrand 
mrs gorbachev entered the louvre under the 70foothigh glass 
pyramid passing hundreds of waiting visitors lined up in the 
napoleon courtyard 
the pyramid centerpiece of the 850 million renovation tops 
three underground levels containing a vast main hall library 
information desks galleries and storage space 
with culture minister jack lang as her guide she toured the 
vestiges of the first louvre castle built by king philippe auguste 
in 1200 as a military stronghold to protect paris from english 
invaders 
on the specially built wooden walkways in soft yellow light she 
looked at the restored ruins including the base of the castle keep 
and turrets of the thick stone wall that once surrounded it 
it is fascinating to find oneself all of a sudden in the center 
of paris transported back to the 12th century mrs gorbachev 
said i am happy to have the chance to see all these beautiful 
things and get to know more about french culture 
she did not get to see the museums three main attractions the 
mona lisa venus de milo and winged victory of samothrace but did 
receive a silk scarf as a gift from the museum staff and presented 
two soviet art books to curator michel laclotte 
then her motorcade was off to the left bank and the works of 
auguste rodin and a disappointment the sculpture she most wanted 
to see sleep is on exhibit in new york 
too bad mrs gorbachev said i guess ill have to come 
back 
she told curator jacques vilain she had visited the museum once 
before but did not say when and soviet officials did not know 
after looking at the hand of god the cathedral the 
kiss and several other works she ended her tour in the garden 
before the sculpture of the thinker 
mrs gorbachev called her visit to the museum an unforgettable 
souvenir of paris

the youth department of a predominantly black 
pentecostal group said wednesday its primary effort into the next 
century is to fight drugs and it urged other churches to help 
the church must speak out loud and clear and more 
effectively bishop charles brewer told members of the church of 
god in christ which claims 3 million members in the united states 
and 15 million in 44 other countries 
the drug program was disclosed at the 14th annual convention of 
the churchs united national auxiliaries more than 12000 people 
are participating in various meetings and activities through 
saturday 
we hope to make an impact across the country with drug 
programs said brewer of new haven conn chairman of the youth 
department 
bishop floyd perry of cleveland chairman of the convention said 
the church is the answer in the battle against drugs and crime 
and it all starts in the schools 
when those who are addicted leave treatment centers they often 
go back to drugs and we have to change that we have to stop 
that perry said treatment is the bandaid it only patches up 
the problem but the churches must do the healing we have to reach

church has to change the content of the heart

the church has to open its doors to work with the addicted and the 
afflicted

the supreme court will use the case of a 
convicted arkansas mass murderer who says he is ready to die to 
decide whether state appeals courts must review all death sentences 
the court has agreed to review an appeal in behalf of r gene 
simmons sentenced to die for killing 16 relatives and acquaintances 
in 1987 
the justices took the action monday in the windup to their 
current term but the announcement went largely unnoticed as the 
court ruled in a key abortion dispute and also decided an important 
churchstate controversy 
the court will hear arguments in the simmons case in its next 
term which begins in october a ruling is likely in 1990 
simmons has said he wants his death sentence carried out 
i only ask for what i deserve let the torture and suffering 
end please allow me the right to be at peace he said 
after a judge determined simmons was mentally competent to waive 
his right to appeal the rev louis franz asked the arkansas supreme 
court to block the execution 
the state supreme court said franz who ministers to arkansas 
death row inmates lacked legal standing to make the appeal in 
simmons behalf 
the state court also said simmons understands the choice of 
life and death and has made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his 
right to appeal 
three days before simmons was to be executed last march 16 
another arkansas death row inmate jonas h whitmore asked the 
state court to spare simmons the request was denied 
on the eve of simmons scheduled execution the us supreme 
court granted whitmores emergency request to spare simmons in order 
to give the high court time to decide whether it would review the 
case 
in his appeal to the high court acted on monday whitmore said 
the constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment requires a 
state appellate court to review all capital cases even when the 
defendant has asked to die 
lawyers for whitmore said arkansas is alone among the 37 states 
with the death penalty in not requiring mandatory appellate review 
if the justices rule for whitmore arkansas will have to join the 
other states if he loses other states would be free to abandon 
mandatory appellate review 
whitmores lawyers noted that utah added a requirement for such 
review after gary gilmore was executed in 1977 gilmore who did not 
challenge his death sentence was the first person executed in the 
united states since the supreme court reinstated capital punishment 
in 1976 
lawyers representing simmons asked the high court to reject 
whitmores appeal 
with all due respect society demands that capital 
punishment be enforced fairly and expeditiously or be abolished 
in its entirety they said 
among simmons victims were kathy kendrick 24 who was shot to 
death at a russellville ark law office on dec 28 1987 
police said she had spurned simmons advances more than a year 
earlier when both worked at a motor freight office 
in what prosecutors called a murderous rampage through the 
college town of russellville simmons shot four others on dec 28 
one fatally 
after arresting simmons police went to his home in nearby dover 
and found the bodies of simmons wife their three sons four 
daughters a soninlaw a daughterinlaw and four grandchildren 
seven of the bodies were found in a shallow grave near the house 
two in plastic bags in the trunks of abandoned cars and five in the 
house 
the case is whitmore vs arkansas 887146

sri lanka on wednesday banned local 
journalists from writing antigovernment articles and an official 
linked the order to newspaper reports predicting a military takeover 
the censorship rules will not apply to foreign correspondents 
according to a department of information statement that gave few 
details other than to say president ranasinghe premadasa has 
appointed four government officials as censors 
a senior government official linked the censorship to reports on 
an ongoing transport workers strike believed instigated by 
sinhalese extremists 
the decision was taken he said after several antigovernment 
reports appeared in newspapers saying the transport strike had 
crippled the government and that a military takeover was on the 
cards 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
censors will stop publication mainly of articles about the strike 
about violence by sinhalese extremists and current peace 
negotiations between the government and separatist tamil rebels 
he did not name offending newspapers but at least one sinhala 
language daily the dinerasea has severely criticized the 
governments handling of the strike and peace negotiations it is 
published by the opposition sri lanka freedom party 
journalists last were censored in july 1983 when ethnic violence 
between the buddhist sinhalese and mostly hindu tamils claimed 
hundreds of lives 
the strike for higher wages by about 50000 workers of 
stateowned transport services has spread among other workers and is 
paralyzing the island nation 
two weeks ago premadasa imposed a nationwide state of emergency 
to crush the strike which his government blames on ultranationalist 
sinhalese 
the government also blames the extremists from the leftwing 
peoples liberation front for assassinations of 3500 government 
workers and ruling party officials and supporters in a twoyear 
campaign to protest peace overtures to the minority tamils who 
dominate the northeast 
the biggest tamil rebel group the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam last week agreed to a ceasefire and peace talks 
this week the government postponed until jan 29 a referendum on 
whether the northern and eastern provinces should merge 
it was scheduled for wednesday in eastern province which has 
many ethnic groups tamils say both provinces form the traditional 
tamil homeland 
the postponement was requested by the tamil tigers and the tamil 
group that has run the provincial government since it accepted 
limited autonomy in exchange for ending the rebellion the tamil 
tigers still want an independent homeland 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
accuse the majority sinhalese of discriminating against them 
at least 9000 people have been killed in the sixyear war

south africas territorial administrator 
said wednesday he wont free about 30 political prisoners until he 
is sure namibias guerrilla movement has released all its detainees 
more than 150 people detained by the southwest africa peoples 
organization returned home from angola on tuesday and said more than 
2000 others still are held under harsh conditions in guerrilla 
camps in angola tanzania and zambia 
administratorgeneral louis pienaar is determined to ascertain 
if all swapo dissidents will be released before he will release 
political detainees here said pienaars spokesman eberhard 
hofmann 
swapo says it has released all 201 of its prisoners whom it 
accused of spying for pretoria during its 23year bush war to end 
south african administration 
the state department said wednesday it is asking concerned 
countries to help account for swapo detainees 
spokesman richard boucher said we are deeply concerned about 
the allegations of mistreatment of namibians by swapo 
we have raised the question of accounting for all swapo 
detainees with several countries in the region and have asked them 
to use their influence with swapo to ensure the safe repatriation of 
all swapo detainees 
boucher said two un groups are investigating the claims some 
namibians say un officials are reluctant to follow up allegations 
against swapo 
andreas shipanga a politician and former swapo member imprisoned 
in the 1970s said tuesday the head of the un refugee operation in 
namibia nicholas bwakira of nigeria refuses to be helpful even 
though we want to give him the names of people believed held by 
swapo 
un spokesman fred eckhard said wednesday his organization has 
been investigating claims for weeks its a matter of ongoing 
review he said without elaborating 
swapo spokesman theo bengurirab said the party urges the un 
special representative martti ahtisaari to prevail on the 
administratorgeneral and the south african government to fulfill 
their obligations 
we have released all our detainees and we find the 
administratorgenerals conditions totally unacceptable he said 
freed detainees join thousands of swaposupporting refugees and 
other namibians returning to vote in unsupervised independence 
elections in november swapo is expected to win 
the territorial authorities hold 28 or 31 political prisoners who 
support swapo the different figures involve a dispute over 
political versus criminal violation of the law pienaar has charge 
of the territory until a new government is installed but un 
monitors can veto decisions that would interfere with free and fair 
elections 
also wednesday pienaar sought a court interdict to stop a strike 
by regional government employees in northern ovamboland they 
stopped work tuesday to protest the presence in the southwest 
african police force of former paramilitary police known as koevoet 
koevoet was disbanded in january but most members transferred to 
the regular police swapo supporters in ovamboland namibias most 
populous region and where swapo garners most of its support say 
they continue to harass residents ahtisaari has said their presence 
could interfere with elections 
pienaar refuses to dismiss them he says hell discuss the matter 
with un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar when he visits 
namibia on july 19

a federal judge today delayed a decison on 
a request by pete roses lawyers to keep his lawsuit in a state 
court where he has won an order protecting him from suspension or 
firing for alleged gambling 
us district judge john d holschuh said he would not make a 
decision on moving the case to federal court until at least july 17 
holschuh gave baseballs lawyers until july 12 to file papers and 
roses lawyers until july 17 to file their response 
the ruling indefinitely postpones a hearing scheduled for 
thursday by common pleas judge norbert a nadel in cincinnati for a 
preliminary injunction 
baseballs lawyers asked the federal courts on monday to take the 
case from nadel who has given rose a temporary restraining order 
that prevents giamatti from deciding the managers fate 
roses lawyers filed papers in federal court here earlier today 
to block baseball commissioner a bartlett giamatti from moving the 
case to federal court 
giamatti is fighting for the right to hold a disciplinary hearing 
on charges rose bet on his own team an offense that could get the 
cincinnati reds manager banned from the game for life 
roses lawyers told holschuh there were no legal grounds to move 
the case of the state court system they accused baseball of seeking 
a third courtroom in which to vindicate themselves or at least 
free the way to boot pete rose out of baseball without a fair 
hearing before an impartial decisionmaker 
baseballs request was filed in federal court in cincinnati 
which transferred it to columbus to avoid any appearance of 
impropriety in the reds hometown where rose is a hero 
the question of which court gets to handle roses lawsuit could 
be pivotal federal courts repeatedly have upheld the sweeping 
powers of the baseball commissioner while nadel has shown a 
willingness to go into what he described as uncharted waters 
federal courts are much more aware of the needs of baseball and 
much more willing to accept the authority of baseball and the 
commissioner baseball lawyer louis hoynes jr said 
nadels order blocks giamatti from holding a disciplinary 
hearing nadel said there was evidence giamatti had already made up 
his mind that rose is guilty giamatti denies that 
baseballs lawyers then turned to a state appeals court in 
cincinnati which concluded it had no right to intervene 
the next step was federal court although two federal judges in 
cincinnati said they had substantial doubt whether the case 
legally could be moved to federal court

ostriches in ohio and oklahoma he said 
the usda agency announced june 19 that african ticks had been 
detected on shipments of ostriches and told livestock producers to 
be on the alert 
bont ticks are known to transmit heartwater a disease of cattle 
sheep goats and other ruminants however glosser said the ticks 
removed from the ostriches are not known to transmit any human 
diseases 
so far there is no evidence that the ticks have spread to us 
livestock he said 
glosser said his agency is reviewing inspection methods and 
quarantine facility standards to determine if other action is needed 
to prevent additional pests from entering the united states 
he said the ostriches were in a shipment of 44 adult birds 
imported from zimbabwe on april 2 twentyfive survived and were

birds and soil every 14 days with a pesticide used to control 
livestock ticks glosser said 
other birds or animals that may have had contact with the 
ostriches or those immediately adjacent to the birds are being 
examined for ticks and treated he said if no ticks are found 
the state or federal veterinarian will lift the quarantine and 
continue a tick surveillance for six months 
glosser said rabbits birds steers and other sentinel 
animals are being placed on all farm premises with the adult 
ostriches to see if the ticks are still a threat to domestic 
animals agency health officials also are trapping wildlife on the 
farms to check for ticks

from the knot of demonstrators chanting for tv 
cameras to the shortsclad tourists hoping for a glimpse of a 
celebrity the streets outside the courthouse where oliver north was 
sentenced had the look of news in the making 
except for the presence of any of the principals in the case 
after us district judge gerhard a gesell announced his 
sentence for the 45yearold former national security council aide 
on wednesday north and his attorneys left the building through a 
side door and clambered into a waiting van saying nothing to 
reporters 
one voice shouted over the crowd ollie north youre a hero 
and the exmarine lieutenant colonel could be seen through the vans 
darktinted windows smiling 
minutes earlier chief prosecutor john keker was equally 
closedmouth as he burst through scores of reporters and camera 
crews at the courthouses front entrance and ducked into a car 
its kind of ridiculous to have all these cameras and all of 
this expense just to see a guy walk out said bernie doll a 
washington psychiatrist at the scene because he was on jury duty and 
awaiting assignment to a trial its a crazy world and getting 
crazier 
gesell had set the time of sentencing for 10 am by 9 am about 
20 north supporters cleancut welldressed and mostly in their 
20s had mustered outside the drab gray courthouse at the foot of 
capitol hill some carried printed oliver north american hero 
signs others toted handpainted banners and one hoisted a yellow 
dont tread on me flag depicting a coiled rattlesnake 
polite and orderly peering intermittently at the muggy overcast 
skies for signs of a possible downpour they erupted when cameras 
came into view 
pardon north now they chanted north american hero 
the largest contingent outside the building by far was the 
press nearly 30 television cameras were poised at the front 
entrance along with scores of reporters and photographers another 
throng lurked at the side door 
a handful of tourists gathered 
i wanted to see what he looked like personally betty 
donovan visiting town from woburn mass said of north 
frank enten a 58yearold retiree from bethesda md and a 
selfdescribed ollie north supporter from day one set up a 
sidewalk stand and began selling buttons to the faithful 
the duke would have loved ollie said one that depicted north 
and the late actor john wayne their visages tilted heavenward 
others portrayed fawn hall norths former secretary a flag 
unfurled behind her and the inscription thanks for your support 
fawn hall others implored victory over communism and im a 
contra too 
i thought thered be a bigger crowd said enten who said 
business had been slow i guess a lot of people couldnt get off 
work 
rep robert dornan rcalif a conservative and north supporter 
attended the sentencing left the courtroom and stepped up to the 
cluster of microphones positioned outside the building 
he did not seem overly dejected dornan said when asked about 
norths reaction to the sentence the lawmaker said he believed the 
sentence which included no jail time was on the low side of what 
we expected 
dornan spent much of his time explaining that he would not 
immediately send a letter to president bush that he had distributed 
to reporters before the sentencing the letter signed by 58 members 
of congress said north should spend no time in prison and asked 
bush to pardon him

from the shaker chair to the latest style of 
seating device the worlds first museum exclusively dedicated to 
design opens thursday with a threedimensional history of everyday 
comforts and hightech gadgets 
i want to make people aware of everyday things and see them as 
lifeenhancing said sir terence conran founder of the design 
museum who made a fortune from his habitat store chain its the 
culmination of a dream 
conran 57 has turned a derelict 1950s warehouse at butlers 
wharf a concrete monstrosity infested with rats he said into 
a gleaming showplace of consumer civilization on the south bank of 
the thames river by tower bridge 
everything manmade has been designed and this is the first 
museum in the world to show how massproduced consumer objects were 
designed and the first to explain why and how they work and look as 
they do the millionaire retailer said 
it shows how design contributes to the quality of our lives 
he said in an interview wednesday before the museums official 
opening by prime minister margaret thatcher 
one floor of the 11 million museum displays technological 
marvels like pocket allworld radios and suitcase computers the 
smartest thing in baby strollers lampstands tableware bicycles 
and tv receivers 
there is the famous 1927 red telephone booth of sir giles scott 
now discarded by uptotheminute british telecom but so loved by 
ordinary britons that public uproar forced authorities last year to 
give more than 1000 of them official protection from scrapping 
a permanent collection of 400 exhibits shows how modern objects 
evolved from flat irons to railway timetables paperback books 
newspaper pages sewing machines motor scooters soapflake 
packaging iceboxes washing machines and fountain pens 
there are 44 different chairs starting with a 1900 american 
shaker design on rockers from the christian sect that believed in 
communal living 
reproductions of such famous icons as leonardo da vincis mona 
lisa on a tablemat and designers of home furnishings seeking 
museum treasures to copy onto drapes and cushion covers show 
culture and commerce coming together 
a video screen unrolls wellknown british tv commercials for 
autos coffee and jeans that newspapers discuss endlessly because 
their readers say the advertisements are better than the programs 
they are designed to interrupt 
besides lectures and seminars on creativity work and technology 
the museum will run movies featuring the sets of famous designers 
many of the latest products shown are japanese 
its not surprising because after 30 years of looking 
listening and copying the japanese are developing their own design 
culture which is enormous and remarkable said conran 
the museum grew out of the boilerhouse project the first venture 
of conrans charitable conran foundation which ran 23 exhibitions 
on design at the victoria and albert museum in 19821986 seen by 
more than 15 milion people 
bayley 37 who ran the boilerhouse described the new museum as 
a classroom dedicated to the present and future of everyday life 
museum visitors can see through its big windows the 900yearold 
tower of london and the modern office blocks of the city financial 
district

prime minister yitzhak shamir giving in 
to demands from hawks in his rightwing likud bloc on wednesday 
adopted a hard line that may make it more difficult to sell his 
peace proposals to palestinians 
shamir in putting down a challenge to his leadership came out 
strongly in favor of more jewish settlements in the occupied 
territories and the exclusion of 140000 arabs in east jerusalem 
from proposed elections to choose palestinian negotiators 
he also demanded an end to violence associated with the 
palestinian uprising before any vote could be held and rejected any 
possibility of a palestinian state being formed 
shamirs hardline speech raised a debate on whether his stands 
killed his plan for a vote among the 17 million residents of the 
occupied territories to choose representatives to negotiate limited 
palestinian selfrule 
finance minister shimon peres leader of the rival labor party 
attacked the statements and raised the possibility his centerleft 
party would drop out of the coalition government 
i think they have put heavy shackles on the peace process and 
the labor party institutions will have to debate where we go from 
here peres said i know there are some members who have reached 
a conclusion that we should leave the government 
the palestine liberation organization had criticized the plan as 
a device to prevent creation of a palestinian state 
in his address to 2600 wildly cheering members of the likuds 
central committee shamir used tough language that could further 
alienate palestinians and thwart us efforts to arrange peace talks 
while he noted the us view that settlements are an obstacle to 
peace shamir sent his warm blessing to 80000 settlers in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
we call for continuation of jewish settlement in judea samaria 
west bank and the gaza strip every jew who wants to will be 
able to settle in any place in the land of israel and will receive 
support and security from the israeli government shamir said 
he also restated israels claim to east jerusalem which was 
captured from jordan in the 1967 middle east war and which the plo 
has demanded be the capital of a palestinian state 
jerusalem is not part of the initiative shamir declared 
sweeping aside a key palestinian demand that east jerusalem arabs be 
allowed to take part in the proposed elections 
he also said israels security forces would wipe out the 
palestinian uprising before any election was held 
shamirs speech quieted a revolt led by trade and industry 
minister ariel sharon who wanted to amend the plan to include the 
hardline likud positions 
shamir won overwhelming approval by a show of hands for a 
compromise vote to accept his speech as party policy while not 
considering attempts to alter the plan 
officials have said the plan approved by the coalition 
government on may 14 is deliberately vague in an attempt to appeal 
to palestinians by leaving key questions open to later negotiations 
likud and labor officials disagreed on the implications of 
shamirs speech 
nothing has changed said justice minister dan meridor a 
shamir supporter all that we have today is a firm likud 
resolution behind the peace plan there was a question mark over the 
peace initiative now all of likud is bound to it 
but chaim ramon of the centerleft labor party which shares 
power with likud in the coalition government said todays 
decision certainly torpedoes the peace plan 
sharon said the party decision was binding on the 12 likud 
cabinet ministers in an israel radio interview he said the points 
adopted by shamir make it very clear how far israel can go and 
where we will not be going 
but aides to shamir who demanded anonymity said the positions 
stated by shamir were not binding on the peace plan and were only a 
restatement of likud policy

the new conservativecommunist coalition 
government said wednesday that a promised cleanup of scandals that 
helped bring down the socialists aims to end the controversy not 
stir it up 
everything necessary will be done to set the cleansing process 
in motion said athanassios kanellopoulos minister to 
conservative premier tzannis tzannetakis 
but the spirit is not to perpetuate the issue or give the 
impression that a war by everyone against everyone is being 
started he said 
kanellopoulos said officials will investigate a banking scandal 
alleged kickbacks in the purchases of us and frenchmade 
warplanes wiretapping and missing government files since the new 
government took power sunday 
the conservative new democracy party and a communist partyled 
alliance that calls itself the coalition of left and progress formed 
a government after no party won an absolute majority in the june 18 
elections 
the new government partners said they would govern for three 
months to investigate and prosecute officials in former premier 
andreas papandreous government who allegedly were involved in 
multimilliondollar banking and financial scandals 
the socialists alleged involvement in the scandals and 
70yearold papandreous romance with a 35yearold woman before he 
divorced contributed to his downfall after eight years in office 
on wednesday papandreou left a hospital after 13 days of 
treatment for pneumonia and kidney failure accompanied by his 
girlfriend dmitra liani he went to the parliament building to be 
sworn in as a deputy to serve as opposition leader he kept his seat 
in the june 18 elections 
the banking scandal involves the 200 million embezzlement and 
fraud affair involving fugitive banker george koskotas the former 
bank of crete chairman in a us jail pending a hearing for his 
extradition to greece accused the socialist administration of 
masterminding and authorizing the fraud 
koskotas accused of using the bank funds to build a publishing 
empire and to buy a top greek soccer team has said in interviews 
from jail that socialist officials including papandreou received 
bribes from him 
kanellopoulos said the purchase of warplanes from the united 
states and france will be investigated socialist officials have 
been accused of receiving kickbacks from greeces purchase of 40 
f16 and 40 mirage 2000 jet fighters 
he said the government also will look into the case of yugoslav 
corn sold as a greek product to european economic community 
countries and alleged widespread wiretapping by the staterun greek 
telecommunications organization 
justice minister fotis kouvelis said tuesday that the cleansing 
could be hampered by the lack of documents in ministries 
ministers who took over this week said they found confidential 
files missing from their socialist predecessors offices 
tzannetakis said he could not find a single file in papandreous 
office 
the new premier said he was told by one of papandreous advisors 
that when problems were solved we tore up the documents therefore 
there are no documents we solved all problems 
kanellopoulos said the government would investigate why the files 
were missing 
papandreou failed to win a third term in office when his 
panhellenic socialist movement won only 125 seats in the 300seat 
unicameral parliament new democracy won 145 seats and the 
communists won 28 the remainder went to a small conservative party 
and an independent

cubas troop withdrawal from angola 
is on schedule and washington believes negotiations to end the civil 
war there will succeed us assistant secretary of state herman 
cohen said wednesday 
cohen said the usbrokered peace accord signed by angola cuba 
and south africa is working very well the retreat of cuban forces 
is exactly on schedule the same thing for south africa 
he arrived in abidjan the ivorian capital after visiting south 
africa and namibia he will attend a meeting of the commission 
monitoring the withdrawal friday in luanda angola 
under the agreement the more than 50000 cuban troops are to 
leave angola by july 1991 south africa pulled out its forces from 
angola and is withdrawing from namibia under a un independence 
plan for the territory 
cuba has helped luandas government fight jonas savimbis 
usbacked guerrillas and incursions by south african troops 
supporting savimbi 
at an african summit in zaire last month savimbi and angolan 
president jose eduardo dos santos called a ceasefire and agreed to 
negotiate an end to 14 years of civil war that has devastated the 
southern african nation 
they suffered a setback last week when dos santos accused 
savimbis fighters of breaking the truce 
cohen said tough negotiations lie ahead but i believe they are 
both committed to a solution a political solution 
he also said hopes for peace are improving in mozambique 
angola and mozambique both have marxist governments and have 
suffered civil wars since the 1970s when portuguese colonizers 
hastily withdraw leaving opposing guerrilla armies that warred for 
independence to fight it out wars in both countries have turned 
into a stalemate 
cohen said he hoped to discuss peace prospects next week during 
talks with mozambican president joaquim chissano 
we support the government of mozambique and i will be 
consulting with him to see if we can be helpful i believe a 
prenegotiating situation exists there and i am hopeful that it will 
move onto a real negotiating situation 
mozambique also can resolve its conflict through a political 
solution a military solution is impossible he said 
guerrillas of the mozambique national resistance said tuesday 
they are ready and willing for peace talks with no prior 
conditions as long as the government accepts the same arrangement 
chissano has ruled out direct talks but has permitted indirect 
contacts through church leaders

several rocky flats workers were exposed to high 
levels of radiation in seven incidents at the nuclear weapons plant 
from 1981 through 1987 a newspaper reported wednesday 
unusual occurrence reports obtained by the denver post 
detailed incidents in which workers were injured because of their 
own negligence or inadequate safety measures at the plant including 
radiation exposures that were not previously made public 
the newspaper based its story on 36 reports it obtained from doe 
under the freedom of information act most of the reports detail 
incidents that did not involve radioactive material 
one report cited by the post described an accident where an 
electrician inhaled plutonium rockwell international corp which 
operates the plant for the department of energy said the amount of 
plutonium in the workers lungs was 55 percent of rockwells 
maximum permissible lung burden 
many health officials say any measurable amount of plutonium 
inhaled into ones lungs can lead to serious health problems and 
even death the post said 
fbi and environmental protection agency agents are investigating 
allegations that hazardous waste was disposed of illegally at the 
plant 
the newspaper cited seven incidents involving radiation exposure 
that affected at least nine workers in some cases the number of 
workers involved was not specified 
in a feb 15 1984 report rockwell said an electrician who 
asked for a body count radiation test was found to have 
elevated levels of plutonium in his lungs apparently after he 
repaired a pump without using respiratory protection 
rockwell spokesman ed heintz said details on the electricians 
health are confidential we dont consider that level to be a 
serious problem heintz said but any plutonium is obviously 
something you dont want to get inside your system 
heintz did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on 
the other six incidents detailed in the post from the doe report 
they are 
on april 3 1985 two workers in building 371 accidentally 
inhaled plutonium but the incident report indicated there was 
little or no plutonium deposited in their lungs 
in july 1985 body counts of workers in building 779 after a 
release of radioactive contamination into a lab area showed some had 
inhaled radioactive materials 
a month later three workers were contaminated with plutonium in 
rocky flats main plutonium reprocessing center they were 
successfully decontaminated the report says 
in december 1985 truck drivers and janitors were directly or 
indirectly handling radioactive material unknowingly and without 
precautions after a small amount of radioactive waste 
inadvertently got into nonradioactive trash headed for a landfill 
on the plant grounds 
guards outside the area from which the trash was taken ignored 
radiation alarms that went off as the truck was about to leave 
on nov 3 1986 three workers in building 771 were exposed to 
high levels of radiation from plutonium oxide that was released 
accidentally during an equipment failure no contamination of their 
lungs was discovered the report said 
radiation was released in building 707 after an emergency 
electrical system failure nov 23 1986 no one was in the area

the chief us negotiator in ussoviet 
talks in geneva on longrange nuclear weapons assured nato allies 
that verification is a key issue 
negotiator richard burt discussed at length the american 
proposals offered since the strategic arms reduction talks resumed 
late last month according to a us official 
the allies questioned the negotiators about such issues as mobile 
missiles and sealaunched cruise missiles as well as verification 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
burt told the allies that any ussoviet agreement has to be 
based on a good strong verification regime the official said 
burt and another negotiator henry f cooper met privately with 
representatives of the 16nation north atlantic treaty organization 
in brussels it was the first time that burt the former ambassador 
to west germany talked to the allies in his new job 
natos press office said the allies welcomed the opportunity 
for confidential exchanges on developments in the geneva talks on 
the basis of a detailed report made by the us negotiators 
the ussoviet talks which resumed after a sevenmonth recess 
are expected to end in early august 
president bush has suggested washington and moscow begin testing 
verification procedures during the arms negotiations rather than 
waiting until an agreement is wrapped up 
they could carry out trial inspections at each others missile 
sites and discuss equipment needed for assuring compliance with a 
treaty 
the bush proposals are designed in part to build support in the 
senate for ratification of an eventual accord 
several arms control deals including the 1979 salt 2 treaty on 
limiting longrange nuclear arsenals were never ratified because of 
senate concerns about adequate verification methods 
the start negotiations which began in march 1985 are aimed at 
reducing us and soviet strategic or longrange bombers missiles 
and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent 
the pact is intended to cover nuclear weapons that the two 
superpowers could use to strike each other including sea and 
landbased missiles as well as heavy bombers 
in earlier rounds of talks both sides agreed to lowered ceilings 
of 6000 nuclear wearheads and 1600 delivery vehicles missiles 
and bombers for each side outlines of a system for monitoring 
compliance were also set

the african national congress an outlawed 
south african antiapartheid group intends to open an information 
office in washington this year an official of the organization said 
wednesday 
the decision is likely to generate controversy in light of 
opposition from conservative american groups to soviet support for 
the anc and to what they regard as the groups marxist orientation 
the defense department listed the anc among 52 terrorist 
organizations worldwide in a report entitled terrorist group 
profiles which was released in january the state department 
expressed reservations about inclusion of the group in the report 
saying the united states supports the ancs goal of ending the 
apartheid system of racial discrimination in south africa but 
opposes its violent methods 
we need to establish ourselves strongly in this city said 
dumi matabani a south african who has been representing the anc 
from his home here for the past eight years 
matabani said an office would be opened before the end of the 
year once funding and space for the facility have been organized 
matabani is registered with the justice department as a foreign 
agent representing the anc for lobbying and information purposes 
the new office will also be registered in keeping with us law he 
added 
the anc which also gets help from african and european 
countries hopes recent actions by the administration of george bush 
herald a more conciliatory approach toward the organization 
former secretary of state george shultz met with anc leader 
oliver tambo several years ago and there have been other official 
contacts with the organization which also maintains an office at 
the united nations but matabani said he does not have any regular 
contacts with the state department adding that us officials are 
not generally eager to hear what we have to say 
the bush administration unlike the reagan one has taken an 
active role in seeking to promote negotiations between the black 
majority in south africa and the whitedominated government 
last week bush hosted a leading antiapartheid activist 
albertina sisulu at the white house fw de klerk who is expected 
to assume the countrys presidency later this year is expected to 
visit the united states next month and become the first south 
african leader to do so in 30 years 
the anc founded 75 years ago was outlawed by south africa in 
1960 and its leader nelson mandela was jailed the group began a 
sabotage campaign one year later claiming it had no alternative 
against the government

reinforced stands will consume their solid fuel propellant after 
the firing renders the missile useless the sections are to be 
crushed 
the operation comes under provisions of the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty between the united states and the soviet 
union signed in december 1987 by president reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
a 10member soviet inspection team was scheduled to monitor 
thursdays event which marks the destruction of the 169th and last 
pershing 1a plant spokeswoman dorothy grant said 
the inf treaty which took effect june 1 1988 requires 
elimination of 859 american intermediaterange and shorter range 
missiles and 1752 similar soviet missiles within three years 
the missiles marked for destruction which have a range of 300 to 
3400 miles are unarmed nuclear warheads and electronic guidance

terms of the treaty at longhorn ms grant said nine pershing 2 
missiles have been eliminated with 234 more headed for the junk 
heap worldwide in addition hundreds of groundlaunched cruise

from an army depot near pueblo colo other missiles are being taken 
out of service at davismonthan air force base ariz and near 
frankfurt west germany 
the soviets began destruction of several classes of similar 
missiles a year ago 
the treaty allows the missiles to be burned in place and then 
crushed to be destroyed with explosives or to be launched without 
warheads american officials have said they chose burning in place 
because it is the cheapest and cleanest method 
thursdays affair was expected to be a much lowerkey event than 
the first destruction at longhorn sept 8 1988 
thenvice president bush made the first missiles demise a stop

escalona told the court that ochoa deceived the nicaraguans 
robbing them of big sums of money and robbing the sandinistas 
also means betraying cuba 
calling ochoa the main culprit escalona said the cashiered 
general also weakened the prestige and defense of the cuban 
revolution 
ochoas betrayal of cuba was even more serious when he betrayed 
the angolans by black market deals when he was chief of the cuban 
military mission in that african country escalona said 
escalona said ochoa planned to build a mansion with fine woods 
from the angolan jungles and enjoyed all the human and divine 
pleasures by incurring in multiple immoral acts

expenses last year up 75 percent from 1101 billion in 1987 a 
preliminary report by the agriculture department said wednesday 
despite the increase 1988 expenditures were still far below the 
record level of 1318 billion in 1981 just before the general 
financial crunch that stalled expansion in the nations agricultural 
sector 
by 1986 annual spending by farmers dropped to less than 106 
billion indicating massive cutbacks in capital investments as land 
values plummeted and debts burdened so many 
according to the latest report by the departments national 
agricultural statistics service 1988 expenditures were higher for 
all major categories except interest which decreased 37 percent to 
837 billion and building and fencing which dropped 103 percent 
to 223 billion 
farm services which include rent accounted for the largest 1988 
expenditures by farmers totaling 246 billion or 21 percent of 
the total that was up 27 percent from 1987 
spending on feed for livestock totaled 179 billion was up 20 
percent from 1987 and accounted for 15 percent of last years total

a puerto rican nationalist sentenced to the 
federal prison in atlanta for burning an american flag has been 
freed since the us supreme court ruled that such a protest is a 
legal exercise of freedom of speech 
greg bogdan a spokesman for the us bureau of prisons in 
washington dc confirmed wednesday that carlos mendozalugo 36 
was freed last week 
mendozalugo had filed a petition in us district court seeking 
release after the us supreme court issued its ruling june 21 
bogdan said the puerto rican magistrate who sentenced 
mendozalugo to the maximum one year in prison reduced the sentence 
to seven months making him eligible for release 
but he said he did not know when the judge reduced the sentence 
or whether the reduction was tied to the supreme court ruling he 
said mendozalugo was freed june 30 when the notification arrived 
in atlanta 
mendozalugo a professional photographer was convicted of 
burning a flag in front of the us post office in his home town of 
anasco puerto rico on march 16 1987 
wind kept blowing out his matches and he only singed the flag 
but he pleaded guilty to one charge of flag desecration 
mendozalugo said he was protesting continued american control of 
puerto rico and pressing for puerto rican independence 
i never intended to degrade the american people he said from 
jail last week it wasnt an act of vandalism i was protesting 
its unconstitutional for me to be in jail when i was making use of 
my freedom of speech 
federal judiciary officials have said that others jailed on the 
same charge likely also will be freed as a result of the supreme 
court ruling 
the bureau of prisons said the number of people jailed on the 
charge is very small but that such statistics are not kept 
separately

the legislature will put off electing 
polands new president until after president bush visits next week 
a communist official announced wednesday 
politburo member marian orzechowski leader of the communist 
deputies caucus in the sejm said the election by the national 
assembly could not be held earlier because state officials will be 
out of the country friday and saturday and will be busy after that 
with the bush visit 
the news came on the second day of the meeting of polands new 
sejm and senate the first legislature in four decades in the east 
bloc to have opposition representation 
bush is to visit poland july 911 at the invitation of polish 
leader gen wojciech jaruzelski who will accompany bush during his 
activities in warsaw and gdansk before that jaruzelski will be 
attending a conference of warsaw pact political leaders in bucharest 
on friday and saturday 
orzechowski said at a news conference that he expected the 
presidential vote before july 22 polands national day and that 
his caucus supported jaruzelski for the post 
communist party and solidarity officials earlier insisted the new 
president would be chosen before bushs visit the postponement 
appeared related to ongoing indecision over who the party will 
nominate for the new sixyear office that will oversee the army and 
foreign relations 
the presidency a powerful post similar to the one created in the 
soviet union for mikhail s gorbachev is being restored after 37 
years 
the president will oversee the army and foreign policy he will 
be elected by the sejm and senate sitting together as the national 
assembly where the communist coalition will have a 300259 majority 
over solidarity legislators 
jaruzelski had been the partys prime candidate but he surprised 
the nation friday by announcing he would not run and nominating 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak instead 
since then the party has asked jaruzelski to reconsider 
orzechowski said he believed jaruzelski still had not made a 
decision wednesday 
he said the communist caucus supports the candidacy of gen 
jaruzelski and is leading its activities in this direction 
jaruzelski was the best candidate because of internal and 
international reasons orzechowski said 
solidarity sejm deputy adam michnik has proposed that the union 
support the communist candidate if solidarity is given the right to 
form the next government 
behindthescenes negotiations on such an arrangement evidently 
continued 
although initially greeted with skepticism by solidarity members 
reluctant to take power so quickly especially with the economy in 
disarray michniks proposal appeared to gain cautious support among 
others quoted wednesday in the unions election gazette daily 
the proposal should be taken as an indication of a political 
possibility said sejm deputy jacek kuron 
the communist party leadership has not responded to the proposal 
orzechowski said communist lawmakers would discuss details of a new 
government after the president is elected 
in activity at the sejm meeting solidarity deputy julius braun 
demanded that officials explain a case of alleged police brutality 
on picketers 
the remarks at the end of the days meeting followed routine work 
in which the parliament certified last months elections and 
considered candidates to the watchdog state tribunal that oversees 
government officials 
braun said from the podium that peaceful picketers were attacked 
overnight in a brutal way by plainclothes police in front of the 
parliament they were holding banners opposing against the 
presidential candidacy of jaruzelski 
the demonstrators were from the banned anticommunist 
confederation for an independent poland 
saying his question was directed to kiszczak head of the police 
braun asked what were the intentions of the people who ordered 
this action on the first day of the parliament session 
the question was shown during the live nationwide tv broadcast of 
the sejm and drew applause from many delegates speaker mikolaj 
kozakiewicz said kiszczak would be called to the chamber at its next 
sitting to answer 
the 161 solidarity parliament deputies were installed tuesday 
alongside 299 communist coalition members creating the first east 
bloc legislature since the late 1940s to include a political 
opposition 
the freely elected senate with 98 solidarity representatives out 
of 100 seats also met tuesday and wednesday only one seat in that 
chamber was won by a nonsolidarity member procommunist 
businessman henryk stoklosa one seat is vacant due to the death 
last week of solidarity senatorelect grzegorz bialkowski 
bialkowski rector of warsaw university was buried wednesday in 
a funeral attended by solidarity leader lech walesa and hundreds of 
union supporters and members of the academic community

china has ordered major hotels in the capital to 
unhook satellite dishes that receive foreign news broadcasts 
including cable news network hotel officials said wednedsday 
in addition to cnn some hotels also receive the us armed 
forces radio television service and in a few cases the japan 
broadcasting corp only the hotels that are partly owned by foreign 
business concerns have satellite dishes 
the chinese hotels do not have this service said an official 
at beijings travel and tourism bureau who identified himself as sun 
anyone with a satellite dish can receive the programming and the 
hotels do not pay cable networks or the chinese government for the 
service the tourism official said satellite service was ordered 
cut because it was unfair 
our guess is that they are concerned the hotel staff is seeing 
it said vito maggiolo cnns managing editor in beijing 
china is engaged in an intensive propaganda campaign to discredit 
western news accounts of a sevenweek student movement for 
democratic reform and a military crackdown on june 34 the chinese 
government has said up to 200 people half of them soldiers died in 
the crackdown while chinese witnesses and western intelligence 
sources say the death toll may have been as high as 3000 
sun said the order to cut cable reception was issued in january 
by the state bureau of travel and tourism and the ministry of radio 
film and television but he said it was enforced only in the past 
few days after the government realized hotels had not heeded the 
first order 
beijing hotel officials said the government order was issued 
about six months ago but that there had been no attempts to enforce 
it 
hotels in shanghai and guangzhou said however they have not 
been ordered to cut satellite reception 
the great wall sheraton was the first to cut its satellite 
service last month it restored the service briefly this week 
reportedly because it realized other hotels were still ignoring the 
order but cut it again less than 24 hours later 
the jiangguo hotel chinas first jointventure hotel suspended 
service on friday one day after cnn broadcast a videotape of 
fugitive student leader wuer kaixi saying from exile he would never 
give up the struggle for democracy in china 
the hotel issued a circular a few days later saying that 
technical difficulties were responsible for the loss of programming 
at least four other beijing hotels the shangrila palace 
kunlun and holiday inn lido also have cut satellite service 
questions and complaints from disappointed and angry hotel guests 
elicited a variety of responses ranging from blank looks to talk of 
technical problems 
we are upset about it but what can we do we have to accept 
it everyone is in the same boat we cannot fight it a jianguo 
hotel official said on condition of anonymity 
there is no way we can say no said the manager of another 
hotel our guests are angry we can only tell them it is beyond 
our control 
sun said any hotels that still refuse to follow the order will 
not be punished but said that hotels in china should obey chinese 
law

opposition leaders took to the streets wednesday to 
kick off campaigns for nationwide elections prime minister sousuke 
uno fighting scandal and new allegations of tax evasion stayed at 
party headquarters and promised reform 
analysts and much of japans media have predicted his liberal 
democratic party which has governed japan since the party was 
formed in 1955 will suffer heavy losses in the july 23 elections 
for half the seats in the upper house of parliament 
in a 15minute speech uno promised reform and apologized for the 
widespread recruit influencepeddling scandal that tainted many 
liberal democratic party leaders and led to the resignation of his 
predecessor noboru takeshita one month ago 
but he told voters not to listen to those who would change 
japans system and lead the nation to isolation from the 
international community 
he was referring to opposition parties which have been gaining 
in local elections in the wake of the scandal and voter anger over a 
3monthold sales tax 
soon after becoming prime minister uno was accused of keeping 
paid mistresses he denied doing anything immoral 
by breaking the liberal democrats majority the upcoming 
elections will be a historic first step said socialist chairwoman 
takako doi 
the current government is not valid in the eyes of the world 
she told a rally in nagoya central japan prime minister uno is 
holding office only because all his partys executives hands are 
dirty 
the masscirculation newspapers asahi and yomiuri reported uno 
misreported property holdings and underpaid his taxes by 7000 
between 1977 and 1985 
the papers said uno continued for several years to claim as a 
rice paddy property he converted into a parking lot in 1977 the 
reports said he was taxed at the lower rates for farmland 
the asahi report based on public announcements of all cabinet 
ministers assets tuesday also alleged he violated a government 
regulation by acting as president of his family brewery for several 
months while holding a cabinet post 
meanwhile a liberal democratic party official who asked not to 
be further identified said it was rare for the party president 
not to go out stumping the first day of such a major campaign he 
said uno had no plans to attend any support rallies in the near 
future 
the sex scandal has absolutely nothing to do with it said 
another official at the partys campaign headquarters he is busy 
preparing for the summit 
uno is scheduled to attend the paris summit of seven major 
industrialized nations beginning july 14 
the tokyo branch of the liberal democratic party last week asked 
uno to keep away from the campaign for the metropolitan assembly 
fearing the mistress question could scare off support he did but 
when votes were counted monday the party lost nearly onethird of 
its 63 seats in the 128member assembly while the socialists the 
no 1 opposition party tripled their strength to 36 
of the 126 seats being contested in the 252seat upper house the 
liberal democrats hold 66 the socialists 22 the komeito clean 
government party 12 the communists eight minor parties 13 and 
independents five 
before takeshitas resignation three cabinet ministers were 
forced to step down due to links to the recruit co a publishing 
conglomerate that allegedly doled out millions of dollars in 
political donations and underpriced stock shares in exchange for 
favors 
uno reiterated his support for the new sales tax which the 
liberal democrats forced through parliament late last year but said 
he was willing to reexamine certain aspects 
the liberal democrats hold a comfortable majority in the more 
powerful lower house where elections do not have to be held before 
next year

the government on wednesday announced new 
procedures for the first nationwide elections in 22 years and the 
first to separate the kingdom from the west bank since jordans 
independence 
in a statement broadcast with the election announcement prime 
minister zeid bin shaker connected the new voting law with jordans 
support of the plo as representative of palestinians in the 
israelioccupied west bank 
government sources said the elections will take place nov 16 
but there was no official announcement of the date 
sources close to the prime minister said a ban will remain in 
effect on political parties which were outlawed after a coup 
attempt in 1957 
an interior ministry statement over official radio jordan said 
the amended election law called for an 80member parliament elected 
solely from jordan 
king hussein issued a royal decree enacting the new law which 
modifies an election plan adopted in april that outlined a 72member 
parliament 
all previous parliaments since 1951 four years after 
independence were evenly split between west bank palestinian and 
east bank jordanian representatives because jordan claimed both 
banks of the jordan river 
no nationwide voting has been possible since 1967 when israel 
captured the west bank a handful of district elections were held on 
the east bank in 1984 to replace members who had died 
hussein suspended the old 60member parliament last year after 
renouncing sovereignty over the west bank in favor of the plo 
the palestinian cause constitutes the heart of our commitments 
and interests in all fields bin shaker said in a prerecorded 
radio statement 
he said the elections should do all possible to purify the 
relationship in accordance with our stable position to defend 
the palestinian people on their national soil and in considering the 
palestine liberation organization the legitimate representative of 
the palestinian people 
in april hussein promised to call elections before the end of 
the year after four days of rioting over price rises 
many political activists complained that the april election law 
failed to distribute seats fairly according to population 
the new law adds three seats for amman where most citizens of 
palestinian background are concentrated but the capital district 
with roughly 40 percent of the countrys 3 million people still has 
only 21 of the 80 seats

a federal judge refused wednesday to bar the 
senate from beginning the impeachment trial of us district judge 
alcee l hastings of miami next monday 
us district judge gerhard a gesell ruled that he had no 
jurisdiction to rule on hastings claims that the senate procedure 
for hearing the impeachment evidence violated due process 
hastings faces senate trial on 17 articles of impeachment 
including allegations that he lied during his 1983 bribery trial 
which ended in his acquittal and that he obstructed a corruption 
investigation by disclosing wiretap information 
the miami jurist had sought an injunction to bar the proceeding 
on the ground that appointment of a 12member special impeachment 
committee by the senate violated his constitutional right to a trial 
of the evidence by the full senate 
but gesell said the constitution gives the senate the power to 
devise the procedures for conducting impeachment trials 
the constitution simply does not specify in detail what is 
required for the trial before the senate the judge said absent 
evidence that the senate is violating the constitution the court 
should stay its hand 
he noted that the same committee procedure with some 
modificatins was used in 1986 during the impeachment trial of 
former us district judge harry claiborne of nevada 
several senators voted against claibornes impeachment saying 
they objected to the committee procedure 
but gesell said that issue was for the senate not the courts to 
debate 
it is not this courts function to tinker with the senates 
procedures or to anticipate problems that could arise gesell 
wrote the procedures adopted do not by their terms violate any 
constitutional rights or offend fundamental notions of justice 
gesell also rejected hastings claims that he is a victim of 
double jeopardy because the senate is considering many of the same 
charges for which he was acquitted during the criminal trial 
but gesell said hastings argument is based on a fundamental 
misapprehension because impeachment is not a criminal 
proceeding 
impeachment proceedings are not restricted by principles of 
double jeopardy any more than conviction always necessitates 
impeachment gesell said

encumbered with mistrust confrontation and all of this has to be 
gotten rid of for this we have to be very wise and very 
courageous the soviet president said 
bush who visits warsaw on sunday urged the soviet union to 
withdraw military units it has stationed in poland since the end of 
world war ii 
on behalf of the nato alliance bush called last month for 
sweeping reductions in conventional forces in europe that would cut 
the number of us and soviet troops on the continent to 275000 for 
each superpower 
the soviets would have to remove 325000 men under the ceiling 
the americans would have to cut only 30000 
during nearly 10 hours of talks over two days gorbachev and 
mitterrand discussed reducing conventional forces and signed 22 
agreements covering cultural scientific business and military 
cooperation 
the statement on lebanon called for an immediate ceasefire 
rigorously respected as an indispensable condition for the 
establishment of a constructive interlebanese dialogue aiming at 
national reconciliation and peaceful building of a country founded 
on a balance of the interests of all lebanese communities

on wednesday morning gorbachev met with french intellectuals at 
the sorbonne and challenged them to help create a new more peaceful

us ambassador peter secchia says that in 
washington at least people are judged by their first 100 days in 
office 
but it took the michigan businessmanturneddiplomat only 100 
hours to draw fire by reiterating us opposition to communist 
participation in the italian government 
christian democratic premier ciriaco de mita resigned may 19 and 
has since been trying to resurrect the same fiveparty coalition 
that excludes the communists with political parties maneuvering for 
position secchias statement opened up the floodgates for the 
communists 
asked if any change was expected in us policy toward the 
italian communist party the ambassador replied that while that it 
was up to the italian people to decide it is clearly our 
preference that the communists not enter the government for a number 
of reasons specifically the positions taken on key strategic 
issues 
he told a monday news conference that unless that changed he had 
no intention of meeting with achille occhetto italys communist 
party chief who visited america in may but was not received by the 
bush administration 
the communist party daily lunita which described secchia as an 
industrialist promoted diplomat for financial reasons called it his 
first diplomatic incident and published a series of attacks 
hes like a japanese soldier in the jungle it seems he hasnt 
understood that the cold war is over lunita quoted independent 
leftist deputy franco bassanini as saying 
its interference in the affairs of our country while there is 
a delicate political crisis said renato zangheri the communist 
whip in the chamber of deputies 
asked about criticism of his appointment secchia said monday 
i ask you to give me a chance and judge my performance and maybe 
100 days from now we can meet again 
secchia was restating longstanding us policy that had been 
reiterated by his predecessor maxwell rabb when occhetto went to 
the united states 
the communist party has opposed natos deployment of cruise 
missiles in sicily and attacked a plan to transfer to southern italy 
a us air force f16 wing forced to leave spain

people in the rural village where oliver 
north grew up criticized his sentence wednesday as too harsh and 
said the former white house aide was a fall guy for higherups 
if he came to philmont tomorrow id give him a heros 
welcome mayor phillip mossman said after north was sentenced in 
washington to two years probation and a 150000 fine for 
irancontra crimes 
north who could have been sent to prison for up to 10 years was 
also given suspended prison terms of three two and one years for 
his three felony convictions 
charles havelka a retired real estate agent whose son was a 
friend of north called the sentence ridiculous 
havelka asserted that the former marine lieutenant colonel was 
just an intermediary between thenpresident reagan and thenvice 
president bush and all the rest 
havelka said he remembered young north as regular churchgoer a 
boy scout and later as a marine and said hes sure north did no 
wrong 
if hes a patriotic american and he said he didnt do anything 
wrong then he didnt havelka said 
north a key figure in the scandal over the use of profits from 
arms sales to iran to illegally fund the nicaraguan contra rebels 
was convicted of aiding and abetting obstruction of congress 
destroying or altering government documents and accepting a 
gratuity a security fence around his home 
public support in this village of fewer than 2000 people about 
30 miles south of albany has been mostly on norths side since 
congressional hearings on the irancontra scandal in the spring of 
1987 
the hearings made north a hero to many americans philmont even 
held an oliver north day in august 1987 to show their support 
the feeling that north was a patsy for higherups especially 
reagan and bush seemed widespread in the village 
at the sentencing judge gerhard a gesell told north as you 
stand there now youre not the fall guy for this tragic breach of 
the public trust 
mossman though said norths sentence was too harsh and that he 
was a fall guy 
dont tell me that reagan and bush didnt know what was going 
on mossman said they come out on national television and call 
him a hero and the next day they fire him 
sharon johnson a real estate broker said north is not the 
only one that should be in the position he is in 
she said reagan and bush are supposed to be fearless leaders 
they should have owned up 
pat near a village clerk admitted that hometown prejudices 
might be coloring her judgment but she remembered north as a nice 
boy who grew into a fine man 
i love my country very much and i was very saddened by what he 
went through near said 
what he did he didnt do selfishly he did it for his 
country johnson added even if he wasnt from philmont id have 
the same feeling

a senior leader of the fundamentalist 
hezbollah organization said wednesday the abduction of foreigners in 
lebanon was inappropriate and not a good method 
sheikh subhi tofaili who heads hezbollah or party of god in 
east lebanons bekaa valley spoke in an interview with the 
associated press in south beirut 
hezbollah has repeatedly denied involvement in the kidnappings 
but western intelligence sources and and local reports frequently 
described the shiite moslem faction as backing islamic jihad the 
umbrella organization for underground groups believed to be holding 
most of the 14 foreigners missing in lebanon 
we havent practiced kidnapping because of our conviction it is 
inappropriate said tofaili who recently returned from a trip to 
tehran after the death of revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini 
we do not believe the abduction is a good method 
but he made it plain that for now the party was not ready to 
intervene to help secure the hostages release because the 
issue is political 
the hostages include nine americans the longest held is terry 
anderson 41 chief middle east correspondent for the ap he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
tofailis statement came a week after hezbollah spokesman ibrahim 
amin said it is possible that we might feel some acts might have 
involved a very big mistake but we have to face our mistakes in the 
way that preserves and respects our society

emergency parking lots after rail and bus workers went on strike

troops laid metal sheets on park lawns to protect the grass even 
so the owner of hyde parks exclusive horse stable complained that 
drivers turned a 300yearold riding path laid by king william of 
orange into a race track causing serious damage 
a oneday walkout by bus maintenance crews disrupted services on 
the capitals red doubledeckers which carry 32 million people 
daily trains and subways carry nearly 5 million

a windswept mrs thatcher sped down the river thames in a port 
authority launch to open the new design museum at butlers wharf on 
the rivers south bank near tower bridge 
i just think its a tragedy the public are being put to all of 
this trouble to get to work she said 
transport minister paul channon who took a bus instead of his 
official limousine to work said a lot of people have been making 
superhuman efforts to get to work today in london and in other 
cities 
mrs thatchers administration said it was prepared for what a 
senior government source called a war of attrition with 
increasingly militant unions 
as the latest oneday strike hit british rail announced a record 
486 million profit achieved despite reduced subsidies that 
followed the government announcement it would sell the system to 
private enterprise 
british rail said the profit was for reinvestment not pay 
increases 
john prescott the transport spokesman for the opposition labor 
party declared the government has to end its obsession with 
privatization and the free market before congestion and overcrowding 
reduce our transport system to total chaos 
troops laid metal sheeting over grass in hyde park and regents 
park to provide 7000 extra parking spaces for motorists who 
normally would take public transportation to work 
richard briggs owner of the hyde park stable said some 
motorists damaged a riding path put down in 1689 i want to know 
whos going to pay for it he said 
huge traffic jams were reported in the morning and afternoon on 
some routes but hundreds of commuters walked jogged or cycled to 
work passenger ferries on the river thames reported brisk business 
the employers confederation of british industry said the turnout 
for work appeared slightly less than the estimated 75 percent of 
londoners who made it during the last strike on june 28 
the 75000member national union of railwaymen has held weekly 
oneday strikes to coincide with walkouts that began three months 
ago by the london undergrounds 10500 employees 
the railworkers who want a 10 percent pay increase have 
rejected a 7 percent offer the union also demands an end to a 
management attempt to negotiate separately with different categories 
of workers weakening the national unions power to halt the system

without a guard management has offered 47 plus 14 days extra 
vacation with the package tied to increased productivity

the air force bombed moslem guerrilla 
positions around kabul and the eastern city of jalalabad on 
wednesday and the insurgents fired at least seven rockets into the 
capital the government said 
mohamad nabi amani the foreign ministry spokesman also reported 
army counterattacks around the provincial towns of khost kandahar 
and herat but gave no details 
he said 53 people had killed in all the operations including 37 
rebels 
amani said nine people were killed by the rockets in kabul two 
exploded in a residential area about 1000 yards from the 
continental hotel 
on tuesday the government claimed the insurgents were preparing 
major assaults on kabul and other cities 
a statement by the supreme defense council on wednesday said the 
army was countering a heinous plan by pakistan to aid the 
guerrillas at jalalabad which has been under siege since march 7 
amani said both air force and artillery units were involved in 
the fighting at jalalabad an important provincial capital 75 miles 
east of kabul and 45 miles from the border with pakistan 
on a former government tree farm at ghaziabad 25 miles east of 
jalalabad the guerrilla faction led by younis khalis released 40 
afghan soldiers on wednesday 
guerrillas have been accused of killing prisoners and insurgent 
leaders fear that has made many soldiers reluctant to change sides 
even though the afghan armys desertion rate is high 
they are not convinced we will not shoot them said aoul 
gul the commander holding ghaziabad he said the prisoners were 
freed to counter propaganda that we are killing the people we 
get 
diplomatic sources and witnesses said wednesdays air strikes 
were the most intensive in weeks 
fighterbombers were seen leaving kabul and the nearby baghram 
air base in groups of two and three for the paghman mountains a 
guerrilla sanctuary northwest of the capital 
thirty to 35 aircraft took part in operations that began at dawn 
and lasted about 90 minutes witnesses reported 
some aircraft headed for nangarhar province of which jalalabad 
is the capital the assault on jalalabad was the first major 
guerrilla attack after the withdrawal of soviet military forces from 
afghanistan was completed feb 15 
jalalabad the countrys fifthlargest city is considered 
strategically important because of its nearness to pakistan where 
the main guerrilla groups are based the united states and pakistan 
provide most of the support for the insurgents 
the sovietsponsored government claims it broke the siege of 
jalalabad last month but official kabul radio has reported fighting 
around the city for two weeks it said shells and rockets fired into 
residential areas tuesday killed four people including two 
children and wounded eight 
on tuesday the government said insurgents planned simultaneous 
massive attacks on kabul and other major cities in midjuly it 
asked the united nations to intervene 
foreign minister abdul wakil said the grave consequences 
which will include bloodshed and destruction will be shouldered 
by the pakistani militarists and overseas designers of the attack 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and soviet military forces entered the country in december 
1979 an estimated 115000 red army soldiers were in afghanistan 
when the unmediated withdrawal began in may 1988

beer consumption in 1988 was 341 gallons and distilled spirits 
221 gallons 
napa valley winemaker robert mondavi said the per capita decline 
was principally among less expensive wines however for the fine 
wines we went up 10 to 15 percent and that is true even for france 
and italy he said 
mondavi widely regarded as the nations most influential 
vintner predicted consumption will increase again if the wine 
industry wakes up we have been asleep at the switch in telling the 
story of wine to the world 
the survey using statistics compiled by state and federal 
agencies and californias wine institute found that total us wine 
consumption dropped to 5522 million gallons in 1988 49 percent or 
287 million gallons under the 1987 figure

sales fell off again with the dollar weak against european 
currencies domestic wines posted an export record in 1988 and 
imports declined again 
mondavi said even the generic wines the jug wines are 
coming up in quality following the lead of the finer premium 
varietals 
the survey noted that while exports hit a record 119 million 
gallons in 1987 last years exports hit 169 million gallons or 35 
percent of total sales 
about 86 percent of all wine sold in this country last year was 
white blush or rose with only 14 percent red wines 
california produced 905 percent of all us wine last year at 
4284 million gallons a 96 percent rise over 1987 new york was

wineries

president bush anxious not to be overshadowed 
by the european allies on tackling environmental problems will 
emphasize steady longterm commitments to those issues during 
next weeks economic summit meeting in paris a top adviser said 
wednesday 
bush intends to discuss a variety of us environmental concerns 
including atmospheric ozone depletion ocean dumping deforestation 
international air pollution and global warming said william reilly 
administrator of the environmental protection agency 
without going into detail reilly said bush will make specific 
proposals including in hungary and poland which the president will 
visit before the july 1317 summit 
reily said the environment will take on an unprecedented priority 
at the paris sessions 
there is even something of a race on by some of the economic 
summit participants leaders to be the greenest of all on this 
issue reilly told reporters i would expect that our posture 
will be one that emphasizes that restoring the environment is not a 
sprinters game its going to require steady longterm commitments 
to reverse accumulated environmental problems which have reached 
very serious proportions in many parts of the world 
reilly said that as bush indicated in a may 31 speech in mainz 
west germany the president will make some proposals on the 
environment both in poland and in hungary and will show an 
interest in making available to eastern europe some of the 
benefits of us experience 
reilly would not elaborate on what those proposals would be or 
whether they involved the economic incentives that bush has promised 
hungary and poland in response to their democratization reforms 
in the mainz speech bush said that the united states and western 
europe should work together on environmental problems and extend a 
hand to the east 
at that time he said the west could offer technical training 
and assistance in drafting laws and regulations and new 
technologies for tackling environmental problems 
the united states is expected to work against moves toward what 
reilly called a large new united nations bureacracy to oversee 
air pollution rules 
such a un role was envisioned in a pact signed by leaders from 
24 nations in march at an ozone conference in holland the pact 
asked the united nations to police efforts to curtail 
ozonedestroying chemicals and other air pollutants french 
president francois mitterand was among the signers 
reilly said that he did not expect the issue to dominate the 
environmental talks but said that discussion of ozonedepleting 
chloroflourocarbons was expected to be a hot topic 
he said he did not anticipate specific treaties or signed 
ratified instruments on the environment to come from the summit 
reilly said the summit will more likely produce an affirmation 
of the major issues on the environment particularly those that 
intersect importantly with economic development 
there is likely to be a focus on sustainable development and 
perhaps what that means for the world environment

a windwhipped forest fire sent smoke billowing 10000 feet over 
the utahcolorado border and forced officials to restrict air travel 
wednesday hundreds of firefighters battled lightning fires in two 
other states 
in southern california residents of an affluent neighborhood 
devastated by a wildfire returned to their homes to survey the 
damage and guard against looters the fire destroyed 13 homes 
causing at least 43 million in damage 
we were going to have a barbecue said tammy wigington who 
lost a redwood deck and hot tub in the fire though her home was 
spared but i guess we already had one 
the 1500acre fire in hacienda heights a canyon about 20 miles 
east of los angeles was surrounded tuesday and firefighters said 
the cause remained under investigation 
i can probably tell you it was manmade inspector john 
lenihan said the last time we had spontaneous combustion on brush 
was in the old testament 
lightning was blamed for fires in utah colorado and in the 
okefenokee swamp along the georgiaflorida border 
a 7000acre blaze roared past fire lines in the flume canyon 
wilderness study area in eastern utah and belched so much smoke that 
the federal aviation administration closed an airway in the area 
about 80 miles west of grand junction colo 
the fire burned less than one mile from two natural gas lines 
forcing northwest pipeline co to close the lines said mary plumb 
of the bureau of land managements moab district 
the fire did not threaten structures but it burned a 5000 
bureau of land management radio repeater being used to fight the 
blaze plumb said it burned through sagebrush and old douglas fir 
we arent sure of the damage because we havent been able to 
get to the scene yet she said its in extremely rough country 
with extreme fire danger theres a drought out there so its just 
a tinderbox 
more than 300 firefighters were called in to fight the blaze 
which authorities hope to contain by monday 
in georgia more than 100 firefighters from state and federal 
agencies fought a 750acre blaze in the okefenokee swamp with the 
help of helicopters that dumped water on hot spots the 425000acre 
swamp has been left dry by belownormal rainfall and water levels 
the fire burned in the southwestern part of billys island about 
16 miles northeast of fargo firefighters hoped to stop it from 
spreading to other parts of the island said john oberheu a 
spokesman for the us fish and wildlife service in atlanta 
swamp officials say fire sometimes benefits the swamp especially 
if it burns off dried peat that if allowed to continue building up 
could turn parts of the okefenokee into dry land

international benefactors rallied to support the 
philippines on wednesday and promised to commit 35 billion to the 
first year of an aid program for the young democracy 
japan the biggest donor announced a pledge of about 1 billion 
in easyterm loans and grants and said it was considering a separate 
loan of 600 million to help service the philippines 28 billion 
foreign debt 
the united states says it will add 200 million this year to its 
previous commitment of 4586 million 
the 12nation european economic community said it would roughly 
triple its aid to the level of about 350 million a year 
we are grateful for the positive and enthusiastic response of 
the international community to this unique effort to help us 
roberto villanueva aid coordinator in the philippines said after a 
threeday meeting of 20 countries and seven international 
organizations 
a statement issued by the world bank which organized the 
meeting said the donors complimented the manila government on 
the remarkable economic recovery achieved in the past three years 
and endorsed the governments policy objectives as presented 
the aid commitment is double the level that resulted from the 
last donors meeting in 1987 the world bank said 
if carried through 1992 it would mean 14 billion to help 
president corazon aquinos government deal with pervasive problems 
of poverty poor infrastructure and a foreign debt legacy left from 
the 20year authoritarian rule of ferdinand marcos 
the united states former ruler in the philippines and now 
possessor of major military bases there originated the idea for the 
philippines multilateral aid initiative secretary of state james a 
baker iii said in tokyo tuesday it was critical to the future of 
philippine democracy 
the world bank did not release details of other donors 
commitments most of which would come from the bank itself or other 
global institutions like the international monetary fund said 
japanese analyst katsumi nozawa 
nozawa said that in addition to supporting democracy and economic 
reform the aid package would bolster western strategic interests in 
the philippines the current usphilippines agreement on key us 
air and naval bases there expires in late 1991 
all sides officially say no link exists between aid and 
continuation of the bases but there is a de facto link said 
nozawa a philippines specialist at the institute for developing 
economies a think tank supported by the ministry of international 
trade and industry 
the philippines 198992 economic recovery plan also coincides 
with the end of mrs aquinos term as president villanueva noted 
he said no conditions were set on debtrelief measures but he 
acknowledged that manila now must show improved performance in 
utilizing aid a concern that was stressed by japanese americans 
and others at the conference 
villanueva said a system of checks and balances was in place to 
guard against corruption and mismanagement areas that long have 
been problems in delivering aid to the philippines 
the philippines deputy finance secretary ernest leung told 
reporters work now could start soon on electric power and road 
projects and that the conference result would help back a fisheries 
loan and give other fiscal support 
poverty now afflicts 49 percent of the people in the philippines 
according to official standards if the aid reduces poverty it may 
eventually lower the strength of the communistled insurgents who 
have fought for 20 years to overthrow the government 
the 20 countries represented at the tokyo meeting were australia 
belgium britain canada denmark france finland west germany 
italy japan south korea the netherlands new zealand the 
philippines saudi arabia singapore spain sweden switzerland and 
the united states 
international organizations included the world bank the asian 
development bank the european economic community the international 
monetary fund the un development fund the international finance 
corporation and the un international cultural and educational fund

he could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison and fined up to

indictments against 50 people for sampl or bank fraud and obtained 32 
convictions in two years more than 100 other people have been 
convicted for bank or sampl fraud under indictments sought by the us

the task force in dallas and establish a similar one in southern 
california the two areas of the country with the biggest backlogs 
of thrift fraud cases 
what we prefer to do is have the flexibility to move our 
resources where they are necessary thornburgh said

leona helmsley wrote off jade figurines worth 
500000 an outdoor sound system patterned after one at disney 
world and other household purchases as business expenses to avoid 
taxes a prosecutor charged wednesday 
in opening arguments at her federal trial on tax evasion 
conspiracy and extortion charges mrs helmsleys attorney asked 
jurors not to hold her personality against her 
mrs helmsley 69 and her husband harry head a 5 billion real 
estate and hotel empire 
the couple acted as if they were above the law said 
assistant us attorney james devita they used their position in 
society to evade one of the most important responsibilities to 
pay their fair and accurate share of taxes 
helmsley 80 indicted in april 1988 with his wife was dropped 
as a defendant in the us district court trial after being found 
mentally incompetent 
mrs helmsley is on trial with former helmsley hotel executive 
frank turco and joseph licari who was a top aide to harry helmsley 
devita said that in addition to charging the renovation of the 
couples greenwich conn mansion to helmsleycontrolled companies 
mrs helmsley used her hotels and businesses as a personal piggy 
bank for other purchases 
he said these included everything from a 45000 silver clock for 
her husband right down to her shoes and underwear 
devita also detailed instances when mrs helmsley yelled at 
employees and had them fired if they did not not go along with the 
scheme 
mrs helmsleys attorney gerald feffer downplayed the charge 
mrs helmsley did not pay 1 million in federal taxes from 1983 to 
1985 he said the helmsleys paid 578 million in federal state and 
local taxes during that time 
feffer told the jury he would prove helmsley companies were 
entitled to pay part of the cost of renovating decorating and 
operating the mansion which the helmsleys bought for 11 million in 
1983 
feffer also addressed the issue of mrs helmsleys personality 
which he said would be a critical part of the case 
they are going to try to get you to hate her by the end of the 
trial he said adding that prosecutors would try to prejudice the 
jury by giving details of the helmsleys extravagant lifestyle 
in the united states we dont put people in jail for being 
unpopular feffer said 
he said mrs helmsley has a mania for running the best hotels 
in the world if she should stumble on a speck of dust or god 
forbid a roach in a hotel room mrs helmsley will blow up 
mrs helsmley appears in national advertisements billing her as 
the queen of the helmsley hotels 
during devitas arguments mrs helmsley shook her head no 
several times and her face became red she jotted notes on a legal 
pad 
devita said the helmsleys avoided paying for the estates 
renovation by submitting phony invoices and records to make it 
appear the expenses were incurred by 19 companies in their empire 
he said the cost of enclosing one of two swimming pools at the 
mansion and installing a marble dance floor on its roof was 2 
million half of which was paid for by helmsley companies 
he said a sound system that piped music to a gazebo and barbecue 
pit was installed after mrs helmsley admired a similar one at 
disney world devita called it a musical paradise underwritten in 
part by uncle sam 
the two jade figurines bought from a dealer for 500000 were 
charged to four hotels and listed on the invoices as antique 
furniture devita said

ethnic albanians in kosovo province 
the measure adopted by the house of representatives last week 
expresses concern over the state of human rights in yugoslavia 
especially in kosovo where a state of emergency was introduced in 
february to quell ethnic unrest 
loncar told zimmermann the human rights situation here was shown 
in a false and biased way according to the state tanjug news

nationalist and separatist elements in kosovo and is contrary to 
american statements in support of the territorial integrity of 
yugoslavia

nearly 150 panamanian paramilitary 
troopers blocked the entrance to a large us army base on wednesday 
to protest what they called lack of respect by the united states 
for panama 
no incidents occurred during the nearly one hour that members of 
the so called dignity battalion blocked the entrance to fort 
clayton home of brig gen mark cisneros commander of us army 
south 
earlier wednesday the foreign ministry accused the us army of 
provocations and intimidation through weekend military maneuvers 
in civilian areas near the panama canal 
cisneros said he ordered the exercises and they would continue 
his forces are in charge of defending the canal 
the development was the latest in the confrontation between 
washington and the government controlled by gen manuel antonio 
noriega commander of the defense forces 
noriega is under us indictment on drug trafficking charges 
which he denies the united states also accuses him of domestic 
repression and considers him a possible threat to the canal 
the dignity battalion was formed and trained by the defense 
forces and is made up of civilians who support the forces and 
noriega 
its members carrying panamanian flags and chanting antiamerican 
slogans stood blocking the access roads leading to the main gate of 
the base 
the group commander benjamin colamarco and others went to the 
gate and delivered a letter to provost marshal maj alan mansfield 
he urged them to clear the area because you are violating the 
panama canal treaties 
you do not represent an authority in panama colamarco 
replied 
mansfield then talked to lt johnny rivera a panamanian who is 
the liaison officer with the us forces 
rivera told him he understood that they want a letter delivered 
to cisneros 
the letter has been delivered mansfield said 
minutes later the protesters left 
just inside the gate us soldiers in riot gear stood ready to 
intervene 
the us government says that under the canal treaties of 1977 
signed by president jimmy carter and the late panamanian dictator 
omar torrijos us forces can travel freely on panamanian roads and 
carry out training exercises in designated areas near the canal to 
prepare for their mission

labor costs rose more slowly last year in the 
united states than in all but one of the nations 11 major economic 
competitors the labor department said 
the rise in us labor costs 03 percent from 1987 to 1988 
was dwarfed by such increases as 17 percent in taiwan and 112 
percent in south korea 
of the 11 competitors only france bettered the us performance 
recording a decline of 08 percent the bureau of labor statistics 
said 
while american workers were still earning more than employees in 
most of the other countries the fall in the value of the dollar 
meant that a japanese worker was catching up fast to his us 
counterparts 
the average japanese worker cost the employer 1314 an hour in 
1988 a 105 percent increase over 1987 the average in the united 
states was 1390 
in eight western european countries the costs were already 
higher than in the united states 1943 in norway for example and 
1807 in west germany 
in south korea however the cost of an average hours labor was 
only 245 and in taiwan 271 
that is an employer could hire more than five taiwanese or south 
korean workers for the cost of hiring one american this helps 
explain why some factories have moved production lines out of the 
united states to those pacific rim countries 
not all labor costs go to workers as wages the labor department 
figures include employer contributions to private plans and payroll 
taxes for social services such as pensions and health care from 
which workers benefit these expenses are generally higher in 
western europe than in the united states and higher in the united 
states than in the countries on the pacific rim 
here are the percentage changes for each of the 12 countries 
surveyed increases for all but france the bureau did not give the 
1988 cost for an hours labor in all the increases are bases on 
costs measured in dollars because of exchangerate fluctuations 
the percentages might be different for costs measured in local 
currencies 
taiwan 17 percent britain 118 percent south korea 112 
percent canada 109 percent japan 105 percent sweden 79 
percent denmark 34 percent italy 29 percent west germany 18 
percent the netherlands 1 percent the united states 03 percent

gov bob martinez will call a special 
legislative session to take advantage of the us supreme court 
decision allowing states to place more restrictions on abortions he 
announced wednesday 
now we have to balance the rights of the unborn with the 
rights of the mother said the republican governor a staunch 
abortion foe 
the special session will come no later than a previously 
scheduled legislative meeting in october to consider transportation 
and growth management issues and could be sooner martinez said 
i dont believe we ought to wait until 1990 to deal with a 
difficult subject martinez said later in tallahassee its not 
something thats going to go away its something that must be dealt 
with 
martinez met wednesday night with eight antiabortion activists 
and lawmakers 
he said in miami beach that he was pleased that the supreme 
court in modifying the roe vs wade ruling that legalized 
abortions also seemed to reinforce states rights 
before the ruling state house speaker tom gustafson had said 
abortion should be dealt with in a special session so that it 
doesnt dominate next springs regular session 
senate president bob crawford was on vacation and could not be 
reached for comment but an aide said lawmakers would not be able to 
avoid the highly emotional topic 
under florida law abortions are allowed during the first six 
months of a pregnancy but prohibited in the last three months unless 
a doctor certifies that the abortion is necessary to protect the 
mothers life state medicaid money can only be spent for an 
abortion when the mothers life is threatened 
floridas parental consent law which is not being enforced 
because of a lawsuit pending is one of the strictest abortion 
standards in the country us sen bob graham said 
that law requires unmarried minors to get permission from their 
parents or a judge before having an abortion supporters of the law 
contend it protects the fetus and the right of parents to supervise 
their children 
several state legislators didnt need time to reach decisions 
about mondays supreme court ruling within hours of the high 
courts ruling state rep tom banjanin filed a bill that would 
enact many of the restrictions the high court allowed 
but the house and senate committees most likely to consider 
abortion legislation are chaired by prochoice advocates who have 
vowed to weaken restrictive measures before they reach the floor of 
either chamber 
state sen eleanor weinstock chairman of the senate health and 
rehabilitative services committee said she would try to kill any 
legislation that would further restrict abortion 
i am not supportive of any change in the law whatsoever said 
state rep steve press chairman of the house hrs committee i am 
firmly behind the roe vs wade decision i see no reason why the 
state should get involved in changing that 
charlene carres a lobbyist for the american civil liberties 
union said the abortion issue would make martinez and legislators 
vulnerable in the 1990 elections 
both sides are going to say to every member of the legislature 
youre either with us or your against us carres said

williams sr in the summer of 1952 
johnson said his client was away from her home wednesday and was 
unaware of the ruling 
he estimated the royalties from songs such as your cheatin 
heart kowliga and i saw the light are worth at least a 
half million a year and maybe close to a million a year 
richard frank a nashville attorney representing williams 
publishers said the ruling was complicated by an earlier federal 
court ruling in new york that rejected mrs adkinsons claim to a 
share of the copyright royalties 
johnson said the case must go back to montgomery county circuit 
court for settlement but anticipated ms adkinson would get 
onethird of the estate which has been controlled by williams son 
from his first marriage country music entertainer hank williams jr 
and the second wife of williams sr 
williams died on jan 1 1953 his daughter was born five days 
later and because of an agreement the country singer had with ms 
jett the child was raised by williams mother lillian stone until 
her death on feb 26 1955 
williams sister irene smith had originally agreed to take the 
child if something happened to mrs stone but changed her mind and 
the child was placed for adoption by the state welfare agency the 
supreme court said 
on april 23 1959 the child known as cathy yvonne stone was 
adopted by george and mary deupree of mobile who according to 
court records wanted to conceal her past and declined efforts by an 
attorney to have the child involved in the settlement of her 
fathers estate in 196768 
while a student at the university of alabama mrs adkinson 
became aware she might have a famous father she started seeking 
closed court records about her paternity 
hank williams jr filed a lawsuit in 1985 to keep the court 
records secret prompting a long legal battle 
mrs adkinson won a lower court ruling that she was the daughter 
of hank williams sr but the court said she could not inherit the 
supreme court reversed that part of the ruling but said she could 
inherit only from the time she made the complaint in 1985

ceasefire in the war with the peoples liberation army and proposed 
a general amnesty 
the amnesty would apply to the 5000060000 rebels who have 
taken up arms against the government since the rebellion led by 
turncoat army col john garang began in three southern provinces 
bashir said that on thursday a military delegation would be sent 
to the rebels southern headquarters in addis ababa ethiopia for 
talks with garang 
staterun television quoted bashir as telling reporters his peace 
measures proved his june revolution was serious in seeking a 
paeceful settlement for the war 
also wednesday the junta agreed to allow relief operations to 
continue in the south the sudan news agency quoted bashir as 
telling an army rally in gabal awlia south of this capital 
both sides stilled their guns in may and june in response to a 
unilateral ceasefire proposed by garang to allow the united nations 
to move 120000 tons of relief supplies to the south to ward off 
famine this summer 
despite bashirs repeated peace vows spokesmen for the sudan 
peoples liberation army have refrained from comment saying they 
were closely watching developments in khartoum

the new military leadership which has lowered the prices of basic

suspected leftist guerrillas wednesday bombed a 
bus carrying sailors from a soviet fishing fleet on shore leave in 
lima injuring 20 seamen police said 
the 12pound bomb exploded as the 49 fishermen were boarding the 
bus after leaving a handicrafts store according to police and 
witnesses eight were in serious condition with injuries and burns 
on their lower bodies police said 
no group claimed responsibility for the bombing but police said 
it had the characteristics of an attack by the shining path a 
leftwing guerrilla group that has targeted soviet diplomats and 
citizens in the past 
police also blamed the rebels for the deaths of six people they 
said were killed in three attacks tuesday in the region around 
huancavelica a mining town in the central andes about 150 miles 
southeast of lima police said the dead included an engineer for the 
state electrical company and two women traveling in his truck a 
village mayor a peasant and his mother 
gen oswaldo diaz salvador the lima police chief said two young 
men were seen placing a package under the bus carrying the soviets 
and then racing off as the bomb exploded he said the police were 
seeking four people in connection with the bombing 
two smaller buses each carrying 35 soviet fishermen were 
damaged by the midmorning explosion police said but all of the 
injured were on the larger bus a group of 66 soviets had just left 
the area to sightsee in downtown lima 
the buses are owned by a tourism service company 
the explosion also damaged the threestory building where the 
fishermen had been shopping at a store that caters exclusively to 
soviets 
an agreement between peru and the soviet union allows 20 soviet 
trawlers to fish in peruvian waters in exchange for a percentage of 
the catch the fleet uses the port of callao five miles west of 
lima as a resupply point 
when their vessels are in port the fishermen often take shopping 
trips and a number of stores have opened that cater exclusively to 
the russianspeaking clients 
on june 3 shining path guerrillas blew up a bus carrying palace 
guards to a ceremony in downtown lima killing six people 
in 1986 a shining path guerrilla was killed when the bomb he 
carried after breaking into the grounds of the soviet embassy 
exploded also in 1986 soviet fishermen were injured when a bomb 
went off in a store in callao 
the shining path which follows the ideology of mao tsetung 
views the soviet government as a traitor to marxist theory it 
regards the soviets as enemies because they have been a major 
supplier of arms to peru for the past two decades 
the shining path has been fighting to topple perus elected 
government since 1980 more than 15000 people including police 
soldiers rebels and civilians have died in the violence

a military judge on wednesday 
ordered a bad conduct discharge and suspended sentence for a navy 
deserter who led a normal life for two decades without revealing his 
past 
i couldnt ask for anything more said charles smith 43 a 
seaman apprentice who walked away from his post at treasure island 
in september 1969 after being ordered to report to an alaskan 
outpost 
although it was the vietnam era smith said it was a marriage 
gone sour and resentment of authority rather than politics that made 
him desert they gave me a lot of harassment smith said his 
18month tour were even now 
smith who pleaded guilty during his courtmartial was sentenced 
to four months in the brig suspended reduced to the lowest rank 
and ordered to forfeit 1000 in navy pay 
if he does not violate any laws for a year the brig time will be 
lifted 
smith who kept his name and lived less than 10 miles from the 
base during his desertion was among the longest of the navys 
recent cases 
because of a new enforcement program desertions dropped from 
14000 in 1987 to 2485 said lt cmdr kaye roberts head of the 
navy deserter apprehension program in washington dc 
smith faced up to one year for desertion life imprisonment for 
unauthorized absence and two years for using marijuana detected by 
urinalysis after his may 3 surrender said his attorney howard 
denike of san francisco 
prosecutor lt dennis hoffman portrayed smith as a problem 
child who never grew up but smiths employer and the pastor of 
his church testified he was a dependable worker and family man 
community groups and his current wife mary who said she knew 
nothing of the desertion gathered 600 signatures from smiths 
friends business associates and others asking that smith get only 
an administrative discharge 
mary smith said she was overwhelmed by the sentence and 
called it especially important when youve had somebody whos been 
a constructive member of society 
smith even garnered support from a veterans organization with 
members from every us war and major conflict since the 1930s the 
group asked the military to grant smith clemency 
smith turned himself after getting a 5 am call from navy 
investigators who tracked him through a routine credit check after 
several days in the brig smith has reported daily to treasure 
island for duty on a maintenance unit 
he is likely to be placed on leave without pay within a few weeks 
and then discharged that means the government probably wont get 
the 1000 he was ordered to forfeit because it was to be taken out 
of his next four monthly paychecks 
in a previous interview smith said he had considered turning 
himself in several times but it was hard i had a new life 
wife kids and i couldnt risk that 
i didnt want to hide he said i just wanted to put 
everything behind me and get on with my life 
smiths desertion meant he severed ties with his first wife a 
son his parents and a sister who at the time lived in ohio he has 
not talked to them since and never obtained a divorce from his first 
wife 
denike said smith deserted because he believed his first wife was 
unfaithful and because he resented the rigidity of military life 
smith enlisted in march 1968 and left the service without 
permission twice before his final desertion 
he remarried in 1975 had five children bought a suburban house 
in san pablo and became active in the local episcopal church he 
also worked 12 years as a manager at kardum paint co of san 
francisco where he earned 24000 yearly smith has been earning 
750 a month at his navy job 
denike said he assumes smiths first wife either annulled the 
marriage or received a divorce 
because he left during what the military technically considered 
wartime there is no statute of limitations to the charges congress 
never declared war in the vietnam conflict but the military 
previously ruled in desertion cases that wartime laws apply said 
denike 
the record for navy deserters who turned themselves in belongs to 
a nowdeceased sailor who jumped ship in 1926 and turned himself in 
to navy authorities last year said lt cmdr roberts who would not 
reveal the mans identity 
the longest unresolved desertion case involves a sailor who left 
his base in 1962 she added

the opposition celebrated its first victory in 
a governors race after the institutional revolutionary party 
conceded defeat in baja california but said wednesday the ruling 
party was trying to cheat elsewhere 
the party known as the pri for its spanish initials has 
controlled the federal and state governments since its founding in 
1929 and had never conceded the loss of a gubernatorial election 
because of election fraud charges leveled against the pri for 
decades even its opponents said the party may have won more by 
losing in baja one of five states that voted sunday than it would 
have gained through victory 
this brings change to the sociopolitical reality not only in 
baja california but in all of mexico because it inspires confidence 
in their officials said ernesto ruffo who won the governorship 
for the national action party known by its initials pan 
ruffo said from his hometown of ensenada his victory was a step 
toward greater citizen participation in public decisions but pan 
president luis h alvarez said the pri was trying to cheat in the 
state legislature 
he said ruffo cannot govern encircled surrounded and pressured 
by an illegitimate legislature controlled by the pri alvarez 
addressed a rally outside the federal senate building in mexico city 
president carlos salinas de gortari was inaugurated dec 1 with a 
weak mandate because of his narrow victory in an election marred by 
fraud 
he won respect with efforts to revive the economy and fight 
endemic fraud and corruption but many viewed sundays state 
elections as a test of his intentions 
a mexico city shopkeeper who voted against salinas last year said 
he was impressed by the presidents performance and was willing to 
go back to the pri but only if it lost baja a pan stronghold 
pri officials claimed victory for candidate margarita ortega 
after the polls closed sunday night but appeared to back off in 
succeeding days party chairman luis donaldo colosio announced the 
concession late tuesday and official results are expected sunday 
it marks the beginning of a new step in the political life of 
the country a presidential spokeswoman said wednesday speaking 
privately 
pan figures showed ruffo winning by 204690 votes to 151099 
with ballots from 1073 of the 1168 polling booths counted 
the wellorganized conservative party made a major effort in 
baja where there is less opportunity for fraud at isolated 
countryside polling stations because most people live in a few 
cities near the us border 
party representatives obtained the official counts for most 
voting stations and roving squads of poll watchers were sent to 
trouble spots by radio 
crowds of pan supporters waving banners and beeping car horns 
celebrated into the morning hours in the baja california cities of 
mexicali tijuana and ensenada where ruffo served as mayor 
the pri was claiming mayoral victories in tijuana mexicali and 
tecate and a narrow majority in the state legislature it said 
there were voting irregularities on both sides but not serious 
enough to affect the results 
well have to learn how to live together in a new political 
relationship a federal government official said privately they 
have to learn how to govern we have to learn how to share power 
pan and the salinas administration have similar positions on many 
issues both are strongly against corruption and support free market 
economics 
in michoacan a western state the leftist democratic 
revolutionary party claimed it was being cheated of victory in state 
assembly elections colosio the pri chairman said his party was 
leading in 11 of 18 assembly districts 
ricardo pascoe pierce a spokesman for the leftist party said 
if they respect the vote in baja california and not in michoacan 
the pri would be trying to divide the opposition as well as the 
nations hope for democracy pri candidates won handily in state 
legislative elections in campeche and zacatecas the party claimed 
victory in chihuahua but the pan disputed that 
gubernatorial legislative and municipal elections were held in 
baja legislative and municipal in chihuahua and legislative in 
michoacan zacatecas and campeche 
most newspapers hailed the pri concession in baja california 
including the usually unsympathetic la jornada 
after saying we shouldnt applaud someone who simply complies 
with a duty dictated by the rules of competitive democracy la 
jornada added that the pri came out ahead because the defeat was 
such a contrast to its reputation for fraud

gov mario cuomo saying the us supreme 
court follows a lower standard promised his continued support 
wednesday for medicaid funding in new york to pay for poor womens 
abortions 
thus far efforts to eliminate such abortion funding from new 
yorks state budgets have failed 
democrat cuomo a roman catholic said nothing in the courts 
monday decision changes my opinion about the right to abortion or 
the right of poor people to receive funding 
it was cuomos first statement on the supreme courts ruling on 
the missouri case webster v reproductive health services where the 
divided top court upheld missouris attempt to place more 
restrictions on abortions 
new york states abortion law one of the most liberal in the 
country allows abortions during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy and 
after that if a womans life is in danger 
despite personally opposing abortion cuomo has included in his 
budget each year medicaid funds that can be used by poor women to 
pay for abortions cuomo whos said poor women shouldnt be denied 
abortions that others can pay for said hell continue the practice 
in his 1990 budget proposal 
in this case as in the case of the death penalty where the 
supreme court would allow us to execute children and the mentally 
retarded we in new york will choose what we believe to be a higher 
and better way cuomo said in a statement distributed by aides 
cuomo said he will oppose the inevitable attempt by some 
legislators to deny fairness to poor people because the supreme 
court follows a lower standard 
cuomo also said hed oppose any attempts to put any other 
limitations enumerated in the webster decision into state law such 
as a prohibition against abortions being held in public hospitals 
but he would not say how he would act if presented with a bill 
requiring parental consent if minors seek abortions 
the governor said both the strongest supreme court supporter of 
the 1973 roe v wade decision legalizing abortion justice harry 
blackmun and the most outspoken critic justice antonin scalia 
both said the webster decision breaks no legal ground 
antiabortion lawmakers in both the republicancontrolled senate 
and democraticcontrolled assembly already have said they will 
attempt again next year to remove medicaid funding from the budget 
such moves have repeatedly failed in the past

a nonperson for 35 years milovan 
djilas yugoslavias bestknown dissident is freely speaking his 
mind again claiming the nations communist system is a failure and 
calling for a multiparty democracy 
such views once landed him in prison for nine years 
now interviews with the 78yearold former vice president are 
published in widely read magazines and other publications 
the official communist party newspaper borba has carried 
djilas interviews in several installments ironically it was his 
writing in borba in the early 1950s that led to his expulsion from 
the party and banishment from public life 
calls are growing for the rehabilitation of other prominent 
figures such as former secret police chief aleksandar rankovic who 
also was purged by president josip broz tito during his unchallenged 
rule from 1945 until his death in may 1980 
yugoslavia is now reappraising some of titos policies and trying 
to shake off the legacy of the man who built one of the strongest 
personality cults of the communist world 
since titos death the feeling has grown among yugoslavs that 
most of the countrys deep economic and political problems took root 
during his rule yugoslavia has a 191 billion foreign debt a 
650percent inflation rate and 17percent unemployment 
there is little doubt that calls for the rehabilitation of djilas 
and others are thinly disguised attempts to discredit some of titos 
policies 
the weekly newsmagazine danas of zagreb titled its june 6 cover 
story the second death of josip broz 
as we approach the 10th anniversary of titos passing away the 
entire country is going through the drama of his second death the 
story said 
the magazine quoted slavoj zizek a slovenian philosopher as 
saying we have to distinguish between titos physical death and 
the symbolic death of titos political being whats happening today 
is the end of titos yugoslavia 
tito left yugoslavia with a highly decentralized system of 
collective leadership with diluted responsibilities the presidency 
for example rotates among leaders of its six peoples republics 
yugoslavias democratic and economic development largely 
depends on our ability to free ourselves from the tito cult 
djilas said in an interview with the belgrade weekly nin in may 
if titos reign had been shorter there would have been much 
fewer doubts cast on his merits 
before his fall djilas had been titos heir apparent djilas 
says tito certainly had historic merits such as steering yugoslavia 
away from the soviet bloc but he maintained that the countrys 
political and economic system has failed 
titoism has failed djilas said in a recent interview with 
the associated press the only problem is how to proclaim its 
finished 
speaking about his own rehabilitation he said it was a symptom 
of the end of titoism or its even better to say the end of 
leninist and stalinist models of politics and economy 
djilas disillusionment with communism made him the godfather of 
eastern european dissidents his bestknown book the new class 
exposed the abuse of power by communist leaders it was published in 
the west but never in yugoslavia

olive drab helmet cpl tami pressed her ears and winced at the 
detonation of a small plastic explosive she had rigged moments 
earlier 
the 19yearold soldier is one of scores of women who are being 
trained to take over army jobs that had once been reserved for men 
army commanders say the objective is to free more men for duty in 
fighting the palestinian uprising that began 18 months ago 
israeli women who according to foreign estimates make up about 
onequarter of the armys 130000 regular soldiers have served in 
the armed forces since israels beginning 
women are drafted at age 18 for two years duty while men serve 
three years and remain in the reserves until age 49 women are 
banned from combat duty and have been serving as typists clerks and 
telephone operators 
a change has come about however as more and more soldiers are 
being assigned riotcontrol duties to confront the uprising in the 
west bank and gaza strip 
commanders estimate hundreds of women are being trained in combat 
techniques to become instructors of males in such areas as 
sharpshooting the use of explosives chemical warfare and driving 
tanks 
some women also serve in the occupied territories as 
behindthelines operations officers or noncommissioned staff who 
help coordinate military actions and occasionally go on patrol 
it is part of a change in our society there is now more value 
placed on women soldiers brig gen hedva almog commander of the 
womens corps told reporters during a tour of a west bank army base 
that could not be named 
the concept of moving women into combat training has evolved over 
the past decade largely out of a need to put more men on the front 
lines of israels pressing conflicts in the occupied territories and 
along the northern border with lebanon 
the process lately has been accelerated by the palestinian 
rebellion which has put new manpower demands on the army 
defense minister yitzhak rabin has estimated an average 10000 
soldiers were on duty in the occupied lands last year several times 
the preuprising level 
little by little there has been an increase in the number of 
women being recruited into the army and a lack of manpower has led 
the army to find solutions such as these said almog 
palestinian men and women harvested wheat only 100 yards from the 
base fence where about a dozen women demonstrated battle skills 
three 19 and 20yearold women maneuvered a tank into position 
and pounded a hillside with artillery shells another showed some 
privates how to hit the bullseye on a target 300 yards away using 
a telescope and a sharpshooting m14 rifle 
cpl tami the demolitions expert practiced securing wires to a 
detonator and exploding a onepound charge made of plastic and a 
substance like putty 
its a great experience she said it sounded like it would 
be dangerous and interesting so i wanted the adventure my mother 
would probably be quite shaken if she ever saw what i did 
she and other soldiers could not be fully identified in keeping 
with army regulations 
initially some of the women had trouble getting the men to take 
orders from them said lt col yaffa a commander of infantrywomen 
but newer male recruits are more open some saying they prefer 
women commanders because they are less strict 
they are more like mothers said pvt shlomo 18 an 
infantryman after a session on an armored personnel carrier 
commanded by a woman sergeant 
israeli feminists have welcomed the armys new attitude toward 
women recruits but are critical of a law barring the women from 
active combat duty they contend it prevents true equality 
almog said women are kept out of combat for three reasons to 
encourage childbearing to keep women from being killed or captured 
and to avoid conflict with some orthodox jews who oppose women 
adopting the role of men 
its a traditional view of women that you have to protect 
them said galia golan a professor of political science at 
jerusalems hebrew university i think women should do real combat 
duty it is that one last bit of prestige that they need 
tami like most of her colleagues said she was not bothered 
about being kept off the battlefield 
i dont really like war she said and i would have to 
think a thousand times if i were involved before i could hurt 
somebody

this land of ancient ruins and sunsplashed 
islands is troubled by its reputation as a country too cozy with 
terrorists 
while greece angrily denies it the image persists with painful 
consequences for tourism its largest industry many american 
tourists who once flocked to its shores now go elsewhere 
its strange that greece has to suffer such accusations said 
costas skouras the secretarygeneral of the greek national tourist 
organization 
lets face reality we know that international terrorism is not 
a new phenomenon and especially air terrorism these incidents can 
happen any time any place 
however the most common complaint is what critics call the loose 
and easy style that premier andreas papandreous socialist 
government demonstrated in dealing with terrorists who come to 
greece after attacks elsewhere the socialists lost their majority 
in elections last month 
in december a palestinian arrested in greece was put on a plane 
to libya although he was wanted in italy for a hand grenade attack 
on romes main synagogue in october 1982 the attack killed a 
2yearold boy and wounded 37 other people 
other countries would give a palestinian terrorist who killed a 
baby the chair the noose or life behind bars greece gave him a 
plane ticket to freedom the antidefamation league of bnai 
brith charged in an advertisement in the new york times 
greece has repeatedly delayed ruling on a us extradition 
request for another palestinian accused of planting a bomb on a pan 
am jetliner 
last year the united states accused greece of allowing the abu 
nidal terror group to open a logistics office in athens in exchange 
for a promise not to launch any attacks in greece 
skouras contends such allegations are unfair and says greece 
often finds itself caught in the middle 
some arab and palestinian countries accuse the israeli mission 
of being a place where many terrorists israeli terrorists are 
hiding he said and they ask our government to give these 
israeli terrorists to the arabs and close the mission 
vassilis fillias a greek sociologist and newspaper columnist 
said one problem is the the widespread propalestinian feeling in 
greece makes it difficult for the government to take a strong stand 
against arabs or palestinians 
although the supreme court approved it papandreous justice 
minister vassilis rotis blocked the extradition of abdel osama 
alzomar the palestinian wanted for the rome attack and whose 
detention in greece may have triggered the massacre of the city of 
poros cruise ship near athens last july terrorists killed nine 
people aboard the ship no one has been arrested for the attack 
rotis explained his decision by saying alzomar was acting in 
the struggle for the reacquisition of his country 
we consider it outrageous justin j finger the associate 
national director of the antidefamation league said in a telephone 
interview from new york if other nations followed greeces 
example it would increase terrorism rather than dampen its 
activity 
italy protested greeces refusal to extradite alzomar and on may 
23 an italian court convicted him in absentia of organizing the 
synagogue attack and sentenced him to life in prison 
skouras contends some allegations against greece are distortions 
aimed at intentionally hurting its tourist industry he declined to 
elaborate except to say i cannot find any other explanation 
except that this country has enemies somewhere perhaps competitors 
in the tourism field or in some other field official government 
figures which tour operators dispute indicate overall tourism 
has increased every year since 1983 last year the figures show 
82 million tourists came leaving greece with almost 25 billion 
in foreign exchange 
the tour operators say the figures are deceiving 
all this terrorism has dramatically affected our business in 
greece said dimitris mantzios the general manager of a large 
greek travel agency with offices in the united states japan and 
canada 
he said his american business has fallen by 50 percent in five 
years there are more europeans and japanese coming to greece but 
he said they dont stay as long or spend as much 
americans spend maybe 2000 while the europeans 500 to 
1000 he said 
andreas potamianos the president of epirotiki lines said 
americans fell from 60 percent of the passengers on his line to just 
3 percent by 1986 
it mainly occurred in 1985 after the hijacking of the twa 
airplane then the united states issued a travel advisory asking 
americans not to come to greece that travel advisory had an immense 
effect he said 
that hijacking june 14 1985 of an athens to rome flight ended 
in beirut where a us navy diver was killed and 38 people were held 
captive for 17 days 
the travel advisory was lifted six weeks later after greece 
increased security at its airports 
but it was lifted in a very silent way and imposed in a very 
pompous way with high publicity complained potamianos when it 
was lifted it was two lines on an inside page 
government statistics indicate 295000 americans traveled to 
greece in 1988 as opposed to the 360000 greece expected and less 
than half the number who came 10 years ago

when savers and investors turn to financial 
professionals for advice they usually look for two words buy 
or sell 
experience shows however that they get far more than that even 
if the words are printed in black and white the vocabulary of 
investment savants is rich in varying shades of gray 
hold is a familiar and often perplexing favorite when 
something isnt good enough to buy what makes it worth hanging onto 
just because you happen to own it 
and if that gives you trouble what to make of accumulate 
buy on weakness switch or use as a source of funds 
faced with such choices newcomers to the challenge of money 
management often grow apprehensive concerned that their ignorance 
will be exposed when the natives see they dont speek the local 
language 
cynics with longer experience on the other hand dismiss much of 
what they hear in this vein as nothing more than mumbojumbo 
the cynics have a point making investment recommendations is a 
hazardous game and those who want to survive in the business for 
long have a natural tendency to protect their flanks 
still in fairness to these advisers they are dealing with 
questions that dont often yield clear yesorno answers for every 
member of their audience and many of the terms they use can be 
translated into everyday english with a little practice 
consider hold for starters a typical definition comes from 
donoghues moneyletter an advisory service that uses a 
buyholdsell system for rating mutual funds 
if a buy fund dips in performance it receives a hold 
signal if your fund becomes a hold dont invest new money in 
that fund but dont sell it either although its no longer a top 
performer it still compares favorably with other funds tracked in 
moneyletter 
for the longterm investor in particular hold is often a 
more sensible idea than either buy or sell 
even if you should succeed in the nighimpossible mission of 
jumping from one hot investment to another at frequent intervals 
you have to consider the tax bills and transaction costs you might 
ring up along the way 
all that having been said many veterans of the financial wars 
still interpret a downgrading of a recommendation from buy to hold 
as an advisers gentle way of steering his or her clients away from 
a given investment 
many other entries in the modern lexicon of investment 
recommendations have evolved with the growing dominance of investing 
institutions 
managers at these funds compete in a shortterm performance derby 
and are much less concerned with taxes or transaction costs than 
individual investors must be because many of them are operating on 
a large scale they also cannot just buy or sell as readily 
as the small investor can 
thus accumulate translates as a sort of tepid buy 
recommendation in a meeting of an investment committee operating 
under legal constraints of prudence use as a source of funds is 
a handy if stuffy way of saying sell this loser as judiciously 
as you can and put the money someplace else 
no matter how you go about translating investment jargon it is 
always important to consider the source if it comes from anybody 
working on commission you have every reason to expect to hear what 
lawyers call dealers talk 
example in a recent midyear commentary from a research official 
at a leading wall street firm stay well diversified in stocks 
bonds and cash but do a little finetuning sell off big 
stockmarket winners and recycle money back into undervalued 
issues 
for a commission broker there is money in selling and money in 
buying but there is no money in hold

proceeding with caution despite chinese 
repression president bush is determined not to tear down bridges to 
beijing believing that ties with the united states though shaken 
may yet be the path to greater economic and political freedom 
hes been facing political pressure for a more forceful us 
policy since the days before the crackdown and massacre in tiananmen 
square but he has resisted demands for tougher sanctions 
thats based on practical judgment as well as philosophy theres 
little chance that the chinese government would change its 
repressive course because of them 
bushs china course fits his broader view of the way the united 
states should deal with economic and political change in the 
communist world he is doing so with care wary of overreaction 
that could court trouble 
bush is applying that guideline as he journeys to poland and 
hungary beginning on sunday 
it is important the united states show its interest in these 
countries that are undergoing change bush said last week you 
dont want to overexhort you dont want to overpromise you dont 
want to rally people to levels of political activity that might 
cause repression 
in an interview with three polish journalists bush repeatedly 
stressed that concern he said he would not seek to inflame would 
not do anything that could provoke crisis 
when students seeking democratic reforms in china first occupied 
tiananmen square bush resisted demands that he speak out forcefully 
in behalf of their demonstrations as well as their goals but he 
said on may 22 that beyond urging the students to peacefully stand 
up for their beliefs he was not going to try to tell them what to 
do bush also urged the chinese government to seek a peaceful 
resolution that would further democracy 
the president said he did not want to exhort the students in a 
way that is going to stir up a military confrontation 
when confrontation came in the bloody crackdown of june 3 bush 
condemned it cut off sales of military equipment barred private 
arms sales barred military and other highlevel visits suspended 
us support of international bank loans to china and left open the 
possibility of further steps 
he stopped short of trade sanctions or a break in diplomatic 
relations 
the chinese government protested those measures as interference 
in domestic affairs but apparently continues to cooperate in us 
intelligencegathering from missile and nuclear monitoring sites 
near the soviet border 
while the administration has not been explicit about that bush 
has said that any president must be concerned about the strategic 
importance of us relations with china 
bush said he will continue to express outrage about the attack 
that ended the demonstrations and the executions that have 
followed but i reiterate also my desire not to do damage to the 
people themselves because i believe that it was contact with the 
united states and others in the west that moved the process of 
economic reform forward and hopefully some day will move the 
process of political reform forward he said 
that has not satisfied congress senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine said the president should speak more forcefully 
about chinese executions which can only be described as organized 
murder terror by a government against its own people seeking to 
intimidate them 
the house voted unanimously on june 29 to toughen us sanctions 
against china an amendment to a foreign aid bill would put into law 
the steps bush took and add suspension of trade and development 
programs a ban on sale of police equipment and a bar against 
transfer of nuclear aterials that might have military application 
the vote was 4180 but it probably doesnt mean much the bill 
was sent to the senate which hasnt started work on the subject so 
it is far from enactment although it did send a message 
i think someone in this government has to speak clearly on 
behalf of the american people and take more forceful action than the 
president and the secretary of state have been to date willing to 
take said house majority leader richard gephardt dmo rep 
william broomfield rmich said the chinese should be aware that 
there is a deepseated revulsion in congress to what they have 
done 
but bush who spent 16 months as us representative to china in 
1974 and 1975 noted after the crackdown that the chinese 
historically have been less than totally interested in what other 
countries think of their performance 
richard m nixon who as president opened us relations with 
china said a policy of reprisal would only isolate the chinese 
regime 
lashing back with punitive policies would be politically 
popular and emotionally satisfying for the great majority of the 
american people he said such policies would make us feel 
better 
but he said they wouldnt have any impact on the hardliners who 
hold power in china

john rhysdavies one of the most successful 
of all cinematic chameleons plays a rare english role in a new 
miniseries based on charles dickens great expectations 
rhysdavies is joe gargery the gentle giant of a blacksmith in 
this victorian tale of the creation and destruction of a snob the 
sixhour miniseries which follows young pips sudden fortune and 
his effort to become a gentleman will be seen this sunday monday 
and tuesday on the disney channel 
the englishborn actor is virtually a multinational cast all by 
himself he is perhaps best known as sala the arabic friend of 
archaeologist indiana jones in the movie series that began with 
raiders of the lost ark and is currently on the screens with 
indiana jones and the last crusade 
the nationalities of other characters rhysdavies has played 
include indian kim portuguese shogun russian the 
living daylights and irish the little match girl in nbcs 
upcoming desperado movie hes english again 
rhysdavies like another english actor peter ustinov is quite 
good with accents and has the sort of face that takes on the look of 
whatever national accent is he using 
sala is an arab and i give him an english accent with a touch 
of his native egypt he said steven spielberg the director 
says he listens to gilbert and sullivan hes more british than the 
british 
rhysdavies said he sees joe gargery as a holy fool who is not 
wholly foolish 
the miniseries also stars anthony hopkins as magwitch jean 
simmons as miss havisham and anthony calf as pip it was filmed on 
location in england in the sites where dickens set the story 
its a thankless task to play pip because there are many times 
when we dont like him he said he behaves badly of course we 
in the audience never show any snobbishness and we never make 
judgments based on appearances the growth of pip is a painful 
process in which he ends up sadder but wiser 
everybody in the piece has an ax to grind with the possible 
exception of joe gargery hes the character that dickens fell in 
love with which gave him a problem because dickens wrote it in 
weekly installments as a serial he began by making gargery a figure 
of fun and saddling him with a nagging wife 
as the story progressed dickens changed gargery and eventually 
killed off his wife and had him remarry biddy 
rhysdavies has a home in los angeles but between work he 
retreats to the isle of man in the irish sea he has a 16thcentury 
house named ballateare where he can see ireland and scotland from 
his bedroom window the stone house is on the edge of a crumbling 
cliff and he hopes to postpone its inevitable destruction by about 
60 years 
i bought it because i wanted to write a film about a man who 
buys a house and tries to stop the sea from taking it he said 
its a metaphor for coming to terms with time and growing older 
it should be rather sad and rather funny 
he said he finds the island home an idyllic place to rest and to 
write i started out wanting to be a playwright he said ive 
written a few films 
he has two sons ben who attends the university of california at 
berkeley and thomas who is in school in england 
although he does a lot of television he has yet to do a series 
if the writing was good id do it he said im not proud and 
i like working id just want time off each year to do a film of my 
own were now in the early talk stage of doing a pilot 
asked if there will be another indiana jones movie he smiled 
its hard to turn down those numbers he said harrison 
ford says hes getting too old for that sort of thing theyve very 
demanding physically but harrison is rather fond of the character 
and with the right story and the right director he might do one 
more steven spielberg has said he will not direct another one

compared with a couple of decades ago americans 
know a lot more about consumer rights and such marketplace 
complications as warranties variable interest rates hidden charges 
and poor labeling 
but they might not be much better off markets change especially 
financial markets and some of todays products and techniques are 
beyond the comprehension of anyone who doesnt make a career of 
keeping abreast 
in effect it creates in some marketplace areas the identical 
problem that two decades of legislation and education have sought to 
correct ie an information and knowledge gap between professional 
sellers and amateur buyers 
the situation exists despite various studies supporting the view 
that product quality especially among manufactured items is 
probably higher today than it has been at any time since world war 
ii 
that might or might not be true of investments but what is 
completely clear is that never before in history have investors been 
challenged by more sophisticated products aggressive marketing 
techniques and high technology 
a study by the american association of retired persons observes 
that many people today are firsttime investors neophytes whose 
previous savings patterns were restricted to passbook savings 
accounts or us savings bonds 
these days however they are in common stocks and mutual funds 
and if not already may soon be in taxfree municipals treasury 
bond options commodities futures time sharing currencies condos 
franchises and mineral rights 
and more as they grow older they might be faced with 
understanding reverse home mortgages pensions annuities estate 
law and inheritance taxes while trying to keep abreast of changes 
and proposals regarding social security 
the aarps public policy institute which recently studied the 
situation estimates investment fraud now costs 1 billion a year 
it blames not just lax regulation or investor indifference but 
marketing techniques and technology 
magazines and newspapers television computer software and 
specialized newsletters promote enticing opportunities and provide 
more information than could ever be assimilated by the average 
private investor it says 
the widespread use of 800 numbers and wats lines has it says 
made it economically feasible to telephone large lists of 
prospects and keep them on the phone at little expense until a sale 
is consummated 
it adds that the widespread use of the credit card in telephone 
sales has also had an impact on the investment market 
it claims that with some 2333 million visa mastercard and 
american express accounts in force at the end of 1987 the major 
credit card issuers have embarked on an aggressive marketing 
strategy to produce even more 
this strategy it says includes increased emphasis on telephone 
sales with payment via credit card already coins land and 
precious metals are marketed by phone with the buyers credit card 
number used for billing 
it comments this type of sale has become so popular that 
credit card companies report signed credit card slips as almost a 
thing of the past 
the aarp says it is especially concerned because older people 
seem to be targets of aggressive marketing 
many older americans it says find themselves with large sums of 
cash due to the sale of residences or because of cash payments on 
life insurance policies widows may be forced to make financial 
decisions for the first time in their lives many such people it 
says have a tendency to seek advice and assistance when making 
decisions making them prey to aggressive sellers 
it adds that not all the misrepresentation is by fringe 
operators claiming files of the securities and exchange commission 
show fraudulent investments are sometimes peddled by brokers working 
for new york stock exchange firms

the leader of reform judaism says its strategy 
should not be fashioned with an eye toward possible orthodox 
approval or criticism 
our forebears did not forge reform judaism to have us trade it 
in for a tinsel imitation of orthodoxy said rabbi alexander 
schindler president of the union of american hebrew congregations 
cautioning against being frightened by those who counsel us to 
retreat from some of our recent innovations lest we break jewish 
unity he said at the annual meeting of the central conference of 
american rabbis 
let us not become sycophants truckling for favor by becoming 
what we are not we would only demean ourselves and lose our 
distinctive character

usually be trotted out

crews chip away old paint and hack at 
kneehigh weeds at the abandoned chilocco indian school seemingly 
unaffected by the tempest brewing in this remote corner of oklahoma 
when a california group received state permission for a 75bed 
drug and alcohol treatment center newkirk thought the project on 
the reservation six miles away would solve local economic troubles 
brought on by oil and farming slumps 
but the initial euphoria like the old paint has chipped away 
replaced by distrust frustration even fear 
townspeople say narconon international hasnt been honest about 
its affiliation with the church of scientology its financing its 
medical credentials and its plans for the project which will draw 
mostly outofstate clients 
they say narconon denied the project had anything to do with 
scientology until newkirk officials turned up a scientology magazine 
with a story headlined trained scientologists to staff huge 
oklahoma facility 
and the mayor says narconon tried to dupe locals at a staged 
ceremony where a 200000 check and a glowing study were presented 
to narconon by a group that turned out to be part of narconon itself 
now the town fears it could earn a cult image because of the 
projects ties to scientology which follows the teachings of the 
late science fiction writer l ron hubbard former members have 
accused scientology of fraud and mental abuse and the internal 
revenue service has challenged its taxexempt status as a religion 
people interested in coming to this town will see the church of 
scientology thing the cult thing and i think that that image 
will hurt our possibilities for growth and development mayor 
garry bilger said in an interview last month 
some townspeople say they worry about the kind of people the 
project will attract and that the stately 80building campus built 
of native oklahoma stone and tucked more than a mile off the nearest 
road will become a scientology recruiting station 
i dont think any of us are against drug abusers getting 
rehabilitation said mike clifton pastor of the first christian 
church but theres a lot of concern in the community because we 
really dont know what these folks are exactly about what really 
worries us is what theyre not saying 
in the basement of the first baptist church pastor mark jones is 
making copies of a videotape of a british broadcasting corp 
documentary on scientology which he showed to his congregation at a 
worship service 
the tapes along with scientology literature have been 
circulating in this town of 2400 there have been town meetings and 
public forums including a sometimes heated session with state 
officials who approved the narconon project before the town knew it 
was supported by scientology 
the town got the shaft said insurance agent charles 
eisenhauer i dont think anybody can undo anything thats been 
done so far the center is scheduled to open in september 
narconon officials say newkirks concern is inflated and 
unwarranted narconon is a legitimate worldwide drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation program with 23 years experience and an 86 percent 
success rate they assert 
narconon spokesman gary smith said he tried to reassure the town 
that narconons sole intention is to get people off drugs he 
said the town has been misled 
theres fear being put into the town by false information being 
fed in there by somebody whos in favor of drug abuse theyre 
either connected to selling drugs or theyre using drugs smith 
said 
smith declined to be more specific about the identity or 
whereabouts of these outside sources with criminal motives 
trust me i know he said 
another narconon attempt at persuasion provoked an angry response 
in a letter printed may 18 on the front page of the weekly 
newkirk herald journal narconon president john duff wrote there 
will be those that will not want narconon to succeed at chilocco 
because they are for drugs and are on the other side in the battle 
against drugs 
jones the baptist minister responded the following week 
writing he resented the implication or more accurately the 
accusation that was made by narconons mr duff he accused me of 
supporting illegal drug use in our area if i did not swallow his 
program hook line and sinker 
bilger said he had been so optimistic about the promise of a 
revitalized chilocco that last december he wrote oklahoma health 
officials supporting narconon 
but the mayor said his winter hope turned to disillusionment by 
spring when he learned of narconons history and he came to believe 
he had been misled when narconon held an emotional ceremony april 8 
in which the association for better living and education presented a 
glowing study of narconon and the 200000 check 
later bilger learned that able shared a street address in los 
angeles with narconon and is identified in a scientology magazine 
as part of narconon 
they totally misrepresented what was going on bilger said 
i came away with the impression that we had an independent 
group here interested in mankind and they had researched the 
narconon process then i find out able and narconon are part of the 
same organization he said 
i try to be straightforward and when somebody doesnt do that 
i wonder why 
in late june narconons smith used a copy of bilgers december 
letter of support to suggest to the associated press that the mayor 
supported narconon 
bilger says the december letter no longer reflects his feelings 
i imagine if i was in his shoes id use it too bilger said 
i just think now it narconon is a problem and if all the facts 
were out at the time things might have been done differently 
the chilocco indian school closed in 1980 and was declared 
surplus property by the bureau of indian affairs which turned 
control over to five indian tribes ponca kaw pawnee 
otoemissouria and tonkawa 
last year narconon invited representatives of tribes throughout 
the country to a meeting in clearwater fla narconon touted its 
program and said it was looking for a site for a treatment center 
currently narconons only us inpatient center is a los angeles 
clinic with 12 beds 
a ponca representative told narconon about the chilocco site the 
25year lease eventually drawn up offers the tribes a percentage of 
gross earnings up to 16 million the tribal leadership remains 
enthusiastic about the narconon project 
in january the oklahoma health planning commission gave narconon 
approval for an initial 75 beds the group seeks 150 beds with 
growth projected to 400 
robert lobsinger publisher of the weekly herald journal was by 
then becoming curious about narconon in newkirks tiny library he 
found articles about ties to scientology and past runins with 
officials his first story published april 27 under the headline 
chilocco drug treatment center may be part of notorious religious 
cult set the town abuzz 
townspeople said they have repeatedly asked narconon what medical 
credentials they have and so far have received no answer 
my first question is do they think that everyone down here is 
stupid said jones people around here are not world travelers 
but theyve got a lot of common sense and they ask a lot of 
questions 
weve encountered deceit from the beginning he said there 
have been smoke screens everywhere and there have been flatout 
lies

fine art prices are going going gonzo this 
auction season soaring through the ceiling when the gavel comes 
down but even as the art market booms some experts fear the 
picture may not stay so pretty 
a lot of people are being taken in by this sort of fever 
said george goldner a curator and top buyer at the j paul getty 
museum the nations richest the longer it goes on the more it 
resembles a bubble that one day will burst 
for now the inflation is inescapable as even goldner will 
attest he paid 325 million for a 16th century painting last 
month more than tripling the record for an old master at auction 
and all that glitters is not goldners 
records were set for more than three dozen modern postmodern 
and impressionist painters at sales in may including 479 million 
for a picasso selfportrait an 800 percent increase from its 1981 
price only one painting has done better a van gogh that drew 539 
million in 1987 
an 18 century american bookcase desk sold in may for 121 
million quadrupling the record for a piece of furniture the 
reported buyer was neither museum nor gallery but a texas 
financier robert m bass 
a catskill mountains landscape sold for 825 million tops for 
an old american painting a frederic remington bronze brought 44 
million a new height for american sculpture the birds of 
america etchings by john james audubon sold for 396 million an 
increase of 2 million in less than two years 
such prices are reflected in thousands of lesser sales rippling 
through the art world in a delicious shudder at least for sellers 
sothebys auction house the worlds biggest gaveled off 18 
billion in goods last year up by 400 million from 1987 and this 
year is far bigger 
its awesome its mindboggling said milton esterow 
publisher of artnews magazine art has become an international 
currency the market has exploded its a revolution a renaissance 
like weve never seen before 
but the glee is not universal art experts say the soaring sums 
are pricing many museums out of the market leaving them unable to 
expand or upgrade their collections some say auction hype has 
falsely inflated some prices 
its simple and easy buy something and youll get rich this 
is the message of the auction rooms said goldner its the 
wrong message and people eventually are going to get hurt by it 
there will be a day when the market will shake out and bad modern 
paintings wont be worth what people are paying for them today 
the reason for arts price explosion is simple because of 
worldwide economic good times many people have much more money as 
some of that cash migrated to art prices rose drawing finer art 
to the market and raising prices even higher and 1986 federal tax 
changes limited the benefits of donating art to museums putting 
even more works on the market 
additionally said harvey katz an art market analyst for the 
investment firm salomon brothers inc the auction houses have 
improved their marketing techniques catalogs are less intimidating 
major works are sent on tour before sales bidding is simpler and 
telephone bids are accepted 
as the auction houses have become more accessible theyve 
captured more and more business said katz one result christies 
auction house is rumored as a takeover target and sothebys is 
splitting its stock two for one 
but goldner said auction house promotions can misrepresent the 
value of some pieces particularly costly modern art and he called 
sothebys practice of lending money to buyers a dangerous trend that 
inflates the market and increases the perception of art as a 
speculative commodity 
john marion chairman of sothebys north america maintained that 
buyers still are primarily collectors drawn to certain works not 
investors seeking profit and he said marketing ultimately does 
not create sales 
what weapons do we use to get people into bidding they do 
spend real money marion said sothebys willingness to loan 
buyers some of that money he added is no different from a banks 
loan to a home buyer 
another concern is the art booms effect on public museums many 
of which are finding themselves unable to afford major purchases or 
pressed to sell some works to private buyers which removes the art 
from public view 
such was the case for the walker art center in minneapolis a 
modern art gallery that sold the 825 million catskill landscape 
by frederic edwin church to finance purchases of modern works the 
painting was on loan to the minneapolis institute of art which had 
it on display a dealer bought it 
this was an issue we wrestled with long and hard said erwin 
kelena board member of the walker and its acquisitions committee 
chairman is it our responsibility to keep a 19th century painting 
on public view even if not in our institution or to maximize 
acquisitions for our own collection 
while the latter concern prevailed kelen said the painting 
likely will outlive its new owners and be returned to a museum 
goldner however said he feared the growing concept of art as a 
commodity would work against that outcome 
the sad fact is that a lot of people who call themseves 
collectors today are investors he said and instead of giving 
their collections toward the end of their life to a museum to put on 
display they see their apotheosis as being a successful sale at 
sothebys 
marion for his part is looking forward to sothebys greatest 
sale yet an estate auction next fall that includes 44 paintings 
valued at 1 million or more each including a van gogh a picasso 
and nine monets the total take should easily exceed 100 million 
the fall he said looks to be very very strong

during his protracted battle to corner a 
quarter of the nations poultry market chicken king don tyson drew 
inspiration from a word he scribbled on the mirror in his private 
bathroom 
patience tyson impulsively wrote in black felttip oct 5 
as he battled with conagra inc to absorb rival poultry giant holly 
farms 
the chairman of tyson foods wanted a reminder during the long and 
agonizing takeover war to slow down and analyze developments that 
stood to double the worth of his 2 billion company 
every time i stepped in the bathroom i faced this word the 
59yearold tyson said as he pointed to the looping cursive on the 
mirror 
patience that was the key we were just looking for time 
patience and a sweetened bid paid off june 23 when tyson 
foods and holly farms agreed to a merger deal worth 14 billion on 
july 18 springdalebased tysons is to pay 70 per share for stock 
in holly farms 
if it hadnt been such a perfect fit we would have gone off 
but it was just such a perfect fit with our company productwise and 
geographically tyson said of holly farms which is headquartered 
at memphis tenn 
the combination has prospects for huge profits tyson said since 
the company that bears his name emphasizes wholesale and 
institutional service with some supermarket sales and holly farms 
is a force in grocery stores taking 40 percent of the freshpoultry 
market in new york city and washington dc 
the combination also promises to provide tyson with the chickens 
he needs to keep his company growing at the pace that has raised 
annual revenues from 660 million to 19 billion in five years 
the deal will give tyson 25 percent of the freshpoultry market 
in the united states 
when he first considered uniting with holly farms more than two 
decades ago the numbers were not so impressive tyson had one 
poultry operation in the ozarks and fred lovettes holly farms was 
about the same size 
he was the first one to prepackage poultry and deliver it to 
the supermarket which was a major change tyson said of lovette 
and he was nice enough to show that to me 24 years ago and we 
talked then about maybe our companies should get together 
but the friendly discussion went nowhere nor did conversations 
tyson initiated about six years ago with r lee taylor ii holly 
farms president and chief executive officer 
last summer tyson asked the stephens inc investment banking 
firm at little rock to analyze how the companies might fit 
then i started visiting with lee again when it was obvious we 
werent going to get together friendly we had to tell lee hey 
were going to go to your stockholders and ask them if theyd like 
for us to get together that started this whole process tyson 
said 
the eightmonth fight with conagra to gain control of holly farms 
ranks as one of the nations longestrunning takeover wars 
after the final agreement was reached a janitor at the tyson 
foods corporate complex was allowed to wipe clean her bosss 
bathroom mirror 
last week tyson filled his red mug with coffee and settled into 
a chair at his huge conference table to reflect on the takeover 
im up to my neck in debt he said then laughed and added 
that he has been there before 
all of us are waking up with a better feeling every morning 
said tyson every time we look at this company its better than 
we thought it was when we bought it 
didnt he get upset when his offers were repeatedly spurned by 
the holly farms executives and board 
just privately tyson said because we were trying to 
figure out a strategy and we had a strategy and then it didnt 
work and when the strategy didnt work i was mad at myself 
but then i remembered what my dad told me it costs money to 
get mad 
it also cost money to settle with holly farms other suitor 
whose advances threw a wrench into tysons strategy conagra of 
omaha neb is to get 50 million for its trouble 
taylor who will get 156 million for his holly farms shares 
will not stay on he said something about taking a roundtheworld 
cruise cause hes got enough money to tyson said 
tyson also took it easy after the agreement flying to alaska for 
five days of salmon fishing he said the fishing camp was 45 miles 
from a road and nowhere near a telephone 
julys schedule is filled with meetings to push the merger along 
and accepting bids on two divisions of holly farms rendering and 
flour that tyson plans to sell to raise cash 
tyson who joined his father in the business in 1952 and took 
over the reins in 1967 also will keep looking for acquisitions 
which he compares to his beloved fishing excursions saying 
youve always got your hook in the water 
of course weve got our work cut out for us here for a couple 
of years our boats loaded were going to divest and we have a 
goal by sept 30 of this year that we will pay back 500 million of 
this debt well do that he said 
they asked me how many chickens i wanted i said well 
general motors at one time had 51 percent of the car business and 
i thought that was fair 
im patient

chris isaaks dark and dreamlike music has 
long been a hit with audiences in the san francisco area but 
national fame and a spot on the pop charts have eluded him 
a hit single would be swell says the 32yearold singer and 
songwriter but its not the most important thing 
i like to sing if i had a hit thatd be great isaak says 
id be really overjoyed to have a hit tickled pink but im not 
worried about that im more worried about just keeping my job 
maybe hes not a household word but isaak has a solid reputation 
as someone who borrows the best from countrywestern and rock n 
roll to produce an original sound 
his newly released album heart shaped world is more upbeat 
than earlier efforts and possibly his best guitarist james wilsey 
adds a polished heavily tremoloed background to isaaks 
velvetysoft vocals 
wilsey is largely responsible for the sound that has grabbed the 
attention of critics he has a sharp ear for what works with isaaks 
lyrics but he says a sophisticated computer system is partly 
responsible for the sound he achieves on stage 
this is the bands third album since 1985 and the third time 
observers have said isaak is teetering on the edge of national 
acclaim 
but the man often compared to roy orbison and elvis presley two 
of his many idols has a hard time being serious when describing the 
new album 
this is pretty much me singing a bunch of songs i wrote just 
like the first two albums he said if you liked the first two 
albums this is pretty much the same route if you didnt like the 
first two albums this is all different 
if isaak in person was like the isaak in his music one would 
probably meet a somewhat somber person dressed in black his songs 
often speak of lost or nearly lost love one imagines the 
songwriter sitting in an unlighted room peering out a window at a 
grimy predawn city street 
but the inperson isaak is a regular cutup the stockton 
calif native talks with a slightly goofy rural california accent 
which disappears when he sings and gets a kick out of telling 
stories like the one about how he learned to play guitar by 
sneaking into his older brothers room 
nick isaak had told his younger brother to stay away from his 
prized instrument 
every day it was forbidden but hed go to school and id play 
his guitar id put it back exactly where it belonged the singer 
said one day i was sitting there watching tv i had put the 
guitar back and the string just popped theyll do that sometimes 
i heard it go brrroooiing i thought id been playing it but i 
wasnt playing it right now 
he worked me over pretty good for that one 
then theres the one about how he acquired his first guitar the 
silvertone hes played on all three albums and the inspiration for 
his first bands name hed been eyeballing it every day as he 
walked by a local pawnshop finally he asked his brother for help 
my brother was better at arguing on prices so i said why 
dont you go see if you can get a deal so he called the fire 
department and told them the pawn shop was a fire hazard so they 
had to get rid of a bunch of stuff 
he bought the guitar for 80 
we didnt like the people at that pawn shop anyway theyd 
sold my mother a single guitar string for 4 isaak said 
fans are familiar with isaaks brand of humor he often 
introduces songs with long whimsical tales involving members of the 
band he drives a 1964 nova at a recent record release party at the 
fairmont hotel he showed up in a floralpatterned suit made from 
window drapes 
and for some undisclosed reason isaak thinks tikis are neat he 
keeps dozens of the polynesian idols big and small on his dining 
room table and in his kitchen he even owns a painting of a tiki an 
awful thing that looks like it might have been drawn under the 
influence of mescaline 
but the zaniness doesnt carry over into the music 
isaak has always thought of his style as countrywestern 
however numerous influences are apparent including rockabilly and 
rhythm and blues 
i try not to make things that are too angrysounding he 
said it makes me nervous when i hear music that is just people 
banging away if i listen to it its got to be pretty like bing 
crosby 
i dont like people who cant sing but say ill make records 
despite that fact 
critics often speak of the dark side of isaaks music one deejay 
in washington dubbed him the baron of brood and singles such as 
you owe me some kind of love off his second lp and wicked 
game off the new album exemplify that lonelier side 
as a young man living in stockton a place he describes as 
fresno without all the glitter isaak attended the university of 
pacific and took up boxing but like early ideas of being a 
filmmaker the boxing career petered out he went to japan as a 
transfer student and spent much of his time singing and playing the 
guitar 
isaak came to san francisco in 1980 and later hooked up with erik 
jacobsen who produced his albums and eventually became his manager 
until he met wilsey isaak was the lead guitarist in his band 
jimmy and i met in 1982 i had a threepiece band and he said 
hey let me in i can play guitar better than that 
wilsey who started out running the sound system for isaaks 
first band said he was immediately taken with the budding singer 
i realized he was the funniest person id ever met it was nice 
to hang around him and laugh when other things seemed depressing 
wilsey said 
aside from the music isaak has enjoyed a successful sideline 
career as a film actor hes appeared in two episodes of the tv show 
private eye and had a cameo in jonathan demmes married to the 
mob

coffee bean prices tumbled to their lowest levels 
in eight years in london trading on heavy selling triggered by the 
international coffee organizations announcement that it would 
suspend export quotas 
the news is negative and the immediate reaction very 
predictable said analyst laurence eagles of commodities traders 
gerrard and national intercommodities 
coffee beans for september delivery closed at 1387 a metric ton 
tuesday in london down 98 from mondays final price earlier in 
the day the price fell to 1343 
selling was particularly heavy in london on tuesday because the 
new york market was closed for the fourth of july holiday 
the 74nation organization of coffee consumer and 
producernations announced the suspension of quotas late monday 
after members rejected proposals to extend the existing 
international coffee pact the suspensions took effect at midnight 
the price of coffee which reached this years peak of 1896 a 
ton in january had been falling steadily ahead of mondays 
emergency meeting 
export quotas have been in force since the early 1960s apart 
from a 19month break in 198687 and a sixyear gap in the 1970s 
they are used to keep surplus coffee off the market in an effort to 
balance supply with demand and so maintain the average world price 
above a target minimum of 120 a pound 
with the quotas gone traders predicted a freeforall among 
exporting countries seeking to raise their market shares 
many delegates blamed the organizations failure to reach a new 
deal on the hard line of the united states the main consuming 
nation and the tough position of the 11nation group of mild 
arabica producers largely comprised of central american producers 
not to extend quotas 
singapore was the only other consuming nation besides the united 
states to vote against the extension 
the mild arabica producers led by mexico and costa rica pressed 
for guarantees of a bigger slice of the market before they would 
agree to support an extension of the quotas 
their proposals were backed by the united states but roundly 
defeated when put to a vote 
colombia the worlds secondbiggest producer for which coffee 
represents 40 percent of its export income led the fight to keep 
the coffee agreement and its quota system alive 
colombia has been much more active than brazil the biggest 
producer coffee now generates less than 10 percent of brazilian 
foreign exchange

first city bancorporation of texas is negotiating 
for the sale of the federal deposit insurance corps investment 
interest in the houstonbased bank holding company says chairman a 
robert abboud 
first city and the fdic are seeking to redeem the fdics interest 
or sell it to a third party 
the fdic participated in the 16 billion reorganization of the 
old first city entity in april 1988 by providing 970 million a 
group of investors led by abboud then purchased first city and the 
fdic bought about 2 million shares of the new companys preferred 
stock and a warrant to buy 1 million additional shares until 1993 
that situation has created confusion about the fdics 
relationship with first city abboud said tuesday 
the fdic sought upside profit potential through direct 
investment wholly apart from the assistance package he said 
abboud said the sale of the fdics investment in first city would 
give the company greater expansion flexibility 
he said the fdic would realize a return on its investment of 
about 50 percent if the sale were made now 
the sale of the fdics investment will eliminate all such 
confusion and misperceptions and serve the best interests of all 
concerned first city its shareholders its customers and the 
fdic 
first city operates 20 banks in 62 texas locations and several 
others out of state

university of illinois researchers say 
farmers plants ought to be in pictures and they want to take some 
of the uncertainty out of farmers decisions with the help of 
computer vision technology 
farmers are constantly dealing with problems they cant control 
they plant pray and wait to harvest researcher ken tarbell a 
university of illinois graduate student said recently if we can 
take technology and make their lives less stressful thats what 
were here for 
tarbell and ui agricultural engineer john reid say 
pictureperfect plants photographed and displayed on a computer 
screen may give scientists a better idea of how healthy crops grow 
he said once the system is perfected farmers could take 
photographs of their corn or soybeans at regular intervals feed the 
images into a computer and find out quickly if their crops were 
healthy or sick 
between planting and harvest farmers rely on experience and 
field history to make management decisions said tarbell our 
goal is to give them timely information about their crops 
tarbell selects three plants from his test field every day puts 
them in pots and photographs them in a studio next to a scale that 
helps a computer analyze size and color the color slides are 
transferred to a highresolution computer screen 
one thing the computer studies is the leaf area making its 
calculations much more quickly and accurately than the traditional 
method of hand measuring each leaf healthy plants have broader 
leaves that capture more energy from the sun and help the crop yield 
more at harvest 
scientists now get about 20 to 30 different measurements to 
describe the condition of a plant in the field said tarbell a 
picture is worth a thousand words and theyre only using a small 
fraction of them 
the computer can spot trouble early said tarbell its a 
lot more sensitive a computer can see 256 shades of green and 
people are lucky to be able to see 10 
for example a lack of nitrogen fertilizer or an attack by 
rootworms would put corn under stress and leaves would begin to 
change from a healthy green to yellow the computer could spot the 
clue immediately while there still was time to correct the problem 
farmers also might use the computer system to predict more 
accurately how much grain they will have to market after harvest 
tarbell said the secret to good yields is keeping plants in an 
optimum growth pattern 
we want to be able to tell farmers how to keep them there or 
if its cost effective said tarbell 
the computer system also could help scientists who are doing 
things like developing new hybrids with drought resistance he said 
the new variety of plant would be grown next to the existing hybrid 
and water would be limited 
if the old hybrid starts to brown they could measure the 
damage exactly and the drought resistance of the new hybrid said 
tarbell you could do that without a computer but this machine 
loves numbers and eliminates margin for error

the board of consolidated gold fields plc has 
unanimously recommended that shareholders accept a new offer worth 
553 billion for the mining giant from british conglomerate hanson 
trust plc 
the new 35 billion pound bid which consists of cash stock 
warrants and an extra dividend payment was announced tuesday night 
by lord hanson the chairman of hanson trust 
it was immediately supported by consolidated gold fields 
chairman and chief executive rudolf agnew and later tuesday night 
gained the backing of the board 
on june 22 hanson in a move that took the stock market by 
surprise offered 31 billion pounds then worth 48 billion for 
consolidated gold fields 
but on that occasion agnew advised consolidated gold fields 
shareholders not to accept saying the offer undervalued the assets 
of the company 
consolidated gold fields is primarily involved in mining south 
african gold and platinum it also has interests in us 
construction materials and owns a 493 percent stake in newmont 
mining corp the largest us gold miner 
hanson trust is britains fourth largest company with interests 
ranging from bricks and ever ready batteries to tobacco and light 
industry among its american brands are smith corona typewriters 
durkee spices and farberware cookware 
last april a us court blocked a merger bid for consolidated 
gold fields from south africancontrolled minorco sa an investment 
group 
minorcos bid was worth 365 billion pounds equivalent at the 
time to 62 billion 
a majority of consolidated gold fields shareholders indicated 
that they wanted to accept minorcos bid but the us court refused 
to lift an injunction against a minorco takeover arising from an 
antitrust suit 
us courts had ruled that minorco had ambitions to create a 
world gold monopoly 
one of the first shareholders to back the hanson bid was minorco 
itself which has pledged its 299 percent holding in consolidated 
gold fields to hanson 
minorco had threatened to sack all of consolidated gold fields 
management above the level of operations manager if its bid 
succeeded 
but hanson said tuesday night that he looked forward to welcoming 
agnew as a nonexecutive director of hanson trust if the hanson 
trust bid is accepted

south korean consumer groups launched a 
nationwide boycott wednesday against imported us grapefruit 
claiming it is chemically tainted and unsafe to eat 
the us embassy and a spokesman for florida growers who export 
the fruit said the boycott is another salvo in a grapefruit war that 
started over a huge misunderstanding 
the citizens alliance for consumer protection of korea said 10 
leading consumer groups in seoul and 60 others around the country 
are not satisfied that us grapefruit is safe and are launching a 
nationwide campaign to warn people not to eat it 
grapefruit sales have plunged ads placed by grapefruit importers 
appeared in korean newspapers tuesday headlined grapefruit has no 
cancercausing substance we are sorry consumers have been worried 
at issue is the interpretation of a korean laboratory report that 
consumer advocates claimed shows florida grapefruit contains 
daminozide alar a suspected cancercausing agent 
the us embassy and a citrus expert from florida issued 
statements and then held a news conference june 26 to say that the 
scientific nature of the test was misinterpreted by laymen 
alar is not used on and has never been used on grapefruit 
said dan l gunter executive director of the florida department of 
citrus in lakeland were concerned and hopeful the matter will be 
clarified promptly 
the test performed by the governments agricultural chemical 
research institute estimated alar at 05 parts per million on the 
peel and flesh of grapefruit gunter said that since the lab test 
could not measure below 05 ppm the report was equivalent to a 
finding of no alar 
a few days later the lab clarified the report and agreed that 
could be the case but then consumers demanded an explanation of 
other chemicals used in the production of grapefruit 
the korean womens association asked for a second test but the 
lab refused and the national health institute said it did not have 
the equipment 
korean farmers use pesticides and chemicals and consumers are 
increasingly concerned about their effect on food products some 
growers also use alar 
as a korean consumer all we want is safe fruit said song 
bokyung of the citizens alliance we are not convinced american 
grapefruit is safe 
if the grapefruit businessmen accepted our concerns and made 
efforts to improve we would wait but when they dont listen 
consumers have only one choice a boycott she said 
consumer organizations said the boycott is targeting 43 local 
trading firms that are major importers and sellers of grapefruit 
grapefruit has disappeared from some major markets but is available 
in food stalls and back street stores 
grapefruit imports to south korea have tripled every year for the 
last four years and now total 10 million annually grapefruit is 
imported from california texas and arizona but about 
threequarters comes from florida 
florida which produces onehalf of the worlds grapefruit has 
exported 300000 boxes each weighing 85 pounds so far this year 
about 14 million boxes a quarter of the states production is 
exported annually to world markets gunter said 
a spokesman for the grapefruit industry said the fruit can be 
stored in cool containers for a few weeks but unused fruit 
eventually would spoil and have to be destroyed he had no figures 
for lost sales south korea does not produce grapefruit

grain and soybean futures prices surged in early 
trading today on the chicago board of trade with some corn and 
soybean markets up their permitted daily limits on forecasts for dry 
midwestern weather 
the buying stemmed from a national weather service sixto10day 
forecast issued after the close of trading monday predicting 
belownormal rainfall in the corn belt right through the middle of 
next week 
the soybean market also was buoyed by ideas that the extremely 
wet conditions in the southeast will prevent planting of soybean 
crops there but analysts said the dry forecast was the overriding 
influence in early trading 
the only way you can get the markets limitup in july is almost 
always weather said cathy leow a vicepresident and grainmarket 
analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
drierthannormal conditions also are forecast for most us 
wheat areas which would help get the winter wheat harvest back on 
track in the great plains but could threaten the vulnerable spring 
wheat crop in the north 
in early trading wheat was 4 cents lower to 10 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in july at 403 a bushel corn was 5 
cents to the limit 10 cents higher with july at 282 a bushel oats 
were 10 cents to 12 cents higher with july at 169 a bushel 
soybeans were 21 cents to the limit 30 cents higher with july at 
762 a bushel 
hog and porkbelly futures were trading at or near their lower 
limits on the chicago mercantile exchange in a continuing reaction 
to fridays quarterly agriculture department hogsandpigs 
inventory which showed fewer animals than traders had expected 
cattle futures also were lower in early trading 
live cattle were unchanged to 30 cents lower with august at 
6955 cents a pound feeder cattle were 45 cent to 67 cent lower

a jet engine that remains the workhorse of the 
boeing 737 fleet is under close inspection because of problems that 
led to the temporary grounding of 34 boeing jets last month 
taken out of service after fan blades broke apart in flight on 
two planes within three days the jets were later returned to the 
air with new or modified cfm563 engines 
the seattle postintelligencer reported today that industry 
insiders say the problem could be the design manufacture or 
materials used in the latest model of the engine the cfm563c 
introduced on the 737 in october 
snecma in france and general electric in ohio are testing the 
engines to see what went wrong the two companies manufacture the 
engines jointly under the name cfm international 
ge officials declined to be interviewed a spokesman for ge said 
that its engineers are going over the engines thoroughly and will 
not comment until they know the cause of the problem 
the company has stressed that the engine has a history of 
reliability with an inflight shutdown rate of one in every 20000 
hours of flight a performance record the industry considers healthy 
boeing also has declined to speculate publicly on what caused the 
fan blades to break off 
the cfm563c took the basic design of the cfm563 and increased 
the thrust to 23500 pounds 1500 pounds more than the cfm563b 
model since the problems were discovered the engines have been 
rated to run at the lower thrust level 
the engines contain 38 titanium fan blades almost five feet in 
diameter which turn at 5330 revolutions per minute tremendous 
stress is put on the blades and the disks that hold them together a 
stress level the cfm56c3 apparently could not withstand under some 
conditions 
it was a cfm563c that failed on a british midlands jet in 
january in a crash that killed 47 people while the 737 is designed 
to be able to fly on one engine it is thought the pilot shut off 
his good engine by mistake after the other caught fire 
investigators have not yet disclosed what caused the engine to fail 
in that plane 
on june 9 a danair 737 en route to minorca spain was forced to 
return to londons gatwick airport because of severe engine 
vibration two days later a british midlands 737 flying from london 
to belfast northern ireland made an emergency landing because of 
the same problem 
while problems with fan blades are not uncommon insiders say so 
many problems so soon in a models operating history is cause for 
concern the newspaper said 
on june 13 boeing took the unprecedented step of asking airlines 
to ground planes to check their engines and replace damaged parts 
airlines also were instructed to reduce the thrust to 22000 pounds 
the grounding was simultaneously made mandatory for planes under the 
jurisdiction of the british civil aviation authority and 
subsequently by the federal aviation administration for us planes 
inspections showed severe cracking of the fan blades and in at 
least one case the fan disks 
you just dont expect to have this kind of problem these days 
on an operational engine said a professor of aeronautics at a 
major us university normally problems like this one are 
detected during inspections and acted on immediately and fixed 
without appearing in the newspaper 
this leads insiders to speculate that the breakage was not caused 
simply by increased thrust but by a set of unanticipated conditions 
that caused too much vibration the postintelligencer said 
vibration in the fan blades a harmonic oscillation similar to 
the phenomenon of flutter in an airplanes wing is caused by the 
way the air moves around the metal it is a result of how hard the 
engine is run its temperature and altitude 
the fact that the fan blades broke during the climb at between 
25000 and 29000 feet is therefore also significant

mccaw cellular communications inc said 
today it will extend its 120pershare hostile takeover bid for lin 
broadcasting corp until july 20 
mccaw said it was considering whether to adjust that offer and 
will announce its decision next week the company reserved the right 
to extend the offer beyond july 20 
the offer was due to expire at midnight thursday 
a revision of the takeover bid would reflect lins legal loss to 
metromedia inc last week over the right to buy metromedias 
interests in cellular telephone systems in philadelphia and new 
york mccaw said 
because the decision appears to bring the metromedia litigation 
to an unfavorable end for lin and because its 120pershare offer 
price for lin stock reflects the possibility of a lin victory mccaw 
is now considering whether an adjustment in the offer price 
would be appropriate the company said in a prepared statement 
mccaw said that only a nominal percentage of outstanding lin 
shares have been tendered to date 
mccaws current offer for lins outstanding shares is worth 585 
billion 
lin broadcasting rejected the 120pershare offer in june

break out the dramamine executives are climbing 
back into the company planes from which many last alighted in the 
early 1980s recession 
economic turbulence sent corporate aviation into a nose dive and 
the end of the federal investment tax credit on purchases of company 
planes created an additional downdraft for the industry 
but its finally showing signs of pulling out says robert g 
carnell one of seven directors of the national air transportation 
association which represents about 1500 charter companies and 
flight service operations nationally 
some companies are going back to private planes to improve their 
schedule options and lessen luggage hassles with commercial 
airlines in addition corporations are leaner carnell said and 
theyre trying to have fewer people cover more plants 
with a private plane he said you can go in and out of a plant 
in alabama from detroit in a day by airlines its a day and a 
half or more 
the general aviation manufacturers association in washington 
dc said 157 new business jets were delivered in 1988 up 287 
percent from the 122 delivered in 1987 sales of turboprops used 
almost exclusively by businesses were up 106 percent in 1988 over 
1987 to 291 planes delivered from 263 
there are other favorable signs 
federal aviation administration and us travel data center 
surveys indicate 35 million business travelers were delivered to 
destinations by 52000 corporate and executive aircraft in 1987 the 
latest surveys available that was 2 million more travelers than in 
1986 
overall its finally starting to come back after 10 years of 
disastrous sales on new airplanes said carnell who is president 
of corporate flight inc in detroit which manages planes for 
corporations 
about 50 companies keep planes at john wayne airport in orange 
county calif and the number remains fairly constant because of 
space limitations said sue anderson manager of millionnaire flying 
service one of the airports three fixedbase operators companies 
that fuel and service corporate and private planes 
demand for more space is high millionnaire is planning to build 
a new hangar scheduled for occupancy in january anderson said 
weve got people wanting to put aircraft in that hangar and 
weve not even broken ground yet 
millionnaires fuel sales to private planes most of them 
business planes have increased from about 11 million gallons a 
year when the company began five years ago to 15 million gallons 
last year she said 
in the cleveland area charters and used aircraft sales picked up 
as the economy rallied said jim barber manager of mercury aviation 
inc at cuyahoga county airport where electronics and auto parts 
maker eaton corp and aerospace and defense company trw inc have 
air fleets based 
bausch amp lomb inc recently built a new aviation facility and 
hangar and eastman kodak co expanded its facility at monroe county 
airport near rochester ny airport assistant manager frederick 
iekel said 
corporate flying is up said jim keogh manager of the butler 
aviation inc facility at detroit metropolitan airport though he 
couldnt provide separate figures on company planes 
business flights also are increasing at detroits city airport 
an early corporate aviation center still used by thousands of 
company planes 
about half of the fortune 500 companies land here at least once 
a year airport director lillian snyder said 
city airport counted 137000 landings and takeoffs last year 
when construction kept the airport closed many nights and weekends 
this year snyder said the figure is expected to grow to 170000 
carnell said his company corporate flight manages planes for a 
halfdozen companies making them available when needed and 
chartering them at other times to help pay expenses 
theres no perfect airplane carnell said a company will 
have one plane maybe a beech king air occasionally they might need 
a lear jet with a group like mine they can interchange and use the 
right plane for the right mission 
as a rule about onethird of general aviation aircraft are used 
for business said richard lampl of the national business aircraft 
association 
an association survey of its members found that the number of 
hours flown per business jet has increased since 1987 from 4255 
hours a year to 4418 hours a year last year the association 
estimates each jet will be used an average of 483 hours for business 
this year

daimlerbenz already west germanys 
no 1 company is pushing for a merger with an aerospace giant that 
would make the conglomerate a major global force in weapons sales 
and aviation technology 
but the proposed merger the largest and one of the most 
controversial in the nations 40year history has run into serious 
objections 
they have ranged from fears of stifled competition to concern 
that the resulting defense colossus could end up dictating its own 
terms to the government 
after a veto from the federal cartel office economics minister 
helmut haussmann must decide whether to override the veto and stands 
at the center of what could become one of the most politically 
divisive debates of the year 
haussmann whose predecessor helped engineer the proposed deal 
has promised a decision by september 
if daimler is allowed to merge with the 
messerschmittboelkowblohm mbb group germanys largest defense 
contractor the reach of the conglomerate would be immense 
daimlerbenz already is a leader in making luxury cars and sturdy 
trucks which officials say will still be a large and vital part of 
its operations 
the merger would create a giant with yearly revenues of almost 80 
billion marks about 42 billion the conglomerate would rank among 
the top 15 aerospace and defense contractors worldwide 
the conglomerate would have vast holdings in weaponry and defense 
electronics including military aircraft missiles engines tanks 
and small naval ships areas that daimler officials believe have 
more growth potential than cars and trucks 
the cartel office in april rejected the proposal on grounds that 
it would give daimler a dominant position in the defense aerospace 
and truckmanufacturing sectors it also feared the conglomerates 
resulting political clout 
there is a danger that in the longterm daimler could become so 
powerful that it could pressure the government for future 
concessions said hubertus schoen a spokesman for the west 
berlinbased cartel office 
economic power can easily become political power schoen 
said referring to fears that with so many defense jobs tied to the 
company it would be hard for the government to turn down lucrative 
contracts 
schoen said the conglomerate could push smaller companies out of 
the running for defenserelated contracts 
daimlerbenz officials contend those fears are misguided 
we expect the merger to create new outlets for thousands of 
suppliers said friedrich loesch a spokesman for the 
stuttgartbased company 
daimler officials are quick to note that it was the government 
that came to them with the merger proposal nearly two years ago the 
government hopes the deal will ease bonns share of the subsidy 
burden in europes lossplagued airbus industrie consortium which 
manufacturers commercial jets 
mbb which is currently 52 percent owned by the states of 
bavaria bremen and hamburg holds west germanys 379 percent stake 
in the airbus venture 
under terms of the daimlermbb proposal the governments only 
involvement in the airbus program after the year 2000 would be in 
providing funds for research and development saving it millions in 
future subsidies 
economics ministry officials say that despite bonns pledge to 
pay subsidies to equal losses from currency fluctuations until the 
turn of the century the gains of privatizing the program are 
enormous in the long term 
daimler officials say the merger will make west germany more 
competitive in international aerospace research and production 
the west german aviation and aerospace industry is now just too 
fragmented to compete well on the international market loesch 
said 
combined with daimlerbenzs existing operations in aviation and 
aerospace the merger would give the auto and truck maker control of 
about 60 percent of west germanys aerospace industry 
the deal which initially calls for daimlerbenz to take a 30 
percent interest in mbb is currently under final review by the 
federal monopolies commission the commission is expected to deliver 
its report to the economics ministry in august 
economic minister haussmann can override the vetoes of both 
agencies if he determines that the merger is in west germanys 
overriding national economic interest 
although government funded both agencies fulfill independent 
watchdog functions 
haussmann is under growing pressure to uphold the cartel office 
ban both from within the ruling conservative parties and from the 
opposition parties 
ulrich immenga chairman of the colognebased monopolies 
commission acknowledges that haussmann is in an uncomfortable 
position 
the commission will address the awkwardness for the economics 
minister in its report immenga said referring to charges that 
the ministrys decision could be skewed in favor of the merger 
because it once helped author the proposal 
while haussmann has said his final decision will be based on 
objective review of all aspects of the proposal one of the 
ministers topranking officials has already irritated members of 
the commission and the cartel office by saying publicly that the 
negative ruling would likely be set aside

most corn and soybean futures prices soared their 
permitted daily limits wednesday on the chicago board of trade amid 
forecasts for hot dry weather in the midwest possibly lasting 
through the middle of next week 
the exchange limits daily price movements to 10 cents a bushel in 
the corn market and 30 cents a bushel in the soybean pit 
the runup extended a rally begun on monday the markets were 
closed tuesday and stemmed from a national weather service 
sixto10day forecast issued after the close of trading monday 
predicting belownormal rainfall in the corn belt 
analysts said the likelihood that temperatures in the midwest 
will climb above the mid90s this week bodes ill for the corn crop 
which has entered its pollination phase and requires cooler wetter 
conditions 
extreme heat with no moisture is an absolute nono for corn 
this time of year said jerry zusel balfour maclaine corps 
manager of tradingfloor operations at the board of trade 
dry heat wont do much harm to the soybean crop he said but the 
strong rally in corn triggered heavy buying in all of the 
neighboring grain pits 
at the close wheat was 4 cents to 7 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 402 a bushel corn was 8 cents 
to 10 cents higher with july at 280 a bushel oats were 8 cents 
to 9 cents higher with july at 166 a bushel soybeans were 6

that countrys recent bloody crackdown of prodemocracy 
demonstrators

highlevel contacts with china 
prime minister margaret thatcher ruled out full economic 
sanctions but banned arms sales and told the house of commons 
normal business could not continue with china 
organizers of the two trade missions which include leaders of 
industry and banking insisted they were not breaking the law but 
angry lawmakers criticized the missions and demanded the government 
withdraw its support

crude and home heating oil prices gained while 
gasoline prices skidded wednesday as the energy futures market was 
moved largely by supply concerns 
the august contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude rose 52 cents to close at 2079 a barrel on 
the new york mercantile exchange 
the august contract for home heating oil spurted 117 cents a 
gallon higher to close at 5106 cents while wholesale unleaded 
gasoline for august delivery dropped 035 cent to settle at 5742 
cents a gallon 
jim fiedler an analyst with edampf man international futures 
inc said crude prices rose on concerns that the flow of oil from 
the north sea could be disrupted by labor problems between oil 
companies and maintenance workers and helicopter pilots 
in the heating oil market traders bid up contracts believing 
that stockpiles have not kept pace with demand fiedler said 
he said gasoline prices fell because the summer driving season 
has not been as strong as anticipated and traders were expecting 
supply reports issued by the american petroleum institute after 
the close of trading to show strong inventories of gas

a planned 553 billion buyout of newmont mining 
corps biggest shareholder likely will mean that nearly half of 
newmonts stock will be up for sale soon analysts said thursday 
british conglomerate hanson trust plc announced late tuesday that 
it had tentatively agreed to acquire consolidated gold fields plc 
which owns a 493 percent stake in newmont the biggest us gold 
producer 
gold fields raised its holdings in newmont to 493 percent from 
262 percent in a twoday street sweep in september 1987 to help 
block a hostile takeover by a group led by oilman t boone pickens 
jr pickens later dropped his bid for the company following the 
purchase and court rulings that supported it 
the board of directors for gold fields which is involved mainly 
in mining and road construction recommended tuesday that 
shareholders accept the offer by hanson which sweetened its 
proposal from an initial 48 billion bid made june 22 
hansons varied interests include construction materials the 
likely source of the companys interest in gold fields said william 
siedenburg a new yorkbased analyst for the investment firm smith 
barney 
hanson doesnt know beans about mining siedenburg said 
calling it a minor possibility that hanson would decide to keep 
gold fields newmont assets particularly because newmont recorded 
12 billion in debt last year and its income was sagging 
siedenburg said hanson more likely would try to sell the newmont 
stake 
newmont rose 50 cents to 3975 a share wednesday on the new york 
stock exchange 
newmont posted a profit of 94 million or 14 cents a share in 
revenue of 1322 million in the first quarter of this year that 
compared with a profit of 1144 million including 303 million 
in onetime gains or 170 a share on revenue of 924 million a 
year earlier 
the company recently announced a complex restructuring of its 
peabody holding unit the nations biggest coal company that 
effectively will transfer some of its debt to peabody while moving 
500 million in cash from the coal company to newmont 
analyst ronald shorr at bear stearns in new york noted that 
hanson had a history of breaking up companies it had acquired in 
order to keep the businesses it considered most useful 
consolidateds construction assets would fit nicely into some 
niche that they hanson have the mining things do not it is 
likely that they would sell 
but said shorr its also true of hanson that theyve not 
necessarily been in any great rush to sell things furthermore 
gold prices are relatively low so hanson might prefer to hang on to 
newmont for awhile he said 
under a standstill agreement between newmont and gold fields the 
british company may dispose of its stake in a widely placed public 
offering to prevent raiders from acquiring the block and mounting a 
new takeover threat 
both shorr and siedenburg said several parties expressed an 
interest in purchasing a stake in newmont earlier this year when the 
south africancontrolled minorco sa investment group made a hostile 
bid for gold fields 
a us judge blocked minorcos bid in april after gold fields 
and newmont filed an antitrust lawsuit to prevent the takeover and 
minorco later agreed to sell its 299 percent stake in gold fields 
to hanson

background on events leading up to the recent student protests and 
massacre in tiananmen square as well as analysis of the prospects 
for chinas political future

the times greenwood said 
five interpreters spent two days translating the section which 
was then sent to taiwan via facsimile transmission for typesetting 
using a computer that allows high quality generation of chinese 
characters the paper said 
the composed pages were then flown to los angeles for printing at 
the times plant on july 2 
some 55000 copies of the translated section will be distributed 
starting thursday in restaurants book stores libraries grocery
