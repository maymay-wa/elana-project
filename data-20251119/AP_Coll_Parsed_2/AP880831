the jury in the mcmartin preschool 
molestation trial may not hear about a romance between a social 
worker who gathered evidence from children in the case and a 
newscaster who covered the story a judge ruled wednesday 
superior court judge william pounders said the defense had not 
shown that it was relevant to the trial 
the defense had suggested that wayne satz a former kabc 
reporter influenced the interviews that kee macfarlane conducted 
with children from the preschool as part of her job at childrens 
institute international the attorneys also argued that her 
credibility might be damaged if jurors knew about the relationship 
i dont see from whats been presented that theres a 
substantial issue for the jury pounders said after hearing ms 
macfarlane testify about the relationship outside the presence of 
the jury 
ms macfarlane whose testimony in pretrial hearings concerned 
her use of games and picture coloring to get children to talk of 
the alleged abuse told the judge that her romance with satz began 
after the interviews were completed 
raymond buckey 30 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 61 
are on trial on 100 molestation and conspiracy charges linked to 
their now defunct mcmartin preschool in manhattan beach the case 
has been in los angeles courts for five years 
were not trying to demonstrate that wayne satz obtained 
information from kee macfarlane to enhance his career said 
defense attorney dean gits what were trying to show is that kee 
macfarlane had a relationship with wayne satz to enhance her 
career 
ms macfarlane has denied being a source for satzs stories 
broadcast on kabctv on the mcmartin case although she 
acknowledged wednesday that they discussed it at the time 
satz who is no longer with the television station sat in the 
courtroom while ms macfarlane was questioned but pounders ruled 
he was protected from testifying by californias news reporter 
shield law 
pounders said that although the relationship has an impact on 
the case he would allow only general testimony about the affair 
during wednesdays hearing and no exploration of minute details 
which he said would be prejudicial and might violate ms 
macfarlanes privacy rights 
he also limited testimony to late 1983 to march 1984 when ms 
macfarlane ended her interviews with children and indictments were 
issued he is previewing the testimony before jurors hear it 
ms macfarlane said they met when satz came to interview her for 
a general story on child molestations 
in late 1983 before stories about the case broke ms 
macfarlane said she received a phone message from satz saying he 
wanted to discuss raymond buckey who would later become a 
defendant 
she said she turned to a coworker sandra krebbs and said 
my god sandy hes gotten wind of the case 
he knew a lot of things about this case she said some of 
them were things i knew some were things i didnt know 
at another point she said i remember being shocked at what 
kind of information he had it was startling to me he seemed to 
know everything 
did you ever become boyfriend and girlfriend with wayne 
satz gits asked ms macfarlane 
yes she answered after a brief pause 
when in your best estimation did that happen he asked 
it was after march 1984 she said but added she could not 
be sure because relationships evolve over time 
ms macfarlane did not say when the relationship ended she has 
since married someone else satz was fired by kabctv last year in 
a dispute unrelated to the mcmartin case

when jazz great miles davis recently 
praised the originality of carlos santana the lowkey musician 
expressed satisfaction that he still strikes a singular chord on 
the musical scene after two decades 
for miles to tell me this hey thats a great compliment but 
it shows that im not on stagnant water said santana whos 
admired for his stirring guitar solos stagnant water stinks you 
need water to go out you need water to come in all the time and 
in order to do it you have to become a student once you have a 
masters and you know everything its a drag 
to keep his music flowing santana will release a threerecord 
lp early next month and has launched a tour that reunites gregg 
rolie jose chepito areas and michael shrieve three original 
members of the band that evolved during jam sessions in san 
franciscos heavily hispanic mission district 
the santana blues band made its debut in 1968 at the fillmore 
west where santana recently held court at a small side table 
overlooking busy geary street talking about his new album the 
feelings behind his music and the popularity of latinrhythm groups 
the mexicanborn santana arrived in san francisco in 1961 
entering the national spotlight with a showstopping performance at 
woodstock in 1969 he has gone on to earn 14 gold albums nine 
platinum albums and sell more than 25 million records worldwide 
despite a pocketful of popular hits including evil ways 
black magic woman oye como va soul sacrifice and 
europa the 41yearold santana has continued experimenting 
the new anthology including some unreleased cuts serves to give 
a testimony of the things we have become and lived 
were looking to take the music further i mean play the 
music and respect it for the way you play it but also embrace the 
future and take some new chances said the slender mustachioed 
santana 
we want to serve the people with our music he said music 
is a healing force if played correctly i really believe that 
aside from being the universal language its a healing force and 
reminds us that we have more things in common than we think 
for santana who began playing guitar at age 8 music has never 
been a strictly commercial endeavor 
music is not to make a living he said music is to help 
the conditioning of life people play for many different reasons 
and all of them according to their hearts capacity my capacity 
tells me that i can do a great service by doing music correctly 
people know when youre playing something from your heart and when 
youre just giving lip service 
before gloria estefan and the miami sound machine began doing 
the conga and los lobos started playing texmex santana 
was infusing his music with the latin rhythm 
in past cuts such as samba pa ti oye como va and 
black magic woman santana showcased salsa when it was 
still considered something to add to mexican dishes 
still most of the recent publicity surrounding hispanictheme 
movies la bamba stand and deliver and milagro 
beanfield war and latinrhythm musical groups fail to even 
mention santana 
for gloria estefan and los lobos and all the other 
spanishspeaking people today if they want to go to the future 
they got to go through me first santana said 
on the other hand santana expressed satisfaction his music has 
not been easily categorized and points out his innovative music 
has endured for two decades 
i consider myself a musician and a stylist in bringing forth 
a certain thing that all generations can relate to he said 
thats better for me than being something megaeverything for 
three years 
the new album titled viva santana is the latest of 25 lps 
released during his career he also cut albums with buddy miles and 
john mclaughlin 
the tour began on aug 26 at tacoma wash some scheduled stops 
include st louis richmond va new york boston atlanta dallas 
and los angeles

smelly sewage notwithstanding the tiber is having a 
renaissance 
once the river was the lifeline of rome from ancient times to 
just a century ago romans bathed fished and washed their clothes 
in it 
romes unplanned development boom after world war ii however 
proved too much for the river in 20 years the population swelled 
from 1 million to more than 3 million 
anyone foolish enough to swim in the tiber risks fatal infection 
from the untreated sewage that pours into it daily todays romans 
dont have the habit of going down to the river a stroll there 
means sidestepping broken bottles rats and syringes discarded by 
drug addicts 
but this summer gave tiber lovers hope the tide is turning their 
way in the battle against pollution and neglect 
with an eye on developing tourist attractions for 1990 when 
rome hosts the world cup soccer games the city offered free boat 
rides during july the response was so great that the promotion was 
extended into september 
tickets sold out for sunset cruises to the romantic setting of a 
play performed at the roman amphitheater at ostia antica the 
tibers ancient port 
hot breezeless nights found young romans playing cards and 
dancing on tiberina island 
the fish will return there will be pleasure boats this isnt 
the thames but theres reason to believe the tiber can be made 
livable for flora and flauna said aurelio s misiti a sanitary 
engineer and professor at romes la sapienza university his 
department works closely with the city on tiber projects 
while dictator benito mussolini had declared the river 
contaminated and banned swimming and transport in 1924 misiti 
noted postwar governments didnt get around to prohibiting the 
dumping of sewage into it until 1976 
in 1974 rome started building the first purification plant 
misiti said in an interview now there are four plants but they 
can only handle a bit less than half the discharge and thats just 
talking about urban waste not industrys which is supposed to be 
handled by the factories themselves the sewage treatment program 
was supposed to have been completed years ago 
misiti said it should be finished by 1992 and after that the 
tiber should return to normal 
just outside the city fisherman pull in edible catch from the 
river which begins its 251mile course in the etruscan apennines 
paola ruggeri of the world wildlife fund says the city for the 
most part doesnt enforce regulations forcing factories to purify 
their wastes before spilling them into the tiber 
since 1982 her group has rented from the city a stretch of 
riverbank and intends to keep it as a green oasis 
willows poplars even a fig tree lean out to the water making 
that stretch look more like mark twains mississippi than a river 
channeled through a noisy trafficplagued international city 
every week volunteers come to clean it and every week we find 
a mountain of garbage ms ruggeri said 
until about a century ago the city spilled down to the river 
banks leaving rome vulnerable to devastating floods roughly every 
couple of hundred years 
after many suggestions including those of giuseppe garibaldi 
the unification hero the government began walling off the tiber 
and demolishing buildings at riverlevel now pedestrians and cars 
move along at bridgedeck level with the tibers murky green 
waters are out of sight below 
earlier this year when the city planned its annual april 21 
celebrations of the legendary founding of rome by romulus along the 
left bank of the tiber it hosted an exhibit about excavations done 
in the last 10 years when the river became a distinct department 
within the citys superintendency of archaeology 
tourists walking along the river can see the excavation of a 
threelevel storehouse for jars of oil wine and fish sauce left 
dockside by barges at the ancient port near what is now testaccio 
a bluecollar workers neighborhood 
in the past the city lived on its river rome was a kind of 
venice a copenhagen a london or a paris said claudio 
mocchegiani carpano head of the citys underwater archaeology 
department 
a thousand years from now when they dig up artifacts from the 
20th century theyll find out that the tiber just ran through rome 
and served as a sewer carpano said

in the narrow and crowded lanes of the 
old bazaar a 25inchtall man sits in a store selling candy and 
hoping to find a wife 
it is a hard life to be a dwarf and to be the worlds 
shortest living matured man is even harder gul mohammad said in 
his whispery voice as he counted coins and handed sweets to 
children much taller than he 
mohammad is 33 inches shorter than the shortest living adult 
listed by the 1988 guinness book of records nelson de la rosa of 
santo domingo dominican republic 
no one noticed me before until a local newspaper reporter had 
a chance meeting with a friend of mine who told her about me 
mohammad 32 said in an interview tuesday 
he is the eldest of four children of noor mohammad and fatma 
begum 
my first issue were twins gul and zahoor both were 
dwarfs fatma said in her oneroom home in the ballimaran 
district of old delhi zahoor died after four years but gul 
lived to become a man 
her other children a boy and a girl grew to normal size 
gul which means flower in the urdu language is lonely and 
wants to get married he was 10 when his father died his mother 
soon remarried and gul was sent to live with his maternal uncle 
where he stays today 
i want to marry someone who is of normal height so that she 
can carry me around feed me and give me bath i do not want to 
live on the charity of my relatives forever he said 
his arms are so short that his hands cant reach his head 
while bathing said his aunt nargis begum 
mohammad started his candy business with an investment of about 
35 but he has been robbed twice 
i could not do anything i have decided when i marry i will 
ask my wife to sit with me in the candy store he said with a 
broad smile 
mohammad whose only vice is smoking giggles constantly 
i used to get very upset when people laughed at me but i 
figured out if i laughed back that fixes them he said 
being the shortest man is not a joke it is a hard 
existence mohammad said 
walking is difficult for mohammad who pays about 30 cents a day 
to teenagers who piggyback him where he wants to go 
i cant get onto a rickshaw or sit on a bicycle it is 
difficult to balance he said 
mohammads neighbors are fond of him he is our pride when he 
becomes worldfamous we will all be very very happy said 
ashraf rizvi a travel agent who brought mohammad to the attention 
of the national herald newspaper 
mohammads uncle manzoor hussain said a circus once tried to 
buy him i would have gladly agreed to let mohammad work in the 
circus but to lose him forever is something impossible 
he said the circus offered the equivalent of 14285 for 
mohammad a staggering amount in india where the per capita annual 
income is 290 
hussain hopes mohammad will find a bride 
but who will marry him maybe one day when he is famous 
someone will come and offer him her hand the uncle said but 
the problem is that mohammad wants a normalheight women not a 
dwarf like him

womens groups and other organizations 
are demanding compulsory aids tests for the thousands of foreigners 
who will visit south korea for the olympics 
the groups contend the influx of visitors could spread acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome in a nation that has reported just a few 
aids cases and enacted tough laws to curb the spread of the disease 
it must be compulsory for all foreign visitors during the 
olympic period to show medical certificates confirming they are 
free from the disease said so miyong of the womens hot line 
the government worried about offending foreigners has said 
there will be no mandatory aids tests health officials say it 
would be impossible to test the 200000 expected visitors 
health authorities have reported two aids deaths and about 30 
cases of the aids virus mainly among prostitutes since the first 
case was reported in south korea in 1985 
but olympics authorities and government officials are adopting a 
number of measures to try to ensure the games do not expose the 
nation to aids any more than is necessary 
seoul residents have been receiving handbills headlined aids 
and warning people that they must take every precaution to avoid 
the disease 
it is a horrible disease that cannot be stopped by any method 
except preventative measures the leaflet warns 
city health officials said the warning was being distributed on 
the eve of the olympics to raise public awareness before the 
visitors arrive leaflets are being sent to all households in the 
city of 10 million people 
the pamphlet makes no reference to the olympics but it does say 
the first diagnosed case discovered in south korea was an american 
it also stresses the high number of aids cases overseas 
free condoms will be distributed at the olympic athletes village 
that will house 13000 athletes and officials officials said 
officials did not know if condoms would be provided to the 6000 
journalists in the press village 
health authorities and police will watch the citys prostitutes 
during the olympics to make sure they have been tested for aids as 
required by law officials say 
we will be taking special measures during the olympics said 
dr lee sungwoo director general of the bureau of public health 
seoul officials also have conducted a public education campaign 
in recent months to alert the public to aids posters have been put 
up in subways and other places 
but some civic groups and opposition lawmakers say the measures 
are not enough they contend the only certain defense against the 
disease is to require all foreigners to prove they are not infected 
with aids 
national assemblyman park sil called for mandatory testing of 
all foreigners coming to the olympics there is no guarantee they 
wont bring this deadly disease he said 
womens groups say it is unfair to test prostitutes and not 
foreigners who may infect them civic groups formed a council to 
press for mandatory testing 
it is ridiculous to require aids tests only on hostesses with 
frequent contacts with foreigners said ms so of the womens hot 
line 
tough laws were enacted this year to limit the spread of aids 
the law allows authorities to monitor and regulate people infected 
with aids or the aids virus 
under the law people with aids who have intercourse without 
using protection such as condoms face up to three years in prison 
officials have the power to isolate aids sufferers and doctors who 
fail to report cases face jail terms 
most south koreans see aids as a foreign disease and insist 
their nation can be spared if controls are imposed on foreigners 
the government has rejected demands for mandatory aids tests for 
foreigners for fear of offending other nations and discouraging 
business and tourism 
health officials admit it is only a matter of time before aids 
spreads in south korea and testing of foreigners would do little to 
stop the disease the government hopes its public campaigns will do 
more to limit its spread

a mother said she asked the court for 
leniency on behalf of the drunken driver who killed her son because 
the 21yearold former soldier deserved the chance to change his 
ways 
jefferson circuit judge ellen ewing granted margaret smiths 
request and ordered richard brinkley to serve 90 days in jail 
ewing suspended the rest of a fiveyear prison term and placed him 
on five years probation 
ms smith said it had been hard to accept the loss of her 
25yearold son patrick in such an accident 
i feel like the most important thing in my life has been taken 
away from me she told the judge monday every time i go by 
ill be reminded of where my son died and that hurts very much 
but i feel like mr brinkley is very young too and he should 
have the chance to maybe change his ways 
brinkley of decatur ark had been charged with seconddegree 
manslaughter but in july he pleaded guilty to the reduced charge 
of reckless homicide as part of an agreement with assistant 
commonwealths attorney tom wine 
the accident occurred dec 12 as brinkley was driving the wrong 
direction in the westbound lanes of the gene snyder freeway 
brinkleys pickup collided with smiths car and smith died at the 
scene of multiple injuries 
a test showed brinkleys bloodalcohol level was 014 percent 
above the states 01 percent at which a person is presumed 
intoxicated 
at the urging of smiths mother wine had recommended that 
brinkley be placed on probation so he could give public talks about 
the dangers of drunken driving 
brinkley who had been stationed at fort knox was discharged 
from the army this month primarily because of the accident said

camp owners on little cobbossee lake 
discovered a new island and it floats as the wind shifts 
its pretty wild to see tom gordon of the cobbossee 
watershed district said tuesday you can have a stretch of beach 
one day and the next day have wetland 
the island covered with cattails grass and wild rice is 
apparently a chunk of wetland that broke off from the mainland and 
floated out into the lake gordon said 
it is a real inconvenience for property owners gordon said 
one resident paul kendall said he thought he could push the 
island with help from other boaters to shore in a less bothersome 
area there he said it would have to be tied down to prevent it 
from floating back out 
but kendall also had another idea for getting rid of the island 
hey he asked a visitor you want some land

a grass and brush fire raged out of 
control tuesday afternoon quickly destroyed five expensive homes 
and badly damaged two others 
the blaze was controlled about two hours after it began in this 
rural community about 20 miles east of san francisco said fire 
capt greg holm 
there were no reports of injuries 
orinda police chief john dashnor said police and fire 
investigators are canvassing the area to check out secondhand 
reports that a teenager was seen shortly before the fire carrying 
a bottle rocket a homemade fireworks device 
several people reported hearing sounds like firecrackers minutes 
before the blaze broke out said holm 
we are investigating it as a suspicious fire but the cause 
has not been determined he added 
five houses each worth about 1 million were destroyed and two 
others had an undetermined amount of damage said fire chief ed 
lucas 
many residents were not at home when the fire broke out the 
flames rapidly spread through the dry brush and treecovered hills 
destroying several houses in just minutes about 10 acres were 
burned said firefighter marty oconnell 
beverly hopp whose 33yearold home was destroyed in the blaze 
said several children helped her rescue her four dogs from the 
flames the only property she and husband al were able to save 
was a desk containing money and insurance papers 
this has been the worst time of my life she said what do 
you do after all these years 
nancy artist a homeowner and 18year resident said the fire 
came within yards of her home 
the hills are steep and when the wind comes up it makes 
those hills like chimneys with flames just coming right up them 
artist said 
shifting winds gusting up to 22 mph made it difficult for 
firefighters to contain the blaze the fire shifted directions 
several times because of the winds officials said 
one time its going down the hills then seconds later its 
going up the hills faster than it came down artist said 
lynne cechettini 16 was napping when her sister woke her up 
and told her about the fire 
i looked out the kitchen and there was this huge flame wall 
and i thought for sure our house was gone said cechettini whose 
hair was filled with ashes only the roof of the cechettinis home 
burned 
the homes were situated among grassland dotted by patches of 
california scrub oaks pine and eucalyptus trees and lowlying 
bushes

japanese attitudes toward marriage divorce 
and the family are changing but the american model is an 
unattractive one young adults from both countries said at a 
cultural exchange 
thirty university students from japan and 30 from the united 
states ranging in age from 17 to 25 compared cultural and social 
traditions at a gathering that produced strong criticism from both 
sides of the high us divorce rate 
the united states in 1985 had five divorces and 102 marriages 
per 1000 people comparable japanese figures were 139 divorces 
and 62 marriages per 1000 
americans seem so crazy about kids but when they divorce 
arent they forgetting about the children said tadakatsu tsuruno 
of tokyo at the daylong session last week in washington 
cosponsored by nihon keizai a japanese economic newspaper and 
konica the photographic and electronics company the japanese 
from 11 universities were winners of an essay contest on the two 
countries roles in the world the americans were engaged in 
japanese or other foreign studies at us universities 
university of maryland student scott larson said the high us 
divorce rate is a sign of how individualism has gone out of 
control in the united states he called it individualism with 
no altruism 
but despite their criticism of us trends tsuruno and other 
japanese said things also are changing at home 
the japanese attitude to marriage is approaching the american 
way with people thinking more for themselves tsuruno noted 
we still have arranged marriages but 99 percent of my generation 
will find wives by themselves 
noriko takahashi a tokyo university medical student said she 
will make the final decision on her future husband although she 
will consult with her parents 
she said that if someone simply wants romance you can have it 
without marriage but the reason for marriage is to have children 
and propagate generation after generation of the family 
laura pochop of brown university said japans divorce rate is 
likely to rise as japanese women acquire the ability to support 
themselves without it she said many japanese wives are forced to 
accept their husbands liaisons with other women a situation 
american women would find intolerable 
a moderator prof martin weinstein of the university of 
illinois and washingtons center for strategic and international 
studies said japans divorce rate is rising with more older women 
divorcing after raising their children to adulthood

the department of housing and urban 
development must consider the needs of the homeless before the 
agency auctions off governmentowned foreclosed homes to the 
highest bidder a federal judge says 
us district judge harold h greene temporarily barred hud on 
tuesday from selling 170 singlefamily homes in the metropolitan 
washington area the sale was scheduled for today 
last week another federal judge in washington blocked hud from 
selling 200 foreclosed homes in michigan 
the actions are part of a broader effort to force the federal 
government to make some of huds inventory of 47000 foreclosed 
houses available to the homeless 
greene in issuing his temporary restraining order said hud had 
violated federal laws by refusing to make a survey of its stock of 
buildings and properties and determine which might be transferred 
to nonprofit groups that provide services for the homeless 
he also said hud has not complied with the law which calls for 
the realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a decent home 
and a suitable living environment for every american family 
hud cannot just sell to the highest bidder he said the 
government cannot not just consider the amount of revenue coming 
in 
greene said his temporary restraining order would last until 
sept 14 while judge oliver gasch who has jurisdiction over the 
case schedules further action 
hud is acquiring foreclosed properties at a rate of about 7000 
each month because it has been selling between 6000 and 7000 of 
the properties monthly the agency has accumulated a rolling 
inventory of about 47000 homes the largest backlog in its 
history 
the surge in huds stock of properties reflects a rash of 
foreclosures on properties in the oilproducing states and an 
increase in the overall volume of homes insured by hud in the wake 
of lower interest rates two years ago

ussoviet relations were in a whirlwind of 
confusion even before polish workers staged their latest occupation 
strikes 
the united states is engaged in the always disorienting process 
of choosing a new president 
and the soviet union is emerging from a tumultuous communist 
party conference filled with boisterous calls for economic reform 
and greater democratization 
not only is it a period of great flux but as far as the 
soviet union is concerned it is in the most fluid state since the 
1917 russian revolution said madeleine albright the chief 
foreign policy adviser to democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis ms albright born in czechoslovakia is an expert on 
eastwest relations and a professor at georgetown university 
the latest polish upheaval poses loud and clear one of the 
unanswered questions about the reform program of kremlin leader 
mikhail s gorbachev how much political power are communist 
authorities willing to hand over to their people in return for a 
popular commitment to invigorate the economy 
the wrong answer from moscow or warsaw to that question will 
present the next american president with a dilemma 
the problem that the next president is going to have to decide 
is whether to continue to demand perfection from the soviet bloc 
or whether to just declare victory and accept any change for the 
better and there is no question that things are getting better 
said jerry hough a soviet expert at duke university 
it seems that everybody is holding his breath said charles 
fairbanks of the johns hopkins center for advanced international 
studies there is a marked movement toward detente but no one is 
sure how much momentum it has 
a new explosion of violence in poland could delay or derail the 
train 
two weeks ago polish workers with their backs to the economic 
wall began a second wave of occupation strikes this year 
demanding that the government recognize and negotiate with the 
banned solidarity trade union 
the strikes forced polish leaders to meet today with 
solidaritys leader lech walesa with whom they had vowed not to 
negotiate since releasing him from martial law internment in 1982 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski has introduced reforms 
which like gorbachevs program loosen central controls and allow 
a greater role for market forces but the polish reforms have not 
stimulated the economy production remains sluggish and the foreign 
debt has risen to 40 billion 
the governments decision to meet with walesa could be a major 
step on the road toward a healthier poland 
gorbachev has been silent on the polish predicament but he said 
in yugoslavia earlier this year that there were many paths to 
socialism many people interpreted that to mean the soviets would 
not force polish communists to smash a resurgent solidarity as 
they did in the military crackdown of december 1981 
the head of the largest us trade union aflcio president lane 
kirkland last week urged the reagan administration to invoke 
provisions of the new trade bill calling for sanctions against 
nations that violate workers rights 
polands communist authorities should be denied access to the 
american market under those provisions since they are in violation 
of worker rights kirkland said 
poland is desperately trying to break into western markets and 
to secure credits from the united states and the international 
monetary fund 
the reagan administration has lifted most of the sanctions it 
imposed against poland and is in no hurry to slap them back on just 
as ussoviet relations are improving but new credits are out of 
the question until poland stabilizes its political situation 
the administration says state department spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley hopes polish communist authorities can find the path to 
national reconciliation 
free labor unions can help the polish economic reform effort 
not hinder it mrs oakley says indeed it is hard to see how 
economic reform can succeed without the participation of free trade 
unions 
another state department official said weve been telling the 
polish government very consistently that their ability to reform 
the economy and our ability to support that process will depend on 
national reconciliation in other words give solidarity a slice 
of the political pie 
thats not ideology thats practicality no one is going to 
accept the kind of austerity needed for economic reform without 
making sure they get political reforms first said the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
this is one area in which the reagan administration and the 
wouldbe dukakis administration are pretty close albright says 
last week the dukakis campaign urged poland to legalize solidarity

the soviet union is committed to a highly 
advanced nuclearpowered submarine force even though the kremlin 
faces the same type of funding woes confronting the pentagon 
according to a new blueprint for the russian navy now being studied 
in the west 
the blueprint is a book blessed by fleet adm sergei gorshkov 
known as the father of the modern russian navy it envisions 
submarines that can travel at 50 knots to 60 knots underwater in 
the near term and ultimately up to 100 knots while diving to 
depths of 6600 feet and carrying thermaland laserhoming 
torpedoes that can travel at 300 knots 
the book the navy its role prospects for development and 
employment was published in moscow earlier this year and is now 
being translated and analyzed by the us office of naval 
intelligence 
that office already has prepared a threepage summary however 
that concludes the book in its scope is the most powerful soviet 
monograph on the navy since gorshkovs sea power of the state in 
1976 and is clearly intended to demonstrate why the soviet navy 
must continue the gorshkov legacy of fielding a hightechnology 
highseas navy despite evident fiscal constraints 
the book apparently was authored by several individuals but was 
edited and carries a foreword by gorshkov for three decades the 
driving force behind the soviet navy 
according to the navy intelligence office the book offers the 
west an insight into the future composition and employment of the 
soviet navy highlighting three key naval missions 
they include hunting and destroying us and other western 
submarines before they could launch their missiles in a war 
destroying western military and economic targets through nuclear 
strikes from soviet submarines and destroying hostile naval 
forces to gain command of the sea around the eurasian periphery 
throughout the book special attention is given to 
antisubmarine warfare and the threat posed by american subs the 
summary continued 
the authors project a highly dynamic undersea warfare 
environment with goals of 2000meter 6600 feet diving depths 
highspeed submarines 50 to 60 knots in the near term and 100 
knots in the outyears future highspeed torpedoes 200 to 300 
knots with thermal and laser homing 50kilometer 30mile 
antisubmarine warfare missiles and improved acoustic and 
nonacoustic submarine sensors 
a knot is equal to 115 miles per hour meaning the submarines 
ultimately envisioned by the soviets would be able to travel 115 
mph 
the soviet union already has the fastest nuclearpowered 
submarines in the world its alfa and akula attack subs can exceed 
40 knots underwater the us navy in the past has deliberately 
eschewed the goal of building faster submarines preferring instead 
to emphasize quiet operation 
as for the strike mission of attacking western targets with 
submarines the book makes specific reference to covert launches 
from short ranges against targets and areas covered by antimissile 
defense systems in order to decrease reaction time and increase 
missile survivability the summary said 
such comments highlight the potential importance of recent 
soviet sealaunched ballistic missile launches to test shortrange 
short timeofflight trajectories 
the book appears to be the soviet navys first salvo in 
staking out its future role in soviet national security policy 
under the newly proclaimed defensive doctrine and reasonable 
sufficiency philosophy the american analysts added 
kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev and top soviet defense 
officials have insisted to us officials in recent months that 
they are shifting their military orientation from an offensive to a 
defensive stance and intend to maintain only a force that is 
sufficiently large for protection 
defense secretary frank c carlucci has pressed the soviets for 
more details of their plans in several highlevel meetings while 
expressing doubts the soviets are really changing their 
offensiveminded doctrine 
the new book reflects the current soviet emphasis on defense by 
devoting considerable attention to the defensive roles of the 
soviet navy the summary said 
the book says though that naval force composition is likely 
to continue to emphasize nuclear submarines both for defensive 
antisubmarine warfare missions and strategic nuclear strike

it took 42 days to settle their labor 
dispute but gretchen schulte kenoshas striking mom has put down 
her picket signs and signed a negotiated contract with her children 
it was 100 percent worth it she said i dont even care 
about the publicity and criticism even that was worth it all that 
matters is here in this house and i think weve all learned 
something 
its great to be free daughter heidi said tuesday as she 
relished the lifting of her grounding restrictions 
schulte went on strike july 18 to protest what she said was 
disrespect and disobedience by her four children 14yearold twins 
eric and julie heidi 13 and jerry 8 
she hung picket signs and nixed such duties as cooking 
cleaning chauffering and laundering a possible turning point came 
recently when she refused to pay for her childrens school clothes 
final negotiations sunday lasted from noon until 640 pm when 
the detailed contracts were signed 
it was very emotional traumatic said schulte 42 there 
was a lot of crying and screaming 
the family had to take a break when debate became too heated 
but the talks resumed after schultes husband theodore cooked 
dinner and family members cooled off 
even before the pact was signed the children were outside 
celebrating 
before i finished writing my name they were jumping around at 
the street corner yelling its over its over the mother 
said with a smile 
yesterday was the best day of my life and i plan to have 
another one today eric said tuesday 
but in case anyone gets complacent the contracts are taped on 
the walls as reminders 
schulte no longer tells the children what needs to be done but 
simply has them review their contracts 
the handwritten documents contain specific instructions for 
practically every chore and privilege 
for example the rec room contract states that parents will 
provide a recreation room and all radios newspaper delivery bags 
shoes and jackets will be kept there 
it also calls for removal of all cans bottles and wrappers from 
the room by 6 pm and specifies that failure to obey is punishable 
by loss of television privileges for one week 
the contracts 11 of them in all fill a notebook 
schulte had no regrets about the strike and insisted she would 
have kept the children grounded and out of school if they had not 
shaped up 
but i knew they would come around she said i knew i had 
the hammer

farm commodity prices as a group were still 
going up last month although a new agriculture department report 
shows that some major items were starting to level off in august 
the departments overall price index rose 21 percent from july 
averaging 13 percent more than in august 1987 also the new 
figures released on tuesday showed that the index rose only 29 
percent in july instead of the preliminary reading of 36 percent 
announced a month ago 
since april as drought cut into this years harvest prospects 
farm commodity prices overall have climbed 108 percent however 
there were some indications in the august report that the upward 
spiral began to weaken 
the departments agricultural statistics board said in its 
preliminary report that higher prices for cattle apples tomatoes 
and lettuce contributed most to the august increase while prices 
declined for cotton corn onions and soybeans 
in the earlier months corn and soybeans helped lead the way for 
rising prices however by late july widespread rains began to 
dampen further increases although the drought of 1988 has not been 
broken by any means 
at the chicago board of trade on tuesday grain and soybean 
futures closed sharply higher but it was on the strength of new 
export business not further crop losses due to drought analysts 
said 
moreover they said the corn and soybean crops have passed 
their most critical stages of development 
based on aug 1 estimates this years corn harvest may drop 37 
percent from 1987 wheat 13 percent and soybeans 23 percent 
all feed grain and soybean prices declined from july but 
rough unmilled rice and all wheat prices increased slightly 
the report said average prices of beef cattle and calves 
increased sharply from july but were below the high levels recorded 
during february through may of this year 
prices of some major commodities are based on midmonth averages 
and then are revised the following month when additional 
information is available 
as a commodity group prices of feed grains and hay dropped 28 
percent from july to august but still averaged 68 percent above a 
year ago the report said 
prices of meat animals rose 43 percent as a group but averaged 
06 percent below the yearearlier mark beef cattle prices 
averaged 6640 per 100 pounds of liveweight up 320 from july 
hog prices increased 1 from july to 4680 in august 
apple prices at the farm level rose to 261 cents per pound in 
august from 197 cents in july and 16 cents a year ago lettuce was 
reported at 1220 per 100 pounds up from 762 in july but far 
below the 18 of last year tomatoes at 4170 per 100 pounds 
were up from 31 in july and 1730 in august 1987 
overall the august allcrops price index was up 23 percent 
from july averaging 33 percent above the yearago level 
the august price index for all livestock and livestock products 
was up 34 percent from july and averaged 13 percent more than a 
year earlier higher prices for cattle hogs milk turkeys and 
eggs accounted for the increase from july 
consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent 
this year compared with a 42 percent average increase in 1987 
before the drought took hold usda was predicting a 1988 food price 
hike of 2 percent to 4 percent 
department officials have predicted that the drought may add 2 
percentage points to food prices in 1989 above the expected 
increase in inflation currently forecast at around 4 percent that 
could mean a 1989 food price increase in the range of 6 percent to 
7 percent 
tuesdays report said 
cattle averaged 6640 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally up from 6320 in july and 6190 reported for august 
1987 those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 4540 per 100 pounds compared with 4410 in 
july and 5860 a year earlier 
corn at 266 a bushel was down from 272 in july and the 
average of 147 per bushel a year earlier 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 356 per bushel compared with 350 in july and 236 a 
year earlier 
rice averaged 761 per 100 pounds compared with 751 in july 
and 374 a year earlier 
soybeans were 840 per bushel compared with 850 in july and 
502 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 552 cents per pound compared 
with 586 in july and 637 cents in august 1987

a huge christian cross is an inappropriate 
government war memorial at a marine base in hawaii according to a 
federal judge who says a nonreligious monument would be more 
suitable 
us district judge thomas f hogan ruled tuesday that the 
65foot wooden cross that is lit each night at camp hm smith in 
the honolulu suburbs on oahu must be removed or replaced by a 
secular symbol 
the judge said the cross amounts to an unconstitutional 
endorsement of religion by the government the cross was challenged 
by the jewish war veterans of the usa 
the needless use of means that are inherently religious makes 
a message of endorsement likely if not unavoidable the judge 
wrote in his opinion 
the 65foot lighted cross on bordelon field at camp smith may 
fairly be considered to convey a message of governmental 
endorsement of christianity hogan said the use of a cross as 
a memorial to fallen or missing servicemen is a use of what to some 
is a religious symbol where a nonreligious one likely would have 
done as well 
the judge stayed his order for 60 days to give the reagan 
administration the navy and the marine corps an opportunity to 
seek another stay from an appellate court while they appeal his 
decision 
the jewish war veterans of the usa contended in its lawsuit 
that the wooden cross on a prominent point at the marine base 
violated the constitutions ban on governmental endorsement of a 
particular religion 
the government argued during a hearing in may that the cross 
erected 22 years ago served purely a secular purpose of honoring 
marines killed in the vietnam war or are missing in action 
but the jewish veterans group argued that the cross cannot be 
considered a secular object because it is the symbol of the 
passion death and resurrection of jesus christ 
the government did not deny the religious significance of the 
cross but said the history of the memorial is clear it was 
erected as a secular monument 
hogan however noted evidence that the original cross was built 
in april 1966 for easter sunrise services and that it was rebuilt 
after a fire in time to be lit at christmas 1983 
unfortunately the governments choice of the principal and 
universally recognized symbol of christianity to achieve a secular 
goal cannot withstand scrutiny in this instance hogan said 
the principal symbol of christianity this nations dominant 
religion simply is too laden with religious meaning to be 
appropriate for a government memorial assertedly free of any 
religious message

delays in getting the space shuttle back into 
operation have led nasa to postpone its most ambitious scientific 
mission the launch of the 15 billion hubble space telescope 
the national aeronautics and space administration said tuesday 
that by moving the telescope launch from june 1 next year to feb 
1 1990 it can stay on schedule for launching three major 
scientific probes that are dependent on planets being in favorable 
position 
those launches are magellan which will map the planet venus 
in april 1989 galileo a usgerman project to survey jupiter and 
its moons scheduled october 1989 and ulysses a cooperative 
project with the european space agency in october 1990 
the first space shuttle flight since the challenger exploded in 
january 1986 has been postponed five times nasa said it wont set 
a new date until after a flight readiness review on sept 1314 
but that it hopes to make the flight late next month or in early 
october 
the space telescope is in storage but is costing the space 
agency 7 million a month to keep it in working order in space 
the telescope is expected to be able to look at objects 14 billion 
light years away almost to the beginning of the universe 
groundbased observatories which must look through earths 
atmospheric veil can only see light that originated about 2

authorities say a 30nation narcotics 
crackdown resulted in more than 1200 arrests in the past month and 
should lead to further drug busts in this hemisphere 
some operations are still going on charles gutensohn head 
of cocaine investigations at the drug enforcement administration 
said tuesday 
attorney general richard l thornburgh and a host of other us 
and foreign officials said tuesday that 30 countries had 
participated in a series of antidrug trafficking operations this 
month primarily in south and central america 
thornburgh said authorities seized 11 tons of cocaine and 
destroyed 244 tons of marijuana 118000 coca plants and 13 cocaine 
laboratories authorities also demolished seven hidden airstrips 
and seized 38 million in cash he said 
while thornburgh said the effort did not represent victory in 
the war against drugs he said the cooperative nature of the 
operations represented a new avenue in stamping out trafficking 
heretofore each of the nations of the americas has been 
pursuing the war on drugs in a more or less unilateral or bilateral 
fashion he said 
the participating countries all members of the international 
drug enforcement conference shared resources and intelligence and 
in a few cases staged crossborder operations 
thornburgh said the united states did not orchestrate the drug 
busts though it did serve as a clearinghouse for data instead 
each country planned and executed its drug operations often in 
concert with other countries 
by doing it all over at once you disrupt the operation 
gutensohn said 
since many drug traffickers ignore national boundaries it is 
vital to close in on traffickers on many fronts he said 
in peru for instance military authorities seized cocaine 
laboratories in the upper huallaga valley that are used by members 
of the powerful medellin and calli drug cartels based in colombia 
cocaine labs also were seized in colombia itself as well as 
bolivia 
among some other actions cited by the officials 
about 100 national guardsmen in arizona florida and texas 
helped border patrol officials inspect vehicles that crossed into 
the united states 
as a result of information developed abroad new york officials 
seized two tons of cocaine and about 2 million in cash 
military officers from colombia and venezuela operated along 
the joint border 
officials in panama and costa rica worked together to seize 
chemicals used for cocaine at points along the border panama 
participated in the operation as a member of the conference but 
did not receive any centralized intelligence from the united 
states thornburgh said 
panamas military dictator gen manuel antonio noriega has 
been indicted by two federal grand juries in florida on charges of 
drug trafficking and money laundering washington has sought his 
ouster since early this year applying economic sanctions that have 
hurt panamas economy 
european nations and canada stepped up monitoring of vessels 
cargo and aircraft arriving from south america

richard nixons former top aide says the 37th 
president not only was reluctant to install an extensive taping 
system in the white house but that he quickly lost awareness that 
his every conversation was being recorded 
the historiography of the nixon administration will eventually 
be much the richer as a result of richard nixons decision to 
taperecord his meetings and telephone conversations writes hr 
haldeman nixons onetime chief of staff nixon was not thinking 
of historians when he made this decision but they will be the 
ultimate beneficiaries 
haldeman discusses the origin of the taping system which 
provided the evidence that eventually drove nixon from office in 
the watergate scandal in the summer issue of prologue the 
quarterly publication of the national archives 
haldemans latest account is much softer in tone and less 
critical of nixon than when he described the same events in a 1978 
book the ends of power 
it is amazing to me when i think back to the first days weeks 
and months of the taping systems existence how quickly i forgot 
about it haldeman writes for a short time i worried that it 
might not be working and i dispatched someone to test the 
machinery but the worry quickly passed as did any awareness at 
all that nixons conversations my conversations often were 
being taped i think nixon lost his awareness of the system even 
more quickly than i did 
that dovetails with nixons own memory that initially i was 
conscious of the taping but before long i accepted it as part of 
the surroundings 
haldeman says his book 10 years ago focused on the watergate 
scandal that drove nixon from office in 1974 and that it was 
unfortunately sensational in many instances where i would have 
preferred it to be more reasoned and thorough 
nixon fired haldeman in april 1973 at the height of the coverup 
of the breakin at democratic party headquarters in the watergate 
complex in washington haldeman served an 18month prison term for 
his part in the affair in the book he said nixon had fudged 
the tape story in various ways climaxing with the assertion on 
television in 1977 that he had ordered me to destroy all of the 
tapes there is no reference to that in the prologue article 
the former aide said he chose to write about the taping system 
because the archives next year will release 60 hours of the 
recordings for public listening 
nixon abhorred the idea of taping the presidents meetings and 
telephone conversations haldeman writes he said he and nixon 
discovered the taping system of his predecessor lyndon b johnson 
on inauguration day and that the new president ordered it removed 
the major reason for the system haldeman says now as before 
was nixons failed attempt to halt inaccurate reports that came out 
of his meetings with various people other reasons he said were 
that nixon wanted records for his memoirs and an accurate account 
of what foreign leaders said to him 
something had to be done both nixon and i agreed to ensure 
that we possessed an accurate record of what was said in 
meetings haldeman writes they had tried using notetakers but 
quit because they inhibited conversations and they had tried 
debriefing visitors as they left the oval office 
in late 1970 or early 1971 haldeman recalls word got to nixon 
that johnson felt he was foolish for not keeping a record of what 
was going on and that such a record was necessary for memoirs 
nixon suddenly was receptive to the idea of taping his 
meetings haldeman says finally still reluctantly nixon 
agreed that taping was the best way

some state and local democratic leaders say 
that while michael dukakis republican rivals have made their grab 
for the national spotlight his campaign has been making important 
organizational gains in the field 
around the country dukakis field leaders and democratic party 
state and local leaders contend the appearance of flagging momentum 
on the part of the dukakis campaign is at worst a temporary problem 
a part of the ups and downs of a campaign that will balance in 
the end 
dukakis campaign officials have said they were devoting much of 
their summer efforts to building organization in the states and 
party officials in some key states point to organizational gains 
now is the time for quiet organizational activity that doesnt 
get much publicity but pays off at the end said lanny j davis 
democratic national committeeman from maryland dukakis has put 
together perhaps the best field organization ever put together by a 
presidential candidate none of that gets headlines but youll see 
evidence of it in the fall 
in ohio a critical industrial state party spokeswoman carol 
rowan said the party has hired 15 field coordinators to work with 
the dukakis campaign we are getting everything into place in the 
grass roots and thats where this election will be won she said 
iowa state house speaker don avenson said a dukakis organization 
has been built in regional areas of the state far earlier than in 
previous democratic campaigns party chairman bonnie campbell said 
there are 12 dukakis field workers and six administrators in this 
important midwestern farm state that has gone republican in recent 
years 
were seeing organizational work developing very very early 
in a campaign avenson said compared to recent years its 
unprecedented 
in minnesota a good state for dukakis the campaign has opened 
15 state offices compared with one for republican george bush 
according to dukakis campaign director pat forciea 
but in south carolina a difficult state for dukakis state 
campaign director det bowers said were operating almost totally 
on volunteers 
in new york erie county democratic chairman joseph crangle 
acknowledged some sluggishness in the dukakis campaign in 
recent weeks and said the problem has been discussed at local 
organizational meetings he said some dukakis supporters may have 
become overconfident in view of dukakiss lead in the polls after 
the democratic convention 
that lead vanished in the glare of attention on bush and the gop 
convention in new orleans the focus on the republican ticket was 
prolonged after the convention because of the controversial 
selection of sen dan quayle of indiana as vice presidential 
nominee 
in missouri a battleground state for the fall campaign party 
executive director todd patterson said the quayle mess had 
drawn publicity to the republican ticket and that it had hurt 
dukakis even though much of the attention was critical 
right now theyve cut dukakis off at the knees in terms of 
publicity patterson said i believe in my heart that dukakis 
will eventually win missouri but i think we have to get back on 
track 
dukakis himself voiced frustration on monday that he has been 
unable to draw attention to his economic themes because of the 
attention on quayle and on bushs attacks on him 
the dukakis campaign has lost some of its early momentum 
said richard lodge chairman of the democratic executive committee 
in tennessee i think george bush has controlled the debate but 
he has done it through the traditional republican trick of 
distorting governor dukakiss record 
dukakis sought to take the offensive tuesday aggressively 
attacking bush on crime defense spending and his role in the 
irancontra affair 
i dont think democrats have been pushing forward as 
aggressively and quickly as the republicans said patterson the 
missouri democrat the republicans have been forced to move 
quickly because theyve had to stir the dust up so voters wont see 
where theyre at in the road 
some state democrats dismissed talk of the campaign stalling or 
said its so early it doesnt matter 
the campaign is won in the last two weeks not the first two 
weeks alabama party chairman john baker said

there are plenty of boos on the campaign trail 
with republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle but theyre 
not for the candidate theyre for the press entourage traveling 
with him 
the press is generally seen by proquayle audiences as the skunk 
at the picnic as he makes his way around the country because of 
reporters questions about the national guard his academic record 
his resume and various other personal details quayle has called 
side events 
let him alone the audience shouts as reporters try to 
waylay the vice presidential nominee some of the shouts are less 
polite 
signs like media beware cut sam donaldsons tongue out 
and press go home greet the traveling press 
last week on quayles sevenstate trip at almost every stop 
were identical signs with the word press encircled in red and 
with a red slash mark through the word leading some to suspect an 
organized effort 
at a stop in columbia mo one unidentified teenager held such 
a sign and told reporters someone gave it to me when i came in 
the door and i liked it 
david prosperi quayles spokesman said he had no idea where 
the signs came from 
im quite confident that it is nobody affiliated with the 
bushquayle organization in any way shape or form he said 
thats just not the way we do business 
prosperi said quayle does not intend to have a fight with the 
press 
were here to have a fight with the other guys on the 
issues he said 
quayle was asked sunday as he flew home whether he felt at times 
as if he were running against the news media instead of the 
democrats 
im running with george bush he replied 
quayle wont say whether he thinks the press is out to get him 
telling reporters only you can answer that question but he 
says he does not disagree with his wife marilyn who last week 
said she felt the press was biased against quayle because he was a 
conservative 
but quayle has made it clear he dislikes the intensive media 
scrutiny that has followed him since he became bushs running mate 
and allegations surfaced that he pulled strings to get into the 
national guard during the vietnam war and into law school after an 
average performance in college 
at the california state fair in sacramento quayle petted a 
labrador retriever guide dog and when the dog just lay there with 
his eyes rolled up quayle said now i know how it feels to be 
hounded 
he tends to make sarcastic references to the press in his stump 
speech often referring to my newfound friends in the news 
media or my cheering section 
the references are not lost on the audiences at one appearance 
in west carrollton ohio reporters who tried to ask quayle about 
the national guard issue as he made his way shaking hands were 
dealt with roughly 
a large woman hit one female reporters arm and shoulder and 
turned and dealt another one a hefty body block she said the two 
women were endangering a group of scouts 
im just trying to protect the children she shouted 
the hostility reached its peak at a rally in quayles hometown 
of huntington ind as he and bush campaigned together on their 
first day after the republican convention at a news conference 
that was piped to the crowd over the public address system the 
crowd cheered quayles answers and booed reporters questions 
boring they shouted 
on tuesday quayle couldnt resist another reference to the 
press when he spoke to the international association of fire 
chiefs i feel that i am very accustomed to fighting fires these 
last couple of weeks 
when he was presented with a fire chiefs hat quayle said 
this is going to be prominently displayed on my airplane 
right in front of where the press is sitting 
the hat will join another memento at a california stop last 
week quayles aides quickly grabbed up a bumper sticker which 
stated i dont love the liberal media 
it is affixed it to the cabin door that faces the press section 
of the aircraft

new jersey gaming regulators have 
thrown a roadblock in the way of entertainer merv griffin who has 
won approval to buy resorts international inc from developer 
donald trump 
griffins proposed trust agreement needed before he can buy 
the resorts stock from trump the controlling stockholder and 
class a shareholders failed to win approval tuesday from the 
state casino control commission 
the trust agreement is necessary in case the commission finds 
griffin ineligible for a new jersey gaming license in that case 
the trust would run the company until griffin could appeal the 
decision or sell off the companys assets 
the commission voted 32 against the proposed trust agreement 
largely because it calls for a trustee to take control of the 
griffin co rather than just the resorts stock 
griffin officials wanted the trust agreement to cover the 
griffin co to ensure the firm is able to take advantage of prior 
tax losses of resorts potentially worth 100 million 
the former talk show host however said he still expects the 
deal to go through

despite strong objections from the 
prosecutor a judge sentenced a cocaine dealer to stage benefit 
rock n roll concerts for juvenile drug treatment programs rather 
than a prison term 
the santa clara county prosecutor who tried the case had asked 
the judge for a sixyear sentence for 26yearold dan nelson a san 
jose concert promoter 
this is a better deal for society said nelson whom a jury 
in april found guilty of offering cocaine for sale possessing the 
drug for sale and being armed during the undercover narcotics 
transaction that incriminated him 
agents testified he carried a briefcase with 17 ounces of 
cocaine and a loaded handgun 
the sentence was handed down last week by superior court judge 
paul r teilh nelson could avoid spending even a night in prison 
but must donate 1820 hours of community service work and pay a 
5000 fine 
nelson who has no previous record also was sentenced to a year 
in the county jail but would be allowed to work during the day and 
spend his evenings at home with an electronic monitor clamped to 
his ankle 
im upset and very very disappointed said deputy district 
attorney margaret dufreschou were trying to make a real 
deterrent against drug sales and i dont think this helps 
getting arrested and going to prison are part of the cost of 
doing business for drug dealers what this does is lower their cost 
of doing business she said 
however vince schiraldi of the national center on institutions 
and alternatives in san francisco called the judges sentence 
courageous and wise 
were punishing the guy and getting a very needed community 
service at the same time there are winners all the way around

solidarity leader lech walesa left for 
warsaw on wednesday for his first talks with polish authorities 
since solidarity was banned the government hoped the meeting would 
end two weeks of labor unrest 
asked what he would discuss with interior minister gen czeslaw 
kiszczak during the talks walesa said how to make up for the 
past seven years solidarity was crushed in a 1981 military 
crackdown 
walesa traveled by car with senior solidarity adviser tadeusz 
mazowiecki 
the meeting walesas advisers said would be held wednesday would 
follow four days of maneuvering started by kiszczaks proposal on 
friday that officials and worker representatives hold 
roundtable discussions 
a communique from the communist partys ruling politburo 
distributed by the official news agency pap mentioned a 
roundtable meeting endorsed it and said kiszczak should carry 
on with the mission entrusted to him 
it was not clear however whether the reference was to the 
wednesday meeting or the ministers original proposal on friday no 
other official reference was made to walesakiszczak talks 
ten enterprises in poland remained on strike at its height the 
current labor trouble involved 20 sites employing 100000 people 
and was the worst since 1980 
solidarity spokesmen said there was no agreement for an 
immediate end to the strikes in which a central demand has been 
making solidarity legal again mazowiecki called the decision for 
talks a historic moment 
walesa last met with the government on behalf of the union in 
late 1981 
on tuesday evening walesa left the strikebound lenin shipyard 
where he works as an electrician to confer with advisers and 
bishop tadeusz goclowski at nearby st brygidas church he emerged 
from the rectory with the bishop later to cheers and chants from 
supporters 
government spokesman jerzy urban said earlier in the day that 
talks could begin as soon as walesa called off the strike at the 
lenin shipyard where the soviet blocs first free union was born 
in the labor uprising of 1980 but aide piotr konopka said for 
the present the strike is still on 
he said walesa would attend the wednesday meeting as president 
of the independent selfgoverning trade union solidarity the labor 
federations full name 
while the government expressed its willingness to talk strikers 
at the stalowa wola steel mill in southeastern poland said soldiers 
had moved into the town and helicopters flew over the plant 
workers are occupying the shipyard and steel mill as is 
customary during strikes in poland 
in a reference to the stalowa wola strike kiszczaks ministry 
and the armed forces general staff issued a statement saying in 
case of the continuation of the illegal strike action appropriate 
lawful measures will be taken 
adam michnik a historian and senior walesa adviser said 
tuesday night the talks begin exactly on the anniversary of the 
august agreements that created solidarity as a legal union in 
1980 
we want to believe that a new chance begins and it will be at 
a time when poles can make use of this chance he said the 
results of this meeting tomorrow will be very important for the 
fate of the country and the world 
mazowiecki said we hope that this meeting will serve the 
purpose of dialogue and agreement and the most important issue 
which is trade union pluralism and the legalization of solidarity 
urban told his weekly news conference tuesday the stoppage of 
strikes by mr lech walesa and the shipyard where he works would 
mean automatically convening a round table 
he said no rules had been made for the agenda of the 
roundtable talks with representatives of various segments of 
society to be moderated by kiszczak who suggested them last 
friday 
we are ready for talks with all those who respect the law 
a significant symptom of which is avoiding participation in illegal 
srikes and moreover contributing to their stoppage urban said 
walesa had said he would not call off the lenin shipyard strike 
unless gen wojciech jaruzelskis government promised to include 
trade union pluralism in the discussion and he was allowed to take 
part as the recognized leader of solidarity 
he traditionally marks the aug 31 date of the signing of the 
gdansk agreements by laying a wreath at a monument to workers 
killed in labor unrest during 1970 it is near the lenin shipyards 
main gate 
michnik said earlier that urbans statement represented only a 
preliminary step because it does not say exactly what can be 
understood by the term round table who would sit at it and the 
subject of the talks 
most strikers have demanded higher pay and better working 
conditions in addition to legalization of solidarity but the 
status of the outlawed union is the only demand at stalowa wola 
piotr niemczyk a solidarity spokesman in warsaw said the workers 
had authoritized walesa to negotiate for them

anxious to rid itself of the hordes of 
skunks roaming streets yards buildings and gardens the city has 
put out a contract on the malodorous animals 
panguitch officials say the towns 1400 residents have had it 
up to their noses prompting authorities to offer a 5askunk 
reward to encourage the trapping and destruction of the animals 
its a whole stinking problem quipped city manager bruce 
fullmer this is a farming community and the skunks come out of 
the fields and into the community once in a while 
fullmer said that in the past this southwestern utah town 
contracted with resident van barney a pretty good man for 
handling skunks to get rid of the animals but he died last 
year 
the reward is aimed at enticing two animal control officers to 
take up the task he said 
officials wont turn down residents who find a skunk or two 
under a shed or an old house but officials arent trying to 
encourage residents to go out and gather skins and then turn them 
in for the reward fullmer said

seemingly unaffected buffalo roam the 
parched south dakota prairie on americas largest bison ranch while 
crops wither and domestic livestock suffer and even die because of 
the drought 
nature sure gave them about everything it takes to survive 
except the bullet said roy houck who with his late wife 
nellie started the houck buffalo ranch nearly three decades ago 
the hardy bison native to north america were hunted to near 
extinction in the late 1800s for its skins and meat 
houcks buffalo forage on brown grass and linger near water 
holes the ranch has more than 200 ponds all of which have been 
drawn down by the drought and some are almost dry 
depending on the season 3000 to 4500 buffalo inhabit the 
50000acre ranch thats fenced into 35 pastures 
after the various herds are allowed to graze in one pasture for 
a few weeks the gate to the next pasture is opened and the huge 
beasts move into the area to resume foraging 
the main breeding herd we dont feed them anything but 
grass said the 83yearold houck we try to supplement the 
calves a little the first year to give them a boost 
although the drought seems not to have affected the herd its 
impact may show up next spring in a smaller calf crop houck said 
explaining that this is the mating season 
these cows wont conceive if theyre not in good shape 
houck said glancing over at the rummaging animals about 30 yards 
away but so far these cows look pretty good theyre holding 
their meat pretty well 
the ranch hasnt had a decent rain in more than a year and 
100plusdegree temperatures have been common all summer 
but the drought of 1988 is no match yet for the dust bowl days 
of the 1930s houck said 
the dry dust storms of the 30s still haunt me he said 
it was so dry in the spring of 1934 the grass never even 
sprouted 
not that houck isnt concerned now 
if were forced into another year of drought well probably 
have to graze our pastures a lot longer than wed like to he 
said after going through those dry 30s you wonder how long 
its going to last 
weve got to be pretty cautious because you cant just load 
buffalo on a truck and take them to the sale barn 
buffalo enjoy their freedom and are handled as little as 
possible 
when you get them in confinement theyve only got one thought 
in mind and thats to get away houck said if you happen to be 
in the way thats too bad 
horses once were used to round up the buffalo fourwheel drive 
trucks are now used 
buffaloes dont seem to like horses and besides can outrun 
them houck said one of his sons once got his horse knocked 
right out from under him by an angry buffalo 
when buffaloes are 2 years old they are sorted for bulls and 
heifers most bulls go to slaughter and heifers are kept for 
breeding 
between 800 and 1000 are butchered on the ranch each year 
houck said 
the market for buffalo meat which is very low in fat has been 
good houck said right now were getting 2 a pound for dressed 
buffalo meat 
once an endangered species buffalo have made a remarkable 
comeback said mary duvall executive director of the national 
buffalo association buffalo numbers are estimated at between 
75000 and 100000 she said 
their numbers reached into the millions before pioneers began 
forging westward and found them to be easy prey dipping to a 
historical low near 1000 head in 1889 duvall said 
realizing the common misconception that buffalo still are 
endangered was a hindrance to marketing efforts houck helped form 
the fort pierrebased association whose members now number about 
1200 buffalo producers 
the houcks began ranching by raising cattle they switched to 
buffalo after a march 1966 blizzard that killed more than 200 of 
their cattle but not a single buffalo 
theyll just stick their noses down into the snow and eat this 
grass and theyll stay fat on it houck said i wonder how 
they do it but they do

when it comes to representing 
california the banana slug just wont do gov george deukmejian 
said in vetoing a bill that designated the slimy slothful creature 
the states official mollusk 
the veto by the imageconscious governor announced tuesday 
squashed the hopes of a group of blue birds and camp fire girls 
from the san francisco bay area who led the campaign to make the 
banana slug a state mascot 
i feel really bad that he vetoed it says grace moses 9 
whose blue bird troop worked six weeks lobbying i mean why did 
he have to do that he didnt know anything about it i hope he 
watched the news about it 
deukmejian said he vetoed the bill because the large brilliant 
yellow mollusk which can eat poison oak without getting a rash 
isnt a true californian 
if there is a need to designate a state mollusk it would be 
more appropriate to select one that is indigenous to california and 
perhaps one that is more representative of the international 
reputation that california enjoys he said in his veto message 
the governor added that the dubious honor of being the banana 
slugs home state may belong to wetter neighbors to the north 
since the species was first identified near the mouth of the 
columbia river in oregon and lives as far north as alaska 
but members of the redwood city dynamite blue birds and the 
office of the legislator who carried their slug bill said the 
governor is misinformed about the banana slug which has the 
scientific name ariolimax columbianus and lives in damp coastal 
forest areas throughout the pacific northwest 
janice hopcraft an aide to democratic assemblyman bryon sher 
said four of five kinds of banana slugs are native to california 
i think basically the banana slug has gotten a bad rap said 
hopcraft who wore a yellow armband tuesday in memory of shers 
bill theyre obviously easy to look down upon and they do have 
some odd habits perhaps the governor looked too much at that and 
not their good side 
as far as its representative qualities its absolutely a 
unique example of the diversity of californias wildlife 
deukmejian a republican whos made a personal campaign of 
promoting california trade nationally and overseas suggested the 
golden state may not need an official slug at all 
and if california must have a mollusk hed prefer the pismo 
clam black abalone red abalone turban shell twospotted 
octupus common squid or another breed of mussel unique to the 
state 
california has several official mascots including a tree a 
fossil a reptile a fish a rock and even a state insect in 
addition to the usual bird animal and flower the legislature sent 
a bill to the governor monday that would designate the square dance 
as the official folk dance and the west coast swing or jitterbug 
as the official dance 
deukmejian has not acted on that measure 
the banana slug gained notoriety a few years ago when students 
at the university of california santa cruz chose it as the 
official school mascot over the sea lion despite the objections of 
the universitys president

to firefighters on the 
front lines breathing the smoke is like going through four packs 
of cigarettes a day but for those elsewhere in yellowstone it 
poses little danger doctors say 
i think the main thing is its much more an irritant said 
dr osman sawyer who works at the old faithful medical clinic in 
the nations oldest national park 
allan pardee a retiree from casa grande ariz who spends 
summers working in a general store at old faithful can attest to 
the irritation 
whenever we get these inversions wed get all choked up 
pardee said monday when he came to the clinic seeking relief the 
last few days its been really bad 
we like to walk back and forth to work he continued its 
about threequarters of a mile but its gotten so bad that by the 
time we got to work we could hardly talk to anybody 
pardees decision to turn to the clinic came on the second 
straight day of a weather inversion that trapped smoke from fires 
five miles away over the old faithful complex at times during the 
twoday period the smoke was so heavy that nearby ridges were 
obscured 
we tried bandanas and it worked better than nothing he said 
tek kilgore a nurse offered him some surgical masks 
this may just let us stay a little longer pardee said on 
the way back to work 
smoke conditions in the park were moderate to heavy throughout 
the day tuesday 
while in past days the smoke has hung over old faithful like a 
dense morning mist sawyer and kilgore havent seen a rise in the 
number of patients 
for one thing said kilgore tourism has gone down as the fires 
have churned up and those tourists who have serious respiratory 
conditions likely have stayed away 
while there are no official figures for august preliminary 
statistics show a 15 to 20 percent decline in tourism during the 
first two weeks of the month 
the drop in patients has been noteable kilgore said during 
normal summers 2530 people seek help at the clinic each day 
compared with just two to five now said kilgore 
most who have come have had minor respiratory problems said 
sawyer 
for those people away from the fire lines the smokes biggest 
harm is from irritating particulates said sawyer 
its not the same in terms of lung injuries he said its 
probably no different than living in denver or la

israels shutdown of arab labor federations 
with 80000 workers and an association of 108 charities is 
disrupting institutions that palestinians hope will form the basis 
of a future state 
palestinians charge that destroying grassroots organizations is 
the whole object of israels move coming after the outlawing of 
the socalled popular committees that have guided the 8monthold 
uprising against israeli occupation 
they want them closed so when a palestinian state comes it 
will find no infrastructure said walid asali head of the 
palestinian lawyers association one of seven professional groups 
shut by the israelis 
israeli authorities accuse the organizations involved of being 
fronts for yasser arafats palestine liberation organization they 
claim the groups distribute funds recruit members or organize 
protests against israeli rule 
an army order closed the palestinians federation of labor last 
thursday the professional groups a day later and the palestinian 
charities association last sunday all were shut for one year 
the professional organizations represent a total of 10000 
doctors lawyers dentists pharmacists veterinarians engineers 
and agricultural specialists the labor federation groups 55 unions 
with 70000 members and covers almost the whole palestinian work 
force 
col renaan gissin deputy israeli army spokesman said the two 
institutions and the charity association were ideal conduits for 
the plo underground providing offices workers and communications 
links 
in the past month they became more and more active and were 
being used by the plo he said 
gissin noted that the groups became more important when the 
government recently outlawed socalled popular committees which 
had taken over local government functions such as street cleaning 
the committees also organized demonstrations and enforced 
compliance with general strike calls the army arrested more than 
300 of the groups leaders 
gissin said the plo also was trying to tighten its grip on 
social groups that had been linked to jordan until king hussein 
announced july 31 that he was cutting adminstrative ties with the 
occupied west bank 
ghassan ayoub a member of the labor federations 13member 
executive committee denied the group was working for the plo but 
acknowledged that some of its activities furthered the uprising 
the federation negotiated agreements with palestinian factories 
that guaranteed workers would be paid for days when they took part 
in general strikes ayoub said 
he said the group also guaranteed full or partial pay for people 
unable to reach their work place because of curfews imposed by 
israel 
ayoub said the agreements had nothing to do with the plo but 
were protections that any union would seek for its members we 
are unionists not politicians 
he said the federations main task was to provide health 
insurance to members and assistance to families whose breadwinners 
lost their jobs or were injured in the unrest which has claimed 
255 palestinian lives since it began dec 8 four israelis also 
have died 
raed abu sabra another federation official said the union 
group also makes monthly payments of about 120 to families of 
workers jailed by israel 
clayton yeutter the us trade representative said last week 
that the united states was reviewing israels special trade status 
after the americanarab antidiscrimination committee complained of 
indiscriminate closures of palestinian unions 
but israeli officials said the complaint did not recognize 
israels security concerns and gissin said the government tried to 
be sensitive to the social functions of the institutions 
we have to think twice because the groups serve other 
functions such as improving social conditions and social welfare 
he said we dont want to stop those activities but when it 
involves the plo we have no choice 
both ayoub and asali of the lawyers association said the 
closing down of their offices would not stop their work on behalf 
of laborers and professionals ayoub said offices of the 
federations various unions remained open throughout the west bank 
but the two said seizure of union documents from the offices 
would impede their organizations work 
ayoub also said workers committees were afraid to meet because 
of earlier arrests of labor leaders 
he also said he israel might close union medical clinics gissin 
said no such action would be taken 
the 42yearold ayoub was released three weeks ago after more 
than four months in jail he was held under a law that does not 
require charges to be filed but he said he was accused of being a 
member of fatah the mainstream plo faction 
he said neither he nor the federation was connected to fatah 
but added we want our independent state and we feel its our 
right to say so

a northwest airlines flight en route from 
san francisco to detroit made an emergency landing here tuesday 
after fumes from a west german tourists empty gasoline can filled 
the cabin authorities said 
cal clegg fbi special agent for utah said the flight was 
diverted after the crew smelled the fumes 
without knowing the full details they decided to divert the 
plane to salt lake clegg said 
he said a west german tourist whose name and hometown were not 
available was interviewed and authorities determined it was an 
innocent mistake 
in a nutshell one of the passengers a west german who had 
been touring the united states had taken on board with him what 
was an apparently empty gas can that still had vapors in it 
clegg said during compression and decompression the vapors 
emitted into the cabin area 
clegg said the tourist who was traveling alone had rented a 
car earlier and ran out of gas 
he had purchased this can and then decided to take it home to 
west germany with him because he had paid for it and apparently 
they dont have metal gasoline cans in west germany just 
plastic clegg said 
he said he was unsure how the man got past security guards 
before boarding the plane the can was in carryon luggage in a 
plastic bag with souvenirs he said 
according to everybody we interviewed out there the 
individual was totally cooperative clegg said he apologized 
and everything else there were no threats made no hostile action 
on his part in any way 
frank ratliff airport operations manager said the flight left 
salt lake city about 530 pm mdt and the man was released 
although he was not on the flight 
he will be on another flight ratliff said we will not 
file charges and it will be turned over to the faa 
clegg said the flight had originated in seattle but al stuart 
airport operations supervisor said the flight began in san 
francisco

theres probably no way for national tv talk 
shows to completely safeguard themselves against determined 
hoaxers say the producers of three shows that featured guests 
who turned out to be phonies 
two parttime actors said tuesday they posed as people with 
sexual problems to get on national television putting one over on 
oprah winfrey sally jessy raphael and gerald rivera 
tani freiwald 37 and wes bailey 33 both of chicago appeared 
tuesday on yet another talk show cbs this morning 
after you go through the first one they get really easy 
ms freiwald said 
ms freiwald said she first appeared in november on the oprah 
winfrey show in chicago posing as a woman who had been married 
14 years and hated sex 
i dont see anyway we could have double checked this guests 
ms freiwalds story based on the fact that she was presented to 
us on a doctors referral said debra dimaio winfreys executive 
producer 
i consider it to be an isolated incident i dont think there 
are a lot of people who want to come on national television and 
create a personal problem thats probably considered embarrassing 
by the general public 
bailey and ms freiwald said they were asked to appear on the 
talk shows by a chicago psychologistauthor dean c dauw for whom 
ms freiwald was working as an office manager 
he asked me to do it because the surrogates he does have 
working for him are neither presentable or articulate enough to 
go on television ms freiwald said 
dauw did not return calls to his home or office but he was 
quoted by the omaha worldherald as saying that ms freiwald worked 
as an office manager and a sex surrogate a standin sexual partner 
employed by a therapist and bailey was a client and that they were 
not acting 
in may ms freiwald and bailey appeared on the sally jessy 
raphael show which originates from new haven conn with bailey 
posing as an impotent husband and ms freiwald as his sex 
surrogate in july they appeared on geraldo bailey playing a 
35yearold virgin and ms freiwald a sex surrogate 
bailey said the only time he was worried during the talkshow 
stints was when raphael assured the studio audience that the two 
were not actors reproducing a scene 
there was a little clenching in the stomachs but weve 
both been performers all our adult lives bailey said 
burt dubrow raphaels executive producer said the show was 
simply duped despite its safeguards 
how do you know youre really talking to burt dubrow he 
asked during a telephone interview you dont we have basically 
the same procedures as you do we go to people who are credible and 
legitimate in this particular case we went to a doctor who wrote 
seven books we asked him if he knew of a sex surrogate and he 
found someone who worked for him hes claiming as early as 
this morning to me that she is a sex surrogate so we dont know 
exactly where we stand 
rivera reacted angrily monday when he learned the real 
identities of his guests 
these people are admitting now to having committed fraud or at 
least misrepresentation and were going to go after them 
rivera said 
this is something that goes right to the integrity of the 
broadcast itself im really spitting mad 
delia fine his senior producer said guests are often found 
with the help of experts and organizations and then put through a 
rigorous preinterview process 
if someone really has the intention to put one over on you 
im not sure what all the safeguards are to protect yourself she 
said 
ms fine said guests sign a release that says basically 
theyre going to be telling the truth 
we absolutely try and do everything we can do but if someone 
is determined to do it there always are ways to get through said 
lorri benson senior producer of donahue which was not a 
victim this time 
thank god we werent involved in this one but it does i 
think hurt everybodys credibility

winstonsalem nc ap antismoking activists are urging the 
federal government to regulate a hightech lowsmoke cigarette 
developed by rj reynolds tobacco co that hits three cities for 
testmarketing soon 
im not at all surprised that they announced the 
testmarketing said john banzhaf executive director of action 
on smoking and health based in washington dc they wanted to 
get a jump on it after all its a lot more difficult to get the 
genie back in the bottle after the fact 
reynolds tobacco announced tuesday that the new cigarette which 
simulates smoking by heating a flavor capsule instead of burning 
tobacco will be testmarketed in st louis phoenix and tucson 
ariz starting oct 1 
reynolds one of the nations largest cigarette manufacturers 
and a subsidiary of atlantabased rjr nabisco inc began selling 
the new brand premier this week to distributors supermarkets and 
discount chains in the cities 
while it will cost about 25 percent more or about 30 cents a 
pack than the companys other brands reynolds believes it could 
become its bestselling brand the company will use a variety of 
messages including one that touts the cigarette as premier the 
cleaner smoke 
banzhaf said about two dozen antismoking groups met with food 
and drug administration officials recently to urge the agency to 
regulate the cigarette 
joyce taylor branch director of the arizona lung association in 
tucson said that if the fda doesnt get involved smokers wont 
know what theyre inhaling 
my theory is that regardless of what company officials are 
saying if theyre going to light it theyre still going to have 
carbon monoxide which is one of the major irritants in smoke and 
nicotine she said 
theyre not telling us whats in that packet they dont want 
the fda to be involved because then they would have to tell 
everybody what they put into tobacco smoke 
company officials however are not making any health claims 
which could invite scrutiny by the fda 
if a product is sold with claims to make cigarettes safer it 
is a medical device and subject to fda approval said william 
grigg an agency spokesman 
this is not a safe or safer cigarette said richard kampe 
president of reynolds development divison its a cleaner 
cigarette he said the term smokeless cigarette used by the 
media to describe the product is a misnomer 
the cigarette contains a packet of tobacco extracts that is 
heated not burned through a carbon heat source lit at the 
tip the result is a cigarette without odor and only a trace of ash 
or smoke that could irritate people nearby kampe said 
it reduces many of the controversial compounds associated with 
burning cigarettes and virtually eliminates sidestream smoke he 
said

peruvian sailors broke the pacifics surface 
gasping and screaming from pain after a rapid 110foot ascent 
from their sunken submarine which was running out of fresh air a 
navy officer said 
the peruvian navy said tuesday that one of the sailors died of 
the bends on monday but that the others were recovering 
the navy originally said 21 sailors were saved saturday with a 
ussupplied diving bell that brought them slowly to the surface 
but the officer who participated in the rescue operation said 
tuesday that the diving bell did not arrive in time for the trapped 
crewmen who would surely have died if they did not use a 
dangerous escape chamber similar to a torpedo tube 
the officer speaking on condition of anonymity said that after 
their escape the men suffering from severe cases of the bends 
were rushed in speedboats to decompression chambers on shore 
four other sailors were killed shortly after the japanese 
fishing boat kyowa maru rammed the submarine pacocha on friday 
three miles off the callao harbor causing the vessel to sink in 15 
minutes 
the navy said 45 sailors of the 52 sailors aboard either were 
rescued or survived by jumping into the water as the submarine went 
down 
three sailors are still missing and presumed dead 
the submarines commander daniel nieve and three crewmen were 
killed shortly after the crash the navy said nieve led the 
evacuation but died sealing a hatch to protect the men inside 
the navy officer who spoke with the associated press gave this 
account 
rescuers reached the site at 8 pm and divers swam to the 
crippled pacocha shortly after midnight the vessel was half full 
of water and divers did not think anyone was alive 
divers tapped in code on the crippled submarines hull which 
drew a response and the trapped crewmen began communicating with 
divers via a message hatch on the crafts side 
they said they had food and air and everyone was calm the 
officer said 
at 8 am saturday navy officials decided to await help from the 
united states and a speciallydesigned diving bell was due late 
saturday night 
but air supplies dwindled faster than expected and toxic gas 
from the vessels flooded batteries began seeping into the dry 
compartment where the sailors had sealed themselves 
attempts to inject air from another submarine failed 
at 930 am the trapped crewmen sent a message saying they 
needed air and were going to attempt to escape the vessel using an 
emergency pressure chamber a lifethreatening maneuver even if 
successful 
four men at a time wearing life preservers and masks crammed 
into a tiny chamber similar to a torpedo tube sealed themselves 
from the craft allowed in water to equalize pressure with the 
ocean and opened a hatch 
an instant earlier they emptied their lungs of air because a 
rapid release of pressure at the surface could explode their lungs 
divers waited outside the sub and aimed the crewmen toward the 
surface the sailors shot more than 100 feet in 30 seconds pushed 
up by their life preservers 
they came up gasping and screaming from pain due to the 
tremendous pressure change the officer said 
the first group which escaped at about 1030 am was followed 
by groups every hour or two the final three hit the surface at 
615 pm more than 22 hours after the submarine sank 
one of the 21 crewmen died monday from a cerebral embulism 
caused by his ascent from the ocean floor but officials said the 
others appeared out of danger 
the bends or decompression sickness is caused by the formation 
of nitrogen bubbles in the blood or body tissues as the result of a 
sudden lowering of atmospheric pressure it is characterized by 
tightness in the chest by pains in the joints and by convulsions 
and collapse in severe cases

drawn by adventure and hopes of big 
profits floridas 238 newly licensed alligator hunters are getting 
ready to begin the states first legal gator hunt in 26 years 
more than 5000 novice and skilled hunters alike scrambled to 
apply for the permits after game officials announced the hunt 
designed to trim an alligator population that was once threatened 
by poachers but is now an estimated at 1 million 
wideeyed amateurs will be stalking freshwater swamps lakes and 
streams with hopes of cashing in on their catch which can bring as 
much as 1000 for a 10foot gators skin and meat 
but some experts are wondering if the permit holders really know 
what theyre in for 
you got to laugh when you hear these people say theyre going 
to make money off this hunt said 37yearold dale dunaway who 
operates one of floridas few alligator processing plants 
they dont figure in the time expenses and dont forget the 
danger dunaway said tuesday id like to see some peoples 
faces the first time a gator takes a bite at their airboat 
for 30 days beginning at sunset thursday the randomly selected 
permit holders will be allowed to hunt in designated areas where 
the gator population is extraordinarily high 
waterfront residents all over florida called for a hunt against 
the carnivorous reptiles after a 10foot bull gator killed 
4yearold erin glover in the gulf coast community of englewood in 
june 
but game officials have placed tight restrictions on the hunt 
permit holders will be working at night when flashlights make the 
reptiles eyes glow eerily red and they are not allowed to use 
guns relying on clubs traps and hooks attached to poles 
the harvest is limited to up to 3435 gators with each hunter 
limited to 15 gators each 
we expect to be up nonstop from thursday until about monday 
either skinning or hunting dunaway said at his 2yearold 
processing operation in this remote southwest florida town were 
gonna be looking at a lot of dead gators 
skinning an average alligator is a full days work dunaway 
reckons 
first he plunges his hunting knife through the gators thick 
hide at the tip of its tail then its a slow and difficult cut to 
the snout 
you got to look at it as an hour a foot to properly skin and 
gut a gator said dunaway theres no way around it its hard 
work you bet 
some of the experienced hunters will be permitted to use the 
equipment at the gator house a cement frame enclosed by screen 
wire and decorated by deer antlers 
but the novice trappers will have to sit and watch their catch 
be pried apart 
alligators are cut up the back to preserve the valuable hide 
covering the belly and underarms said dunaway the hide which 
sells for about 42 a foot to foreign manufacturers is submerged 
in a brine solution for about a week 
the excess flesh is then scraped off and the skin is sun dried 
and we bury the innards as far away as possible said 
dunaway they got a powerful smell and if you ever cut open the 
stomach you better start running 
the meat which dunaway says makes a nice addition to spaghetti 
sauce must be frozen within hours after the alligator is killed 
one 12foot gator bought to the plant in 1986 yielded 230 pounds of 
meat 
youre fixing to eat gator for a long time with a catch like 
that said dunaways 24yearold brother grant 
yet the gator business is just a hobby for the dunaways and 
their uncle william busby 36 all will take vacation time from 
their jobs to process the gators 
they say the best they can do charging a 30 fee and 2 a pound 
is break even 
we just like it out here with the gators said grant

two soviets and the first afghan in space docked 
their soyuztm 6 capsule with the mir orbiting space station today 
joining two soviet cosmonauts who have been in space more than 
eight months tass reported 
the staterun news agency said the capsule linked up with the 
space station at 941 am moscow time 141 am edt 
the cosmonauts feel well tass said in a brief dispatch 
the capsule launched two days ago from the baikonur space 
center in soviet central asia carried a veteran cosmonaut a 
doctor and an afghan air force pilot 
soviet television showed a live transmission of the crew 
entering the space station and meeting with the cosmonauts already 
on board 
afghan cosmonaut abdul ahad mohmand was shown reading portions 
of the koran the moslem holy book 
the cosmonauts who have been aboard mir for eight months have 
been reported in good health but dr valery polyakov will stay on 
to monitor their health as they try to set an endurance record 
tass did not say how long mohmand and the third new arrival 
vladimir lyakhov would remain aboard the station with its crew 
polyakov an expert on space endurance is to monitor the health 
of vladimir titov 40 and musa manarov 37 who have been in space 
since dec 21 and are hoping to break a 326day endurance record 
set by yuri romanenko 
tass said polyakov had bone marrow removed before the flight 
when he returns to earth more marrow is to be removed and the 
samples compared 
scientists are trying to determine how to counter bone marrow 
depletion which results from prolonged space flight polyakov also 
will study motion sickness 
space officials say the endurance tests are a step toward 
determining whether a manned flight to mars which they estimate 
would take three years is feasible 
mohmand 29 is to take part in experiments to identify oil gas 
and other mineral deposits in afghanistan and to predict runoff of 
snow and ice in efforts to alleviate water shortages 
his presence represents efforts by the kremlin to boost the 
prestige of afghanistans prosoviet government as soviet troops 
withdraw the soviets have agreed to withdraw all their troops by 
feb 15 half of the 100000 soldiers have left afghanistan since 
withdrawal began in may 
the flight is the 47yearold lyakhovs third space mission he 
was in space for 175 days in 1979 and took part in a 150day 
mission in 1983

prime time tv characters this fall will begin 
turning down drinks in a coordinated assault on drunken driving 
initiated by harvard university health researchers 
makebelieve wives will designate makebelieve husbands as 
nondrinking drivers teenagers who drink will take taxis and for 
the next few years polltakers will be trying to find out if viewers 
are coming under the influence of the push for a designated 
driver 
the goal of the project is to achieve a fundamental change in 
american social norms regarding drinking and driving jay 
winsten assistant dean of harvards school of public health and 
director of its center for health communication said tuesday night 
in attempting to achieve that change were asking the 
entertainment communication and advertising industries to work 
with us to add momentum behind changes that are already beginning 
to occur in america he said of the harvard alcohol project 
winsten said the commitment was made by 13 television studios in 
los angeles that are responsible for more than 70 percent of prime 
time weekly programming on abc cbs and nbc 
the executives pledged to ask their writers and producers to 
introduce in their scripts the notion that drinking and driving is 
taboo through devices as simple as having drinkers take taxis or 
saying no thanks im driving 
winsten said if the television campaign succeeds others will be 
tried but drunken driving was the priority he said reciting 
these statistics drunken driving kills 24000 people each year 
studies show as few as two drinks can make a fatal accident twice 
as likely two of five americans will be victims of a drunken 
driver 
in january winsten began meeting with hollywood executives to 
forge the agreements in april he won a unanimous endorsement from 
the board of the writers guild of americawest whose members write 
for prime time tv 
the networks also agreed to run public service announcements in 
december to encourage the designated driver idea the new york 
times reported today 
the new york advertising firm saatchi amp saatchi dfs compton 
has provided advertising research on the designated driver idea 
and the gallup organization said it will donate its services to 
poll the public to find out whether the tv campaign is working the 
newspaper said 
gallup research shows that 78 percent of all drivers would be 
willing to serve occasionally as designated drivers 
winsten said the campaign will continue for at least three to 
five years before its real impact will be known 
the campaign has precedents he said television networks during 
the past year or two have been using their characters to encourage 
the use of seatbelts and to try to take the glamour out of alcohol 
but winsten said he believed this was the first such effort 
mobilized by a school of public health

four councilmen refused a third time to 
change their votes against a housing desegregation plan as 
requests from them and the city to continue a stay of contempt 
fines went to the us supreme court 
unless the supreme court takes their side the defiant 
councilmen will be hit with criminal charges the state agency that 
has taken over yonkers finances warned tuesday 
its the city councilmen who are defying the law and putting 
the citys financial profile at risk who are putting all the 
citizens of yonkers at risk said gail shaffer head of the 
states emergency financial control board 
the 500aday fines against the councilmen along with 
potentially devastating fines against the city that could reach 1 
million a day were imposed by federal judge leonard sand he found 
them in contempt aug 2 the day after the councils first 43 
rejection of the courtordered plan 
on friday a federal appeals panel upheld the contempt finding 
but gave yonkers a week to take the case to the supreme court 
before reinstating the penalties 
justice thurgood marshall on tuesday referred the four 
applications from the councilmen and one from the city to the full 
supreme court according to a court spokesman who gave no 
indication when the court might rule on a stay 
only after a stay is granted would the court consider the appeal 
of sands contempt finding 
at the city councils regular meeting tuesday night councilmen 
henry spallone nicholas longo edward fagan and peter chema again 
rejected a zoning amendment needed to carry out a housing plan that 
the council had accepted last january 
the rev jesse jackson during a visit to yonkers said the city 
must end its illegal resistance to the plan he added that he 
would be willing to meet with the four but would not specify when 
that would happen 
three of the four said they would be happy to meet with jackson 
while spallone said have him call me 
sand ordered the plan to remedy what he determined in a 1985 
ruling to have been 40 years of deliberate segregation in housing 
and education in the city 
the plan calls for 200 lowincome public housing units to be 
built in the predominantly white east side of yonkers with 800 
moderateincome apartments to be built throughout the city 
unless a stay is granted the fines currently suspended will 
be reimposed friday the councilmen have paid 3500 each the city 
has paid 12700 its daily payment would resume at 12800 and 
double daily until it reaches 1 million a day when it will be 
capped 
that would give the city an estimated 70 days until bankruptcy 
shaffer said that if the supreme court appeal is turned down 
she will notify district attorney carl vergari that the councilmen 
are breaking state law by endangering the citys fiscal stability 
the four already face possible imprisonment as early as sunday 
for contempt 
i feel it is unfortunate that people elected to uphold the law 
and defend the law are breaking and defying the law shaffer said 
her remarks came a day after gov mario cuomo said he would 
initiate removal proceedings and urge the councilmens jailing if 
the supreme court refused the stay

criminal charge each for a scheme in which lytle allegedly took 
kickbacks in exchange for arranging to have continental buy 
millions of dollars in risky energy loans from penn square 
penn square failed in 1982 and continental illinois nearly 
collapsed two years later after an unprecedented run on its 
deposits continental was kept afloat by a 45 billion government 
bailout

concerned about his family he had sought a sentence of probation 
and community service 
im sorry for the people in chicago and oklahoma he said 
i think of that a lot 
pattersons attorney burck bailey said after the sentencing 
were relieved to have it behind us 
lytle testifying before his sentencing said he accepted 
responsibility for his actions he asked the judge to sentence him 
to no more than six months in prison and assign him to work with 
the poor on chicagos west side 
but the judge said lytle seemed at times unwilling to 
confront the realities of what he had done 
you allowed your conduct as a bank officer to be driven 
impermissibly by your desire for personal benefits shadur said 
lytle pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank funds while 
patterson pleaded guilty to a charge that he aided and abetted 
lytle the pleas came two months after a trial of the two ended 
with a deadlocked jury

man oklahoma drilling contractor jere sturgis in schemes to save 
his own failing bank sturgis was acquitted of wire fraud charges

sister barbara hawkins the principal of 
josephinum high school once thought shed have to hold a memorial 
service not a birthday party when the allgirls school turns 100 
in two years 
the school on the citys rough west side was set to close as 
recently as 1985 but the sisters of christian charity 
underestimated the will of alumni parents and corporations who 
opened their wallets to help keep the roman catholic school alive 
today the donations are increasing and enrollment has soared 50 
percent for now sister hawkins says the school is in good 
condition no longer on the critical list 
were growing says assistant principal ron rescigno who 
often makes a recruiting pitch from church pulpits in the mostly 
hispanic neighborhood when parents come in with their kids they 
say they cant tolerate the public schools 
the longstanding troubles in chicagos public school system have 
indeed helped josephinum where only about half of the 310 students 
are catholic 
frustrated by teacher strikes and violence and concerned about 
the quality of a system labeled one of the nations worst by 
outgoing us education secretary william bennett many parents are 
sending children elsewhere 
thats a repeated story sister hawkins said we had 48 
students who transferred here last year theyve been to public 
school they didnt do well theyre intimidated 
at josephinum theres no graffiti on the walls and the floors 
shine like the chrome on a wellpolished chevy 
register at the jo a sign reads in the lobby students say 
theyre glad they did 
evette sanchez an 18yearold senior failed her freshman year 
at a public school so she enrolled at josephinum and started from 
scratch 
since ive been here my grades are up miss sanchez said 
tuesday the second day of the new academic year although its 
all girls its fun teachers in public schools dont care they 
just get paid 
sophomore patrina ross 15 said its not too large the 
teachers are all concerned everyone has friends 
a glance at the composite photos of josephinum graduates 
provides proof of the neighborhoods changing face in the 
mid1960s when enrollment reached an alltime high of 850 the 
school was filled mostly with the daughters of polish german and 
ukrainian immigrants 
today those ethnic eastern europeans have been replaced by a 
student body that is 50 percent black and 37 percent hispanic many 
of them from families with low incomes and little education 
about half of this years students have grants ranging from 100 
to 500 to help cover the annual tuition of 1295 sister hawkins 
calls them workstudy scholarships 
they just dont get money handed to them she said 
theyre assigned to a teacher they might clean a room might run 
off papers staple things together 
the tough neighborhood rescigno says gives the school the 
quality of an oasis 
many come from very poor backgrounds problems that we cant 
even imagine he said were like a haven seven or eight hours 
a day especially if your fathers a pusher or your mother walks 
the street 
to keep financially afloat the school now has a development 
director during the 198687 academic year 670 donors gave 
96000 a year later the amount grew to 169000 
kraft inc gave 10000 to help josephinum produce a music video 
that rescigno will use during his recruiting stops at area 
elementary schools trips that some day might boost enrollment to 
400 students

the dollar rose in european trading this morning 
after senior japanese officials said their country is leaving its 
base rate unchanged in keeping with international policy 
commitments 
gold prices fell because of the stronger dollar dealers said 
foreign exchange dealers predicted a relatively quiet session as 
the market waits for fridays release of us unemployment figures 
traders in italy said they expected the dollar to register 
further gains against the japanese yen because of the decision not 
to raise interest rates 
its logical that if interest rates rise in the us and most 
of europe and not in japan then the yen has to suffer the only 
surprise is that the effect was delayed said a trader with an 
italian commercial bank in milan 
the trader cautioned however that the dollars rise against 
the yen could be blocked by profittaking or fears of intervention 
by the bank of japan 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar rose 058 yen to a closing 13497 yen later in 
london it rose to 13650 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with the rates late 
tuesday

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini declared that 
irans war with iraq is not over and accused the united states and 
the soviet union of plotting against the islamic republic tehran 
radio reported 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati meanwhile accused 
iraq of seeking to wreck peace talks in geneva by raising 
unnecessary or outofplace issues both men spoke tuesday 
in baghdad the althawra daily mouthpiece of the ruling baath 
socialist party charged that irans insistence it share the vital 
shattalarab waterway with iraq was hampering the negotiations 
it accused tehran of seeking to string out the talks to buy 
time to rebuild its military forces 
iran and iraq have been observing a ceasefire since aug 20 
the war began in september 1980 
khomeinis comments came as the geneva talks under un auspices 
were suspended because of differences over troop withdrawals and 
shattalarab iraqs only outlet to the sea 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia said khomeini urged iranians 
to man the front lines in the nowdormant persian gulf war but 
also called for a national effort in irans postwar reconstruction 
we must take it that we are still at war the 88yearold 
religious patriarch declared 
he added our enemy be it big enemies such as america and the 
soviet union or their surrogates such as iraqi president saddam 
hussein and others are constantly plotting because they have 
seen how islam has become a major force in the world we must never 
lose sight of that fact 
irans staterun television network also monitored in nicosia 
showed khomeini sitting on a sofa at his home in the north tehran 
suburb of jamaran meeting with president ali khamenei prime 
minister hussein musavi and other senior figures 
khomeini noted it is possible that the enemy pretends now 
that the problem has been solved but its not true people who are 
against us still exist and their numbers are large we should not 
trust anything 
khomeini said that reconstruction of irans missilebattered 
cities and damaged industrial centers could not be accomplished in 
a short time 
they pounded us for eight years and destroyed our cities we 
must persevere so that god willing we may be able to do the job 
in a few years the people should cooperate and bring all their 
power to bear on this major issue 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
cyprus said in a commentary that baghdads claim of sovereignty 
over the 120mile shattalarab waterway the southern border 
between the two countries before the war was the main stumbling 
block in the geneva talks 
the iraqis have said they consider the 1975 algiers agreement 
which drew the boundary down the middle of the waterway as invalid 
and claim the frontier should be on the eastern iranian bank 
saddam tore up the algiers document during a television 
appearance five days before the iraqi army invaded iran on sept 
22 1980 
iran insists that the algiers agreement is still valid

the rev jesse jackson and mayor edward i koch 
invoking democratic unity in november moved to set aside bad 
feelings stemming from kochs criticism of the former presidential 
candidate in the new york primary 
the two were scheduled to meet today at the new york city office 
of gov mario cuomo who arranged the meeting apparently to unify 
their support for the democratic presidential nominee 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis 
koch noting that dukakis has slipped in the polls since the 
republican convention said tuesday weve got to get that surge 
back 
in fact it may very well be that the surge will start with 
the meeting that jesse jackson and i have tomorrow if we jointly 
come out of that meeting united the mayor said but he added 
we have issues that separate us no question about it 
jackson during a visit tuesday to homeless people maintaining a 
vigil at city hall park said there would be no discussion at 
todays meeting about kochs strong criticism of him in aprils new 
york primary 
koch strongly endorsed sen albert gore jr of tennessee in the 
democratic presidential primary and just as strongly opposed 
jackson suggesting that jews would be crazy to vote for 
jackson because of his support for palestinian selfdetermination 
in the middle east blacks all over the country reacted with 
outrage as did many jews 
on monday jackson said that although the mayor operated 
beneath the dignity of that office the need for democratic unity 
in november overrode other considerations

depression and disabling fatigue he said he sometimes felt 
uncontrollably violent paranoid and suicidal 
after a week off steroids he told doctors that he couldnt bear 
his depression fatigue and drug craving and intended to resume 
taking the drugs 
some of the clinical features of this patient resemble those 
frequently observed in cases of opioid dependence the doctors 
wrote

health projects medical group in west covina calif david l 
black of vanderbilt child and adolescent psychiatric hospital in

president daniel ortega announced a 
new currency devaluation and wage increases to shore up an economy 
he said has been damaged by us support for the contra rebels 
ortega gave few details in a 40minute speech tuesday on 
staterun radio but said the measures would increase production and 
permit survival while working toward peace in nicaragua 
a source who attended a closeddoor meeting in planning minister 
alejandro martinez cuencas office after the speech said the 
government devalued its currency the cordoba from 80 to 180 per 
1 at the official rate 
the leftist sandinista government normally conducts its foreign 
trade at the official rate 
wage hikes range from 60 percent for state agricultural workers 
to 35 percent for urban government workers the source said the 
average worker earned about 16 a month before the raise 
the new exchange rate will stimulate exports and the salary 
adjustments come as the first crops arrive at the markets said 
the progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario 
ortega said the measures were in line with reforms enacted in 
february when inflation was running at an annual rate of more than 
1300 percent 
among those measures the government issued a new currency 
valued at 10 per dollar in june it removed most wage and price 
controls 
ortega also updated the casualty toll to 54000 in the 
sevenyear civil war between the sandinistas and the contras he 
said that figure included 28000 dead and damages of 12 billion 
but he did not break down casualties among government forces 
contras and civilians 
the nicaraguan people pay a high cost to be able to defend the 
revolutionary process he said the economic measures have a 
political basis and have to be seen in the revolutionary process 
which has a socialist orientation 
ortega renewed his call for direct talks with the united states 
last held in 1984 
we have insisted on direct talks with the yankee government to 
discuss national security issues not internal subjects and we 
maintain that position he said 
the united states has rejected the idea of direct talks with the 
sandinistas who signed a preliminary ceasefire agreement with the 
contras in march but saw peace talks break off in june

thousands of people are fleeing civil war 
and food shortages in the southern sudan and many die during the 
trek northward or in floodravaged refugee camps an opposition 
party said 
an irish relief official says millions of people face starvation 
in the south 
a statement issued by the union of sudanese african parties a 
grouping of southern political parties did not specify how many 
people who fled the fierce fighting and famine in the south were 
dying 
i would not say by the thousands but they are dying said a 
spokesman who spoke on condition of anomymity 
the statement quoted the bishop of elobeid capital of 
kordofan 225 miles southwest of khartoum as saying people were 
flocking by the hundreds every day asking for food and help to 
continue their journey northward 
this shows you how the food shortages and the long journey 
which in some cases is done on foot can kill women children and 
old people the statement said 
the rev aengus finucane director of the dublinbased aid 
agency concern called for airlifts of food to regions of the 
country made inaccessible by the 5yearold war 
two million people are facing death from the ravages of war 
and starvation finucane said at dublin airport after returning 
from a twoweek visit to khartoum sudans capital 
trains carrying thousands of living skeletons were arriving 
in the north every few days and hundreds of other refugees trekked 
on foot to camps he said 
about 40 people per day were dying at refugee camps at el 
meriam 500 miles from khartoum said finucane his organization 
has 34 workers in sudan 
in 1983 the sudan peoples liberation army made up mainly of 
christians and animists took up arms against the moslem majority 
government in the north the spla claims to control 90 percent of 
the countryside in the south with the army in command only in the 
major cities 
fighting between the army and the rebels has forced an estimated 
820000 southerners to leave their crops and cattle behind and seek 
shelter around the cities in sudan and neighboring ethiopia where 
they become totally dependent on relief food for their livelihood 
in khartoum about 400000 refugees live in extreme poverty in 
tin and canvas shacks around the city these shantytowns were among 
the hardest hit areas in the worst floods in the countrys history 
this month that sent the nile river over its banks 
the floods have left 15 million people homeless at least 91 
dead tens of thousands of homes destroyed and some of sudans most 
fertile farmland inundated

rundu southwest africa ap soldiers dismantled a pontoon 
bridge after army trucks carried the last south african troops out 
of angola in an effort to end a 13yearold civil war 
nearly 1000 south african soldiers who supported angolas 
antimarxist guerrillas crossed into southwest africa on tuesday 
said lt gen ian gleeson south africas army chief of staff 
the withdrawal completed the first phase of a usmediated 
ceasefire and peace plan aimed at ending the civil war in angola 
whose marxist government is backed by thousands of cuban troops 
and granting independence to southwest africa which is controlled 
by south africa 
as of this moment we are out of angola gleeson said at a 
ceremony in this town on the angolan border he said there had been 
no truce violations 
south african and foreign journalists were flown to rundu to 
witness the pullout of the last south african forces 
south africa says it will grant independence to southwest 
africa also known as namibia after cuba withdraws its troops from 
angola the cubans reportedly have offered to leave angola in 24 
months 
an estimated 2500 south african troops have gradually retreated 
to namibia after a ceasefire was declared aug 8 the troops 
supported the national union for the total independence of angola 
or unita which controls about onethird of the country 
the united states mediated peace talks and a ceasefire among 
angola cuba and south africa unita also backed by the united 
states is not a party to the agreement 
the four countries involved in the negotiations met last week in 
brazzaville congo but failed to set timetables for withdrawal of 
the estimated 50000 cuban troops in angola and for namibian 
independence another round of talks is planned next week in 
brazzaville 
cuban and angolan officers serving on a ceasefire monitoring 
committee watched as soldiers dismantled the bridge across the 
okavango river while villagers washed their clothes nearby 
the south african trucks crossing into rundu carried troops and 
supplies and some towed giant g5 longrange cannons across the 
shallow river 
many of the vehicles had graffiti scrawled on them such as no 
retreat no surrender and hello mom the troops were greeted 
by a banner that read welcome winners 
gleeson said south africa will not conduct any more raids into 
angola in pursuit of guerrillas of the southwest african peoples 
organization he said swapo which has been fighting to end south 
african rule over southwest africa said it will observe a 
ceasefire starting sept 1 
south africa has intervened in angola regularly since 1975 when 
it invaded the country on the eve of angolan independence from 
portugal south african army officers said their maximum strength 
in angola was 3000 men although other reports claimed the force 
was twice that size during battles in october

a man who killed himself with a pistol 
he bought less than a week earlier said in a suicide note its 
actually scary how easy it is to obtain a handgun in florida his 
mother says 
robert edward park 31 who suffered from depression and had 
been disfigured in an auto accident shot himself in a marietta 
ga hotel last week after mailing the note dated aug 22 to his 
mother 
park had left his boca raton home for marietta after buying the 
gun said his mother elsie banting 
mrs banting said monday she was sure he bought the weapon 
within a week of his suicide she added that showed the need for 
gun control 
im hoping people will read about the death and pay attention 
and get angry she said i think its terrible 
park was critically injured in a 1984 accident that severed an 
ear and broke his jaw in eight places reconstructive surgery 
helped but he still was depressed family members said he was a 
waiter at the time of his death 
i found out very recently how simple it is to buy a gun in 
florida park wrote according to his mother its actually 
scary no wonder the crime rate is so high this may be an 
interesting case for gun control 
last year florida reduced to two days coolingoff periods of 
up to a few weeks for buying a gun and eliminated other 
restrictions on handgun ownership critics including police 
agencies say the change has led to increased violence 
clark had been arrested twice for drunken driving and was facing 
a court appearance when he disappeared he also attempted suicide 
previously slashing his wrists with a meat cleaver said his 
brotherinlaw timothy babbitt

michael dukakis has resurrected the irancontra 
scandal as a campaign issue against george bush and the 
massachusetts governors top adviser said today bush had yet to 
explain his role in the armsforhostages affair 
his role and participation in irancontra and exchange of arms 
with the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran for hostages is a 
very serious issue dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas said 
on cbs this morning he hasnt answered that question 
brountas said theres a very serious issue of george bushs 
judgment when he was supposed to be in charge of fighting the 
battle against terrorism he apparently endorsed a decision 
to trade arms with the ayatollah for hostages which happens to be 
one of the most disastrous events in foreign policy history 
dukakis on tuesday questioned whether bushs failure to block 
the arms deal showed he lacked the judgment to be president 
dukakis noted that bush was head of an antiterrorism task force 
that shortly before the 1985 arms deal with iran issued a report 
warning against concessions to terrorist nations 
the democratic presidential nominee was spending most of today 
at the massachusetts statehouse before flying to california for 
three days of campaigning in western states 
he spent tuesday in western massachusetts on a gubernatorial 
trip but took time to launch his harshest attack on bush to date 
and declare that he was going to respond aggressively to republican 
criticism 
dukakis in a meeting with area editors and later at a news 
conference noted bushs position as head of an antiterrorism task 
force that shortly before the 1985 arms deal with iran issued a 
report warning against concessions to terrorist nations 
the president and the vice president and a number of other 
people over the opposition of the secretary of state and the 
secretary of defense by the way proceeded to do precisely what 
that commission said you should never do dukakis said 
how can you possibly sit there and do nothing while we traded 
arms to a terrorist nation he asked 
at the news conference dukakis cited a new book by maine sens 
william cohen and george mitchell in which they said the republican 
nominee appeared to have endorsed the armsforhostages deal 
making tough decisions is a test of leadership dukakis 
said george bush endorsed the decision to sell arms to iran and 
in doing so he failed that test 
cohen a republican and mitchell a democrat were members of 
the congressional irancontra investigating panel mitchell was 
visiting with dukakis today 
dukakis asked to respond to bushs charges that he was too 
willing to make concession to the soviets in arms negotiations 
said the american people should match his record of making tough 
decisions with that of the vice president 
dukakis mentioned the irancontra affair the reagan 
administrations dealings with panamanian leader gen manuel 
antonio noriega and bushs support of deposed philippine president 
ferdinand marcos in the early 1980s 
i would be very concerned about someone with that kind of 
judgment negotiating with the soviet union dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor also returned bushs rhetorical 
salvos that dukakis was soft on defense and reiterated his 
opposition to the star wars antimissile system two new 
supercarrier task forces and railbased mx missiles 
mr bush says he wants them all dukakis said you cant 
have them all not if youre serious about providing the resources 
our conventional forces need and not if youre serious about 
getting that deficit down 
dukakis characterizing bush as irresponsible on fiscal matters 
mentioned bushs support of the exotic weapons systems 
increased education spending a taxcredit for child care and a 40 
billion cut in the capital gains tax 
that is not a responsible approach to the basic fiscal 
problems or for that matter the national security problems which 
face our country the democratic nominee said 
dukakis also lashed out against bushs record on crime 
whats the bush record whats the dukakis record i dont 
know what the bush record is dukakis said its a blank on 
the rare occasions when the vice president has been asked to do 
something on this subject its been a failure 
dukakis said he wished the campaign rhetoric was focused more on 
major issues but he adopted a more aggressive stance against gop 
attacks which have included questions about dukakis patriotism 
and jokes about his height 
if it continues you have to respond he said i think 
thats unfortunate but i think its very clear what kind of 
campaign the republicans are running and i think were going to 
have to deal with it

the united states said today it was not satisfied 
with the soviet response to its concerns about radar under 
construction in siberia and threatened to take action that could 
terminate or suspend the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
in a statement issued at the close of a oneweek conference 
reviewing the abm treaty the us delegation said the soviet 
union gave no indication that it was prepared to correct its 
violations of the treaty without linking their agreement to do so 
to unacceptable demands 
the statement also made plain that the us side now links 
dismantling of the krasnoyarsk radar to agreement in other arms 
control negotiations in geneva 
the united states has also made clear that the continuing 
existence of the krasnoyarsk radar makes it impossible to conclude 
any future arms agreements in separate negotiations on reducing 
intercontinental nuclear forces known as the start talks and on 
space and defense systems it said 
the soviet union did not immediately issue its own statement 
and the soviet diplomatic mission said a spokesman was not 
immediately available 
the us statement referred to the radar under construction at 
krasnoyarsk in siberia which the united states has long 
maintained constitutes a violation of the abm treaty because it is 
not situated at the edge of the country pointed outward as the 
treaty stipulates such a radar must be 
the statement said the united states has observed a slowdown in 
construction of the radar but insists the radar must be dismantled 
the statement said that the violation is very serious 
especially when it is recognized that the radar constitutes one of 
a network of such radars that have the potential to support 
ballistic missile defenses 
the us side also raised the issue of soviet deployment last 
year of two other radars in gomel near kiev the statement said 
the abm treaty limits each side to deploying one abm system 
comprising a radar and antiballistic missiles and constrains 
radars for early warning which could because of their location 
orientation and capability contribute to an abm defense 
the aim is to prevent either side from creating a full 
countrywide protective network under the theory that neither side 
would launch a nuclear attack if it feared devastating retaliation 
the soviet union has an abm system deployed around moscow the 
united states has not deployed one 
the us statement called the radar a material breach of the 
treaty and said the united states reserves all its rights 
consistent with international law to take appropriate and 
proportionate responses in the future 
the statement did not elaborate on what those responses might 
be but an information sheet distributed last week by the us 
mission says that according to the vienna convention on the law of 
treaties if one party charges material breach it is entitled 
to invoke the breach as a ground for terminating the treaty or 
suspending its operation in whole or in part 
such action would apparently free the united states to conduct 
uninhibited research and deployment of its strategic defense 
initiative currently in the research stage which aims at creating 
a spacebased missile defense 
the soviet union has charged that some sdi research violates the 
abm treaty but in its public statements has not specified where it 
draws the line 
both sides link compliance with the abm treaty to progress at 
other arms control negotiations under way in geneva 
the soviet union has long made agreement on limiting sdi 
research a precondition for a start agreement the united states 
has rejected such a linkage 
the start talks have been going on in geneva since march 1985 
the two sides have agreed in principle on reducing their forces by 
50 percent but many issues remain to be resolved

the simulated failure of space 
shuttle discoverys right engine forced astronauts to shift their 
craft into a low orbit as part of a final rehearsal for the first 
postchallenger mission 
the 56hour simulation began tuesday and involved about 300 
people at johnson space center 
the first thing after launch when they were going into orbit 
the right engine failed so that they had to do whats called abort 
to orbit nasa spokeswoman barbara selby said 
that means the shuttle can still make it into orbit but lower 
than planned so they have to adjust their activities ms selby 
said they did achieve the ato as we call it and made the 
necessary adjustments to continue the mission 
the shuttle crew faced another problem later tuesday when they 
tried to deploy the 100 million communications satellite 
a tilt table used to deploy the satellite stuck at a 24degree 
angle two crewmen were to go outside the orbiter today to manually 
adjust the table to the needed 50degree angle ms selby said 
that simulation was to take place under water 
discoverys fourday mission will be the first shuttle flight 
since the challenger explosion 2 years ago 
commander rick hauck pilot richard covey and mission 
specialists david hilmers mike lounge and george pinky nelson 
are expected to face about 150 simulated problems during the test 
which is to be completed thursday evening 
as many as 200 others are taking part in the rehearsal in new 
mexico and california spokesman brian welch said 
the launch of discovery is slated for late september or early 
october if sluggish oxygen valves and a hydrogen leak are repaired 
in time

vietnam told the united states it is 
willing to resume joint searches for american servicemen missing in 
the vietnam war 
the decision was revealed in an aug 27 letter from foreign 
minister nguyen co thach to retired gen john w vessey a special 
us presidential envoy a text of the letter carried tuesday by 
radio hanoi was seen today in bangkok 
thach told vessey in an aug 3 letter that vietnam was 
temporarily suspending full cooperation because of what he called 
americas hostile policy toward vietnam thach cited assistant 
secretary of state gaston sigurs testimony before a congressional 
committee in july in which sigur urged the continued isolation of 
vietnam 
vessey president reagans envoy on humanitarian issues relating 
to vietnam replied to thach two days later that sigurs testimony 
merely reflected the us administrations longstanding viewpoint 
on relations with vietnam 
he said the united states would continue implementing previous 
agreements with vietnam and its humanitarian aid 
thach replied in his aug 27 letter that the us declaration 
that it will make the normalization of bilateral relations 
conditional upon the settlement of the mia issues is at variance 
with the agreement between vessey and myself 
but he said settlement of humanitarian issues should be 
separated from political issues 
with the desire that the us government will adopt a suitable 
attitude the vietnamese side agrees to let the us side 
participate in joint investigation and survey activities as 
concerns the issue of american mias and is prepared to hold 
meetings of specialists from the two sides to discuss specific 
plans from 9 to 12 september 1988 thach wrote 
thach and vessey agreed in august 1987 that vietnam would 
accelerate its accounting of nearly 1800 americans listed as 
missing in action or mia in the vietnam war and the united 
states would give vietnam humanitarian aid 
thach told vessey in july that vietnam would try to resolve 70 
top priority mia cases by the end of this year and welcomed joint 
excavations and other searches for remains until october there 
have been no joint excavations since the first was conducted in 
late 1985

an explosion early today 
shattered a sixstory office building used by church and 
antiapartheid groups and police said 23 people were injured the 
structure was declared unsafe for further use 
the type of explosive which was believed planted in the 
basement parking garage and the identity of the bombers were not 
known police said 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu blamed the attack on the 
perpetrators or supporters of apartheid 
the injured included passersby residents of nearby apartment 
buildings and employees of the south african council of churches 
the main occupant of the khotso house which means house of peace 
in the zulu language several nearby shops and apartment buildings 
also were heavily damaged 
the rev frank chikane general secretary of the council said 
the blast destroyed the councils fleet of cars parked in a 
basement garage he said police barred workers of khotso house from 
entering the building and expressed concern the councils files 
might be searched 
it was the second explosion to wreck the johannesburg 
headquarters of antiapartheid groups last year the offices of 
the main black labor federation the congress of south african 
trade unions and several of its affiliates was severely damaged 
the union congress described todays bombing as part of a 
continuous campaign against the opponents of apartheid and said 
it had heard nothing from police about investigations of the 1987 
blast at its headquarters 
khotso house serves as headquarters for the council of churches 
and the black sash civil rights group two of the most prominent 
antiapartheid organizations that so far have remained affected by 
government bans 
several other church and human rights groups have offices in the 
building and it housed offices of the united democratic front 
before the nationwide coalition and 17 other groups were banned in 
february 
the church council which represents most major protestant 
denominations except the afrikaneroriented dutch reformed church 
has taken a lead role in the antiapartheid movement since the 
bannings 
tutu a leader of the church council and winner of the 1984 
nobel peace prize for his antiapartheid campaigning said the 
bombing represents a new low in the behavior of those who seek to 
destroy the witness of the church against the evil and unchristian 
policies of the south african government 
chikane said the darkest forces of evil are arranging 
themselves against the church but we intend to continue telling 
the truth 
a fire set off after the blast destroyed gas pipes in the 
basement the floor of the main lobby collapsed into the basement 
and a section of the facade was blasted open strewing rubble into 
the street 
city engineers and fire officials visited the building after the 
explosion at 110 am and declared it unsafe for further 
occupation 
the rev peter storey a methodist minister who formerly was 
president of the church council called the bombing a bestial 
act 
storey later joined chikane at a news conference at a nearby 
methodist church and told journalists the church office had 
received a telephoned bomb threat moments earlier 
last year there was a series of unsolved bombings and arson 
attacks on offices of antiapartheid groups and militant black 
labor unions activists suggested the attacks were carried out by 
rightwing vigilantes either within or outside the security forces 
this year several restaurants and other civilian targets have 
been bombed authorities have blamed the attacks on the outlawed 
african national congress guerrilla movement which seeks to topple 
the whiteminority government 
under apartheid the nations 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
stateofemergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict 
reporting about unrest security force actions treatment of 
detainees some forms of protest and a broad range of statements 
the government considers subversive enforcement of the regulations

iraq attacked kurdish guerrillas in 
northern iraq with at least 60000 troops backed by fighterbombers 
and helicopter gunships dropping poison gas a kurdish spokesman 
said today 
heavy fighting is taking place between our forces and the 
iraqi army on all fronts in the mountains of northeast iraq the 
official of the kurdish democratic party said in a telephone 
interview 
he said the unprecedented iraqi offensive in which villages 
have been burned to the ground was launched monday all across the 
4000 square miles of kurdishheld iraqi territory 
the army is deploying at least 60000 troops with tanks 
aircraft helicopter gunships artillery and chemical weapons he 
said the army is burning down villages and killing people on 
sight and leaving carnage behind the official based in a west 
european capital spoke on condition of anonymity for security 
reasons 
there was no way to confirm the report independently but 
kurdish guerrilla groups have been bracing for an allout iraqi 
offensive for several weeks 
the spokesman said casualty reports were sketchy because radio 
contact with the kurdish stronghold south of the turkish border was 
difficult 
but he said kurdish guerrillas destroyed iraqs 66th special 
forces brigade killing at least 400 men in the mountainous sidikan 
region on monday 
he said 54 guerrillas and more than 100 kurdish civilians were 
killed and that the iraqis suffered heavy losses 
the official said the iraqi forces comprised the northernbased 
1st and 5th army corps reinforced with units of the elite 
presidential guard special forces and the 7th army corps normally 
based in the south 
he said the kurds had about 15000 guerrillas backed by about 
30000 reservists 
diplomats in baghdad said iraq has taken advantage of the aug 
20 ceasefire in the eightyear war with iran to intensify 
operations against the kurds who seek autonomy and who sided with 
the iranians 
turkey which is fighting its own kurdish rebels has allowed 
civilians fleeing the fighting into its territory on humanitarian 
grounds after appeals from kurdish democratic party leader massoud 
barzani officials in ankara said today 
the party spokesman said turkey has announced that it will 
accept 30000 refugees and that several thousand already have 
crossed into turkey 
he said the brunt of the iraqi assault was aimed at rebel 
strongholds in zakho dahok mosul and erbil provinces 
iraqi jets dropped poison gas bombs outlawed under a 1925 
geneva treaty on villages and guerrilla positions in the zakho 
region monday and tuesday he said 
it was not immediately known how many died from the gas attacks 
but barzani said 500 people were killed and 3000 wounded in 
chemical attacks this month in the buildup to the offensive 
the spokesman said we have no gas masks protective clothing 
or antidotes for the chemical weapons its causing panic among the 
population 
about 20 million kurds live in the mountains where the turkish 
iraqi and iranian borders meet syria and the soviet union also 
have kurdish enclaves 
iraqs 35 million kurds have waged a sporadic war for an 
autonomous homeland for 50 years 
sources in baghdad said nuzhei kandemir undersecratry of 
turkeys foreign ministry flew to the iraqi capital monday and 
complained about the use of chemical weapons on the turkish border 
kurdish and iranian officials said more than 50 villages were 
hit by gas attacks in recent weeks 
iraq has admitted using chemical weapons during the war with 
iran but said iran used them first tehran denied that the un 
security council has blamed iraq for gas attacks on iran several 
times 
the kurds said 5000 of their civilians were killed in march in 
gas attacks on halabja when it was captured by rebels aided by 
iranian fighters 
foreign reporters taken to halabja by the iranians saw the 
bodies of hundreds of men women and children sprawled around the 
town unmarked by shrapnel or bullet wounds

eastern airlines stalled plan to lay off 
4000 workers is part of a broader eastern effort to break the 
unions and gradually dismember the airline the president of the 
air line pilots association charged today 
henry duffy whose group represents most unionized us pilots 
expressed satisfaction with a federal judges ruling tuesday 
blocking eastern from carrying out the layoffs 
the financially strapped carrier said it would file an emergency 
appeal of the ruling 
us district judge barrington parker also ruled that eastern 
could go ahead with plans to eliminate service to 14 cities and 
close its kansas city mo hub 
its an important decision because what the judge found was a 
series of transactions that eastern has been going through that 
hasnt been for legitimate business purposes duffy said on 
nbctvs today show its been to break the unions 
nbc said eastern declined an invitation to appear with duffy on 
the program 
on tuesday the miamibased carrier issued a statement by its 
president phil bakes calling the court ruling gravely wrong 
and saying it would appeal on grounds that any business must be 
allowed to prune moneylosing operations 
we must be able to take prudent although sometimes painful 
measures in the best interests of the company and our employees 
bakes said 
asked if his union believed easterns cutbacks in service and 
proposed layoffs were aimed at eventually doing away with the 
airline altogether duffy said 
as a matter of fact thats what the judge found he found 
theyve been siphoning assets off and transferring them over to 
continental airlines 
both eastern and continental are subsidiaries of texas air corp 
in his ruling parker wrote that texas air which bought eastern 
in 1986 has exerted every effort to curb union influence at 
eastern he also wrote that easterns management had 
contributed to the carriers financial instability through a series 
of decisions that led to a number of questionable loans and 
questionable ventures

banter between the pilots of a continental jet 
before it crashed nov 15 killing 28 people apparently violated 
federal regulations officials say 
a previously undisclosed portion of the black box cockpit 
recording from the dc9 shows that in the minutes before flight 
1713 crashed the pilots discussed the dating habits of a woman 
flight attendant and other matters unrelated to the flight 
the tape shows the pilots did not discuss the snow falling at 
stapleton international airport 
both pilots flight captain frank zvonek and copilot lee edward 
bruecher were killed in the crash fiftyfour people were injured 
a federal aviation administration rule known as the sterile 
cockpit concept prohibits nonessential conversation in the 
cockpit during ground operations and takeoff preparations 
faa spokesman dick meyer said a pilot who violated the rule 
could be suspended or fined as much as 10000 
that would definitely be extraneous meyer said tuesday of 
the discussions between the two pilots the main point is the 
cockpit crew is supposed to be concentrating on their primary 
business of flying the airplane distractions can be deadly 
the faa enacted the regulation in the late 1970s or early 1980s 
after several instances where we found in accidents where flight 
crews were talking about something other than flying the 
airplane faa spokesman fred farrar said 
continental spokesman bruce hicks said nonpertinent 
conversations are common among pilots if the pilots on 1713 were 
in violation of that reg 999 percent of all commercial pilots in 
history have violated that reg he said 
hicks had said previously that the pilots maintained a highly 
skilled welldisciplined professional cockpit 
the pilots conversation has become an issue as the national 
transportation safety board studies possible causes of the 
accident which occurred in a snowstorm 
mel hoagland who retired as a united airlines dc10 captain 
this month said such cockpit conversations arent unusual you 
cant just sit and be keyed right on the edge of the aviation 
experiences all of the time he said 
ed arbon vice president of the flight safety foundation of 
arlington va said that unless pilots anticipate a waiting 
period it is unusual for them to spend much time discussing 
nonflight matters in a plane prpearing to take off in snow 
if the weathers of concern usually your attention is taken 
up by the business at hand he said 
the ntsb is to meet next month to review the accident the board 
is studying whether ice or snow buildup on the wings the 
experience and training of the pilots and possible turbulence from 
another aircraft caused the crash

a government spokesman today confirmed that 
sovietbased fighter aircraft were used recently to aid afghan 
ground troops as they battled for control of the northern 
afghanistan city of kunduz 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov denied however 
a us charge that the action violated the geneva accords on an 
afghan settlement 
he told reporters at a regular briefing that the kremlin 
responded to an urgent situation when it sent the aircraft 
gerasimov denied another us allegation that the kremlin had 
sent troops back to kunduz about 30 miles from the soviet border 
after recently withdrawing them 
under the geneva accords signed earlier this year the soviets 
have pulled out half of their 100000 soldiers from afghanistan 
since may 15 and the remainder is scheduled to be withdrawn by 
feb 15 
phyllis oakley us state department spokeswoman said earlier 
this week that the soviets had directed aircraft into afghanistan 
and moved some red army troops into kunduz from elsewhere within 
the country she said the dispatch of aircraft from the soviet 
union was a violation of the geneva accords 
gerasimov said the dispatch of aircraft was justified 
when the soviet troops left and part of the troops were still 
there counterrevolutionary antigovernmental gangs began to 
operate so countermeasures were required he said 
he said he could not give specifics of the operations declining 
to say how many fighters were dispatched to the area and whether 
the aircraft carried out any bombing but he said the aircraft were 
there mainly as support 
gerasimov did not respond directly when asked whether the afghan 
government requested the assistance or whether the soviets 
volunteered it 
when in the area around kunduz a critical situation emerged 
then with the consent of the afghan government aircraft were used 
from soviet territory for rendering urgent support including a 
soviet unit fighting counterrevolutionary formations gerasimov 
said 
the soviets have persistently accused pakistan of violating the 
geneva accords 
the spokesman today reinterated the list of soviet complaints 
accusing pakistan of permitting guerrillas to operate bases inside 
the pakistani border and blaming the united states for its 
involvement 
nothing of this kind would have happened had pakistan with 
the support of the united states not supplied arms to the rebels 
including advisers he said 
the united states has said it will continue supplying pakistan 
with weapons for the rebels as long as the soviets continue arming 
the kabul government 
gerasimov said the rebels conducted a bloody fight in and around 
kunduz 
they burned down three hospitals they destroyed all 
governmental institutions they destroyed several mosques those 
freedom fighters they blew up the power supply station so kunduz 
remained without electric power they killed officials including 
members of their family they killed traders merchants and they 
took 200 schoolgirls and college students and away from kunduz 
gerasimov said 
rebel commanders have said their strategy is to take the 
provincial seats before an assault on kabul the capital

under pressure from the federal trade commission 
the nations largest organization of certified public accountants 
lifted its 82yearold ban on cpas accepting certain fees and 
commissions 
the ruling council of the 272000member american institute of 
certified pubic accountants voted 1915 tuesday to drop the 
prohibition against compensation for nonaudit financial planning 
services 
the ban was intended to avoid conflicts of interest among 
accountants but officials said that dropping the restriction will 
benefit the consumer by allowing cpas to compete against bankers 
and stockbrokers 
weve been working on this change for five years and were 
just delighted that it occurred said hd vest an irving 
texas accountant who threatened to sue the institute if it didnt 
drop the ban 
the ftc last year issued a letter of complaint against the cpa 
group threatening legal action unless it allowed accountants to 
accept commissions for nonaudit work the ftc contended the ban 
violated antitrust law 
the ftc said the ban effectively prevented cpas from competing 
in the financial services market since they could not accept 
commissions they had no incentive to provide the services 
under the ban accountants in most states could take no part in 
financial planning 
the change allows consumers to go to one person who knows 
their situation best and that one person the cpa will make the 
recommendation vest said in a telephone interview tuesday 
vest said consumers will benefit most from the change because it 
will allow them to get business done under one roof 
licensing authority is actually held by the individual states 
but the institutes code of ethics serves as a model for many state 
regulatory boards 
the ftc had no immediate comment on the vote said a woman at 
the commissions washington offices who did not give her name 
critics of the change focused on the conflict of interest issue 
saying accountants could give biased advice to get a bigger fee 
vest said 
the institutes policy change allows accountants to earn 
commissions in several areas such as helping clients obtain loans 
make acquisitions or mergers and devise costcutting plans vest 
said 
five states maryland oklahoma south dakota texas and west 
virginia already allow such commissions 
the national association of state boards of accountancy whose 
members regulate cpas is expected to vote on a similar measure on 
sept 28

christianmoslem coexistence in lebanon on the basis of political 
reforms distributing power equally between the two communities the

recovering quickly an attending doctor said

session because the only candidate was former president suleiman

syria 
under an unwritten 1943 national covenant the president 
must be a christian the prime minister a sunni moslem and the

republican presidential nominee george 
bush said today that the waiting period for action on acid rain 
is over and promised to support a program to reduce emissions by 
the year 2000 
in turning his attention to environmental issues the vice 
president visited a park alongside lake erie near detroit where he 
said the specifics of his acid rain program could be worked out 
later with congress but we must have a clear commitment to 
emissions reductions a clear time table 
aides traveling with the vice president said his pledge was 
designed to demonstrate that he would go beyond the steps taken 
during the reagan administration to clean up acid rain 
the president has been criticized by environmentalists for 
failing to do more to solve the problem during his two terms in 
office earlier this month however reagan gave the goahead for 
continuing negotiations toward us participation in an 
international treaty to freeze emissions of a precursor to acid 
rain 
the administration had been divided on united nationssponsored 
negotiations in geneva switzerland toward a treaty that would 
freeze emissions of nitrogen oxides until 1996 
in a speech prepared for delivery bush said i am an 
environmentalist always have been from my earliest days as a 
congressman and i always will be 
aside from acid rain he proposed several steps to clean up the 
environment including a global conference on the issue at the 
white house at which all nations would be welcome 
he also called for implementation of a protocol already 
negotiated to limit emissions of nitrogen oxides he said the 
superfund established to clean up toxic waste dumps has enough 
money for the job and said the environmental protection agency 
should use its authority to enforce a program 
polluters should pay the vice president said 
bush called for a zero tolerance policy for polluters 
similar to the one used to combat drugs 
on the acid rain issue bush said the time for study alone 
has passed as president i will ask for a program to cut 
millions of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000 and 
to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well 
i will work out the exact amount and the exact methodology 
with the congress he said 
bush addressed the environment issue on a brief campaign trip to 
michigan regarded by strategists of both parties as a key 
battleground for the fall campaign the state has 20 electoral 
votes 
for the first time in several days bush made no reference to his 
democratic rival michael dukakis in prepared remarks but aides 
said the vice president was considering a trip to boston harbor 
later in the week to dramatize a pollution problem in the 
massachusetts governors home state 
later in the week bush who has proposed a ban on ocean 
dumping also will visit several beach sites in new jersey and new 
england 
bush aides said that the vice president would continue his 
environmental pitch on a campaign swing to the west coast that will 
begin on labor day the aides said this may follow a joint 
appearance with running mate sen dan quayle at a park in jersey 
city nj across from the statue of liberty where ronald reagan 
launched his campaign on labor day 1980 
bush on tuesday wound up four days of attacks on dukakis 
defense stands by telling an american legion post at fort campbell 
ky he had deep wide and worrisome differences with the 
democratic nominee on defense issues 
if he doesnt want to modernize his snow blower thats his 
concern bush said but if he doesnt modernize our weapons 
systems that puts the national security of the united states in 
considerable risk 
the barbed reference to dukakis decadesold snow blower 
highlighted in a film at the democratic national convention 
brought cheers from bushs audience of military veterans 
bush a decorated world war ii torpedo bomber pilot described 
himself as tested in combat in his talk in which he did not 
mention quayle whose service in the indiana national guard during 
the vietnam war has become a heated campaign issue 
however at an earlier rally tuesday at north carolina wesleyan 
college in rocky mount nc bush voiced strong praise for quayle 
im proud of my running mate its nice to have a running 
mate going in the same general direction as i am well do just 
fine bush told several thousand students 
meanwhile bush stood firmly behind his decision to agree to no 
more than two presidential debates with dukakis suggesting any 
more would bore us viewers the democrats are asking for three 
debates between dukakis and bush 
talks in washington between bush and dukakis representatives 
broke down on tuesday after bush campaign manager james a baker 
iii refused to budge from the twodebate format with an additional 
debate for vice presidential contenders talks were to resume on 
thursday 
this is a firm position this is our only offer said 
bush chief of staff craig fuller

thousands of townspeople family members 
dignitaries and fellow aviators crowded into a small church today 
to pay last respects to the three italian pilots killed in the west 
german air show disaster 
defense minister valerio zanone and senate president giovanni 
spadolini headed the government delegation at the funeral service 
for lt col mario naldini 38 lt col ivo nutarelli 41 and 
capt giorgio alessio 31 
the three members of the frecce tricolori tricolor arrows 
acrobatic team were killed when their jets collided during an air 
show sunday at a us military base in ramstein west germany one 
of the planes hurtled into the crowd of spectators at least 49 
people were killed in the disaster 
in addition to air force chief gen franco pisano and other 
italian military officials members of precision flight teams from 
france and canada attended the service in the ossario temple church 
the ceremony was led by a military chaplain archbishop gaetano 
bonicelli who read a message of blessing and condolence from pope 
john paul ii 
in his homily bonicelli said the destiny of the three pilots 
invites us once again to grasp the meaning of the message of 
luke accepting divine will which we often can not comprehend as 
children often dont understand the will of their parents 
one pilot offered a prayer in which he urged zanone to do all 
you can so the arrows remain they are the most beautiful thing we 
have zanone sobbed quietly 
some politicians in italy have demanded the squadron be 
disbanded but zanone and pisano said earlier this week the team 
would continue to fly

hundreds of protesters demonstrated from 
hilltops and in a flotilla of small boats today as two us 
warships capable of launching nuclear missiles arrived at the home 
port of the us 7th fleet 
the two ships are the first to be stationed in japan with 
launchers for tomahawk missiles which are made in both nuclear and 
nonnuclear versions 
get out from yokosuka 100 people shouted in english at the 
gates of the naval base as the ticonderogaclass guided missile 
cruiser uss bunker hill and the destroyer uss fife arrived in the 
port 30 miles southwest of tokyo 
a coast guard official said the warships arrived without 
incident 
fortytwo coast guard patrol boats escorted the ships into the 
port to prevent the approach of 28 small boats carrying protesters 
and banners reading no tomahawks the official said he spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
japan forbids the production possession or introduction into 
the country of nuclear weapons nearly 200000 people died in the 
japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki in the worlds only 
atomic attacks during world war ii 
after the arrival of the ships more protesters from civic and 
peace groups labor unions and the japan communist party staged 
separate rallies at a park overlooking the port outside the naval 
base and elsewhere police reported no arrests 
protesters said the biggest rally sponsored by the communists 
drew an estimated 1000 people 
on tuesday yokosukas 48member city assembly unanimously 
passed a resolution calling on the government to cancel the arrival 
of the us warships the mayor and governor lodged official 
protests monday with the japanese government saying it had not 
done enough to ensure that the ships were not carrying nuclear 
weapons 
local officials and civic groups have charged the ships may be 
carrying nucleartipped tomahawk missiles in violation of japans 
antinuclear policy 
we hope our grassroot struggles will spread to a national 
movement said yoshiko saito a leader of a citizens group 
staging a sitin near the yokosuka city hall 
both the 9600ton bunker hill and the 7810ton fife are 
capable of deploying tomahawk missiles under a security agreement 
the united states has pledged to notify japan if it plans to bring 
nuclear arms into the country 
however critics charge the japanese government uses the 
agreement as a way of avoiding the question of whether us ships 
dock in the country with nuclear weapons aboard 
prime minister noboru takeshita told reporters today that the 
government would not ask the united states to confirm whether or 
not the ships were carrying nuclear missiles because we trust 
each other in such matters kyodo news service reported 
the us military which has 50000 personnel stationed in 
japan maintains a policy of not publicly confirming or denying the 
existence of nuclear weapons aboard its ships

the justice department today dropped sedition and 
racketeering charges against two of seven avowed revolutionaries 
accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the us government 
the charges against thomas william manning 42 and jaan karl 
laaman 38 were dismissed to expedite the trial being held in 
springfield acting us attorney richard g stearns said 
the seven were charged with seditious conspiracy and 
racketeering in connection with 10 bank robberies and several 
bombings including a 1976 blast that injured 22 people at suffolk 
county courthouse in boston 
us district judge william g young in springfield approved the 
dismissal of charges 
manning and laaman already have been sentenced to long prison 
terms for related crimes 
in light of the lengthy consecutive sentences now imposed on 
both manning and laaman it is not in the interests of justice to 
prosecute either man further stearns said in a statement 
dropping the charges will by effectively shortening the jury 
selection process allow the remaining defendants to proceed more 
expeditiously to trial without substantially compromising any 
public interest the statement said 
manning and laaman were named in a 1986 indictment charging them 
with violating the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations 
statute and federal seditious conspiracy laws 
laamans 53year federal sentence and additional 39 to 45year 
state sentence were upheld on appeal earlier this year he was 
convicted of six bombing charges and one charge of conspiracy the 
massachusetts convictions involved the attempted murder of two 
state troopers 
laaman will not be eligible for parole until dec 22 2008 
manning also faces a 53year sentence that has been upheld on 
appeal he was also sentenced to 25 years to life for the murder of 
a new jersey state trooper 
laamans attorney steven schlang said the defense team would 
file motions asking that laaman and manning be allowed to stay at 
the hartford jail where the defendants are housed to help them in 
the defense

farmers who bought drought insurance from the federal insurance 
company a chubb subsidiary 
it is simply stating that the doublepayment is not going to 
prejudice anyone said stanley m chesley of cincinnati one of 
four lawyers representing the farmers he declined to comment 
further 
the insurance companies have agreed that farmers may accept 
premium refunds and matching payments without jeopardizing any 
claim for payments due under the policies said terry 
geibelstein a davenport iowa lawyer who also represents the 
farmers in the suit 
but the statement issued by geibelstein chesley and lawyers 
robert a van of davenport and michael j freed of chicago noted 
that chubb refused to extend its aug 31 deadline for accepting 
refunds and doublepremium reimbursements to farmers who bought 
drought insurance coverage that was subsequently denied farmers 
must apply in letters postmarked no later than today to chubb for 
the refunds 
farmers in ohio indiana kentucky tennessee michigan 
illinois missouri minnesota iowa and wisconsin say chubb sold 
them drought insurance but failed to pay their claims for damage 
from this years drought 
chubb announced in july that agents had oversold the insurance 
and began to return premium checks chubb then issued some policies 
and offered other farmers a doublepremium bonus payment but some 
state insurance regulators have called the offer inadequate

michael dukakis campaign manager said today the 
democrats would use the selection of indiana sen dan quayle as the 
republican vice presidential nominee to question george bushs 
judgment and leadership in the upcoming fall campaign 
dan quayle is going to emerge not only as an issue but as a 
liability on the republican side because it goes to judgment and it 
goes to leadership top campaign aide susan estrich said at a 
briefing on dukakis campaign stragegy 
we start this campaign on a solid footing in a close 
competitive race said estrich 
she said both the dukakis campaign and the democratic national 
committee were preparing separate advertising campaigns to air 
labor day week 
the partys advertising campaign will highlight the theme 
bringing prosperity home while the initial campaign ads would 
focus on dukakis record as governor of massachusetts portraying 
him as a skilled administrator capable of implementing his goals of 
an improved economy and better jobs 
its our sense right now that voters have only scant 
information of what dukakis has accomplished she said 
there is a lot of misinformation out there and were going to 
correct it said estrich an indirect acknowledgment that 
republican nominee bush has scored well in recent weeks with 
attacks on dukakis on such issues as his veto of legislation to 
require the recitation of the pledge of allegiance in massachusetts 
schools 
estrich and dukakis aide jack corrigon flatly denied they had 
ever suggested to jesse jackson that he avoid campaigning in such 
states as michigan louisiana georgia mississippi and texas 
a source close to jackson said such a request was made and then 
withdrawn when jackson objected to the suggestion he ought to stay 
out of states where he outpolled dukakis in the democratic 
primaries jackson finished ahead of dukakis in all of those states 
except texas 
jacksons role in the fall campaign has not yet been settled 
dukakis who has been dividing his time between statehouse 
duties and campaigning as the democratic presidential nominee will 
stay on the road five to six days a week after the holiday 
dukakis was traveling today to the west coast and after labor 
day he will start a trip through the midwest and east coast that 
will include a joint appearance with running mate lloyd bentsen at 
a labor rally in detroit 
bentsen a texan will carry much of the burden of the attacks 
on his senate colleague from indiana 
still unresolved however was what onetime presidential 
contender jackson would do especially when and where dukakis and 
jackson would make joint appearances 
jackson met in washington on thursday with dukakis aides and 
democratic party chairman paul kirk to discuss the campaign but 
very little was settled according to one participant who asked not 
to be identified 
the source described jackson as upset by a request later 
dropped that he avoid appearances in several states including 
three that he carried in the democratic primaries 
dayton duncan a dukakis campaign spokesman confirmed the 
jackson meeting took place but was unable to provide details 
a jackson supporter said the dukakis aides had a list of states 
michigan louisiana mississippi georgia and texas where they 
did not want him to campaign they said they were concerned that 
his negative ratings were so high in those states that he might 
hurt the ticket 
duncan said there was no such list 
jackson and his supporters said he beat dukakis in the 
democratic primaries or primarylike caucuses in all of those 
states but texas that dispute reportedly ended with the dukakis 
aides dropping their objections and jackson saying he would 
campaign in all but texas 
on tuesday officials of the dukakis campaign met with their 
counterparts in bushs campaign to negotiate a debate schedule and 
format 
after a meeting with bush campaign chairman james a baker iii 
in washington dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas said the two 
camps were far apart on arrangements for candidate debates 
we want more debates they want fewer said brountas we 
want to start them earlier they want to start them later 
we want to continue them up until the election takes place 
they would like to end them much earlier

early enthusiasm for the filming of a 
horror movie in this town with a new england flavor has given way 
to well expressions of horror 
the films purpose is to see how many people can be killed and 
how gruesomely they can be killed and i just dont think the city 
wants to cooperate with any of that said mayor jeff book 
book called on city council to declare a moratorium on 
moviemaking here because of plans for the filming by an 
italianamerican company of witch story 
but the council rejected the mayors request after dozens of 
residents and business people supported the filmmakers at a special 
meeting tuesday night 
the last thing this city council wants to do is try to 
legislate morality said vice president al liveright of the mount 
dora chamber of commerce 
the mayor would like to see ground rules established for any 
future movie projects in this central florida town 
in 1980 many downtown businesses were painted pink for the 
movie honky tonk freeway 
that was fun many residents agreed although the movie was a 
boxoffice flop so town officials were excited last week when 
united entertainment corp said it wanted to film a witch story 
here because of mount doras new englandstyle architecture and 
ambiance 
that enthusiasm lasted only until the mayor got a look at the 
script 
the lowbudget splatter film is revolting and offensive 
book said 
the script calls for a gang rape a crushed skull an exploding 
child a couple pureed in bed a decapitation a blood bath an 
exploding stomach and an exploding teenager among other nasty 
business 
the witch would be dragged through city streets repeatedly 
raped and then burned at the stake 
some horror films like some of hitchcocks or the shining 
are made with great style said book but this is just garbage 
i dont think the city wants to be part of it 
clara pascal a spokeswoman for the production company said 
company executives talked to book about his concerns and would meet 
with city officials the film is in the planning stage and no 
production has begun 
there are some things we might be able to do with the script 
wed love to stay in mount dora ms pascal said but it is a 
horror movie 
book said changing a few scenes would not help if you deleted 
all the offending scenes in this script youd have to start all 
over with a new script he said 
we want to improve on honky tonk freeway not go down in 
quality the mayor added

us gen john r galvin the top commander of north atlantic

aboard the uss denebola when it docked today in antwerp 30 miles 
north of brussels 
im quite satisfied with what i see he told reporters after 
a tour of the 946foot long ship which left savannah ga on aug 
22 
we do not have enough military force in europe to be able to 
truly defend western europe and we are absolutely dependent on 
fighting long enough over here with what we have in place in order 
to wait for reinforcements to arrive he said 
this is what im going to need if god forbid we ever have a 
war in europe he said but the mere fact that we can do this 
provide equipment is a very powerful deterrent that would 
suppress any ideas of aggression

the government today warned demonstrators 
who have taken over state offices to leave them immediately 
soldiers meanwhile went from housetohouse searching for 
striking engineers who closed burmas largest oil refinery sources 
said the engineers and other workers have gone on strike to press 
for democracy 
also today 1200 more prisoners were released from insein jail 
in the capital and another prison in the central city of mandalay 
the staterun radio rangoon said authorities have been freeing 
prisoners after disturbances last week at these and seven other 
jails 
the government has permitted peaceful assembly and processions 
under the constitution the radio broadcast also said in some 
towns peoples council local government offices and other 
government buildings are illegally occupied by the people 
illegal occupants must vacate the peoples council offices and 
government buildings immediately or face the consequences said 
the statement signed by maung ko secretary to the council of 
ministers or the cabinet 
the broadcast did not specify the possible consequences 
scarce gasoline supplies and a 5dayold strike by railroad 
workers continued to cripple the nations transportation system 
contributing to food shortages a western diplomat said 
the government has remained silent on the strikers demands and 
spreading violence and disorder have given rise to rumors of an 
impending military coup some observers say the burma socialist 
program party is orchestrating the chaos in order to intervene and 
reestablish itself 
authorities on tuesday freed hundreds of inmates from burmese 
jails 
striking employees from more than 120 government departments and 
stateowned corporations on tuesday formed a committee to agitate 
for an end to oneparty rule their all services general strike 
committee was the fourth illegal association created in burma in 
three days 
students and dock workers also have formed unions and 21 elder 
statesmen some associated with the last elected government 26 
years ago created a committee for democracy 
in addition citizens have formed committees in an attempt to 
govern many burmese cities which were left without authorities 
when troops and officials loyal to the embattled government cleared 
out 
burmas turmoil began after the july 23 resignation of ruler ne 
win who ended democracy with a 1962 military coup established 
oneparty rule and outlawed all other parties unions and 
associations 
thousands of citizens staged protests against ne wins hardline 
successor sein lwin and at least 112 people were killed in 
clashes with security forces 
the violence continued until sein lwin resigned and was replaced 
aug 19 by civilian lawyer maung maung since then peaceful 
rallies and widespread strikes demanding an end to oneparty rule 
have continued 
the strikes have paralyzed most government services and 
industries including the countrys only oil refineries in 
syriam about 10 miles southeast of rangoon and in the central 
city of mann severe gasoline shortages has forced transportation 
to a crawl 
workers at the syriam refinery which had produced 26000 
barrels of oil per day staged an occupation strike after students 
called for a nationwide general strike two weeks ago 
the plant was shut down and military engineers tried in vain to 
operate it on tuesday authorities ordered soldiers to begin 
housetohouse searches for civilian engineers from the refinery to 
force them back to work an engineer told the associated press 
today so far the soldiers havent found the striking employees 
said the engineer who spoke on condition of anonymity he said he 
and his colleagues have gone into hiding and would strike until 
authorities form an interim government to lead the country to 
democracy

a senior israeli official said today he does 
not accept as permanent the decision of king hussein of jordan to 
sever his governments ties with the israelioccupied west bank 
abraham tamir director general of the israeli foreign ministry 
told reporters that hussein is well aware that it is impossible to 
reach a final stage solution between israel and the 
palestinians without jordan 
hussein knows that some day he will be called back to 
negotiate on the final status because without jordan you cant 
solve the problem he knows it very well tamir said 
a month ago hussein announced he was dismantling the legal 
and administrative links between jordan and the west bank a move 
that was seen by some as a setback for hopes that a regional peace 
settlement might be reached 
tamir suggested that it is unrealistic to assume that jordan 
could sever its historical ties to an area it once ruled noting 
that the camp david agreement envisions a role for jordan in the 
final stages of negotiations 
at the same time there have been repeated hints over the past 
month that husseins move may induce the palestine liberation 
organization to initiate a proposal for peace with israel 
tamir who is here for talks with us officials said there is 
an urgent need to end the turmoil in the occupied territories and 
move toward a settlement through negotiations 
as a result of palestinian unrest dating back eight months a 
very dangerous situation has been created he said adding that 
it would be unwise to allow the status quo to exist much longer 
he rejected the view of those who say that israel can wait and 
wait and wait expecting that the arabs will crawl on their 
knees and be ready to accept a peace on the basis of our 
conditions 
to get a negotiating process started tamir said we have to 
mobilize all forces starting with the united states and egypt in 
support an effort to reach an interim agreement with leaders of the 
west bank and the gaza strip 
as long a serious peace talks are delayed he said the uprising 
in the territories will continue and that the situation could 
deteriorate into another arabisraeli war

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
aug 30 
the lewiston maine daily sun on protecting national secrets 
the idea of americans passing along secrets to the enemy has 
always been an abhorrent one and news of another such situation in 
west germany makes one wonder about this nations moral fiber 
it also raises questions about the governments 
counterintelligence capabilities 
its evident that too many people hold security clearances to 
handle classified documents 
and handing out clearances to so many young military people 
most not mature enough to handle the responsibility is a 
questionable practice 
the government may have to consider draconian measures to stop 
the flight of secrets to warsaw pact nations and elsewhere 
more rigorous investigations and followups as well as workplace 
surveillance are not pleasant prospects but it may be coming to 
that in some instances its a matter of sloppy security practices 
whatever the case the nations critical defense secrets must be 
protected better than they have been

the flint mich journal on the presidential campaign 
george bush says he yearns for a kinder gentler nation 
at the same time the vice president and his friends have 
expended excessive energy trying to brand democratic presidential 
contender michael s dukakis as disloyal 
sadly the vice president has squandered several opportunities 
to say something meaningful by instead dwelling on the fact that as 
governor of massachusetts dukakis vetoed a bill that would have 
imposed criminal fines on teachers who failed to lead their class 
in the pledge of allegiance 
dukakis correctly nixed the bill because of state and us 
supreme court rulings that such laws are unconstitutional 
bush claims he would have signed it anyway does this mean he 
has little respect for supreme court interpretations of the 
constitution or that he holds the constitution in as little regard 
as some other reagan administration officials have 
why has bush insisted on beating this nonissue into the ground 
he should be above such cheap shots 
bush and dukakis can show real leadership and character by 
rising from the mud and dwelling on the issues and by doing so 
with specifics not platitudes

the herald everett wash on dan quayle 
sen dan quayles decision to write press releases during the 
vietnam war is not by itself reason to question his suitability 
for the vice presidency but repeated instances of hypocrisy are 
another matter altogether 
it seems quayle holds two standards one for the nation and 
another for himself 
the public quayle champions the family and war games and 
opposes nuclear disarmament and negotiations with the soviets with 
a passion no doubt genuine 
but as quayles national guard escapade reveals theres another 
private man behind the public mask who does not live out the values 
he espouses 
despite his heavyhanded war philosophy given the opportunity 
to fight he has dodged dangerous assignments his rhetoric 
honoring the family sings pure republican 
but the private man has felt no compunction against 
propositioning a playboy model or even carousing in that set of 
company 
there quayle the private man has revealed himself to be an 
opportunist his personal politics and morality vulnerable to the 
convenience of the moment 
that he has tried to rationalize the way he exempts his own 
behavior from the code he holds to the nation should disappoint the 
public that he feels free to condemn anyone who points to the 
inconsistencies suggests he is too immature to face himself

roswell nm daily record on an experimental drug for aids 
patients 
the us food and drug administrations flexible new approach 
to drug marketing brings hope to thousands of people afflicted with 
aids and other lifethreatening illnesses 
after years of dogged resistance the fda has suddenly relaxed 
its rigid rules and bowed to logical demands that an experimental 
drug be made more widely available to sufferers of a severe form of 
pneumonia that is the leading cause of death in aids patients 
under the new policy the fda has agreed to make the drug 
trimetrexate freely available to physicians throughout the united 
states even though the drug has not passed all the tests normally 
required for marketing approval 
naturally the fda should not relax its careful scrutiny of new 
drugs in ordinary circumstances to do so would place the public at 
risk 
but where there is a chance of saving lives in otherwise 
hopeless situations risks are justified

curious past that led to his surprising elevation 
who is he and where did he come from

the postcrescent appletonneenahmenasha wis on oliver 
north 
theres something discomforting about an indicted felon stumping 
for a political candidate for a 25000 fee 
it seems surreal to hear of 1000 people some in 500 frontrow 
seats pay homage to a former marine lieutenant colonel who fell 
from grace as he spoke of patriotism and salvation coming only from 
the republican ranks 
last summer ollie north was the darling of the airwaves as he 
survived four days of congressional grilling before a live 
television audience 
his rhetoric and flagwaving clouded the charges and almost 
turned the tables on his interrogators 
but in the end he was indicted and now faces charges of 
obstruction of justice tax fraud and personal enrichment for his 
role in the irancontra affair 
to raise money for his defense he has taken to the road 
commanding large fees for a small dose of pseudopatriotic talk 
hes unrepentant for his role in the sordid sales of arms to 
iran and in illegally delivering those profits to the contras 
he may retain some popular appeal as an anticommunist zealot 
but his days are over as a credible footsoldier

new jersey herald newton nj on john zaccaros jail 
conditions 
few convicted cocaine dealers are lucky enough to face the kind 
of music john zaccaro jr is listening to these days after being 
convicted on a felony drug charge 
punishment for the son of former democratic vice presidential 
candidate geraldine ferraro isnt a deservedly long sentence in a 
tiny cell in a bleak jail 
he is enjoying a fourmonth stay in a 1500 a month luxury 
apartment in burlington vt which comes with cable television and 
maid service 
addison county states attorney john quinn who prosecuted 
zaccaro calls it a joke as though zaccaro were merely 
grounded we agree 
where prisons and jails are dangerously overcrowded such 
alternative criminal justice programs can have a place 
but permitting a drug dealer such house arrest luxuries hardly 
sends the right message about justice being blind especially when 
the pampered prisoner is the son of an influential politician

the knoxville tenn newssentinel on profiting from the 
drought 
hey havent you heard about the drought thats a standard 
reply these days to complaints about the high cost of putting food 
on the table 
costofliving statistics for july showed that the overall 
inflation rate for that month was 04 percent but the jump in 
supermarket prices was 14 percent 
the price of bread made from wheat harvested before the drought 
has gone up sharply cereals made from predrought grain have 
climbed 
what about beef prices were supposed to go down because cattle 
raisers and many dairy farmers have been dumping animals on the 
market to avoid having to feed them but beef prices in stores 
havent dipped and some have gone up 
donald ratajczak of the georgia state universitys economic 
forecasting center says that perhaps half the increased prices 
recorded on supermarket shelves can be traced to the drought 
if he is right the other half can be laid to efforts to cash in 
on a drought psychology that has prepared consumers to expect 
higher prices 
shoppers can pass up purchases of items they suspect have been 
deliberately overpriced unsold foodstuffs piling up in stores 
would send a message all along the food chain that consumers are 
tired of taking it in the neck

there is certain to be plenty of opposition to proposed federal 
environmental protection agency rules for future landfill 
operations 
requiring bottom liners waterproof covers and detection and 
monitoring systems to prevent ground water damage will be expensive 
if anything however these rules do not go far enough 
at this point in mankinds history we are becoming painfully 
aware of the damage civilization is doing to our planet and its 
ecology 
we need 
mandatory recycling of all nonbiodegradable materials 
ending our dependence on plastics 
confinement of hazardous liquids and other materials to special 
sites 
at stake is the kind of world our children and grandchildren 
will inherit 
someday adventurers in space may find or create new habitats 
for human civilization and development until then this is the

the dallas morning news on spying 
once again americans are reminded that spies are real 
creatures not just the figments of fiction writers imaginations 
 
the united states latest alleged traitor is former army 
sgt 1st class clyde lee conrad 
he is accused of selling the location of nato missiles the 
route of a supersecret pipeline and plans for blunting a warsaw 
pact thrust into central germany 
the conrad flap should first remind every american that the 
smiling face of glasnost notwithstanding there are enemies in the 
world who are prepared to do us and our allies harm 
the death penalty is not used in germany where conrad is being 
charged so if found guilty he will not have to forfeit his life 
for jeopardizing the life and safety of millions thats 
regrettable 
the conrad case is a reminder that the death penalty should be 
applicable in peacetime as well as during a declared war 
the world is a precarious place even during peacetime having 
tactical and strategic information sold to potential enemies makes 
peacetime all the more fragile

los angeles daily news on inflation 
the cloud of inflation is growing over the reagan 
administrations remarkable record of 70 straight months of 
economic growth 
rising prices have not reached economybusting proportions yet 
but the 51 percent inflation rate reported last week has the 
potential to get much worse 
the explanation most often heard for inflation is that the 
economy is growing too fast 
technically thats true a robust economy fueled by rampant 
consumer spending but an inadequate supply of goods and services 
always forces prices up 
those who favor real victory over the inflationary monster 
should look at low productivity not consumers as the culprit 
raise productivity and you give the economy the ability to meet 
the consumers rising demand 
to do this american productivity has to grow at a far greater 
rate than it has in recent years 
but the best ways for a government to promote higher 
productivity lowering business taxes to permit companies to keep 
more of their profits and invest in new equipment are not 
necessarily the most politically popular 
whoever will lead the nation from january 1989 on will have to 
show the moxie to battle inflation and the intellectual ability to 
understand its relation to productivity

apartment had not been seen for several days 
winters said the man who climbed inside accidentally triggered 
the bomb demolishing the apartment in the mainly roman catholic 
creggan area he said police were investigating reports that the 
ira had kidnapped two occupants of the home several days ago and 
held them at gunpoint while planting the bomb 
the iras londonderry unit circulated an apology to local news 
media saying the bomb was intended for an army search squad 
although the operation was carefully planned it went 
tragically wrong at no stage unfortunately was it anticipated 
that a member of the public would enter the flat apartment 
through a front window and open a boobytrapped door 
northern ireland police and the british army released few 
details of tuesdays ambush and killing of the three ira guerrillas 
on a country road at drumnakilly in county tyrone 
the spot was only eight miles from ballygawley where an ira 
bomb blew up a military bus aug 20 killing eight soldiers and 
injuring 27 
british media reports said commandos of the british armys elite 
special air services regiment ambushed and killed the three men as 
they prepared to attack a soldier of the locally recruited ulster 
defense regiment the police and army refused to comment on the 
reports 
sinn fein legal political wing of the outlawed ira said 
tuesday the slain men were ira members it identified them as brian 
mullen and brothers gerard and martin harte 
today it released a statement from the iras midulster 
battalion saying the men were killed while on active service 
the killings were seen as the start of a tougher british policy 
to combat increased ira attacks 
so far this year the ira has killed 27 members of the british 
security forces in gun and bomb attacks in northern ireland 
mainland britain and continental europe in its fight to end british 
rule in northern ireland 
with tuesdays deaths the ira has lost 11 members so far this 
year 
british news reports said mullen was one of eight men questioned 
by police after the aug 20 bus bombing 
the governments northern ireland office refused to say if the 
shootings were a result of new security measures in the british 
province 
security forces have denied accusations they operate a socalled 
shoottokill policy in which suspects are gunned down without 
being given a chance to surrender on march 6 british commandos 
killed three unarmed ira guerrillas on a bombing mission in 
gibraltar 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
the predominantly protestant province and to unite it with the 
overwhelmingly catholic republic of ireland

while the infamous white house taping system 
was being planned president nixon suggested that he have a button 
to turn it on and off manually but was dissuaded by an aide who 
says he thought the president was too clumsy 
therefore a voiceactivated system was installed and nixon 
quickly lost awareness that his every conversation was being 
recorded says former white house chief of staff hr haldeman in 
an article for the national archives publication prologue 
the tapes led to nixons resignation in august 1974 when they 
provided damning evidence that he had consented to the white house 
coverup of the watergate breakin 
haldeman said nixon had resisted the idea of taping 
conversations but reluctantly agreed it was the best way to get an 
accurate record of meetings 
he suggested we might install the same kind of switch or 
buttonoperated machine that lyndon johnson had used haldeman 
wrote that would allow him to turn the system on or off as he 
thought best 
the former aide continued 
i responded mr president youll never remember to turn it 
on except when you dont want it and when you do want it youre 
always going to be shouting afterwards when its too late that 
no one turned it on 
i added silently in my own thoughts that this president was 
far too inept with machinery ever to make a success of a switch 
system 
the taping system that finally was installed was activated by 
the secret services locator system which keeps track of the 
presidents whereabouts 
eventually five microphones were put in the presidents desk 
two were in wall lamps at each side of the fireplace on the 
opposite side of the oval office and there were others in the 
cabinet room nixons office in the old executive office building 
and at camp david md the presidential retreat 
the historiography of the nixon administration will eventually 
be much the richer as a result of richard nixons decision to 
taperecord his meetings and telephone conversations haldeman 
writes nixon was not thinking of historians when he made this 
decision but they will be the ultimate beneficiaries 
haldemans account is much softer in tone and less critical of 
nixon than when he described the same events in a 1978 book the 
ends of power which he said was unfortunately sensational in 
many instances where i would have preferred it to be more reasoned 
and thorough 
in the book haldeman said nixon had fudged the tape story 
in various ways climaxing with the assertion on television in 
1977 that he had ordered me to destroy all of the tapes there is 
no reference to that in the prologue article 
haldeman says he is amazed how quickly he forgot about the 
system once it was in place 
for a short time i worried that it might not be working and 
i dispatched someone to test the machinery he writes but the 
worry quickly passed as did any awareness at all that nixons 
conversations my conversations often were being taped i think 
nixon lost his awareness of the system even more quickly than i 
did 
nixon himself has written that initially i was conscious of 
the taping but before long i accepted it as part of the 
surroundings 
nixon fired haldeman in april 1973 at the height of the coverup 
of the june 1972 breakin when burglars placed bugs in telephones 
and searched files in democratic party headquarters in the 
watergate office building haldeman served an 18month prison term 
for his part in the affair 
haldeman said he chose to write about the taping system because 
the national archives plans to release 60 hours of the recordings 
next year for public listening

the education department may be paying banks 
and other lenders millions of dollars each year in excess subsidies 
on student loans the general accounting office said wednesday 
the congressional watchdog agency said the department performs 
an inadequate job of checking the accuracy of the bills that 
lenders submit for their governmentsubsidized interest payments 
gao auditors who reviewed 2038 loan accounts at 16 major 
lenders found 18 percent were in error or lacked adequate 
documentation to support the amount billed 
the cause of these errors varied but generally resulted from 
lenders miscalculating loan principal balances and interest 
subsidy due and continuing to bill the department after borrowers 
began repaying the report said 
based on the errors found in the loan accounts it reviewed from 
a threemonth period in 1985 the gao estimated that the government 
overpaid the 16 lenders at least 18 million for that quarter 
when they received a total of 694 million in interest subsidies 
the gao said three lenders had voluntarily repaid the government 
345071 in interest subsidy overbillings from that quarter and 
other recent billing periods 
the department paid lenders 24 billion in interest subsidies 
on 39 billion of outstanding guaranteed student loans in 1986 an 
estimated 14000 lenders banks savings and loan associations 
life insurance companies and credit unions make the loans 
the government guarantees repayment of the loans and pays all 
the interest until six months after the student leaves college 
the department of educations inadequate oversight could be 
costing the federal government millions of dollars each year in 
interest subsidy overpayments to lenders in the guaranteed student 
loan program the gao said 
the gao recommended that congress amend the higher education act 
to allow the education secretary to charge lenders interest on 
overpayments and require lenders to have independent auditors 
verify their loan accounts and interest billings 
the education department said it agreed generally with the 
report and already was taking steps to improve its ability to 
detect interest billing errors 
we believe the department currently has the authority to 
assess interest on overpayments the department said adding that 
it does not oppose amending the law to spell out that authority

normal as it took off then seemed to drag its tail and plunged to 
the ground in a ball of fire and a cloud of smoke about three 
stories tall witnesses said 
the boeing 727 flight 1141 crashed today on takeoff from 
dallasfort worth international airport with 104 people aboard 
i was coming over the bridge on i30 in arlington and i saw a 
big ball of fire going into the air greg isaacs of dallas told 
krld radio i started driving over there and it looked like it 
was over near dfw and i thought no way could it be an airplane 
accident 
it was an unbelievably big explosion i could not believe it 
i absolutely could not believe it was that big an explosion 
david hooker 28 of celina was waiting at a gas station at the 
south end of the airport when the plane crashed 
i heard the normal noise of an airplane taking off i turned 
to watch and just barely saw the nose clear a building over 
there he said pointing to a low warehousetype building about a 
halfmile away then there was a cloud of smoke about three 
stories high and an explosion 
clive lane saw the plane from his window before it crashed 
i noticed the tail was sort of hanging down like you know 
it shouldnt have been lane said and then i saw red sparks 
starting at the back of the tail and i thought thats not its 
light thats a fire then i watched it put its tail into the 
ground and exploded in a huge ball of fire 
chip miller arrived at the scene minutes after the crash 
there were probably three different colors of smoke coming out 
of the fuselage miller told cable news network the entire 
half of the plane from the wings back were on fire and charred 
part of the fuselage was cracked above the wing 
there wasnt as much fire as there was three types of smoke 
but the whole area around the plane was on fire 
passengers on the plane had no idea what happened said 
jerry weeks the plane had slid sideways about the last 100 yards 
on the ground weeks said it wasnt a violent crash it wasnt 
cartwheeling or anything like that

george bush promised today to solve the acid rain problem by 
reducing emissions by the year 2000 and declared i am an 
environmentalist always have been aides to democrat michael 
dukakis said they would use bushs selection of dan quayle as his 
running mate to question the republican nominees judgment 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich said the democratic 
national committee and the campaign were preparing separate 
advertising campaigns to kick off the fall campaign after labor 
day among the campaigns targets for the fall the choice of the 
indiana senator for the gop ticket 
dan quayle is going to emerge not only as an issue but as a 
liability on the republican side because it goes to judgment and it 
goes to leadership estrich said at a briefing on dukakis 
campaign strategy 
the democratic nominee raised questions about bushs leadership 
ability on tuesday in resurrecting the irancontra scandal asking 
how can you possibly sit there and do nothing while we traded 
arms to a terrorist nation 
dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas said today that bush has 
yet to explain his role in the armsforhostages deal which 
creates a very serious issue of george bushs judgment his 
comments came on cbs this morning 
dukakis was to continue his attack on bushs role in the scandal 
at an afternoon news conference with maine sen george mitchell 
who served on the congressional panel investigating the affair and 
coauthored a newly published book on irancontra 
the vice president who turned his attention to the environment 
during a brief campaign stop alongside lake erie near detroit 
proposed several cleanup measures as well as a global conference 
on the issue 
the time for study alone has passed as president i will 
ask for a program to cut millions of tons of sulfur dioxide 
emissions by the year 2000 and to significantly reduce nitrogen 
oxide emissions as well he said 
aides traveling with the vice president described his pledge as 
a step beyond reagan administration policy environmentalists have 
criticized the president for dragging his feet on acid rain and 
other issues during his tenure 
bush proclaimed i am an environmentalist always have been 
from my earliest days as a congressman and i always will be 
the vice president for the first time in several days made no 
reference to his democratic rival but aides said he was 
considering a trip to boston harbor in the massachusetts governors 
home state to dramatize the pollution problem 
quayle meanwhile traveled to louisiana with his wife marilyn 
as part of a fivestate southern swing 
the dukakis campaign today tried to dispel reports of lingering 
tension between the dukakis camp and jesse jackson over how the 
former candidate would campaign for the democratic ticket 
estrich and dukakis aide jack corrigan denied they had ever 
suggested to jackson that he avoid campaigning in such states as 
michigan louisiana georgia mississippi and texas 
sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity said tuesday 
that jackson resisted attempts to limit the states in which he 
campaigns but it was still unresolved where and when dukakis and 
jackson would appear together 
on tuesday bush ridiculed dukakis snowblower the prized 
emblem of the democratic presidential nominees 
budgetconsciousness during one of several appearances in which 
he continued to criticize dukakis as weak on defense 
if he doesnt want to modernize his snowblower thats his 
concern bush said at fort campbell ky referring to the 
25yearold snowblower that figured prominently in a film about 
dukakis at the democratic national convention but if he doesnt 
modernize our weapons systems that puts the national security of 
the united states in considerable risk 
dukakis resurrecting the irancontra arms and money scandal as 
a campaign issue said bush was head of an antiterrorism task 
force that had issued a report denouncing any concessions to 
terrorist nations 
the president and the vice president and a number of other 
people over the opposition of the secretary of state and the 
secretary of defense by the way proceeded to do precisely what 
that commission said you should never do dukakis said at a news 
conference during a tour of western massachusetts 
making tough decisions is a test of leadership dukakis 
said george bush endorsed the decision to sell arms to iran and 
in doing so he failed that test 
dukakis was spending most of today at the massachusetts 
statehouse before flying to california for three days of 
campaigning in western states his running mate sen lloyd bentsen 
of texas was taking the day off hunting in wyoming 
on tuesday officials of the dukakis campaign met with their 
counterparts in bushs campaign to begin negotiations on a debate 
schedule and format 
both sides reported being far apart the republicans say they 
want two presidential debates and one confrontation between vice 
presidential contenders but nothing before sept 22 the democrats 
want a more extensive schedule

antigovernment protesters clashed with 
police after the military junta nominated president augusto 
pinochet to rule until 1997 two people were killed during the 
demonstrations and more than 800 arrested 
at least 21 people were injured in the clashes 
pinochet 72 promised a move toward democracy after being named 
tuesday as the only candidate in an oct 5 presidential referendum 
the rightwing general has run chile since taking power in a bloody 
1973 coup pinochet called on his followers to fight to achieve 
victory in the presidential plebiscite 
thousands in the capital banged empty pots and pans in protest 
and demonstrators erected barricades with burning tires and blocked 
traffic at many intersections tuesday night in santiago a city of 
45 million residents 
hospital officials said erickson palma 15 was killed by 
unidentified gunmen who fired from a speeding car as he banged a 
pot from the window of his home in southwestern santiago 
officials at the hospital where palma was taken said the 
teenager was shot twice in the chest the spokespeople said three 
other demonstrators were shot and wounded in similar circumstances 
and one of them also a boy died 
police capt alejandro sierra said 19 other people were injured 
and 846 were arrested in santiago four public buses were set afire 
and destroyed by demonstrators and one of the bus drivers was 
seriously burned he said 
similar protests occurred tuesday night in many other cities 
police did not report on casualties or arrests in those cities 
but this morning a duty officer at the santiago police 
headquarters said without elaborating its totally calm now 
the protests began as pinochet and the other military commanders 
met to choose the nominee and became more violent through the 
night 
power outages occurred in several suburbs of santiago and the 
northern coastal city of la serena the cause of the blackouts was 
not known but the power transmission towers are a favorite target 
of leftist guerrillas 
pinochet heralded his nomination as a decisive moment in the 
institutional process started by his 15yearold government the 
opposition denounced it as the continuation of an aging 
dictatorship 
if i govern you govern pinochet told thousands of 
supporters from a balcony of the government palace he called on 
them to fight to achieve victory in the upcoming ballot 
pinochet led the september 1973 coup that ousted the elected 
government of marxist president salvador allende who died in the 
palace takeover pinochet has been president of the military 
government since 
if the majority of the 72 million registered voters cast 
yes ballots for pinochet he will start a new term march 11 to 
last until 1997 if he is rejected an open election will take 
place within a year with pinochet remaining in power until then 
the operetta is over gen pinochet has imposed his will and 
is preparing to continue to oppress his people until the end of the 
century said ricardo lagos a socialist and coleader of a 
16party opposition coalition 
chileans must decide between an aging dictatorship and renewed 
democracy lagos said 
the centrist christian democratic party said in a written 
statement the nomination of gen pinochet with his own vote is 
the best denial of the supposed democratic intentions of the 
regime 
the nomination was made by pinochet himself along with navy 
commander adm jose toribio merino air force chief gen fernando 
matthei and national police director gen rodolfo stange 
in his acceptance speech pinochet said his government is 
forging a new society in chile with a new type of democracy 
protected against totalitarianism 
the full democracy that approaches constitutes a new challenge 
for everyone he said it also will demand of us all 
overcoming adapting and rectifying to create a new style of 
political coexistence

public school children who dont want to take daily 
religion class will have to replace that hour with equivalent 
alternative material the council of state has ruled 
tuesdays ruling by the supreme administrative court that 
advises the government on prospective legislation reversed a 1987 
decision by the regional administrative court of lazio in which 
students were given three choices an hour of religion an hour of 
an alternative study or the option not to attend either 
just what subjects might be offered for the equivalent 
alternative hour and who would be responsible for teaching them 
is still undecided the ruling was criticized for not first 
legislating national guidelines for the alternative hour each 
school can decide the content of the alternative study 
religious instruction in this overwhelmingly roman catholic 
country was made optional in a 1984 revision of the concordat or 
italianvatican treaty but there has been no standard formula for 
how such classes should be scheduled or what to do with students 
not taking it 
the issue developed into a churchstate struggle last year the 
vatican pushed for a mandatory alternative class saying students 
would be discouraged from attending religious classes if allowed to 
leave school lay political forces objected saying it would 
compromise the optional future of religious instruction 
in 1987 more than 90 percent of public school students 
reportedly had signed up for catholic teaching

it is happening again in asia masses of people 
mounting a sustained campaign of demonstration and protest against 
an authoritarian government 
for several weeks it has been burma a year ago it was south 
korea in february 1986 people power in the philippines ended 
the 20year presidency of ferdinand e marcos and drove him into 
exile 
popular protest developed differently in each case under 
markedly different circumstances but brought changes that were 
breathtaking for all three nations 
there were signs that crowds of demonstrators in both south 
korea and burma drew inspiration from the philippine example 
some south korean protesters cited the philippines as a model of 
an asian nation throwing off oppressive rule without upsetting the 
entire basis of society or destroying the economy 
foreign tourists emerging from burma told reporters that many 
burmese repressed for 26 years found parallels with the 
philippines 
the united states which had close ties with the former regimes 
in the philippines and south korea says it welcomes more 
representative government in asia 
after burmese authorities lifted martial law last wednesday and 
said they would consider holding free elections state department 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley said certainly we welcome this 
movement toward democracy 
gaston j sigur an assistant secretary of state told a senate 
committee in may politically progress toward increasingly 
representative government continues apace in the republic of korea 
and the philippines in short events in the region have been going 
our way 
nonetheless antiamerican demonstrations have occurred as those 
who demonstrated against their governments turned to protests of 
us military forces stationed in the two countries and american 
support for the former leaders 
american officials say washington will face more difficult 
relations with countries whose governments become more democratic 
burma followed an isolationist course under the burmese way to 
socialism of ne win who seized power in a coup in 1962 he 
resigned late in july and students led protests for democracy 
economic reform and release of prisoners 
ne wins successor sein lwin jailed dissidents and soldiers 
shot to kill in an unsuccessful attempt to stop demonstrations by 
hundreds of thousands of people buddhist monks joined students in 
reading prodemocracy proclamations 
sein lwin resigned after 17 days to be replaced by civilian 
attorney maung maung and the turmoil continues 
gregory clark professor of japanese studies at sophia 
university in tokyo and a widely published commentator on asian 
politics said it was encouraging and remarkable that such latent 
people power existed in burma 
we had thought they were a demoralized and docile population 
unhappy about governmental inefficiency but tolerating it he 
said it turned out they had as much guts and bravery as the 
people in the philippines 
the burmese did not have leaders to provide a focus as for 
instance the filipinos had in corazon aquino she is the widow of 
benigno aquino who was assassinated when he returned home to 
oppose marcos and became president when marcos fled 
another difference was that a military revolt against marcos 
coincided with the popular uprising while the burmese military was 
used against protesters 
in south korea street battles last summer between huge crowds 
and riot police led to major concessions toward democracy from the 
militarybacked government but did not overthrow it 
chun doohwan the outgoing president accepted opposition 
demands that included direct presidential elections greater 
freedom of speech and release of many political prisoners 
whether the revolt in burma will bring greater democracy is not 
yet clear but asians have shown that great potentional power lies 
in coordinated mass effort in a region of 3 billion people 
asias most noted proponent of mass action was mohandas k 
gandhi he led vast throngs in demonstrations against british 
colonial rule in india which became independent in 1947

after the circuit court jury announced its verdict his attorney 
james prestwood said he would seek a new trial for the mayor who 
testified that he pardoned dozens of convicted offenders because 
hes soft hearted 
after one hour of deliberation this morning the jury ruled that 
mathis should be removed from office because hes incompetent and 
neglected his duty the verdict means he was immediately ousted

undermined the law by abusing his pardon power during the last four 
years he is accused of pardoning more than 100 traffic offenders 
including 27 drunken drivers

in office said people came to him with sad stories and he was just 
trying to help them 
im just a little soft hearted the former tire store owner 
testified 
the mayor of florala a town of about 5000 on the florida 
border 20 miles south of andalusia drew national attention with 
his july proclamation of national voodoo week and his earlier 
purported attempt to scare the police chief by sprinkling socalled 
voodoo powder around city hall council chambers and down 
corridors to the jail 
however mathis testified that he did not believe in voodoo and 
the yellow powder he spread at city hall was sulfur powder not 
meant to harm anyone physically after the media reported the 
incident the mayor said he decided to capitalize on publicity 
i dont even know what voodoo means he testified i made 
a mistake in the way i did it 
before taking the stand tuesday he told reporters satan is 
trying to destroy floralas government i love florala

undermined the law by abusing his power to pardon drunken drivers 
i have more power than ronald reagan mathis was quoted as 
saying by city clerk betty hooten 
in the states closing arguments assistant attorney general don 
valeska said no one in florala expected mathis would go power 
crazy

jetliner from the harbor near hong kong airport after the plane 
skidded off the runway upon landing in a heavy rain wednesday 
killing seven people 
the dead were six crew members and a hong kong passenger who 
died of his injuries in a hospital 
the crew members bodies were found in the front part of the 
britishmade trident which was submerged just off kai tak 
international airports only runway said tsui hincheuk 
divisional fire commander 
the jetliner operated by civil aviation administration of 
china the nations flag carrier skidded off the runway in a 
rainstorm at 919 am 919 pm edt tuesday as it landed on a 
flight from canton capital of chinas southern guangdong province 
about 90 miles to the northwest 
fifteen of the 89 people on board flight 301 were injured 
including two of the 12 american passengers said the airline 
known as caac thirteen people were hospitalized in fair and 
satisfactory condition 
radio television hong kong said that besides the americans the 
injured included three chinese crew members seven passengers from 
hong kong two from taiwan and a frenchman hospital officials 
identified one of the injured as heung cheukwu a 38yearold 
chineseamerican 
you know today the weather is not very good caac station 
manager chen zhengyou said when asked about the cause of the crash 
chinas official xinhua news agency also blamed the weather 
hong kong officials launched an investigation a london 
spokesman for british aerospace plc which makes the trident said 
the company offered to help 
caac said the pilot was among the dead and civil aviation 
department spokesman alex wong said investigators hoped to retrieve 
the planes flight recorder

democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
has come under republican fire for granting pardons to more than 
230 exconvicts since 1983 but records show he has been tougher on 
the issue than his gop predecessors 
the massachusetts civic interest council in a report released 
tuesday said the governor pardoned 232 people between 1983 and 
1987 clearing their records of crimes ranging from manslaughter 
five cases to breaking and entering 136 cases 
twentyone of dukakis pardons nearly one out of 10 were 
granted to people convicted of selling or possessing with intent to 
sell drugs 
the council a nonprofit research organization founded and 
initially funded by state gop chairman ray shamie claims no ties 
to the republican leader and bull purdun president of the 
council said it was not trying to make an overall judgment 
about dukakis 
but state gop executive director alexander tennant said the 
report is a clear indication that mike dukakis is a very liberal 
leftwing person he says one thing about being tough on crime and 
he does another 
however figures provided by the governors statehouse press 
office show that dukakis has granted fewer pardons than his 
predecessors 
republican governor john volpe granted 1324 pardons between 
1965 and 1968 and gop frank sargent granted 1755 pardons between 
1969 and 1974 
dukakis granted 552 pardons during his first term from 1975 to 
1978 he was followed by democratlatertoturnrepublican edward 
king who granted 211 pardons from 1979 to 1982 
although dukakis granted more pardons between 1983 and 1987 than 
king did during his administration the number of pardons dukakis 
allowed during a comparable fouryear period was actually less 
192 
the 232 pardons granted by dukakis between 1983 and 1987 came 
from 550 requests submitted to the advisory board of pardons a 
committee of the state parole board the full parole board 
recommended 247 of those be granted and dukakis rejected 15 of 
them 
david mcgrath executive assistant to the state parole board 
said the board considers a pardon an extraordinary form of 
relief 
it is founded on the principle that people ought to be able to 
put their problems behind them if they have exhibited extended 
periods of good citizenship and deserve forgiveness by the 
commonwealth he said 
the pardoning process is an extensive one that includes input 
from the courts the police and the prosecutors familiar with each 
applicant besides the parole board the governors legal counsel 
and the eightmember elected governors council review the 
applications 
while the number of pardons has been decreasing the number of 
criminals being sent to state prisons has increased by 40 percent 
between 1983 and 1987 and the crime rate has dropped 134 percent 
said dave wood a dukakis press aide 
in 1983 2035 people were sent to state prisons in 1987 there 
were 2853 of that increase in 818 inmates 72 percent of them 
were convicted of drugrelated crimes wood said 
very simply there are more people going to jail and there are 
hard clear increases in the number of drug offenders going to 
jail wood said and by same token we are looking at fewer 
pardons

maneuver at the wrong altitude and speed 
it was that pilots jet having crossed solo through two passing 
formations that tumbled into the crowd 
a local prosecutor said today he started a probe into the crash 
as required by west german law but said it probably would not lead 
to a criminal trial 
wilhelm sattler chief prosecutor in the neighboring town of 
kaiserlautern said legal restrictions virtually bar bringing us 
and italian officers before a german court in a criminal trial in a 
case like the ramstein crash he also said west germany has no

sunday demanded the shows be banned 
now i take warnings about the dangers of air shows seriously 
i didnt before said karl eggenweiler of rothenbergamneckar 
whose back and arms were severely burned and who will likely be 
scarred for life 
now i think these shows should be forbidden he said from 
his bed at kaiserslautern hospital 
in a poll by the respected wickert institute 82 percent of the 
2710 west germans surveyed said they want all military air shows 
stopped only 18 percent said they did not want the shows stopped 
the institute said 
dietzen said police received scores of reports of missing people 
after the crash 
there are even cases of people from as far away as america who 
have said my relative has been on vacation there for three weeks 
and we havent heard a word is it possible they were at 
ramstein he said 
west germanys ard television showed pictures of a special 
missing persons bureau set up after the disaster in kaiserslautern 
im looking for my sister said one unidentified german man 
the whole family didnt come home 
the west german newspaper bild said authorities searched in vain 
for the parents of two badly burned girls 6yearold nadine and 
10yearold melanie who were taken to a hospital in oggersheim 
one unconscious boy thought to be about 13 also had not been 
identified the frankfurt abendpost newspaper said doctors at a 
hospital in offenbach near frankfurt said he was burned over 95 
percent of his body 
meanwhile some criticized rescue operations at the show 
one eyewitness said that he held one of the injured in his 
arms for 20 minutes waiting for help the frankfurter allgemeine 
newspaper said a doctor said the organization of the air show 
was not prepared for such a catastrophe the newspaper did not 
identify the sources 
wolfgang herbig director of the kaiserslautern hospital told 
reporters he felt there were not enough mobile medical teams 
available at the air show 
but the rhinelandpalatinate state interior ministry defended 
the rescue efforts as quick levelheaded and praised the 
cooperation between the americans and germans

a ship carrying toxic waste that the 
government refused to accept for disposal sailed away wednesday 
after two days in international waters off britain 
the destination of the karin b loaded with 2100 tons of 
industrial solvents was unknown said a port control official in 
this southern city 
the wastes which originated in italy were dumped secretly and 
illegally in nigeria and then removed in two shiploads by 
contractors for italian authorities 
the karin b which left nigeria july 30 was rejected by spanish 
and welsh ports before appearing off plymouth on monday said the 
environmental group friends of the earth west germany also said it 
would not accept the waste 
a second ship the deep sea carrier sailed from nigeria aug 15 
carrying 1000 tons of the solvents reportedly for revenna italy 
which objected strongly to accepting the cargo it showed up off 
gibraltar and was off portugal wednesday said the environmental 
group 
the port official who spoke on condition of anonymity said a 
passing ship tried to contact the west germanowned ship on the 
radio but received no answer 
the environment department refused comment 
an italian embassy official enrico augelli said wherever it 
will go it will be a place where it can be treated in a safe way 
on tuesday junior environment minister virginia bottomley said 
the waste could not be brought into britain because it did not meet 
waste laws she said the waste was essentially an italian 
problem 
environmentalists said the government had lax standards that 
attracted the ship to british waters 
british law allow waste disposal companies to accept toxic waste 
from the united states and european countries for incineration or 
burial 
throughout the furor italian officials maintained their 
government was not involved and that the italian national waste 
firm ambienti had to decide what to do 
italian authorities designated ambienti to dispose of the waste 
left in koko on the banks of the niger river the italian 
government said it did not have the technology to get rid of the 
waste 
british lawmakers from the opposition labor and governing 
conservative parties called for an investigation even though the 
ship left

a former israeli district court judge said 
wednesday he will represent nazi war criminal john demjanjuk when 
he appeals his conviction and death sentence because every man 
deserves to be defended 
dov eitan will join another israeli and a canadian lawyer in the 
appeal before a panel of five supreme court judges in december 
a threejudge panel headed by supreme court judge dov levine 
ruled that demjanjuk 68 was ivan the terrible a sadistic 
guard at the treblinka death camp who operated gas chambers that 
killed 850000 jews during world war ii 
the ukranianborn retired autoworker was sentenced to death on 
april 25 
eitan 53 served for 17 years on the jerusalem district court 
bench before retiring in 1983 the weekly magazine koteret rashit

eitans israeli colleague yoram sheftel who defended demjanjuk 
from the start of the trial in february 1987 was widely criticized 
by israelis for defending demjanjuk 
but eitan said he was not worried about public reaction to his 
decision to defend demjanjuk 
im a lawyer demjanjuks family appealed to me and after 
lengthy consideration i decided the case was worth defending every 
man deserves to be defended eitan said in an interview

extradited to israel claimed he was a victim of mistaken identity 
the trial aroused strong emotions in israel and onlookers 
clapped and cheered when demjanjuk was given the death penalty

us defense policy toward asia will change 
very little regardless of who is elected the next president a 
senior pentagon official predicted wednesday 
whether it is president george bush or president michael 
dukakis policies toward asia will more or less stay on the same 
course said carl jackson deputy assistant secretary of defense 
for international security affairs he also declared it unlikely 
the united states would end its military presence in either south 
korea or the southeast asian region 
rejecting contentions that the united states provides japan a 
free ride on defense burdens jackson told a news conference that 
lingering hostility in asia from world war ii provides real 
limits beyond which japan would be welladvised not to go in 
military spending 
there may be some fine tuning of policy but under a 
traditional american principle that if it aint broke dont fix 
it the next us president would make few if any basic changes 
jackson said 
this is because basically our relationships with china japan 
the philippines with korea have been great successes through the 
last 10 years he said 
he also predicted both the current review of the agreement on 
us bases in the philippines and its eventual renegotiation will 
conclude with a new arrangement because that is in the best 
interest of the republic of the philippines and in the best 
interests of the united states 
jackson said he rules out withdrawal of the approximately 42000 
us military personnel from south korea because their presence has 
been a great success in deterring any major outbreak of war 
since the 1953 korean armistice

about 250 workers at a regional optical 
instruments plant went on strike for several hours wednesday and 
won the reinstatement of a fired manager a news agency reported 
isvan toth the manager of the visorama plant in the northern 
town of esztergom was dismissed tuesday the official mti news 
agency reported without giving any reasons for the decision it 
said the visorama strikers described toths dismissal as unfair 
and rejected the newly appointed manager 
defending toth the strikers said he fulfilled his duties for 
four years to their satisfaction and requested that the 
esztergom facility be left independent from the financially 
troubled granvisus parent company in budapest 
the report said that after some seven hours of talks with a 
representative of the ministry of industry and local communist 
party and trade union officials the employees came to an 
agreement with the general manager of the parent company who 
announced that he restored istvan toth to his former managerial 
post 
according to mti the representative promised the workers that 
his office would study the request for independence of their plant 
from the parent company 
although labor unrest is rare in hungary more than 300 workers 
at a mine in the southern part of the country went on strike for 20 
hours on aug 25 that represented the first worker challenge to the 
stringent economic policies of premier karoly grosz 
the miners at kolmo some 100 miles south of budapest had 
complained that because of a quirk in tax laws introduced at the 
beginning of this year workers on sick leave could earn more than 
those working regularly

george bush standing on the shore of 
lake erie proclaimed himself a lifelong environmentalist on 
wednesday and pledged to reduce acid rain on a set timetable 
i will work out the exact amounts and the exact methodology 
with congress bush said in a speech that aides said was designed 
to contrast the vice presidents environmental views from reagan 
administration policy 
but the waiting period for action on acid rain is over we 
must have a clear commitment to emissions reductions on a set 
timetable he said 
the republican presidential nominee also said he would convene a 
global conference during his first year in the white house to 
address the greenhouse effect he called for protection of 
natural wetlands and said he wants to insure that zero tolerance 
is applied not only to those who poison our childrens minds with 
drugs but to those who poison our water with toxic chemicals 
after several days of campaigning through the south bush chose 
a key midwestern battleground state to open a new front in his 
campaign for the white house 
one aide conceded that bush probably trails democrat michael 
dukakis in michigan which has 20 electoral votes although 
republicans express confidence they will carry the state 
bushs brief trip blended new campaign proposals in a 
madefortelevision setting near lake erie which has undergone 
significant cleanup in recent years the vice president took a 
brief walk along the lakes sandy shore and cast a fishing line 
into the water as he stopped to talk with a family on an outing 
you ever go for the walleyes asked bush an avid fisherman 
for the first time in several days bush made no mention of 
dukakis but aides said he would couple his environmental themes 
with a more aggressive campaign style thursday with a trip to 
boston harbor a highly polluted site in dukakis home state 
nor did bush mention reagan by name during the day these are 
george bush policies this is what i will do when im elected 
president he said when asked whether he was advocating stronger 
policies than reagan has pursued 
but aides traveling with the vice president said his commitment 
on acid rain was drafted with just such an idea in mind 
reagan has come under attack from environmentalists for dragging 
his feet on solving the acid rain problem during his twoterm 
tenure earlier this month however the president gave the 
goahead for continuing negotiations toward us participation in 
an international treaty to freeze emissions of nitrogen oxides a 
precursor to acid rain 
on the question of acid rain the time for study alone has 
passed bush said we know enough to begin taking steps to 
limit future damage as president i will ask for a program to 
cut millions of tons of sulfer dioxide emissions by the year 2000 
and to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well 
the vice president offered no specifics 
bush also said the superfund has sufficient money to handle 
cleanup of toxic waste sites and said the environmental protection 
agency should move aggressivly against those responsibile for 
dumping 
polluters should pay he said i am an environmentalist 
always have been from my earliest days growing up and then as a 
congressman and i always will be thats not inconsistent 
with being a businessman nor is it with being a conservative 
the campaign trip was plagued by the latest in a string of 
aircraft problems when a united airlines jet chartered to fly 
reporters to michigan developed problems and was unable to fly 
a replacement plane was brought in but didnt reach michigan 
until after bush had finished his speech reporters on board 
arrived in time to see the vice president pay a visit to the 
michigan state fair

persecution against writers continues 
in at least 29 nations despite notable improvements in the soviet 
union with an estimated 305 authors imprisoned worldwide a report 
said wednesday 
in all parts of the world there are cases of censorship or 
attempts at censorship said francis king president of pen 
the londonbased association of writers and literary figures that 
is meeting in seoul and issued the report 
the report from pens influential writers in prison 
committee said the number of novelists poets playwrights and 
journalists known to be imprisoned in 1988 was 305 or 35 less than 
one year ago 
the decrease is almost entirely explained by the new policy 
against dissidents in the ussr the report said in 1983 
93 soviet writers and journalists were reported imprisoned in 
forced psychiatric confinement or internal exile today the 
corresponding number is 20 
despite the fact that numbers in prison are diminishing and 
there are improvements in the treatment of writers in the soviet 
union argentina and chile king said conditions worsened in 
countries such as north korea vietnam iran and south africa 
there is no solution said king a british novelist and 
playwright because there is no solution to human wickedness 
he said the figures may be too low in some cases because 
information is not available from every country 
king said pen would continue pressing for the release of 
those denied freedom of expression in particular south korea 
thomas von vegesack a publisher in stockholm and chairman of 
the writers in prison committee which includes delegates from 
20 nations visited two of five literary figures in south korean 
jails this week 
von vegesack said the 20minute visits with journalist kim 
hyonjang and poet kim namju were moving and emotional he said 
pen plans to ask south koreas government to release the two 
plus publisher lee taebok and poet lee sanha with whom visits 
were denied 
the swedish publisher said he did not know enough about a fifth 
prisoner journalist lee pukyong to comment on his case and his 
committee had not asked to visit lee 
von vegesack also said pen would demand that the imprisoned 
writers be immediately given the rights to write to read all books 
readily available in south korea and to see their lawyers 
the committee examines in detail all cases involving imprisoned 
writers journalists and publishers von vegesack said 
the quality of writing is not a factor he said the 
committee deals with whoever gets in jail trying to express 
opinion pen is an apolitical organization but we believe its 
not a crime to have political opinions pen does not support 
those arrested for criminal or violent activities he added 
controversy has surrounded the seoul meeting because its 
unusual to hold a pen congress in a country where writers are in 
prison the last time that occurred was 1979 in brazil 
the east german delegation boycotted the meeting some korean 
writers also have boycotted the meeting saying they would not 
attend until their colleagues were released from jail 
many members think its not nice to go to banquets when there 
are colleagues in prison von vegesack said 
the writers in prison committee was even approached he 
said by representatives from north korea who wanted to give us 
information not about the situation in their own country but about 
the situation in south korea he said the committee ignored the 
overture

but that letters were sent to district superintendents telling them 
of schools with questionable erasures and responses the san 
francisco chronicle reported wednesday 
its up to them to take disciplinary action said honig the 
state superintendent of public instruction our job is to give 
them the information 
honig said a teacher or principal who cheats should get 
canned 
the offending schools scores were dropped from records of the 
198586 california assessment program 
the states 4600 elementary schools gave the multiple choices 
tests on math reading and writing 
the tampering was found when a computer identified 120 schools 
with a statistically high number of eraser marks on test booklets 
state officials then went over each book and found that 38 schools 
had an unusually high number of wrong answers erased and corrected 
when you had a high number of incorrects going to corrects

republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle has received more negative coverage than any national 
candidate except gary hart according to a study of network evening 
news programs released wednesday 
researchers from the center for media and public affairs said 
abc cbs and nbc broadcast 93 stories on the indiana senator from 
aug 16 when he was selected to aug 28 the following night 
there were no stories on him 
the cumulative airtime was three hours and 22 minutes more 
than onequarter of all evening news broadcasts for nearly two 
weeks after his nomination said the researchers 
evaluations of quayle by reporters and nonpartisan analysts 
were positive only 33 percent of the time according to the study 
the researchers called that ratio worse than any candidate 
received during the primaries aside from gary harts 21 percent 
positive rating 
by contrast they said republican presidential nominee george 
bush had a 49 percent positive rating during the primary season and 
his democratic counterpart michael dukakis had a 58 percent 
rating 
the latest study showed that quayles service in the indiana 
national guard was the most common topic appearing in 50 of the 93 
evening news stories his background of privilege dominated 19 
stories his relationship to lobbyist paula parkinson arose in 13 
stories and his good looks came up in 10 stories 
quayle was called a conservative 24 times in 12 days the 
researchers reported all the republican primary candidates 
combined were called conservative only 27 times during 18 months of 
campaigning they said 
the nonpartisan nonprofit center for media and public 
affairs directed by social scientists robert and linda lichter 
has been analyzing evening news coverage since the start of the 
primary season the results are published in a newsletter called 
media monitor

the chilean government to create conditions to ensure that the 
national plebiscite set for oct 5 is carried out peacefully 
deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said chilean authorities must 
create an atmosphere in which citizens can exercise their freedom 
of choice without fear or intimidation so that chile can take its 
rightful place in the community of democratic nations

nominated president augusto pinochet as the only candidate in a 
presidential referendum he will remain as president until 1997 if 
he receives majority support but an open election will take place 
within a year if the voters reject him 
mrs oakley urged the chilean government to take additional 
steps to ensure that both sides in the upcoming plebiscite have 
equal access to the media she said a new law authorizing free 
television time to opposing views improves conditions for a free 
and fair plebiscite 
the government of chile and especially its armed forces have 
an important responsibility to assure its citizens that there will 
be a free plebiscite under peaceful conditions she said

josef stalin and his successor nikita khrushchev 
drove the nations showcase hard worker to drink and ruined his 
family by promoting him to papershuffling jobs a newspaper 
reported wednesday 
alexei stakhanov was quickly ignored after his recordbreaking 
coal mining feat in the 1930s that made him a hero worker the 
labor newspaper trud said 
stakhanov was thrown out and forgotten trud said that is 
how short the administrativecommand systems memory turned out 
to be the stalinist system needed a symbol a poster and not a 
living person 
stakhanov became a legend in the soviet union for setting a 
world production record for coal on aug 31 1935 he drilled 102 
tons of coal in six hours 14 times the norm for one shift 
western historians say the feat performed at a donetsk basin 
mine was contrived they say all other work was stopped in 
stakhanovs section of the mine and that a whole gang performed 
auxiliary work that normally had to be done by the man at the coal 
face this explanation has not been reported in soviet media 
apparently so as not to diminish the value of the feat 
the achievement started a nationwide speedup movement in 
which workers nicknamed stakhanovites competed for bonuses 
and privileges by setting fantastic output records 
wednesdays article represented another attempt under soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness to 
recount history more accurately 
it also was another blow to stalin who is widely criticized in 
the official media now for developing a cult of personality 
killing millions of people including loyal communist party members 
in bloody purges and overcentralizing the soviet economy 
like other soviet leaders recalling the hardworking spirit of 
stakhanov gorbachev has stressed the need to increase 
productivity but in addition to working harder he has promised 
people a program of improved technology and accompanied the calls 
for higher quantity production with a drive for better quality 
goods 
stakhanov received many awards a better apartment and was wined 
and dined by soviet officials including stalin he did not 
however fare well in the long term trud said 
the newspaper said that in 1936 stakhanov was torn away from 
his favorite work and brought to moscow to become a bureaucrat he 
was made section chief of socialist competitions and awards 
for 25 whole years after that his name disappeared from 
newspaper and magazine pages from documentary films his voice 
wasnt heard from a speakers stand trud said 
the new job turned stakhanov into an alcoholic the newspaper 
said 
he didnt do anything in particular with the strong hands 
that were created for a mans real work he was shuffling paper and 
in the evening not infrequently poured himself vodka of 
bitterness trud said 
his lot did not improve under khrushchev who came to power in 
1953 when a foreign visitor asked the soviet leader in 1957 what 
had become of stakhanov he said the hero worker was still in 
donbass the area where he set the production record according to 
trud 
but stakhanov actually was in moscow and when khrushchev 
learned of this later he had the miner sent back to the region 
stakhanov only had 24 hours notice of the move and left his wife 
and children behind in the capital local officials ignored him 
he died a lonely and depressed man in 1977 trud said 
stakhanov still serves as an example for soviet workers trud 
said and for that will remain in the peoples memory as an 
outstanding worker and patriot

residents voted at an emotional town 
meeting to recommend that a modernstyle house erroneously 
constructed in the towns historic district be allowed to stand 
a crowd of more than 300 spilled out of the canterbury 
elementary school into the parking lot tuesday night in the town 
meeting called to try to resolve the dispute 
its not just an issue of technicalities said winofred 
wingate one of the communitys 1500 residents its an issue of 
the quality and the spirit of how we deal with these issues 
fred and janet sallah were granted a building permit for a 
round twostory redwood house because the map used by town 
officials erroneously indicated their lot was outside the historic 
district within the district new buildings are supposed to follow 
traditional new england style 
a second house was also approved erroneously but its 
architecture is not so unconventional town officials propose that 
the house a ranchstyle building would fit in if it is covered in 
wood shingles 
residents approved one proposal tuesday by a voice vote to have 
the sallahs ask the town zoning board for a variance with the 
board taking note that public sentiment favors approval sallah 
said later he would be willing to make such a request but the 
zoning board has already turned down the couples request for an 
exemption 
by a vote of 177114 residents also voted tuesday to recommend 
a referendum on the november ballot to redraw the boundaries of the 
historic district to exclude the sallahs house the ranchstyle 
house and one other nearby house 
but many residents argued that changing the historic district 
would set a bad precedent 
i am unwilling to pay the price of scrapping our zoning 
ordinance which we have protected for 18 years as a solution to 
mr sallahs problem said sabin guertin a canterbury resident 
for 65 years 
the sallahs have taken the issue to merrimack county superior 
court and have stopped work on the house which is enclosed but not 
finished inside the owners of the ranchstyle home also are 
appealing the zoning boards requirement that they put shingles on 
the house

the warring moslem and christian 
communities of lebanon proposed contradictory solutions wednesday 
to the 13yearold conflict that has claimed 130000 lives 
justice minister nabih berri head of the syrianbacked 
mainstream shiite moslem amal movement called for an end to the 
first republic that has given maronite catholics dominance over 
lebanon since independence was gained from france 45 years ago 
i hereby declare the end of the first republic in lebanon by 
burying the system of the 1943 covenant and the creation of the 
second lebanese republic based on lebanons arab calling 
sovereignty independence and justice berri said 
berri was referring to an unwritten covenant under which the 
maronites controlled the presidency the army parliament and the 
judiciary the charter gave the shiites the post of parliament 
speaker and the sunni moslems the prime ministers portfolio 
berri threatened that syrianbacked moslem and leftist factions 
would not permit presidential elections if the demanded reforms 
were not accepted before sept 23 when the sixyear term of 
president amin gemayel expires 
but samir geagea commander of the rightwing christian lebanese 
forces militia rejected berris proposals 
we are ready after the presidential elections to meet with 
all the lebanese factions anywhere in lebanon to discuss entente 
presidential elections should be held first geagea said 
entente in lebanese political parlance refers to a formula of 
coexistence accepted by the various warring factions 
parliament failed aug 18 to muster a quorum to elect a 
president to succeed gemayel when only 38 deputies showed up at 
parliaments headquarters in beirut the only serious candidate was 
syrianbacked former president suleiman franjieh 
moslem and leftist factions accused the lebanese forces of 
preventing parliamentary deputies from taking part in the session 
in order to block the election of franjieh a personal friend of 
syrian president hafez assad 
franjieh 78 holds geagea responsible for the june 1978 killing 
of his elder son tony tonys wife and 3yearold daughter along 
with 30 followers in a raid on the familys summer mansion in the 
northern town of ehden 
gegea made his remark at a news conference in christian east 
beirut as berri addressed a mass rally in south beirut to 
commemorate the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of the 
shiites religious leader in lebanon imam moussa sadr 
sadr who founded amal in 1974 and headed the supreme shiite 
islamic council disappeared aug 31 1978 during a visit to 
libya amal has accused the libyans of holding him libya denied 
the charge 
berri called on moslem and leftist militias to jointly 
confront the threat and achieve victory 
we should have the closest possible ties with syria berri 
added 
geagea called on franjieh to withdraw his candidacy because 
the syrians want to ruin lebanon 
the lebanese forces known for their close ties with israel are 
syrias main foe in lebanon syria the principal power broker in 
lebanon has about 40000 troops in eastern and northern parts of 
the country and in west and south beirut

a delta air lines jetliner carrying more 
than 100 people crashed and burned on takeoff today at dallasfort 
worth airport killing at least nine and injuring more than 30 
officials said 
the boeing 727 en route to salt lake city went down in hazy 
sunshine broke in two and burst into flames on a flat grassy 
field near the runway many passengers climbed to safety through a 
blackened hole in the top of the cabin 
passengers on another flight who watched in horror as the plane 
tipped to one side and went down chanted get up get up a 
witness said 
there was pandemonium people were jumping on the planes wing 
and burning themselves on it because it was so red hot said a 
survivor jim hammack we got out of the way fast because we 
thought it was going to explode 
you could see the fuel running down the window and down the 
wing and i wasnt going to get burned he said 
delta spokesman bill berry said at least nine people were killed 
and that about 60 survivors were healthy enough to continue on 
their way the three pilots survived although one suffered a 
severe back injury he said 
at least 32 people were admitted to seven hospitals hospital 
officials said but their condition was not immediately known 
other passengers were treated and released most of the injured 
suffered burns cuts or broken bones 
the plane had slid sideways about the last 100 yards on the 
ground it wasnt a violent crash it wasnt cartwheeling or 
anything like that said jerry weeks who works for an airport 
shuttle bus service and talked to some of the injured 
they had no idea what happened weeks said 
the fire was brought under control quickly but the partially 
blackened splitopen fuselage smoldered more than an hour after 
the 903 am accident 
flight 1141 which originated in jackson miss carried more 
than 97 passengers and seven crew members but the exact number was 
not known because infants are not on passenger lists berry said 
the important thing is that the airplane was 1000 feet from 
the end of the runway berry said this had to aid rescue 
efforts 
berry earlier reported 15 and then 11 he said those figures 
were based on erroneous reports from hospital officials and people 
at the scene 
investigators had no immediate indication of the cause of the 
crash said michael benson a spokesman for the national 
transportation safety board 
however a source involved in the federal investigation said 
early indications were that the jet took an unusually long time to 
become airborne that it climbed to only about 80 feet and that 
the left wing struck the runway first the source spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
an ntsb team of investigators was sent to the scene the boeing 
727 is one of the most popular commercial jetliners ever made 
flown by more than 170 carriers 
penn waugh an uninjured passenger said the plane never got 
in the air 
i heard a noise i knew something was wrong waugh said 
within a minute the plane was in flames he said the plane broke 
in two and passengers began scrambling through the roof he said 
rick arnett an attorney from austin said he was on a delta 
flight that had just landed when the plane went down 
it was tipping as it was taking off it was already tipping to 
the right and then as it crossed in front of us it never was able 
to get altitude he said a lot of people on the left side of 
our plane were saying get up get up when they saw it coming 
right in front of us 
clive lane said he saw the plane from his window before it 
crashed 
i noticed the tail was sort of hanging down like you know 
it shouldnt have been he said and then i saw red sparks 
starting at the back of the tail and i thought thats not its 
light thats a fire then i watched it put its tail into the 
ground and exploded in a huge ball of fire 
ambulances took injured from the site and fire trucks sprayed 
foam on the wreckage 
rescue teams in asbestos suits walked through the wreckage 
looking for passengers and spraying water on sections still aflame 
ambulances drove onto and off the field where the jet crashed 
several helicopters also flew in and out 
the accident is the second at dfw involving delta in three years 
on aug 2 1985 delta flight 191 crashed as it approached a 
runway during a violent thunderstorm killing 137 people including 
a motorist the crash injured 25 others the l1011 jet was on a 
flight from fort lauderdale fla 
investigators determined that there was a wind shear a violent 
change in wind direction that can rob a plane of lift 
on may 24 a boeing 727 of the costa rican airline lacsa 
exploded in flames on takeoff from san jose costa rica no one was 
seriously injured

a federal law guaranteeing customers of banks 
savings associations and credit unions timely access to money they 
deposit by check takes effect thursday 
congress passed the expedited funds availability act last year 
after consumer groups complained that americans were losing 
millions of dollars a year in lost interest and unjustified 
overdraft charges because some financial institutions were putting 
holds as long as two weeks on funds deposited by check 
however bankers say most institutions were voluntarily meeting 
deadlines for making funds available they complain the new rules 
are confusing and costly to implement and will make it more 
difficult to detect phony or rubber checks 
here are some of the key provisions of federal reserve 
regulations that implement the law 
local checks written on a financial institution in the same 
metropolitan area or within the same federal reserve 
checkprocessing region must be available within three business 
days 
funds on nonlocal checks can be held for as many as seven days 
after deposit 
funds from cashiers checks certified checks and government 
checks must be made available for withdrawal by 9 am on the next 
business day after deposit 
checks deposited through automaticteller machines after 2 pm 
will not be considered received until the next business day 
by sept 1 1990 the hold period will shrink to two days for 
local checks and five days for nonlocal checks

the blind trust of democratic vice presidential 
nominee lloyd bentsen invested about 564000 more than twice the 
amount previously disclosed in a holding company that was formed 
by his son last year but has conducted little business since then 
a published report said wednesday 
the houston post also reported that the company has been paying 
the financially strapped lan bentsen nearly 10000 a month for his 
services as president and board chairman according to a record of 
his testimony in an aug 3 divorce hearing 
bentsen the texas senator denied tuesday that he influenced 
the investment decision and said he saw nothing unusual about the 
transaction he acknowledged however that trust administrators 
probably based their decision on what he would have done in the 
same circumstances 
i dont consider it unusual to consider how a father would 
feel about the investment in his sons buisness bentsen said 
i consider it an investment in my sons future 
in washington spokesman bill maddox said wednesday that bentsen 
talked with the newspaper and expressed his views so i wouldnt 
have any comment in addition to what senator bentsen said to the 
post yesterday 
bentsen who is vacationing in rural wyoming was unavailable 
for comment 
senate records show the investment originated as a personal loan 
bentsen made to his son in october 1986 for between 100000 to 
250000 bentsen transferred the note receiveable to his trust in 
august 1987 
the trustee texas commerce bank then decided to convert the 
note to shares in lan bentsens new business performance property 
management doing business as sovereign management corp the 
trustee also committed additional funds at that time the post said 
federal ethics regulations require that when a public officials 
assets are transferred to a blind trust all investment decisions 
are to be left to the trustee 
lan bensten was questioned extensively about his finances during 
the aug 3 hearing which was held on a motion to reduce child 
support in his pending divorce from his wife of 10 years lynne 
barlow bentsen 
he testified he operates 25 limited real estate partnerships and 
joint ventures under a sole proprietorship called lan bentsen 
interests the business currently earns no income but has monthly 
operating expenses of about 21000 he testified

a gene inherited by a third of all white americans 
may be responsible for most cancer of the colon and rectum and a 
search is on to pinpoint this inborn cancer trigger researchers 
say 
the study to be published thursday suggests one gene or 
perhaps several that are present at birth put some people at high 
risk of developing adenomatous polyps colon and rectal cancers 
develop from these growths 
researchers who conducted the work at the university of utah say 
they believe the stillunidentified genetic factor accounts for 50 
percent to 100 percent of all cancer of the colon and rectum which 
strikes an estimated 147000 americans annually 
this paper is of particular importance because it points to 
the fact that a single gene may underlie a significant portion of 
all cases of colon cancer said dr michael swift of the 
university of north carolina it gives in principle a way of 
getting to that gene and identifying it 
dr randall w burt a coauthor of the utah study said that 
locating the gene is one of his teams goals we think we have a 
fairly good chance of one day finding the gene or genes he said 
until now many experts believed that inheritance played only a 
minor role in colon cancer 
however inheriting the gene does not mean that one is destined 
to have cancer other studies have shown that only about 5 percent 
of adenomatous polyps go on to become cancerous the researchers 
believe other genetic factors or diet may play a role in turning 
the polyps cancerous in people who inherit the gene 
we are not saying that genes are the only thing that are 
responsible for this but only particular individuals who have 
inherited the susceptibility are at increased risk said dr lisa 
a cannonalbright the studys principle author then other 
factors such as diet act upon those people to transform polyps 
into colorectal cancer 
in another report published with the study in the new england 
journal of medicine dr bert vogelstein and others from johns 
hopkins university say that a series of four or five genetic 
mutations and deletions are necessary for colon or rectal cancer to 
occur just how the two discoveries fit together is still unclear 
but vogelstein said they dont necessarily contradict each other 
it would suggest that for some reasons members of those 
families who have colon cancer have a higher tendency to mutate one 
of these genes or they already have inherited a mutated copy 
vogelstein said in an interview if it takes four or five steps 
to get cancer and they have already inherited one of them that 
would explain why they get cancer more frequently because they 
already have a head start 
the american cancer society recommends that people over age 50 
have stool tests annually for signs of cancer and they should have 
proctosignoidoscopy examination of the colon with a lighted tube 
every three to five years 
dr lowell schnipper of bostons beth israel hospital said that 
as a result of the newest findings those exams should probably 
start at age 40 in people who have relatives with colon or rectal 
cancer 
he said the new study suggests that there may well be people 
at considerably greater risk than others we should focus our 
attention on getting relatives of colon cancer patients into the 
doctors office for screening 
based on colon exams of 670 people in 34 families the utah team 
concluded that 32 percent of all white americans inherit one or two 
copies of a dominant gene that makes them susceptible polyps there 
is a 63 percent chance that people with the gene will get polyps by 
age 80 
they did not estimate the chance that people who carry the gene 
will actually get colon or rectal cancer 
the 34 families were selected randomly from utah families in 
which colon or rectal cancer or polyps had been diagnosed 
researchers said the sample had a disproportionate number of 
mormons who make up roughly half the states population but that 
the results would apply to white americans in general

the official radio urged striking workers to resume their jobs 
at the nations two oil refineries at syriam 10 miles southeast of 
rangoon and mann in central burma 
as petrol and diesel oil cannot be refined and sold

tuesday for engineers of the syriam refinery to force them back to 
work but an engineer told the associated press on wednesday none

the treasury department said wednesday it is 
scrapping a 4monthold program that offered investors a 24hour 
tollfree telephone number for buying us savings bonds with a 
credit card 
investors used the program to buy 45 million in bonds from its 
inception on may 3 through midaugust 
when it was announced in april jerrold b speers executive 
director of treasurys us savings bonds division predicted sales 
would surge as people learn they can buy bonds at any time from 
any phone 
however in a statement wednesday he said the program proved 
not costeffective and will end sept 30 
stephen meyerhardt a spokesman for the division said the 
perbond costs of selling bonds by telephone were more than the 
traditional methods of selling through banks and payroll deduction 
plans 
the budget for the fivemonth program was 800000 he said 
customers may still use the tollfree line 1800usbonds to 
listen to a recording with rate and other information on the bonds

at first blush it sounds like a pretty 
good deal if you dont mow your lawn in hempstead the town will 
do it for you 
ah but there are strings attached to the new lawn law which 
was approved by town supervisors tuesday for starters the town 
will charge errant landowners a fee for municipal mowing and town 
officials have the right to tack on a 250 fine and throw the 
offender in jail 
the fee hasnt been determined 
the beautification law which goes into effect this fall 
specifies that the town will cut any lawn in which the grass is 
more than 8 inches high it also empowers the town to remove 
abandoned vehicles from private property 
officials wont prowl through neighborhoods with tape measures 
said presiding supervisor joseph mondello but action will be taken 
against people whose neighbors complain enough or whose lawn is 
obviously high enough to be unsightly he said

a high school senior who hit rock 
bottom in jail as a gang member went from the streets to student 
council president but faces a legal battle to keep playing football 
in hopes of winning a college scholarship 
robert vaughn 19 is a former streetgang member from aurora 
and is now a b student at yorkville high school in this 
affluent western chicago suburb 
his family moved in 1986 to yorkville where vaughn the only 
black at the school of 640 is now the student council president 
and a star running back for the fighting foxes gaining more than 
700 yards last year 
vaughn is fighting an illinois high school association 
regulation that says he is too old to play organized high school 
sports 
attorneys for vaughn filed a lawsuit aug 22 challenging the 
associations refusal to grant him an exemption from the rule 
vaughn turned 19 july 10 and the rule says he is ineligible because 
his 19th birthday was before aug 15 
if i didnt play it would probably hurt my chances of getting 
a scholarship which would be my ticket to a college education 
vaughn said wednesday in a telephone interview 
when i was in jail i realized i was at rock bottom and the 
only way i have to go is up he said adding he wants to become a 
criminal lawyer 
vaughn spent 2 months in the illinois youth home in valley view 
in 1985 because of gang activities in aurora 
kendall county circuit judge james wilson issued a temporary 
restraining order tuesday that permits vaughn to play in 
yorkvilles friday night opener and five more of the teams nine 
regularseason games 
wilson scheduled an oct 12 court date to hear further arguments 
from the high school association 
we think that vaughn is a fine young man but he is in clear 
violation of the rules said wayne plaza an attorney 
representing the association 
plaza said the association is disappointed with the ruling 
because vaughn is one person now being given an exception that no 
one else is being given 
yorkville officials had requested the exemption under a recently 
adopted association bylaw governing hardships saying vaughn was 
unable to play organized high school sports during what would have 
been his freshman year in 1985 when he was jailed as a gang member 
the association denied the schools request saying its bylaw 
extends only to cases where hardships occur beyond the control of 
the student family or school 
yorkville principal frank babich said vaughn has overcome all 
obstacles so far including being the only black student in the 
schools history and should be allowed to play 
we felt here was a young guy who was able to redirect his life 
from a negative to a positive babich said 
babich who once taught at aurora east high school said many 
students in that area get involved with gangs to gain a sense of 
identity and often steal and vandalize to get attention 
when bob came to us the only problems we had with him were 
his academics and general schooling babich said he just 
wasnt used to going to school 
vaughn has his loftier goals but theres another reason for his 
court fight 
i would like to play football and thats about it he said

the soviet union sent fighter planes to the 
northern afghanistan city of kunduz to support government forces 
but this did not violate the geneva peace agreement a kremlin 
spokesman said wednesday 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said fighter 
aircraft based on soviet territory were dispatched to kunduz but 
declined to provide details of the type of planes or of the 
operations 
in another development afghan foreign minister abdul wakil 
proposed meeting with his counterparts from pakistan the soviet 
union and the united states for new efforts to bring peace to his 
country tass reported 
us state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said this week 
that the soviets had directed aircraft into afghanistan and moved 
some red army troops into kunduz from elsewhere within the country 
she said this violated the geneva accords 
at a news briefing gerasimov denied this charge and another 
us allegation that the kremlin had sent ground troops back to 
kunduz about 30 miles from the soviet border after withdrawing 
them recently 
gerasimov said soviet aircraft had to be sent in to help afghan 
forces repel rebels fighting trying to overthrow kabuls marxist 
government 
when the soviet troops left and part of the troops were still 
there counterrevolutionary antigovernmental gangs began to 
operate so countermeasures were required he said 
asked whether the afghan government requested the assistance or 
whether the soviets volunteered it the spokesman said when in 
the area around kunduz a critical situation emerged then with the 
consent of the afghan government aircraft were used from soviet 
territory for rendering urgent support including a soviet unit 
fighting counterrevolutionary formations 
gerasimov reinterated the soviet complaints against pakistan and 
also lashed out at the united states 
nothing of this kind would have happened had pakistan with 
the support of the united states not supplied arms to the rebels 
including advisers he said 
wakil said in a letter that un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar should also participate in the talks according to the 
official news agency 
the united nations oversaw indirect peace talks between 
afghanistan and pakistan that culminated in april with the signing 
of an international agreement aimed at ending the 9yearold afghan 
civil war and soviet involvement in it 
wakil said the foreign ministers meeting could be arranged with 
the un secretarygenerals help as soon as possible to review 
compliance with the geneva agreement tass said letters proposing 
the session were sent to the united nations and the countries 
invited 
the message repeated soviet and afghan charges that pakistan is 
violating the agreement by interfering in afghanistans affairs 
and noted that 73 complaints about this have been filed with the 
united nations 
pakistan has rebel bases and helps funnel ussupplied arms to 
the insurgents 
the afghan government is hoping a leadership change in pakistan 
will mean more cooperation in peace efforts 
we hope that the new pakistani government realizing the need 
for an aboveboard approach to the international agreements signed 
by the country will take steps toward improving relations between 
the two neighboring moslem states and normalizing the situation in 
the region as a whole wakil said 
pakistan president mohammad zia ulhaq a strong backer of the 
rebels was killed in a plane crash aug 17 he was succeeded by 
ghulam ishaq khan chairman of the senate 
under the geneva accords the soviets have pulled out half of 
their 100000 soldiers from afghanistan since may 15 and the 
remainder is scheduled to be withdrawn by feb 15

the library of congress said wednesday it has 
received a major gift of several thousand documents written by 
composers musicians and literary figures dating to the 12th 
century including handwritten musical scores by beethoven chopin 
and mendelssohn 
the library said the bequest from hans moldenhauer a spokane 
wash pianist teacher and musicologist who died last october was 
the greatest composite gift in the history of its music division 
whose collection already contained more than 8 million items 
the bequest received in july represents the overwhelming bulk 
of the moldenhauer collection which the library described as one 
of the greatest archives of musical primary source materials ever 
assembled 
the inventory of more than 400 pages lists several thousand 
music manuscripts letters and documents the oldest apparently is 
18 lines of latin text on vellum with musical notations from a 
12th century german prayer book 
among the many composers represented in the collection is a copy 
in ludwig van beethovens handwriting of music from mozarts opera 
don giovanni probably written as studies for portions of 
beethovens only opera fidelio 
also included are handwritten scores of frederic chopins 
prelude for piano in a flat cesar francks prelude choral and 
fugue for solo piano the sextet from giacomo puccinis opera la 
boheme felix mendelssohns arrangement of the unpublished 
overture to elijah for two pianos and a major section of the 
coronation scene from nicolai rimskykorsakoffs arrangement of the 
mussorgsky opera boris godunov 
in the collection is a letter written by english composer george 
frederic handel describing specifications for an organ to be built 
for the restored home of his collaborator charles jennens it was 
described as one of the very few handel letters that discusses 
musical matters 
the moldenhauer archives were established at the library of 
congress last year with several gifts which were supplemented 
earlier this year by major manuscripts of johannes brahms that were 
acquired from moldenhauers widow mary 
the combined collection includes many important documents from 
composers arnold schoenberg and anton von webern the library said 
including an unpublished schoenberg composition that will be played 
for the first time at the librarys coolidge auditorium 
the moldenhauer archives foundation established by the german 
immigrant who arrived in the united states in 1938 will finance 
the librarys publication of an illustrated history of western 
music based primarily on the moldenhauer collection

democrat michael dukakis demanded anew on 
wednesday that republican george bush detail his role in the 
irancontra scandal which he called one of the greatest foreign 
policy mistakes in history 
dukakis also attacked the reaganbush environmental record a day 
before bush was to venture behind enemy lines for a boston harbor 
tour designed to showcase massachusetts greatest environmental 
embarrassment 
bush has criticized dukakis for not moving earlier to clean up 
the harbor the nations filthiest but the massachusetts governor 
said he was not to blame and that reagans environmental protection 
agency had contributed to the delay in getting the project started 
dukakis scoffed at bushs pledge wednesday to combat acid rain 
with a new program 
talk about an election year convert dukakis said he noted 
money cut from federal environmental cleanup programs and said 
he wants to spend it on star wars the space defense proposal 
the democratic nominee meeting with reporters before flying to 
california to begin a threeday campaign trip blasted the 
administration for cutting funding for the clean water act some of 
which could have been used for the harbor cleanup and for not 
acting promptly on the states request for a waiver to federal 
sewage treatment guidelines when the waiver request was rejected 
dukakis began the multibillion dollar cleanup 
we are doing it no thanks to mr bush or the 
administration dukakis said 
dukakis campaign aides told a morning strategy briefing that 
dukakis would make questions about bushs judgment a central theme 
of his campaign 
to that end dukakis used the meeting with reporters to denounce 
bushs role in the armsforhostages deal with iran for the second 
consecutive day 
he refused to explain his role in this one of the greatest 
foreign policy mistakes in history dukakis said the vice 
president supported the decision the american people would like 
to know the answer to a continuing question mr bush you sat 
through five meetings five meetings on the subject how can you 
say now that you did not know that know that it was a straight 
armsforhostages deal 
joining dukakis at the news conference was maine sen george 
mitchell the coauthor of a new book on the irancontra affair 
men of zeal and a member of the congressional committee that 
investigated the arms deal 
mitchell said the hearing records and bushs public statements 
showed that the vice president endorsed the trading of weapons for 
american hostages held by proiranian factions 
the democratic senator who later attended a separate news 
conference to denounce the reagan administration environmental 
record said it was ludicrous for bush to come to boston to discuss 
water pollution and also attacked the vice presidents statement on 
acid rain 
mitchell the prime sponsor of legislation to control emissions 
blamed for acid rain said the reagan administration has 
consistently opposed the measure 
where has vice president bush been for the past seven 
years mitchell said the reaganbush administration has 
opposed every single effort to deal with acid rain for any 
american concerned with the environment the choice in this 
election is very clear 
bush may not be alone on the harbor when he takes his pollution 
tour thursday dukakis aides and allies said they were considering 
a harbor event of their own to answer the expected bush attacks on 
dukakis handling of the harbor project

police arrested one member of an 
environmental group that has occupied three caves but the group 
continued its fight wednesday to secure protection for rare 
subterranean organisms 
a 25yearold woman occupying tooth cave was arrested for 
trespassing tuesday afternoon said travis county sheriffs 
deputies formal charges were pending 
members of the group earth first on monday occupied three caves 
in northwestern travis county near the site of a planned shopping 
center activists continued to occupy amber and kretschmarr caves 
on wednesday a spokeswoman said 
james reddell a university of texas scientist who discovered 
the three caves 25 years ago said he agreed with the environmental 
group that they are priceless biologically but he called their 
protest absurd counterproductive and said it could threaten 
the very organisms the activists are trying to save 
those caves are small and any time you have someone inside 
you change the temperature he said the protesters have gone 
completely overboard he said 
but earth first coordinator barbara dugelby defended the 
protest and said it came after months of effort to work through 
normal channels 
people say were intruding on these caves she said we 
think construction and destruction are intruding on these caves 
the group claimed the landowner dr fred purcell risked damage 
to the caves by allowing sewer lines detention ponds and roadways 
to be built on the land 
however purcell denied the charges saying he is working with 
city officials and researchers to keep the caves intact 
tooth cave has five species of invertebrates found nowhere else 
on earth said reddell who has written about 100 articles on cave 
environments but he said purcell has been totally cooperative 
with explorers and with university of texas researchers 
dugelby said the environmentalists want the us fish and 
wildlife service to place the five species two beetles a spider 
a pseudoscorpion and a caveadapted daddy longlegs on its 
list of endangered species

michael dukakis plans to portray the selection of 
embattled republican running mate dan quayle as an example of 
george bushs lack of judgment and leadership a theme that will 
play a major role in democratic strategy for the fall campaign the 
dukakis campaign said wednesday 
we start this campaign on a solid footing in a close 
competitive race susan estrich dukakis campaign manager said 
at a briefing on strategy for the final two months of the white 
house race 
she said dukakis would continue stressing two themes his goal 
of extending economic prosperity to all americans and the need for 
leadership at the top 
reflecting a tougher tone from dukakis in recent days estrich 
said we will be aggressive but we will be aggressive on the 
issues 
estrich said the campaign would contrast the record of 
accomplishment of our ticket of mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen with 
the record of accomplishment or lack thereof the record of lack of 
leadership on the republican side 
one issue we are certain to hear more of from democrats across 
the board is the selection of sen quayle and his record and 
qualifications she said 
estrich predicted that dan quayle is going to emerge not only 
as an issue but a liability because it goes to judgment and it goes 
to leadership 
campaigning in louisiana quayle retorted this is the first 
real sign that you are seeing a crumbling campaign ive been in 
politics a long time fair play fair enough i can stand the heat 
and ill stay in the kitchen 
she said the democratic presidential campaign has paid staff in 
every state and is getting strong assistance from state parties as 
well she cited the crucial states of california with 75 democratic 
party field organizers and texas with 50 as examples 
we believe we go into the labor day beginning with one of the 
best organized campaigns that a democrat has been able to mount 
she said 
dukakis and bentsen will appear together at a traditional labor 
day rally in detroit and then go their separate campaign ways 
the dukakis campaign and the democratic national committee are 
preparing separate advertising campaigns to air labor day week 
the partys advertising campaign will highlight the theme 
bringing prosperity home while the initial campaign aids will 
focus on dukakis record as governor of massachusetts portraying 
him as a skilled administrator capable of implementing the goals 
his goals of an improved economy and better jobs she said 
its our sense right now that voters have only scant 
information of what dukakis has accomplished she said 
there is a lot of misinformation out there and were going to 
correct it said estrich an indirect acknowledgment that 
republican nominee bush has scored well in recent weeks with 
attacks on dukakis on such issues as military buildup crime and 
the pledge of allegiance 
estrich also sought to counter the republican characterization 
of the democrats as the party of gloom and doom 
she said dukakis emphasis on the economy reflects the concern 
of middle class americans that what you have in this country is not 
gloom and doom but it is two people both working in millions of 
families to make what one person made 20 years ago 
she brushed aside concerns that dukakis has spent an unusual 
amount of time the past two weeks campaigning in his home state 
its not an issue she said its a responsibility that 
comes with being governor with those responsibilities come a 
real record of accomplishment and experience 
asked to cite specific differences between bentsen and quayle 
estrich said mike dukakis chose as his vice president the man 
who led the fight for plant closing legislation george bush chose 
as his vice president the man who led the fight against it 
she referred to a billthat would require companies to give 
advance notice to workers and communities before shutting down 
plants 
bush has said he would place his vice president in charge of 
coordinating an administration war against drugs but estrich noted 
that in a recent interview the indiana senator admitted he did not 
know that bush headed an administration task force to block the 
flow of drugs into florida 
believe me when i get into it i will know a lot about that 
program quayle told the boston globe in an interview published 
monday

the united states on wednesday urged the 
soviet union to stop sending planes from its territory to strike at 
usbacked guerrillas in afghanistan 
the call came on the eve of a meeting in moscow between 
undersecretary of state michael armacost and soviet deputy foreign 
minister yuli vorontsov 
the two diplomats are meeting to discuss a series of regional 
issues affecting the superpowers client states around the world 
but the afghanistan question is expected to be at the top of the 
agenda 
on tuesday the state department accused the soviet union of 
violating the geneva accords for the pullout of soviet troops from 
afghanistan by sending its planes to bomb the mujahedeen rebels 
around the northern afghan city of kunduz 
a government spokesman in moscow confirmed that sovietbased 
fighter aircraft were used to aid afghan ground troops battling for 
kunduz but denied the action violated the geneva accords foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov also denied another us 
allegation that the kremlin had sent troops back to kunduz about 
30 miles 50 kms from the soviet border after recently 
withdrawing them 
but mrs oakley dismissed gerasimovs denial saying im 
sticking where i was on this question yesterday we said that these 
raids came from bases inside the soviet union therefore in our 
view it was a violation 
she cited a clause in the geneva accords which she said commits 
the soviets to refrain from any form of interference or 
intervention in the internal affairs of afghanistan 
mrs oakley declined to elaborate saying only obviously the 
soviets have admitted that they have used aircraft in the bombing 
raids in kunduz from areas inside afghanistan let me repeat we 
wish theyd stop it 
mrs oakley reiterated that the united states was in the process 
of preparing a complaint for the un good offices mission which 
monitors the geneva pact the agreement signed last april calls for 
the pullout of all soviet troops by feb 15 
the soviets have already complied with an aug 15 deadline for 
withdrawing half of their estimated 115000 troops following more 
than eight years of occupation 
the soviets have repeatedly complained to the un about us 
and pakistani violations of the pact in connection with supplies to 
the mujahedeen 
the united states says it will keep arming the rebels as long as 
the soviets supply the kabul government

the states top court refused wednesday to 
consider removing former rep mario biaggi from the states 
democratic primary ballot despite his resignation and conviction 
on corruption charges 
the decision by the court of appeals not to hear the appeal by 
biaggis primary opponents means the popular bronx democrats name 
will almost certainly be on the ballot sept 15 even though he has 
said hes not a candidate 
biaggi 70 was in his 10th term when he resigned his 
congressional seat aug 5 the day after he was convicted on 
federal racketeering extortion and bribetaking charges in 
connection with the wedtech defense scandal 
because of biaggis popularity some bronx democratic leaders 
believe theres a strong chance he could win the primary election 
in the heavily democratic district a primary victory often 
guarantees a november election victory and thats especially true 
in this case because biaggi also has the republican nomination 
if biaggi is reelected to congress its expected that he would 
resign again rather than face the possibility of not being seated 
by his former colleagues the house had been poised to begin 
expulsion hearings against him when he resigned in august 
in the wake of wednesdays action the only way biaggi could get 
off the sept 15 democratic primary ballot is by death being 
nominated for a judgeship or moving out of the state 
biaggis opponents in the sept 15 democratic primary state 
assemblyman eliot engel and former assemblyman vincent marchiselli 
had tried to get the state board of elections and the state courts 
to have biaggis original nominating petitions declared invalid 
the two have been rebuffed even though biaggi says he doesnt want 
to run 
arnold linhardt a spokesman for engle said there probably were 
no grounds for bringing the appeal to the federal courts 
should biaggi be reelected and resign again it would be up to 
gov mario cuomo to call a special election probably in february 
at the earliest 
linhardt said some bronx democratic leaders want biaggi to be 
reelected so they can handpick a candidate for the special 
election neither engel nor marchiselli are considered organization 
favorites 
biaggi faces up to 20 years in prison on the counts for which he 
was convicted aug 4 he has said he would appeal biaggi also has 
been sentenced to 30 months in prison for obstructing justice and 
taking a free florida trip in an unrelated case involving alleged 
favors for a brooklyn shipyard company

the transportation department and a handful of 
republican congressmen are challenging a state department 
recommendation that export licenses be granted for china to launch 
usmade satellites administration and congressional sources said 
tuesday 
the white house national security adviser lt gen colin 
powell told members of the house in a letter that president reagan 
will reach a decision on the issue by midseptember 
transportation department officials argued at an interagency 
meeting last thursday that allowing china to launch the satellites 
aboard its long march booster would undercut us companies that 
are trying to develop an expendable launch vehicle elv 
the reagan administration has barred private us companies from 
launching satellites aboard the soviet proton booster and congress 
and the administration have encouraged us firms to develop a 
onetime booster in the wake of the challenger shuttle disaster 
the transportation department has expressed a concern that the 
approval of this export license could be to the detriment of the 
emerging commercial space launch industry that the president is 
trying to create said a department official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
rep gerald solomon rny said in a letter to the white house 
that permitting us satellites to be launched on either the 
proton rocket of the soviet union or the long march vehicle of the 
peoples republic of china both of which are government produced 
and backed would defeat the intent of presidential and 
congressional policy 
the artificially low prices offered by these countries are 
less than half of the cost to us firms to build similar 
vehicles solomon wrote 
solomons letter to the white house was signed by five other 
republican congressmen jack kemp of new york william broomfield 
of michigan robert walker of pennsylvania jerry lewis of calif 
and james sensenbrenner of wisconsin 
powell replied that the administration was judging applications 
to export satellites for launch by china on a casebycase 
basis 
the state department favors allowing usmade satellites to go 
up on the long march so as not to offend the chinese say 
administration sources 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley told reporters that 
because the issue is under review it is inappropriate for me to 
comment at this point other state department officials said the 
issue would be decided by the white house 
the six republican house members argued that giving business to 
chinas governmentowned and governmentsubsidized long march 
booster program would 
jeopardize the jobs of 8000 americans involved in developing a 
us booster 
act to the detriment of our goal of assured access to space 
and undercut us efforts to develop a reserve fleet of launch 
vehicles in time of national emergency 
result in a oneway street of transferring sophisticated us 
aerospace technology to the peoples republic of china 
two organizations both foreign have applied for licenses to 
export usmade satellites to china aussat an austrialian 
company signed a letter of intent in june with the hughes aircraft 
co to manufacture two telecommunications satellites 
asiasat owned by british and hong kong concerns is negotiating 
with hughes to refurbish a westar 6 satellite that was launched by 
the us shuttle in 1984 failed to reached the proper orbit and 
was recovered by the shuttle said hughes spokesman don oneill

solidarity leader lech walesa wednesday 
night appealed to striking workers across the country to settle 
local grievances with management in order to end polands worst 
wave of strikes in seven years 
walesa said the national issues of guaranteeing trade union 
pluralism and legalizing his banned trade union solidarity would be 
taken up in roundtable discussions promised by the government in 
the near future according to a statement read by an aide 
the aide piotr konopka said walesa was conferring with 
strikers at the lenin shipyard and the strike there could end very 
soon 
walesas statement came after meeting with communist officials 
for the first time since the union was banned in 1982 the 
officials media said they discussed holding talks on workers 
grievances 
the extraordinary threehour meeting was aimed at solving 
polands strongest wave of strikes since the 1981 martial law 
crackdown 
i am an optimist a smiling walesa told reporters and 
several dozen cheering supporters after the meeting 
walesa had no other comment as he left the roman catholic 
episcopate in warsaw by car he conferred with top solidarity 
advisers and church officials for two hours after concluding his 
talks with interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak 
earlier a communique by the press office of the episcopate said 
that walesa had raised the key issues of solidaritys future and 
union pluralism 
the partners in the talks stated that all problems connected 
with union movement will be discussed at the round table there are 
no taboo subjects the communique said 
ten enterprises across the country remained idled by strikers 
demanding reinstatement of solidarity and higher wages to offset 60 
percent inflation 
the staterun news agency pap carried a brief report on the 
talks 
gen czeslaw kiszczak met with lech walesa in warsaw the talk 
was attended by bishop jerzy dabrowski and stanislaw ciosek the 
pap report said ciosek is a secretary of the official national 
unity organization pron pron which stands for patriotic movement 
for national rebirth was set up by the government shortly after 
martial law 
witnesses who saw walesa leave the meeting said it was held in a 
villa in the mokotow district of warsaw 300 feet from the residence 
of the us ambassador to poland 
walesa who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 then returned to 
the roman catholic episcopate where he went after arriving from 
gdansk 
pap said the participants discussed the premises for holding a 
roundtable meeting and its procedures 
the pap report apparently referred to fridays proposal by 
kiszczak for broadbased roundtable discussions on worker 
grievances 
the communist partys ruling politburo on tuesday heard a report 
on preparations for the roundtable meeting and recommended 
kiszczak continue the mission entrusted to him 
lt colonel wieslaw gornicki an aide to polish leader gen 
wojciech jaruzelski told abcs good morning america today that 
kiszczak talked to walesa as an eminent personality but not as 
the chairman of a nonexistent union 
the government demanded in exchange for the talks that walesa 
end a strike at the lenin shipyard in gdansk 
when asked by reporters earlier today if he would do this 
walesa replied i dont have the powers when asked if that 
meant he would not call off the strike the solidarity chairman 
said i did not say so 
asked what he would discuss with kiszczak walesa said how to 
make up for the past seven years 
accords signed at the gdansk shipyard on aug 31 1980 after a 
nationwide strike wave made solidarity the only independent labor 
federation ever recognized in the soviet bloc it was suppressed 
with martial law in 1981 and banned the next year 
the current strikes began began aug 16 in the coal fields of 
silesia in southern poland and spread to solidaritys traditional 
stronghold in the ports and shipyards of the baltic coast 
at their peak they affected 20 businesses employing about 
100000 people 
a strike at the huge steel and heavy machinery plant in stalowa 
wola in southeastern poland intensified this week 
senior solidarity advisers called todays warsaw meeting a 
historic event 
walesa last met with a senior government official in early 1982 
when he was still interned 
in recent years he has been spoken of by the government as a 
private citizen a tool of foreign powers and the former head of 
a former union 
but in the past few months authorities have been seeking 
partners in an attempt to open a dialogue with society that might 
help lead the country out of economic despondency 
the results of this meeting will be very important for the 
fate of the whole country and the world said adam michnik a 
senior solidarity adviser 
at a news conference in warsaw urban the government spokesman 
said the starting of talks would be a common victory 
the evening news tuesday showed footage of the signing of the 
gdansk agreements on aug 31 1980 by walesa and mieczyslaw 
jagielski who at that time was the deputy prime minister 
its high time to try it again said the television news

president miguel de la madrid believes his 
biggest accomplishment is maintaining social order while keeping 
the country from going bankrupt an aide said 
de la madrid who planned to deliver his final state of the 
nation message on thursday came to power on dec 1 1982 mexico 
was nearly bankrupt after a collapse in oil prices inflation was 
rampant and the value of the peso was plunging 
while he is proud of keeping mexico solvent and relatively free 
of unrest his frustration was not being able to do the things he 
would have liked because of the economic limitations said the 
aide who spoke on condition of anonymity tuesday 
but de la madrids efforts to reform a corrupt political system 
produced mexicos most democratic election since his institutional 
revolutionary party gained power in 1929 
one hundred seats to be divided in proportion to the national 
vote were added to the lower house of the legislature giving the 
opposition an opportunity to win a larger role opposition 
candidates were permitted to win local elections especially in the 
north 
the pri itself instituted primaries on the municipal level 
although a disagreement about presidential primaries was one factor 
in a split that helped the leftwing opposition which grouped 
itself as the democratic front 
the result was a july 6 presidential election that saw the 
opposition win nearly 50 per cent of the popular vote and a 
forceful voice in congress but the opposition contended the pri 
maintained its grip on power only through massive fraud 
a long wrangle in the chamber of deputies ended with the pri 
taking 260 seats and a divided opposition 240 139 for the leftist 
front and 101 for the rightist national action party the left also 
won four of 64 seats in the senate the first time the pri has ever 
lost senate seats 
de la madrid a harvardtrained economist renegotiated a 
foreign debt that now stands at 104 billion while resisting 
pressure for a moratorium on payments his administration took 
steps to reduce the role of the state in the economy although many 
large industries such as petroleum and banking remain 
nationalized 
some of the steps were painful and the peso plunge cost mexican 
consumers about 50 percent of their buying power during de la 
madrids sixyear term 
he also had to deal with the september 1985 earthquake in mexico 
city which killed about 9500 people 
de la madrid downplayed mexicos high profile role in central 
america avoiding open friction with the united states over 
conflicts in nicaragua and el salvador while working for regional 
solutions 
he had a good working relationship with president reagan and 
argued that mexico could not be solely responsible for stopping 
drug trafficking de la madrid said the drug problem starts at the 
consumer level in the united states 
de la madrid prepared the way economically for his chosen 
successor carlos salinas de gortari who was largely responsible 
for the regimes economic measures as de la madrids planning and 
budget secretary 
in addition to loosening tight state control of the economy de 
la madrid brought mexico into the general agreement in trade and 
tariffs to force mexican industralists to compete abroad and 
domestically 
when inflation hit nearly 150 percent in 1987 de la madrid 
united government and private business in a belttightening 
economic solidarity pact that helped reduce inflation to 43 per 
cent in the first six months of 1988 government figures for august 
show a rate of below 1 percent 
de la madrid suffered harsh criticism from both left and right 
leftist presidential candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas called for a 
moratorium on debt payments saying that they are hobbling economic 
development the national action party wants economic privatization 
to go farther faster 
the political reforms changed the political structure of this 
country and shook the pri salinas who won with the lowest 
percentage ever for a pri presidential candidate said after the 
election that the era of the oneparty rule is over 
referring to the drop in popular support de la madrid told a 
group of labor leaders tuesday that the party made mistakes 
but he added there is no threat to the system we will 
regroup will will fight more strongly we are strongly enough to 
keep reactionaries from the left or the right to take power away 
from the mexican revolution

hundreds of protesters shouted from 
hilltops and waved banners on boats wednesday when two us 
warships that can launch nuclear missiles sailed into the home port 
of the us 7th fleet 
the ships are the first to be stationed in japan with launchers 
for tomahawk missiles which are made in both nuclear and 
nonnuclear versions 
get out from yokosuka about 100 people shouted in english 
at the gates of the naval base as the ticonderogaclass guided 
missile cruiser uss bunker hill and the destroyer uss fife arrived 
in the port 28 miles southwest of tokyo 
a coast guard official said the warships arrived without 
incident fortytwo coast guard patrol boats escorted the us 
ships into the port to prevent the approach of 28 small boats 
carrying protesters and banners reading no tomahawks the 
official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
japan forbids the production possession or introduction into 
the country of nuclear weapons 
nearly 200000 people died in the japanese cities of hiroshima 
and nagasaki when the united states dropped the first atomic bombs 
to end world war ii 
after the ships arrived more protesters from civic and peace 
groups labor unions and the japanese communist party staged 
separate rallies at a park overlooking the port outside the naval 
base and elsewhere carrying placards and shouting slogans police 
reported no arrests 
protesters said the biggest rally sponsored by the communists 
drew an estimated 1000 people 
on tuesday yokosukas 48member city assembly unanimously 
passed a resolution urging the government to keep out the us 
warships the citys mayor and the prefectural governor also lodged 
official protests monday with the japanese government and said it 
did not do enough to ensure that the ships were not carrying 
nuclear weapons 
we hope our grassroot struggles will spread to a national 
movement said yoshiko saito a leader of a citizens group 
staging a sitin near the yokosuka city hall 
the 9600ton bunker hill and the 7810ton fife both are 
capable of deploying tomahawk missiles under the japanus 
security agreement the united states has pledged to notify japan 
beforehand if it plans to bring nuclear arms into the country 
but critics charge the japanese government uses the agreement as 
a way of avoiding the question of whether us ships dock in the 
country with nuclear weapons aboard 
prime minister noboru takeshita told reporters wednesday that 
the government would not ask the united states to confirm whether 
the ships were carrying nuclear missiles because we trust each 
other in such matters kyodo news service reported 
the us military which has about 50000 personnel stationed in 
japan maintains a policy of not publicly confirming or denying 
nuclear weapons aboard its ships

police captured two heavily armed 
ira guerrilla suspects heading toward a british army barracks after 
driving from the netherlands through a remote border crossing 
officials said wednesday 
their car seized around midnight tuesday contained two rifles 
and two pistols said alexander prechtel spokesman for the chief 
federal prosecutors office but he could not confirm a radio 
report that the men brought explosives 
since march 1987 attacks by suspected irish republican army 
guerrillas against british army installations in west germany have 
killed three people and injured 40 
in the latest such attack a bomb exploded at a british army 
barracks in duesseldorf on aug 5 five people were injured 
the attacks are part of an escalated ira campaign against 
british targets in europe 
on wednesday officials said the two men drove over the dutch 
border into northwestern west germany by using a remote country 
lane that is off limits to traffic between the two countries 
german police arrested the two suspected guerrillas after they 
reached the town of waldfeucht 45 miles northwest of cologne on 
the dutch border prechtel said 
there are grounds to believe that they belong to the ira he 
said in a telephone interview an investigation is now underway 
prechtel said the pair was headed toward a small british army 
barracks in the same community but did not specify how close they 
came to the military outpost 
police became suspicious after spotting the pair near the remote 
crossing which has come under closer watch after ira attacks in 
the area the spokesman said 
one of them has a british passport although we do not know 
yet if it is genuine prechtel said police have not found any 
documents for the other man he said prechtel refused to release 
the mens names 
suedwestfunk radio in stuttgart reported earlier wednesday that 
the suspects were carrying weapons and explosives in their car 
so far this year the ira has killed 27 members of the british 
security forces in gun and bomb attacks in northern ireland 
elsewhere in britain and in continental europe 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
the predominantly protestant province of northern ireland and to 
unite it with the overwhelmingly catholic republic of ireland

the pilot to coax the floundering jet into the air 
the boeing 727 lifting crashed wednesday morning just beyond the 
runway at dallasfort worth international airport 
a lot of people on the left side of our plane were saying get 
up get up when they saw it coming in front of us said rick 
arnett an attorney from austin 
as the plane came up to take off it was barely getting off 
the ground and the right wing was dipping as it passed beyond us 
there were flames coming out of the right engine and the wing 
touched the ground the plane started spinning and there was an 
explosion said arnett whose flight had just landed 
gene metzig was aboard a commuter flight that had just landed 
from his hometown of wichita falls 
his right wing was coming straight at us it was probably no 
more than a foot or 18 inches off the ground metzig said as 
he pulled it back to the left i dont know how the hell he missed 
us but he missed us 
as passengers on metzigs plane watched the delta flight 
struggling to get off the ground they began to cheer it was 
like a football game metzig said we were cheering this guy to 
get that plane off the ground it was very emotional plus we were 
in danger of our own lives we were rooting for that pilot to get 
that plane up but there was just no way he said

burst into flames 
i was coming over the bridge on i30 in arlington and i saw a 
big ball of fire going into the air greg isaacs of dallas told 
krld radio i started driving over there and it looked like it 
was over near dfw and i thought no way could it be an airplane

explosion i could not believe it i absolutely could not believe 
it was that big an explosion isaacs said

explosive that struck khotso house or the identity of the bombers 
the governmentrun south african broadcasting corp said without 
citing sources that the bomb was believed to be the biggest of 
its kind in south africa 
there has been a sinister silence surrounding the solution to 
these attacks on antiapartheid groups said rev frank 
chikane general secretary of the south african council of 
churches main occupant of the khotso building 
when community buildings and antiapartheid organizations 
are attacked no one is found responsible in almost all the

countrys largest protestant denominations 
chikane also expressed concern the councils files might be 
searched by police investigating the blast 
authorities declared the building unsafe and police barred 
journalists and the people who work in khotso house from entering

the black sash civil rights group two of the most prominent 
antiapartheid organizations not yet affected by government bans 
several other church and human rights groups have offices in the

severely damaged last year described wednesdays bombing as part 
of a continuous campaign against the opponents of apartheid 
the congress the nations main black labor federation said it 
had heard nothing from police about investigations of the 1987 
blast at its headquarters

outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement which seeks 
to topple the whitedominated government

23 people injured wednesday and said police were conducting a

the city police chief says two men 
should be prosecuted for appearing on a radio talk show to tell how 
they saw guards kick a handcuffed prisoner at the local jail 
chief joe gerwens had warned wnwsam and the men that their 
comments violated a state law forbidding disclosure of an official 
complaint against a police officer the show was broadcast anyway 
last week and gerwens said tuesday he would ask the police legal 
adviser whether the two could be charged 
jeff hochman the legal adviser said wednesday he had talked 
briefly to gerwens but hadnt decided what steps to take 
its so blatantly a prior restraint on the press said radio 
host al rantel i never knew it was against the law for people to 
describe what theyve witnessed 
charles bado one of the two guests said he decided to speak 
with rantel and newspaper reporters because he believes the law is 
wrong 
under this law youre denied the right to talk about what you 
saw before you say it he said 
gerwens however defended the law saying discussing 
allegations against police in the media could impede a successful 
and thorough investigation bado a marketing vice president for 
a financial company said he and his friend randy detrick were 
bicycling aug 23 when they stopped to watch police arrest a woman 
for disorderly conduct 
police reports say officers warned the two men to move on bado 
said that when they did not move quickly enough they were arrested 
in a jail holding cell that night bado said he saw an inmate 
lorenzo pierce 40 kicked repeatedly by guards as he lay helpless 
on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back police say 
pierce struck two guards and spit on them and they struggled to 
get him under control 
bado said he also saw a guard partially disrobe another inmate 
as other guards hooted at him 
after bado was freed he called the police departments internal 
affairs department and made an appointment to discuss the matter 
gerwens said that call officially started the investigation and 
under the 1982 law bado and detrick were therefore prohibited from 
talking about it violation of the law is a firstdegree 
misdemeanor

an afghan cosmonaut who has flown combat missions 
against rebels in his country arrived with two soviets at a manned 
space station wednesday and appealed for peace in his homeland 
staterun television transmitted live as the afghan cosmonaut 
and his two soviet colleagues entered the space station and met 
with the two cosmonauts already on board 
vladimir titov and musa manarov already have spent eight months 
in space and hope to break the 326day space endurance record in 
december that record was set by soviet cosmonaut yuri romanenko 
who returned to earth on dec 29 
afghan abdul ahad mohmand in a message addressed to his 
countrymen from the soviet space station mir which means 
peace said violence could not be seen from outer space 
i would like to believe that such will be the situation on the 
land inhabited by my brothers and sisters on the land of our 
fathers and mothers who have suffered so much during the years of 
the war he said during the live transmission by staterun soviet 
television 
mohmands presence on the flight represents an effort by the 
kremlin to boost the prestige of afghanistans prosoviet 
government as soviet troops withdraw the soviets have agreed to 
withdraw all soldiers who were sent to bolster that government by 
feb 15 1989 
mohmand 29 has flown combat missions against the 
antigovernment rebels in afghanistan as a pilot in its air force

the afghan was accompanied by soviets vladimir lyakhov and dr 
valery polyakov who will stay aboard mir to monitor the health of 
titov and manarov as they try to break the endurance record

shortages 
polyakov underwent an operation before the flight to remove bone

a smoker became outraged and shoved a flight 
attendant across an aisle when he was told he couldnt light up a 
prosecutor said but a defense attorney argued that the man didnt 
touch any airline employee 
james tabacca 34 a mortician was on board a trans world 
airlines flight from boston to los angeles in december when it was 
announced shortly before takeoff that smoking would be banned on 
the flight 
but tabacca insisted on lighting up and twisted a flight 
attendants arm and shoved her when she tried to stop him 
assistant us attorney robin scroggie said tuesday in his opening 
statement in federal court here 
scroggie who also alleged that tabacca hurled obscenities at 
flight service manager pamela martinez said that as tabacca was 
leaving the plane he intentionally rammed his shoulder into 
her and swung his garment bag directly into pam martinezs 
leg 
but tabaccas lawyer deputy public defender marilyn butler 
said tabacca didnt touch ms martinez 
nothing happened all the people surrounding mr tabacca who 
could be found saw nothing ms butler said 
although tabaccas ticket was for the smoking section federal 
regulations require airlines to provide nosmoking seats for all 
passengers who arrive on time and want them prosecutors say this 
meant most seats on the flight needed to be converted 
the defense attorney claims tabacca was unfairly singled out by 
authorities who named him and one other smoker in an indictment 
while she says tabacca did light a cigarette she denies her client 
touched ms martinez 
tabacca if convicted faces a 20year prison sentence and a 
possible 250000 fine scroggie said

a court has ordered a town house owner in one of 
bostons most elegant neighborhoods to lop off a fifthstory 
addition under construction that officials fear will disturb the 
atmosphere of posh beacon hill 
its a piece of architecture that is going to be with us for a 
long time if its not done david buckley chairman of the beacon 
hill architectural commission said wednesday these things dont 
just come and go like flowers in a planting bed 
but the owners attorney guy carbone said his client is being 
treated unfairly because the city decreed that the original 
119yearold row house be torn down during renovations because of a 
rotting foundation then rebuilt with the facade restored to its 
original condition 
the whole issue here is that once the city ordered the 
building torn down can the architectural commission order us to 
rebuild it as it was in 1869 carbone said 
thats an interesting opinion said buckley who responded 
by pointing to court decisions backing the commissions stand 
the commission in 1985 approved some renovation for parkers 
house but did not approve an additional floor buckley said the 
commission allowed him to take down the facade but said bricks had 
to be removed by hand numbered and put back in place 
court papers said in addition to the extra floor many of the 
bricks were tossed into a pile and broken and some instructions on 
maintaining the facade were not followed 
the owner chase f parker declined to comment wednesday 
carbone said parker planned to build a town house that would fit 
in with other structures in the area we tried very very hard to 
satisfy the commission he said 
the beacon hill historic district was established in 1955 to 
preserve the neighborhood as an example of old boston said john 
devereaux an attorney for the commission 
much of the area home to the wellheeled of 18thcentury 
boston has been transformed inwardly into condominium 
developments but the outward facades remain for the most part town 
houses of darkred brick some with ornate windows and entryways 
zoning regulations in the area would allow a fifth floor but 
the architectural commission a fivemember panel appointed by the 
mayor has final say on any structural changes visible to the 
public 
suffolk county superior court judge catherine white on june 21 
upheld the commissions decision forbidding the fifth floor and 
ordered parker to tear down construction a hearing date has not 
been set in the case currently before the state appeals court 
while the case is pending white sheets are draped over part of 
the building and a temporary roof has been erected to cover initial 
construction above the fourth floor 
carbone noted that other renovated buildings in the district are 
taller than the original structures 
the commission does not try to maintain strict preservation and 
allows new materials to be used and changes to be made if they are 
judged to be in keeping with the area buckley said 
but adding a floor to a building would change the character of 
the structure he said 
there hasnt been an enormous problem in having people 
conform he said in fact theres quite a bit of support for 
it

a federal magistrate has recommended that 
a contempt citation be brought against agriculture secretary 
richard lyng for failing to fully obey a court order barring the 
usda from calling in cropstorage loans 
magistrate janice symchych made the recommendation tuesday to 
us district judge harry maclaughlin who had issued a preliminary 
injunction july 21 against the agriculture departments 
loancancellation plan 
lyng has 10 days from tuesday in which to file objections to the 
contempt recommendation 
according to the minnesota attorney generals office which is a 
party to the suit against the usda the department did not comply 
with the injunction until july 29 when it announced that certain 
loans could be extended until aug 31 the announcement came after 
many farmers already had settled their loans with the usda the 
attorney generals office said 
symchych recommended all loans due and payable after july 22 be 
extended for loans that matured on july 31 and were settled by 
farmers before any extensions were available symchych recommended 
that usda restore those farmers to the position they would have 
been in had the federal agency obeyed the injunction 
the court cannot allow defendants usda to circumvent the 
purpose of the injunction by simply employing new tactics or 
strategies which achieve the same unlawful result symchych said 
in a report 
the federal reserve program allows farmers to hold surplus 
grains off the market while receiving government price supports and 
storage fees in effect the grain is collateral for the loans 
because the drought has tightened grain supplies the agriculture 
department is calling the loans in order to force the farmers to 
sell the grain 
in addition to the contempt citation symchych recommended the 
usda be fined 1000 for each loan it canceled after maclaughlins 
injunction went into effect symchych also recommended the usda be 
given until sept 30 to comply with the order 
lyng was on vacation and unavailable for comment usda spokesman 
dave lane said wednesday 
richard w goldberg acting undersecretary for international 
affairs and commodity programs for the usda said he would not 
comment on the matter because it is under litigation 
attorney general hubert h humphrey iii brought the suit against 
the department on behalf of agriculture commissioner jim nichols 
and seven minnesota farmers he contended that the agriculture 
department failed to go through the formal government rulemaking 
procedures before it decided to stop extending the loans 
the usda meanwhile announced tuesday that it would stop 
extending crop loans as of wednesday irrespective of maclaughlins 
injunction the announcement came before symchychs recommendation 
was issued 
humphrey and nichols were expected to seek a court hearing this 
week to halt implementation of the usdas new plan

four thousand men women and children 
have died of starvation and tens of thousands residing in the 
wartorn regions of southern sudan face a similar fate officials 
said wednesday 
angelo beda president of sudans council for the south said 
the only way to save those starving in the equatoria and bahr 
elghazal regions was with emergency air shipments of food and 
medical supplies 
in ireland the rev aengus finucane director of the 
dublinbased aid agency concern said about 40 people were dying 
daily at a refugee camp in el meriam 500 miles south of khartoum 
and that about 2 million people faced death from the ravages of war 
and starvation 
beda said most southerners abandoned their crops and cattle in 
the countryside and fled to towns and cities because of fierce 
fighting in the fiveyear civil war he said residents are being 
beseiged by the rebel sudan peoples liberation army and dying of 
starvation as food supplies dwindle 
beda whose group includes southern political representatives 
from prime minister sadek elmahdis government said record floods 
in sudan earlier this month diverted the attention of western 
relief organizations from what he called the catastrophe of the 
south 
four thousand people have died of hunger in the town of 
aweil so far he said aweil in the bahr elghazal region is 
587 miles southwest of khartoum 
asked about finucanes estimates for the number of southerners 
dying beda said he lacked exact figures but yes you can say 
the reports about people dying by thousands is correct 
in torit 787 miles south of khartoum about 10000 people were 
stranded without food and facing starvation beda said he said the 
bishop of torit described the situation as critical 
beda also said wau 662 miles southwest of the capital faced a 
similar situation as did residents in juba 750 miles south of 
khartoum and malakal 425 miles south of the capital 
for at least four months no food or essential commodities has 
reached those towns no medicine has reached them either so people 
die beda said 
he said the only way to save those people was to make emergency 
air drops of food and medical supplies 
the rebel spla in recent years has shot down two civilian 
aircrafts killing 73 people and several military planes it has 
accused the government of using civilian and relief planes to 
transport military troops and equipment and has threatened to shoot 
down any plane flying over the south 
the civil war has forced at least 820000 people to flee their 
homes in southern sudan and trek to neighbouring ethiopia they 
usually head by foot or by train to southern cities and towns that 
are controlled by the army or northward to khartoum 
in 1986 western relief agencies warned that up to 2 million 
southerners faced starvation because they were dependent on relief 
food in the cities and because the rebels controlled 90 percent of 
the countryside making it almost impossible to get supplies to 
them 
despite the rebel attacks relief agencies have been 
sporadically flown in supplies from neighbouring countries or used 
trucks trains and barges from khartoum 
the rebels mostly christians and animists are seeking more 
autonomy as well as economic and administrative reforms from the 
moslem majority government in the north

officials of the department of housing and 
urban development voiced concern wednesday that recent court 
decisions could cost the agency more than 3 billion a year and 
bankrupt its singlefamily mortgage insurance fund 
thomas t demery assistant housing secretary and commissioner 
of the federal housing administration expressed what he described 
as fear and alarm over a decision in us district court here 
tuesday that prevents hud from selling any of the 47000 foreclosed 
homes in its inventory 
us district judge harold h greene temporarily blocked hud 
from selling the homes to the highest bidder unless they are for 
the benefit of homeless or lowincome people 
demery along with hud general counsel michael dorsey said 
greenes decision if upheld would halt fha property sales which 
provide about 32 billion in annual revenues the fha fund has 
current reserves of about 6 billion 
imposing a freeze on our disposition program could well 
threaten the financial solvency of fha since our basic home 
mortgage insurance program receives no congressional appropriations 
and has no authority to borrow from the treasury demery told 
reporters 
demery and dorsey said hud would ask congress to clarify whether 
the department has complied with legislation last year that was 
intended to benefit the homeless 
greenes temporary restraining order expires sept 14 us 
district judge oliver gasch who has jurisdiction over the case 
will schedule further action 
greene issued his order in response to a plea by the national 
housing law project one of the homeless advocacy groups fighting 
huds singlefamily home sales policy because hud planned to sell 
170 homes in metropolitan washington on wednesday 
last week the project succeeded in preventing hud from selling 
200 such homes in michigan 
demery said the fha insures more than 6 million home mortgages 
with outstanding balances of nearly 230 billion in recent years 
he said 30 to 40 percent of all new homes sold for less than 
100000 have been insured by the fha 
this is a program that has helped 17 million american families 
obtain home ownership and has received bipartisan support from all 
segments he said 
it would be tragic if we were to put a program like this at 
risk especially at a time when there is a growing consensus over 
over the need to do more to help reverse the recent trend toward 
declining home ownership rates demery said 
we need to do more to help working class families obtain home 
ownership not less he said 
demery said hud has 400 homes under lease or that have been sold 
to homeless persons 
we want this number to grow and are eager to work with 
homeless advocates to devise ways that we can make more fha 
foreclosed homes available demery said 
but what we object to is a strategy that pits the needs of 
hardworking families who want to buy modestly priced homes with 
the needs of the homeless he said 
it shouldnt be a case of one versus the other and surely we 
can find ways of doing more to help the homeless without 
bankrupting the fha fund

drought continues to put the bite on consumer 
food dollars including higher prices for fresh vegetables this 
summer and signs that processed items also will be more costly in 
1989 an agriculture department report said wednesday 
prices paid to growers for fresh vegetables jumped more than 21 
percent from july to august the report said and this summers 
prices overall could be up 10 percent from the third quarter of 
1987 a period when fresh vegetable prices usually decline 
however this years extremely dry weather coupled with 
minimum irrigation in the north central states reduced supplies 
and put upward pressure on prices in midsummer the department 
economic research service said as local supplies tighten 
consumers likely will be be more dependent than usual on vegetables 
shipped from more distant areas 
the governments consumer price index for fresh vegetables 
including potatoes rose 4 percent from june to july and was up 5 
percent from july 1987 potatoes lettuce and tomatoes are the most 
important in the fresh vegetable index 
retail potato prices were up seasonally in july and were also 
boosted slightly by the droughts impact on the summer crop 
lettuce prices tend to be seasonally low in july and were 
slightly lower this july due to large california supplies the 
report said tomato prices tend to be down in july as tomatoes 
are the most commonly grown vegetable in home gardens which 
reduces summer demand however the drought boosted this julys 
prices 
the cpi for processing vegetables is generally flat in the 
summer but it rose 1 percent in july the report said prices are 
expected to continue rising through 1989 as higher wholesale costs 
work through the marketing pipeline

a contract dispute between hollywood 
producers and the teamsters union is threatening to disrupt the 
film and television industry as it recovers from the fivemonth 
scriptwriters strike 
the teamsters contract with the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers expired july 30 and only daytoday contract 
extensions have prevented the teamsters from striking 
the union was scheduled to announce late wednesday the results 
of a vote on the producers latest contract offer with members 
expected to reject the contract by an overwhelming margin 
another negotiating session was set for thursday morning 
a walkout by the teamsters representing 2200 film and 
television drivers could put a severe crimp on hollywood 
production as it recovers from the writers walkout which ended 
aug 7 
earl bush secretarytreasurer for the teamsters local 399 has 
said that the producers last proposal is the most insulting 
offer he has seen in 43 years as a teamster 
the contract proposal bush said would require about half the 
teamsters local 399 members to take 261perhour pay cuts the 
producers are offering a minimum salary for those drivers of 14 an 
hour down from 1661 bigrig drivers earn more and producers 
plan to raise their salaries 
the producers have said that union concessions are necessary to 
keep costs down and prevent socalled runaway production where 
film and televison crews move to nonunion states and countries 
the issue is competitiveness said herb steinberg a 
spokesman for the alliance we want to remain competitive in this 
market and keep production here the producers estimate that 
runaway production has cost hollywood teamsters 14 million in lost 
wages and benefits during the last two years 
the producers also want to redefine rules for overtime pay

delta air lines inc has grown from a cropduster 
to the nations thirdlargest airline since it began operations six 
decades ago flying from dallas to jackson miss 
a delta boeing 727 flight 1141 which originated in jackson 
crashed on takeoff wednesday at dallasfort worth international 
airport 
the crash came three years and 26 days after a delta lockheed 
l1011 jet crashed at the same airport killing 137 people 
lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages from that crash are 
still in court although some already have resulted in 
multimilliondollar judgments against delta 
last year delta suffered a spate of embarrassments pilots 
landed at the wrong airport or on the wrong runway one plane 
plummeted toward the ocean because the pilot mistakenly shut off 
the engines another plane was involved in a near miss over the 
atlantic 
last year delta also grew by acquiring western airlines in an 
860 million merger 
through it all delta has maintained a reputation as a wellrun 
safe and financially secure airline 
i dont think the reputation is undeserved and it probably 
wont change said robert decker an airline industry analyst with 
duff amp phelps inc in chicago 
if you ask people in airline maintenance who they think does 
the best job deltas almost always the name mentioned first 
said john pincavage an analyst with painewebber inc in new york 
delta spokesman bill berry said the airline is not afraid its 
reputation will suffer greatly because of the crash 
you have to realize delta flies more flights than any airline 
in the world he said we operate more flights so we have 
greater exposure you have to put it in perspective you look 
at our overall record and its quite good 
deltas common stock dropped 1 a share at news of the crash 
but recovered half the loss by the close of trading to stand at 
4650 
analysts attributed the stock drop as much to a round of fare 
reductions touched off tuesday by continental airlines as to the 
crash itself 
anthony hatch an analyst in new york with argus research 
called delta a terrifically well run airline he said delta 
survived the embarrassing incidents last year because it had so 
much good will in the bank 
eastern airlines deltas chief competitor has been rocked by 
safety investigations of its aircraft and labor troubles the 
airline has cut back on its routes a plan to lay off 4000 
employees was blocked this week by a federal judge 
delta began corporate life as the worlds first cropdusting 
service huff daland dusters a division of huff daland 
manufacturing co of ogdensburg ny 
then in 1928 the company led by collett woolman broke away 
from the parent company to form delta air service with headquarters 
in monroe la passenger service began in 1929 with 90 mph flights 
from dallas to jackson 
woolman who ran the company until his death in 1966 set the 
tone for delta including a unique tradition of having pilots greet 
passengers as they leave each flight 
the company changed its name in 1930 to delta air corp and 
later to delta air lines inc and moved headquarters to atlanta in 
the early 40s for the annual meeting however the company leaves 
its headquarters at hartsfield atlanta international airport and 
returns to monroe 
deltas growth was spurred in the early years as it added routes 
in the south and merged with other airlines in 1953 and 1972 but 
the biggest step came in 1987 when delta completed an 860 million 
merger with western airlines inc making it the nations third 
largest airline in terms of numbers of passengers carried 
delta which has 48000 employees posted a profit of 30683 
million on 692 billion in revenues during the fiscal year ended 
june 30

thousands of government postal workers sealed mail 
boxes stopped sorting letters and walked off their routes 
wednesday to protest bonus payments that vary by region 
private delivery companies welcomed the extra business saying 
it will prove they can compete 
the union of communication workers called a 24hour nationwide 
strike but the royal mail disputed the unions claim that nearly 
all its 140000 letter carriers and letter sorters had stopped 
working 
its very patchy a patchy situation said sally williams a 
royal mail spokeswoman while theres certainly support for the 
strike nevertheless quite a number of staff have turned up for 
work 
she said the post office had repeatedly offered to continue 
talks with the union and had been as flexible as we can 
the unions other 60000 members either work for the state 
telephone monopoly or for the post office in administration or 
counter services which were not involved in the dispute said a 
union spokesman 
ms williams said mail was being sorted and delivered in some 
areas particularly the southeast and southwest although she did 
not have figures for how many employees had shown up for work 
counter services were not disrupted at any of the striking royal 
mail post offices in england scotland wales and northern ireland 
although letter boxes had been sealed she said 
it was the first national strike at royal mail since a 1971 
walkout which collapsed after 47 days 
the stoppage increased demands for prime minister margaret 
thatchers conservative government to end the royal mails 
nearmonopoly on the delivery of letters and parcels since she 
came to power in 1979 her government has sold off to private 
enterprise large sectors of stateowned assets under its 
denationalization program 
the royal mail has the exclusive right to collect sort and 
deliver all mail with a postal charge of less than one pound 
160 the cost of mailing an ordinary letter in britain through 
the royal mail is 18 pence 30 cents 
tnt mailfast a company claiming to be the largest private 
carrier in britain said business rose 500 percent on wednesday and 
was expected to produce longterm benefits 
people are getting a bit upset about the threat of strikes all 
the time said general manager john hartle more and more 
people who come over to us are tending to stay 
alan tuffin general secretary of the union said the union was 
going to throw the nations mail into chaos 
the dispute concerns bonus payments for new recruits in london 
and southeastern england where living costs are higher than in the 
rest of britain and where the royal mail has trouble recruiting and 
keeping staff because of high employment and competition for staff 
the union wants the bonuses paid to all new recruits throughout 
the country or not paid at all tuffin said he fears the royal mail 
management eventually wants to introduce differentials in basic pay 
for different areas and end national pay bargaining agreements 
the bonuses range from 1267 to 3380 a week the royal mail 
said that with the bonuses firstyear recruits in central london 
earn a basic 206 a week it said the average wage for all postal

former democratic candidate jesse jackson and 
new york city mayor edward i koch promised wednesday to put aside 
their political animosity and work together to elect michael 
dukakis to the presidency 
april 1988 is behind us november 8 and the elections of next 
year are ahead of us jackson said after a more than twohour 
peace session convened by gov mario cuomo at his manhattan office 
were moving in that direction 
then koch who apologized for the stridency of his attacks on 
jackson during new yorks primary in april said i couldnt add 
a sentence that would improve on jacksons words 
jackson and koch said the focus of the meeting was finding a 
common ground centering on their commitment to the dukakis 
campaign voter registration and an agenda of urban policies 
democratic nominee dukakis is battling republican george bush in 
a close race for the white house 
last april koch endorsed sen albert gore jr of tennessee in 
the democratic primary and suggested that jews would be crazy 
to vote for jackson in light of his position on the middle east 
on wednesday koch praised jackson for his generosity of 
spirit 
but jacksons actions contradicted the upbeat words at no point 
during the news conference did the democratic leader stand beside 
koch and he kept a dour expression despite several attempts at 
levity by the mayor 
cuomo who stood between the two men as they addressed a 
jampacked news conference said it was difficult for koch and 
jackson but especially for jackson to sit down and discuss a 
truce 
we decided it is better to compromise and conciliate than 
criticize we should replace criticism with constructive 
compromise cuomo said 
jackson told the news conference that it was in our best 
interest to act like mature adults and stay above attacks on 
integrity 
jackson said he bore no animosity toward koch who seemed to 
surprise the civil rights activist by shaking his hand after 
addressing the crowd

saudi arabia has decided to cut spending on 
domestic production subsidies for the 1989 wheat crop in an effort 
to reduce the need for export subsidies an agriculture department 
report said wednesday 
however at this point the subsidy reduction will affect only 
large farms which account for about 10 percent of total saudi 
wheat production the departments foreign agricultural service 
reported 
the government of saudi arabia has been subsidizing exports of 
domestic wheat surpluses since 198586 as a result saudi wheat 
has competed against us wheat in china indonesia and south 
korea the report said 
in addition to the wheat subsidy reduction the saudi government 
will attempt to reduce the countrys reliance on barley imports by 
requiring largescale wheat producers to plant as much barley as 
they do wheat

the diseased bodies of more than 1000 
dogs dumped off greenland may have caused an epidemic that has 
killed at least 11000 seals in northern europes coastal waters 
the swedish news agency tt said wednesday 
sled dogs on the arctic island died of distemper early in 1988 
and the first discoveries of swollen dead seals were reported in 
april in denmark 
western european experts said earlier this week the canine 
distemper virus cdv or a similar one killed the seals 
we knew that greenland was ravished by the distemper disease 
in march tt quoted seal expert berndt klingeborn as saying we 
first thought that the seals had contaminated the dogs but after 
hearing that the carcasses were thrown into the water it appears to 
be the other way around 
thousands of seals migrate from greenland to western european 
waters each year in search of food 
distemper virus causes infections of the respiratory and central 
nervous systems and digestive tracts in both dogs and seals 
greenland officials have said the virus was brought to greenland 
by foxes ravens and possibly polar bears across the frozen baffin 
bay from the canadian arctic where distemper was reported in 
october 
seal experts say up to 80 percent of the seals in affected 
waters will die but those remaining population will be immune to 
the disease 
the virus has been most devastating off scandinavia with 3400 
seals dead in sweden and almost 3000 in denmark about 3900 
others died off west germany 600 in norwegian waters and 175 off 
the netherlands

the fireravaged northwest can expect little 
relief from unusually hot dry weather until a trend toward rain 
and cooler temperatures begins in october the national weather 
service said wednesday 
abovenormal temperatures will persist over much of the west 
during the next five days through the labor day weekend government 
forecasters said while seasonable temperatures can be expected 
elsewhere widespread rain will fall from the great lakes region to 
the eastern states 
the picture will remain pretty much the same through sept 10 
the service said most of the nation except for the east and gulf 
coasts will be dry with high temperatures over most of the west 
and northern plains states and cool weather east of the mississippi 
valley 
the pacific northwest which has battled widespread forest fires 
in recent weeks will continue to suffer abnormally warm dry 
weather throughout september until a wet cooling trend begins 
only the longer outlook through november brings cool wet 
conditions to the northwest the service said it should be 
warmer in the southwest and california and most areas of the east 
with rain extending up the mississippi and ohio valleys to the 
great lakes and midatlantic regions 
streamflows are expected to remain below average across much of 
the country although tropical storm chris dumped four to six 
inches of rain across the atlantic coast this week the boost to 
streamflows in that area will subside in a few days the forecast 
said 
water reserves at major reservoirs remain average to below 
average for this time of year across much of the country the

despite wednesdays fiery crash at the 
dallasfort worth airport the boeing 727 has been a workhorse for 
many of the worlds airlines for nearly 25 years and has garnered 
rave reviews for its safety after a rocky start 
it is the most reliable airplane in the world said gary 
reich who analyzes the aerospace industry for the new york 
investment firm shearson lehman hutton it has flown through 
storms and turbulence and its performed beautifully and 
reliably 
before they were discontinued in 1984 the boeing co 
manufactured 1831 of them since the first went into service in 
1964 53 have been lost in accidents including wednesdays crash 
and four that were destroyed in terrorist attacks said jack 
gamble a boeing spokesman in renton wash 
reich said that in the early years of the 727 the nations 
airline fleets were just entering the jet age and several of the 
planes crashed because pilots were unaccustomed to the rapidity 
with which the aircraft descended during landings 
pilots had to be retrained to cope with the socalled high sink 
rate 
in the course of those accidents another problem was revealed 
reich said in the early models lines brought fuel along the top 
of the fuselage from the wings to the three engines at the rear 
which meant that in accidents coach passengers would be doused 
with burning fuel within a few years the lines were repositioned 
to the bottom portion of the fuselage 
they had some difficulties in the early years but those go 
back to the mid to late 60s said roger fleming vice president 
for technical planning and development for the air transport 
association the airline industry trade group theyve been a 
highly reliable aircraft 
over the years the federal aviation administration has issued 
122 airworthiness directives ordering the owners of 727s to 
make specific adjustments to the planes faa spokesman mitch barker 
said in seattle he said that represents a normal number for an 
aircraft that old 
of those however only 12 applied to the model 200 the longer 
modernized version of the plane that boeing began delivering to its 
customers in december 1967 in all 1260 of the 727s manufactured 
were model 200s including the jet that crashed in dallas on 
wednesday the earlier versions were model 100s 
one recurring problem was with the aircrafts landing gear 
which barker said were complex and had been kind of a headache 
he said he did not have details on what the problem was 
gamble said the first crash involving a 727 occurred in august 
1965 when one of the aircraft plummeted into lake michigan the 
next involved an american airlines 727 that crashed in cincinnati 
in november 1965 followed three days later by an accident at salt 
lake city the cincinnati and salt lake city incidents were caused 
by the pilots unfamiliarity with aircrafts rapid rate of descent 
he said 
among the crafts more recent accidents a pan american 727 
crashed after takeoff in kenner la on july 9 1982 and 153 
people were killed and on sept 25 1978 a pacific southwest 
airlines boeing 727 and private cessna 172 collided over san diego 
calif killing 144 
the aircraft remains the most widely used jet in the us 
airline fleet according to airline consultant george james of 
3476 passenger and cargo aircraft used by american carriers 1148 
are 727s the second most commonly used craft is the boeing 737 
with 634 in use 
the 727 is being phased out for economic reasons airlines have 
have found it less expensive to use more modern aircraft that have 
only two engines and require two pilots instead of the crew of 
three needed to fly 727s

american oilmen are negotiating quietly in 
hopes of resuming libyan operations if the next us administration 
ends or modifies the economic embargo imposed on moammar gadhafis 
government in 1985 
in the past two years the chairman of libyas state petroleum 
company has met with us oil company officials in geneva paris 
and other west european cities a west european oil company 
official said wednesday 
he said the two sides are discussing a possible return of the 
americans under terms of an agreement signed a few months after 
president reagan imposed the embargo on libya in 1986 
the agreement on july 1 1986 froze american oil company assets 
and allowed the libyans to work their oil fields the western 
source said with libya assuming all costs but also taking all the 
income 
before the embargo libya got 51 percent of the oil produced by 
us companies the agreement provides for the same split if the 
embargo is lifted and the source said of the americans they will 
return 
us companies said to be involved are occidental petroleum 
corp oasis oil and a consortium of conoco marathon and amerada 
hess 
the 1986 agreement expires june 30 1989 but if the americans 
are not back by then an extension probably will be arrianged 
because both sides are eager to do business again the source said 
an official of the state oil company said we are waiting to 
see what happens at the start of next year and expressed a 
common libyan opinion that restrictions might be relaxed when 
reagan leaves office 
all those who commented did so on condition of anonymity 
reagan imposed the sanctions in january 1986 because of 
gadhafis alleged support of terrorism and forbade americaans to 
work in libya 
the work ban has been costly for libya the state oil company 
official said it replaced the departing american workers by 
advertising around the world for highly skilled managers and 
technicians 
he said the places were filled by britons canadians swedes 
indians and french workers but at a high cost about 400 americans 
worked in the libyan oil industry before the embargo he said 
spare parts for american equipment also had to be obtained 
elsewhere at higher prices 
lower world prices have caused libyas oil revenue to decline 
from 22 billion in 1980 to 6 billion in 1986

republican george bush promised action to reduce acid rain on 
wednesday and declared i am an environmentalist rival michael 
dukakis shot back talk about an electionyear convert 
seeking to gain the initiative after two weeks of moribund 
campaigning the democratic presidential nominee delivered a broad 
attack on bush for a second day ridiculing his statements on the 
environment and demanding an explanation of his role in the 
irancontra debacle 
bush campaigning in michigan avoided mention of his rivals 
name a new course after weeks of calculated attacks but his 
republican running mate dan quayle picked up the cudgel and 
denounced dukakis as a defeatest liberal 
the republicans continued to poke fun at dukakiss aged snow 
blower that became a symbol of his frugality at the democratic 
convention 
his ideas are as old as that 25yearold snow blower quayle 
said in baton rouge la 
dukakis campaign strategists were targeting quayle the indiana 
senator whose selection stunned even republican insiders dukakis 
campaign manager susan estrich said they would depict his selection 
as an indication of poor judgment by bush and would make that one 
of the central themes of the fall campaign 
one issue we are certain to hear more of from democrats across 
the board is the selection of senator quayle and his record and 
qualifications she said at a briefing in boston 
quayle was unbowed by the prospect of two more months of 
personal attack saying i can stand the heat and ill stay in 
the kitchen 
a new abcwashington post poll released wednesday found twice as 
many voters thought the democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen was more qualified than quayle but twothirds said 
quayle should remain on the ticket 
the poll showed the presidential race a statistical dead heat 
dukakis had 48 percent to bushs 47 percent within the 35point 
margin of error of the survey aug 2430 of 1129 registered 
likely voters 
bush stood on the michigan shore of lake erie to deliver a 
speech aimed at separating himself from the reagan administration 
with more activist positions on major environmental issues of acid 
rain the greenhouse effect and pollution of waters 
polluters should pay the vice president said i am an 
environmentalist always have been from my earliest days growing 
up and then as a congressman and i always will be 
bush planned a trip onto his rivals home ground on thursday 
with a visit to boston harbor aimed at making the harbors 
longstanding pollution problem an embarrassment to the 
massachusetts governor 
attempting a preemptive strike dukakis blasted the reagan 
administraiton for cutting funding for the clean water act some of 
which could have been used for the harbor cleanup 
we are doing it no thanks to mr bush or the 
administration dukakis said 
he displayed scorn for bushs promise of action on acid rain 
saying bush really would rather spend money on the star wars 
spacebased defense program than on environmental protection 
talk about an electionyear convert dukakis said 
damaging increases in the acidity of rainfall has been tied to 
emissions from coalfired power plants and other sources including 
auto exhausts 
on the question of acid rain the time for study alone has 
passed bush said we know enough to begin taking steps to 
limit future damage as president i will ask for a program to 
cut millions of tons of sulfer dioxide emissions by the year 2000 
and to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well 
dukakis appeared at a news conference in boston with maine sen 
george mitchell one of the irancontra investigators and coauthor 
of a book that criticizes bushs role in the missilesforhostages 
deal with iran 
the american people would like to know the answer to a 
continuing question dukakis said 
mr bush you sat through five meetings five meetings on the 
subject how can you say now that you did not know that it was a 
straight armsforhostages deal dukakis demanded 
quayle campaigned before students at louisiana state university 
and toured an exxon oil refinery he said he and bush vigorously 
disagree with dukakiss opposition to offshore oil exploration 
dukakis has called for no new offshore drilling and has 
stressed that position in california where it is a major issue 
campaigning in california in the spring bush opposed 
administration plans to lease new oil plots off the california 
coast and called for more study instead 
dukakis left boston for california where he planned to campaign 
thursday before stopping in other western states friday and 
saturday bush was campaigning in the northeast on thursday and 
friday 
democratic vice presidential nominee sen lloyd bentsen was 
vacationing in wyoming his republican counterpart was remaining in 
the south the rest of the week

foreign minister ali akbar velayati of 
iran urged wednesday that an early exchange of prisoners be 
arranged with iraq official tehran radio reported 
in paris the daily newspaper le monde quoted velayati as saying 
iraqi negotiators have dalayed progress on prisoner exchange and 
other issues in a settlement of the 8yearold war 
he said the purpose was to force concessions from iran on the 
disputed shattalarab waterway which forms their southern border 
and is iraqs only outlet to the persian gulf le monde reported 
tehran radio said velayati made the comments to iranian 
reporters in geneva where peace talks were stalled for the fifth 
straight day 
our aim is that the exchange of prisoners of war should take 
place as soon as possible velayati said the very urgent 
problems facing iranian families need to be resolved so that our 
loved ones who have been captured may return to their homes 
iran has listed 46098 prisoners in its camps but un 
officials say many have not been unregistered and the real number 
may be about 70000 
iraq furnished a list of 18139 iranian prisoners as of aug 1 
but iraqi authorities told un officials many recent detainees had 
not been registered un officials believe that could bring the 
total to 35000 
velayati also called for renewed efforts to return iraqi 
refugees to iraq the radio report said 
thousands of kurdish civilians fled to iran because of battles 
between the iraqi army and iranianbacked kurdish guerrillas other 
refugees are shiite moslems from southern iraq 
velayati declared according to the radio fundamental 
thinking must be done in order to facilitate the honorable return 
of iraqi refugees be they kurds or arabs to their own country 
and in order to restore these peoples rights 
no official count of the refugees has been given 
le monde quoted velayati as saying the iraqis hoped to win 
sovereignty over the shattalarab and if we give in to these 
iraqi demands nothing guarantees us that they will not draw up 
other conditions just as difficult why would we be the only ones 
to make concessions 
the paper also quoted velayati as claiming in an interview that 
iraq still hold more than 380 square miles of iranian territory 
including the towns of khosravi and naft shahr but iran had 
withdrawn from all iraqi territory

democrat michael dukakis and republican george 
bush are locked in a dead heat in their presidential race 
according to the latest poll of registered voters released 
wednesday 
the abc newswashington post survey found dukakis holding a 
onepoint lead over bush 48 percent to 47 percent that was 
negated by the polls 35 percent margin of error 
the poll of 1129 likely voters conducted aug 24 through 
tuesday night was similar to the last survey which found bush 
leading by two points 48 percent to 46 percent the last poll was 
completed aug 23 
dukakis enjoyed his biggest lead in the abc newswashington post 
survey shortly after the democratic national convention in july 
when he led his gop opponent by 15 percentage points 
according to the latest survey twice as many voters 53 
percent believe democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd 
bentsen is more qualified that his gop rival dan quayle than the 
reverse 26 percent 
the poll also found that bushs aggressive campaign style of the 
past few days and dukakis lack of response has had little 
effect on two key groups democrats who voted for president reagan 
in 1980 and 1984 and independents 
among the reagan democrats dukakis led 58 percent to 34 
percent a marginal change from his 57 percent to 31 percent lead 
over bush last week the republican nominee added no new 
independents this week although he continues to lead among that 
group 52 percent to 38 percent 
the gender gap in which womens voting patterns vary from men 
narrowed slightly but dukakis still holds an advantage in the 
latest poll dukakis led 51 percent to 43 percent among women 
voters while bush held a 51 percent to 44 percent lead among men

an antiabortion group said wednesday it will 
scale back the sitins that have led to hundreds of arrests at 
atlanta abortion clinics and will encourage jailed protesters to 
identify themselves and leave jail 
an abortion clinic official called the moves a defeat for the 
new yorkbased antiabortion group operation rescue 
in light of all the other false claims theyve made this is a 
graceful way to bow out said lynne randall executive director 
of the feminist womens health center 
but julie nash media coordinator for operation rescue 
answered thats wishful thinking on their part they dont know 
us and they dont know what were capable of 
she said the group plans to recruit and conduct training in 
nonviolent protest techniques for an oct 58 blitz in atlanta 
comparable to sitins staged at new york city abortion clinics in 
may she said 1648 people were arrested then and some clinics were 
temporarily closed 
about 25 of the more than 700 people arrested in a month of 
atlanta sitins remained in jail wednesday down from as many as 
250 earlier ms nash said 
police spokesman cal jackson said 24 protesters were in city 
holding facilities at the latest count tuesday and a fulton county 
sheriffs department officer who asked not to be identified said 
two protesters were still in the county jail wednesday 
some protesters spent up to 40 days in jail often fasting 
before giving their names and being released on bond or on their 
own recognizance ms nash said 
the demonstrations will be on a back burner for six weeks we 
might do one a week were getting ready for a long struggle 
here ms nash said 
mass arrests of the demonstrators began during the democratic 
national convention july 19 many identified themselves only as 
baby john doe or baby jane doe in symbolic solidarity with aborted 
fetuses and city officials would not release them until they 
provided their real names 
the demonstrators originally planned to remain jailed only 
during the democratic convention ms nash said the organization 
dug in and called for more people to go to jail when the city 
continued to insist that the protesters identify themselves 
she said operation rescue changed its tactics because of the 
people in the jail who wanted to come out and recruit 
ms randall said the group had to give up because it failed to 
pack local jails or to shut down a clinic 
people were disgusted with their tactics ms randall said 
they were mean and vicious to the clients to the police to the 
abortion providers

in all of the patients the majority of the burns are 
thirddegree which means that ultimately considerable skin 
grafting will have to be done to close the wounds pruitt said at

weeks but he declined to discuss each case specifically 
two suffered from smoke inhalation one has a head injury and

during the first twotothreeday period the main 
consideration centers on maintaining vital organ function and 
preventing shock and then the care centers on the care of the wound

skin grafting pruitt said

tammy and their 2yearold son jeffrey jr were put on a plane 
headed to the medical center from west germany where they had been

prosecutors began an investigation 
of the ramstein air show disaster but said wednesday no criminal 
charges were likely and officials said they had mistakenly listed 
a 4yearold boy among the dead 
us officials raised the death count to 52 but the west germans 
said their mistake about the badly burned child lowered their toll 
to 48 killed in the crash sunday of an italian jet west german 
officials also said up to 30 badly burned survivors may die 
there was no reason given for the discrepancy between us and 
west german figures the pentagon has said six of the dead were 
americans but did not release their names 
on wednesday the air force identified one of them as army pfc 
genevieve riggs 36 of the 110th military police company in 
pirmasens west germany her husband sgt myron riggs of the 
110th was one of four people evacuated tuesday to the brooke army 
medical center in san antonio texas 
many grieving families still had not found missing relatives by 
wednesday and officials said 138 reports of missing persons 
remained unresolved some badly burned children lay in hospitals 
apparently orphaned by the accident 
scores of people were seriously injured when three of 10 
lowflying italian jets collided and one became a fireball that 
swept into the crowd during the annual air show at the us air 
force base in ramstein 
the three pilots were killed the italian air force official who 
coordinated the teams stunts said one caused the crash by flying 
into an intersecting maneuver at the wrong altitude and speed 
thousands of townspeople family members dignitaries and fellow 
aviators crowded a small church wednesday at udine italy for the 
funeral of the pilots lt col mario naldini 38 lt col ivo 
nutarelli 41 and capt giorgio alessio 31 
juergen dietzen the rhinelandpalatinate state spokesman said 
a communications mistake caused the erroneous report of the 
boys death he would not elaborate 
that reduces the death toll to 48 he told the associated 
press adding that the 4yearold was seriously injured 
dietzen said the bodies of 25 people 22 spectators and three 
pilots had been identified and no us citizens were among them 
two were children he said 
the spokesman whose state includes ramstein said 166 people 
still were hospitalized 
maj kathy white a us air force spokeswoman told the ap at 
ramstein revised figures showed 52 people dead 
she did not say whether the 52 included deaths on wednesday and 
there was no explanation for the discrepancy in the death counts a 
day earlier the pentagon said its figures showed 40 people had 
died six of them us citizens 
wilhelm sattler chief prosecutor in kaiserlautern near 
ramstein told the ap i have opened an investigation because 
under german law there must be a probe into all cases of violent 
death 
he said complex legal restrictions involving us troops in west 
germany virtually prohibit bringing american officers before german 
courts for criminal trial in a case like the ramstein crash he 
also said west germany has no jurisdiction at the ramstein base 
so it is highly unlikely that anyone will come before a west 
german criminal court in this case sattler said a telephone 
interview he added that the same applies to italians involved with 
the flying team 
sattler confirmed that two individuals and the local branch of 
the greens party had filed criminal complaints alleging negligence 
he said one was against defense minister rupert scholz and the 
other directed at those responsible 
he said tests of the surviving italian pilots for alcohol and 
drugs were negative but the results on the three who perished were 
not yet available 
greens party members and others have demanded that scholz 
resign contending he should have done something about air shows 
before the tragedy occurred 
he ordered a suspension of military air shows after the crash 
and said wednesday his decision also applies to the us air force 
my decision is based on german law this is within my right and 
also applies to the allies he told reporters 
how far the ban extended has been unclear but scholz said 
wednesday he expects the united states and other nato allies to 
honor it 
us officials have asked spectators who made still or moving 
pictures of the accident to lend the material to a special board of 
investigators trying to determine what went wrong the unofficial 
us military newspaper stars and stripes reported

the chairman of the us nuclear regulatory 
commission said wednesday the soviet nuclear power plants he 
inspected are run by businesslike workers but he could not comment 
yet on their safety 
lando w zech jr told a news conference his team of us 
nuclear experts believes it is too early to form opinions about the 
state of soviet nuclear safety 
we have just started ussoviet exchanges so it is 
inappropriate that we draw conclusions he said 
among the plants visited was chernobyl where a reactor 
explosion april 26 1986 killed 31 people and sent up a huge 
invisible cloud of radioactivity that spread over europe and 
eventually worked its way around the world 
zech and alexander n protsenko chairman of the soviet 
committee for utilization of atomic energy signed an agreement 
promising cooperation between the soviet and us governments on 
promotion of civilian nuclear safety nuclear experts from the two 
governments will exchange information sponsor joint seminars and 
regularly visit each others countries 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev laid the 
groundwork for the exchanges at their december summit in washington 
i think and i hope that this will lead to improved nuclear 
reactor safety in both of our countries zech said 
he said the people he met at the power plants were dedicated 
to safety 
delegation members realize the american and soviet plants have 
differences in design construction and procedures he said but 
would not elaborate 
we are still assessing these differences he said 
protsenko said zechs private remarks to him after visiting the 
nuclear facilities were invariably polite even when protsenko 
discussed what he believed to be inadequacies 
i found his comments very useful protsenko said 
a similar soviet delegation will visit the united states soon 
but zech said when and what plants they would visit had not been 
decided

the delta air lines boeing 727 jet that 
crashed wednesday at dallasfort worth international airport had 
only minor problems in the last five years according to federal 
aviation administration records 
a service difficulty report on file at faa headquarters in 
oklahoma city showed a power controller actuator on a wing flap on 
the jet had to be replaced in july 1987 after the aileron flap on 
the planes right wing jammed 
a power controller actuator in the flap was removed and returned 
to the manufacturer the records show a new controller was 
installed 
dave jimenez a spokesman for boeing in seattle said the 
actuator is like a small pump that is activated as part of the 
process of operating the flaps during takeoffs and landings 
in august 1983 inspectors found two small cracks in the 
fuselage skin the faa said the first crack measured onehalf inch 
in length at the corner of the pilots window the second found in 
another inspection the same month was threequarters of an inch 
long at the upper corner of the captains windshield the report 
said 
bobbie mardis a spokeswoman for the faa described the problems 
as very minor 
ms mardis said the crew was identified as pilot larry davis 
copilot carey wilson kirkland jr and flight engineer steven judd 
according to faa records none of the crew members had a record of 
an accident incident or violation she said 
the aircraft was built by boeing in 1973 and delivered new to 
delta 
ms mardis said the aircraft accidentincident report for the 
plane showed that on nov 13 1986 at raleigh nc the aircraft 
didnt stay at the altitude assigned by air traffic controllers 
the jetliner was was powered by jt8d engines manufactured by 
pratt amp whitney based in east hartford which sent two 
investigators to the scene 
the engines are a mainstay of the airline industry according to 
david m long a pratt amp whitney spokesman long said the company 
routinely sends its investigators to crashes in which aircraft are 
powered by pratt amp whitney engines 
long said it was way to early to speculate on the cause of 
the crash 
were just really collecting information and trying to learn 
more ourselves we have learned to wait until the facts come 
along long said 
the jt8d received its initial certification from the faa in 1967 
and about 10000 are now in use it provides a thrust at takeoff of 
14000 to 18000 pounds according to pratt amp whitney documents 
problems with jt8d engines were cited as contributing factors in 
1985 airline crashes in london and milwaukee

the environmental protection agency on 
wednesday was urged to drop plans to finance a superfund study 
that some environmental groups said would be used by industry to 
weaken the toxic waste cleanup law 
the us public interest research group supported by other 
groups sent epa administrator lee m thomas a letter saying the 
superfund study plan usurps the legislative function and is a 
clear attempt to shift blame for the agencys sorry record 
epa plans to give 25 million to the conservation foundation 
for a major study of the law under the direction of a steering 
committee made up of 20 people from industry the states and four 
environmental groups the law comes up for revision in 1991 
the steering committee includes representatives of industries 
that want to repeal the cornerstone of the law the strict joint 
and several liability standard said bill walsh of the public 
interest group an advocacy organization that ralph nader helped 
found 
taxpayers should not be forced to finance an industry effort 
to cripple the superfund law walsh said 
joint and several liability means that any company found to 
have contributed to dumping no matter how small the amount could 
be held responsible for the entire cleanup cost epa has often 
called the provision an indispensable tool in its enforcement 
efforts 
the four groups asked to take part were the environmental 
defense fund the natural resources defense council the sierra 
club and the national audubon society the fund said it had not 
decided whether to participate key officials at the council and 
the society were away from their offices and the club said it did 
not expect to participate 
sierra club lobbyist blake early said the club would like to 
have the study redirected to focus on the problems epa has had in 
implementing the law and not whether congress did the right thing 
linda fisher assistant epa administrator for policy planning 
and evaluation said no one in this agency would ever give up 
joint and several liability it goes to the core not only of 
superfund but hazardous waste management in general 
she said the superfund study will examine how its being 
implemented how you can increase state cleanups and how you can 
increase private party cleanups 
joining walshs group in the request to thomas were the clean 
water action project citizen action environmental action the 
environmental policy institute friends of the earth greenpeace

okeechobee fla a streetwise new yorker thomas alpern knows 
more about urban sharks than swamp alligators but thats about to 
change as he takes to the waters of lake okeechobee on thursday in 
the first statewide gator hunt in 26 years 
this guy doesnt know an airboat from an air hose said 
professional gatorhunter lee kramer who will serve as alperns 
guide im here to make sure we get the gators not vice versa 
beginning at sundown thursday the two men will head out onto 
the lake as the most unusual and celebrated of the 238 participants 
in the gator hunt which was organized in response to a growing 
alligator population estimated at 1 million 
former ivy leaguer alpern 25 acknowledged with a tip of his 
mets baseball cap that he is enjoying his wellpublicized role as 
the only northerner among the hunters 
they all think im a bit strange said alpern who left his 
loft apartment in brooklyn on tuesday you know the city boy out 
in the country sort of thing im just taking it all in 
he has caught the attention of the major television networks and 
nearly every large newspaper in florida last week new york city 
environmental officials gave alpern a tshirt decorated with a 
sunglasseswearing alligator climbing out of a city sewer in jest 
of the tales of freed pet alligators roaming beneath the streets 
its all been an adventure in itself i never thought id be a 
newsmaker he said but i like doing odd things so i guess it 
just comes with the territory 
alpern a freelance writer and aspiring racecar driver said 
he contacted florida game officials in may after reading about the 
hunt in a magazine alpern and bart mcbeth of sulphur la were 
the only two outofstate residents randomly selected from about 
5000 applications to participate in the monthlong season 
mcbeth could not be reached by telephone wednesday to confirm he 
will join the hunt 
alpern who will be allowed to take 15 gators with his permit 
said he selected kramer 51 as a guide after learning the danger 
in gator hunting 
ive never hunted anything except a bird i shot with a bb gun 
as a kid said alpern who has practiced on a shooting range 
however and will take his practice gun with him on the hunt 
alpern left harvard university in 1982 after one year of classes 
and is working on a bachelors degree at columbia university 
between schools he devoted himself to auto racing in 1985 the 
last time he was in florida he crashed his formula ford race car 
at a track 
he spent the next year racing in europe and trying to develop a 
new britishitalian formula 3 car later back in new york he 
began helicopter lessons 
on wednesday he got some ideas of what he can expect to earn on 
his adventure into the everglades 
on a white legal pad kramer rapidly tallied some figures take 
15 gators subtract money for alperns 1000 outofstate permit 
and 75 each for processing and other expenses and it leaves about 
4000 in potential profits from the sale of the carcasses 
alpern thought for a moment and proposed an even split a 
handshake consummated the deal

the united states said wednesday it may suspend or 
terminate the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty unless the soviet 
union dismantles a siberian radar complex 
a statement from the us delegation to a weeklong conference 
that reviewed the agreement left no doubt that washington was 
dissatisfied with the kremlin response to us concerns about the 
krasnoyarsk radar installation 
the statement said the united states has made clear that the 
continuing existence of the krasnoyarsk radar makes it impossible 
to conclude any future arms agreements in the start or defense and 
space areas 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
would continue efforts for a treaty on limiting longrange nuclear 
forces known as start but said there was little prospect of doing 
so before president reagan leaves office in january 
we are still meeting in geneva and still working toward a 
start treaty in the hope that it the soviet radar will be 
dismantled in the interim he said 
fitzwater was in santa barbara calif with the vacationing 
president 
negotiations on limiting intercontinental nuclear forces and on 
space and defense systems are separate parallel talks that have 
continued in geneva since march 1985 
the soviet union made no immediate comment but the chief soviet 
delegate viktor karpov scheduled a news conference for thursday 
the us team was led by the director of the arms control and 
disarmament agency william burns 
the us statement said that during the review conference the 
third of its kind the soviet union gave no indication that it 
was prepared to correct the violations of the abm treaty without 
linking their agreement to do so to unacceptable demands 
the statement referred to the krasnoyarsk radar installation 
which the united states for years has been saying violates the abm 
treaty because of its location and orientation 
it said the us side also raised the question of two other 
radars that the soviets deployed last year in gomel near kiev 
the abm treaty limits each side to deploying one abm system 
comprising a radar and antiballistic missiles it also constrains 
early warning radars which could because of their location 
orientation and capability contribute to an abm defense 
the us side charges that the krasnoyarsk radar is such an 
installation 
the krasnoyarsk violation is very serious particularly when 
it is recognized that the radar constitutes one of a network of 
such radars that have the inherent potential for attack assessment 
in support of ballistic missile defense the statement said 
the aim of the abm treaty is to prevent either side from 
creating a nationwide protective network under the theory that 
neither side would launch a nuclear attack if there was a 
possibility of devastating retaliation 
karpov said in july that the soviet union would dismantle the 
krasnoyarsk radar equipment but not the building housing it if 
the united states agreed to renew its commitment to the abm treaty 
for at least 10 years but the united states says the entire 
installation must be scrapped 
since the soviet union was not prepared to satisfy us 
concerns during the review conference the united states will 
have to consider declaring this continuing violation a material 
breach of the treaty the statement said 
an information sheet distributed last week by the us mission 
says that according to the vienna convention on the law of 
treaties if one party charges material breach it is entitled 
to invoke the breach as a ground for terminating the treaty or 
suspending its operation in whole or in part 
such a move would apparently free the united states to conduct 
uninhibited research and deployment of its proposed spacebased 
missile defense system known officially as the strategic defense 
initiative and popularly called star wars 
the soviets say some of the research violates the abm treaty 
they have long said that a limit on the research is a prerequisite 
for a start treaty but the united states has rejected such a 
linkage

pennsylvanias auditor general has issued 
a summons for us attorney general dick thornburgh to seek 
information on a 1984 state contract for dump trucks said to be bad 
buys 
the summons filed in commonwealth court orders thornburgh a 
former pennsylvania governor to testify before auditor general don 
bailey 
a spokesman for thornburgh david runkel said the summons was 
prompted by political motives thornburgh is a republican bailey a 
democrat 
it would normally be thornburghs intent to cooperate with 
any legitimate questions having to do with his administration but 
this is absurd and mr bailey knows it runkel said 
bailey who is seeking reelection raised the contract issue 
earlier this month in a statement submitted to the senate 
judiciairy committee which reviewed thornburghs nomination to 
replace edwin meese as attorney general 
runkel said the matter has been fully investigated by the fbi 
the state attorney general and the us attorneys office and no 
problems have been found 
a spokesman with the state attorney generals office said the 
matter was still under review james west acting us attorney in 
harrisburg said the case is not formally closed but officials are 
not actively investigating it 
the 23 million contract for 428 dump trucks was awarded when 
thornburgh was in his second term as pennsylvania governor bailey 
has previously criticized the contract saying the state paid too 
much for underpowered trucks 
bailey in a telephone interview said efforts to meet with 
thornburgh have been unsuccessful 
as auditor general bailey is authorized to gather information 
on state matters under his jurisdiction such as contracts but 
cannot prosecute if he finds evidence of wrongdoing such 
information would have to be forwarded to appropriate agencies 
such as the state attorney general 
however he can issue summonses to compel testimony in matters 
under review

jailed black nationalist 
nelson mandela has been moved from a hospital to a private clinic 
while he recuperates from tuberculosis the government said 
thursday the move sets the stage for a possible release from 
government custody 
mandela 70 was transferred on aug 12 from pollsmoor prison 
to nearby tygerberg hospital where he was diagnosed with the 
disease 
mandela leader of the outlawed african national congress has 
been in prison for 26 years 
he has been making a speedy recovery from his illness his 
doctors have said and was moved late wednesday night to the 
constantiaberg clinic in cape town a spokesman for the prison 
service danie immelman told the independent south african press 
association 
nelson mandelas condition has improved to such an extent that 
his further treatment in the tygerberg hospital was no longer 
necessary immelman was quoted as saying 
the spokesman gave no indication of how long would be in the 
clinic or what the conditions of his stay would be like 
the move appears to confirm widespread speculation that mandela 
would be placed in a private clinic and gradually reintroduced to 
the south african public before the government decides whether to 
release him outright 
under this widely accepted scenario mandela is expected to have 
access to a greater number of visitors and possibly even allowed to 
conduct media interviews 
mandelas full recuperation is likely to at least several weeks 
and after that period the government can then choose whether to 
send him back to prison or grant him freedom 
president pw botha in a major speech two weeks ago said he 
was seriously considering releasing mandela the countrys 
bestknown black leader 
mandela has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the whiteled 
government his continued imprisonment has the government in a 
difficult bind 
if botha releases mandela the president risks an enormous white 
backlash and the possibility of reactivating militant black 
opposition that has been largely suppressed under the 26monthold 
state of emergency 
if botha keeps mandela in prison there could be widespread 
black unrest if the countrys preeminent black leader dies in 
prison 
nationwide municipal elections are set for oct 26 further 
complicating bothas dilemma the government is engaged in a 
massive campaign to encourage blacks to vote in municipal township 
elections but it also faces a growing threat from conservative 
whites 
mandelas release would likely encourage black voters to go to 
the polls but could harm bothas national party in the separate 
white local elections 
the different race groups vote in separate local elections but 
the nations black majority has no vote in national affairs 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
botha has offered since 1985 to release mandela if he will 
renounce violence however mandela has said that the governments 
1960 decision to ban the thenpeaceful african national congress 
left him no choice but to fight 
mandela has said he will disavow violence only if the anc is not 
longer banned apartheid is dismantled and blacks are given a voice 
in national affairs

parents of students who are chronically 
truant could lose custody of their children under a plan being 
considered by school and court officials 
a proposal to have schools report the names of chronic truants 
to the courts who would consider transferring custody to a 
grandparent or other relative quickly drew fire from legal aid 
lawyers critics said it appeared to be an extreme way to deal with 
absenteeism and threatens student confidentiality 
probate judge john keyes who met last week with school 
superintendent john dow jr to discuss the proposal said it could 
be undertaken legally the idea is still in the planning stages 
officials said 
keyes said the idea grew out of a conversation he had in july 
with dow about parents who abuse drugs and dont send their 
children to school regularly 
dow proposed a mechanism of reporting truancy to the courts and 
having a probate judge inquire into the family situation keyes 
said 
keyes said removing a child from parents custody would require 
much more than just showing he or she missed school there would 
have to be other signs of neglect he said 
glenn knierim state administrator for probate courts called 
the proposal an innovative approach to a serious problem 
but lawyers who defend poor people were critical 
you cant assume parent neglect because the child is absent a 
lot said robin murphy a lawyer with new haven legal assistance 
it could be that the child is not in an appropriate educational 
program or other children are picking on him or her in school or 
there may be family problems at home 
shelley geballe supervising attorney at yale law schools legal 
services organization said new haven schools have repeatedly cited 
federal law prohibiting disclosure of student names when declining 
to comment on school problems 
volunteering student names in the absence of a subpoena from 
the court i find ironic to say the least she said 
deputy superintendent of schools rosa quezada said the school 
system will work with lawyers to determine how to pass on 
information to the court while maintaining student confidentiality 
any new policy would require school board approval she said 
the absenteeism rate has remained stable in recent years 
quezada said but school officials have been alarmed by figures 
showing that 35 percent of the fourthgraders who failed a state 
standardized test last year had excessive absenteeism

the us postal service and the national 
association of letter carriers signed a joint commitment 
wednesday to cut by half thousands of expensive grievance appeals 
arbitrations and employment discrimination complaints annually 
the nonbinding agreement to improve the labormanagement 
climate is the first ever signed by the postal service with a union 
representing its employees 
according to postal service records 19543 grievances were 
appealed beyond the local level by members of the letter carriers 
union in the 12 months ending aug 1 and 10766 individual 
disputes were taken to arbitration 
in addition members of the union filed 2128 complaints of age 
sex or race discrimination against the postal service with the 
federal equal employment opportunity commission 
the twopage accord said a joint employee involvement process by 
the postal service and the 310000member union has improved 
labormanagement relations over the past five years 
however it added that tension and antagonism remain at an 
intolerable level in many work locations and the number of 
grievances filed and arbitrations conducted is unacceptable 
the accord was worked out after postmaster general anthony m 
frank became the first person ever holding that post to address a 
postal union convention when he spoke to the letter carriers last 
month in portland ore 
these processes break down the old them and us 
attitudes and promote a positive spirit of cooperation he said 
in short they save money for both sides improve productivity 
and reduce workplace stress 
postal service officials said the cooperation agreement does not 
alter any terms of a 40month labor contract signed last summer

the un secretarygeneral could not break a 
stalemate in the iraniraq peace talks but said wednesday he would 
make one last try to arrange a meeting between the two nations 
before his departure 
meanwhile iranian leaders called for volunteers for the front 
in the war that has taken up to 1 million lives since it began in 
september 1980 a ceasefire took effect aug 20 and the peace 
talks started five days later 
javier perez de cuellar the secretarygeneral continued trying 
until late wednesday night to arrange a meeting even at two or 
three in the morning between the chief diplomats of the two 
countries his spokesman francois giuliani told reporters 
giuliani said perez de cuellar had no luck and would try again 
thursday morning he is scheduled to leave for lisbon in the 
afternoon 
the secretarygeneral is frustrated by the slow progress of 
the talks and the inability to reach the necessary compromise 
giuliani said earlier 
in tehran irans deputy head of the military general command in 
charge of manpower called for continuing mobilization and said 
iranians at the front must extend their period of service 
alireza afshar the deputy was quoted by the official islamic 
republic news agency as saying iranians have been ordered to remain 
on alert in order to foil the enemies plots the report was 
monitored in nicosia 
on tuesday ayatollah ruhollah khomeini told his nation we 
must take it that we are still at war 
giuliani said said perez de cuellar had been putting forward 
new formulations constantly to overcome the difficulties 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati and his iraqi 
counterpart tariq aziz have not met facetoface since friday the 
talks have been conducted since then on lower levels as the un 
chief sought a compromise to bridge differences over the 
shattalarab waterway and other issues 
irans news agency also quoted president ali khamenei as saying 
iran would not submit to any blackmail by iraq during the peace 
talks he reiterated that iran would not accede to iraqs demand 
for sovereignty over the shattalarab waterway which forms part 
of the southern border between the two nations 
the agency quoted parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani as 
calling the slow pace of thetalks unsatisfactory and accusing 
iraq of procrastination it gave few details of his remarks 
what we have all to keep in mind is that time is running out 
and i have other commitments perez de cuellar said as he entered 
the un office early wednesday i hope that today we will make 
some significant progress i hope 
the un chief is to leave thursday for portugal then go to the 
hague on monday it was not certain whether he would return between 
appointments but giuliani said he would return if necessary 
giuliani said perez de cuellar hoped to name a special 
representative on thursday to conduct the talks in his absence 
as an honest broker i have to go from one side to another 
proposing ideas and new formulas which could be a real compromise 
not necessarily 100 percent concessions but a real compromise by 
both sides perez de cuellar said 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition they not be 
identified said no concrete proposals have been made regarding 
troop withdrawals and shattalarab iraqs only outlet to the sea 
they said the un effort is directed at arranging the beginning 
of troop withdrawals from the front and keeping the question of 
sovereignty over shattalarab from impeding progress on other 
issues 
iraq wants to control the entire waterway while iran insists 
that it be divided as specified in a 1975 treaty iraq has 
repudiated that treaty 
velayati said tuesday his government never would make 
concessions to iraq and both sides accused each other of blocking 
progress 
perez de cuellar said tuesday we are trying to clear the 
first part on an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal without 
delay and the ceasefire at sea is part of the problem 
both iran and iraq have attacked shipping in the persian gulf 
during the war 
aziz said monday that the talks were at square one and there 
had been no substantive discussion of what the ceasefire covered 
on tuesday velayati said iraq was raising a lot of 
preconditions including clearing the waterway which is choked 
with silt and sunken ships but he said there was no deadlock 
both velayati and aziz said they would remain in geneva as long 
as necessary

prime minister brian mulroneys allies in the 
house of commons approved freetrade legislation wednesday to 
eliminate economic barriers with united states 
but members of the oppositiondominated senate say they will 
stall the bill 
with both sides waving canadian flags and the opposition singing 
the national anthem the commons voted 17764 for the agreement 
signed in january by mulroney and president reagan 
the progressive conservatives with 207 of the 282 seats in the 
commons easily outvoted the combined opposition and sent the bill 
to the senate 
the liberals and new democrats who call the trade deal a 
sellout of canadian sovereignty interrupted the final vote by 
singing o canada 
during two raucous votes on opposition amendments speaker john 
fraser admonished members of parliament to settle down and asked 
new democrats and conservatives alike to put down their canadian 
flags and pins 
but the bill which would amend 27 federal statutes to make 
canadas border more open to american goods and services faces a 
rough road ahead 
mulroney has suggested strongly that he will call a federal 
election this fall before the scheduled jan 1 launch of the trade 
treaty 
and the liberal majority in the senate has promised to stall the 
legislation until the issue is decided one way or another in an 
election 
us legislation on the treaty has been approved by the us 
house of representatives and is expected to pass the senate later 
this month 
gordon ritchie canadas deputy chief trade negotiator over the 
two years of talks with the united states said the agreement will 
not be in effect until the deal gets through the canadian senate 
and the prime minister actually exchanges a letter of ratification 
with the united states president 
were saving the champagne for the ratification said 
ritchie 
public opinion surveys indicate canadians are almost equally 
divided on the merits of the agreement but generally agree on thing 
the issue is confusing 
under the trade agreement both countries would begin phasing 
out border taxes quotas standards and other regulations that stop 
or discourge trade 
future disputes could be referred to fivemember panels of trade 
experts from both countries for settlement 
the canadian government has touted the deal as a boon for 
business and jobs as well as cutting the 2 billion a year in 
tariffs that canadian businesses and consumers have to pay on 
imports from the united states 
the opposition says other canadian jobs will be lost as us 
business moves into the canadian market consumers will only see a 
fraction of the value of the tariff cuts they say 
the agreement was reached last fall after 18 months of talks 
between the two nations

the boston symphony orchestra did not violate the 
civil rights of actress vanessa redgrave when it canceled her 
performances following threats by protesters a federal appeals 
court ruled wednesday 
the full us 1st circuit court of appeals ruled by a 32 vote 
that the cancellation did not violate the massachusetts civil 
rights act it was an unusual reversal of an earlier finding by a 
threemember panel of the appellate court 
wednesdays decision reinstated an award to compensate ms 
redgrave 12000 she would have earned in a broadway role she lost 
during the suit against the symphony however expenses the actress 
would have incurred while appearing in the play will be subtracted 
from the award 
orchestra attorney bob sullivan said symphony officials were 
relieved with the ruling 
i think theyre also happy that the case is probably over now 
and they can go back to doing what theyre best at making 
music he said 
attorneys for ms redgrave daniel j kornstein and marvin 
wexler of new york were not in their offices and did not return 
calls wednesday evening 
ms redgrave was hired by the symphony in 1982 to narrate six 
performances of stravinskys oedipus rex at boston tanglewood 
in western massachusetts and new yorks carnegie hall 
but the contract was canceled after the symphony received 
letters and telephone calls indicating there would be picketing and 
other protests because of ms redgraves support of the palestine 
liberation organization 
in november 1984 a federal jury ruled the symphony had breached 
its contract with ms redgrave and awarded her the 27500 she was 
to have received for the performances plus 100000 in compensatory 
damages for work the actress said she lost because of the action 
in february 1985 us district judge robert keeton threw out 
the 100000 award and ruled the symphony had not violated her 
civil rights 
last october a threemember panel of the us 1st circuit court 
of appeals restored 12000 of that award as compensation for the 
lost role the threemember panel also found the massachusetts 
civil rights act had been violated 
attorneys for the symphony arguing that massachusetts law 
allowed them to cancel performances because of concerns that 
threatened disruptions would mar the artistic integrity of the 
performances asked for a rehearing before the full court 
wednesdays ruling by the full court effectively reversing the 
earlier finding was unusual sullivan said 
this is a very very rare thing he said the 1st circuit 
very seldom reverses themselves

some of the passengers who survived the 
crash of a delta airlines jet on wednesday may owe their lives to 
another crash three years ago rescuers said 
last time we didnt know what to expect this time were a 
little more organized said ray cartier a red cross volunteer 
last time was the crash of delta flight 191 a lockheed 
l1011 on the other side of dallasfort worth international 
airport three years ago in which 137 people died 
flight 191 definitely gave us more experience said mike 
sympson paramedic supervisor for the airport police and fire 
department when we got here it was click click click 
there was a lot of preparation done because of the last one 
said michael muncy a lab technician at the 314bed harris 
methodist heb hospital where many of the injured were taken 
everyone was right in place there was no wasted motion we knew 
just what to do 
sympson arrived aboard one of the first three emergency vehicles 
at the crash scene just three minutes after the 903 am accident 
at the airports west end 
dozens of fire trucks helicopters and police vehicles converged 
on the prairie southwest of the main airport tower and within 10 
minutes some of the first victims were being transported to 
hospitals sympson said 
when we got to the plane the majority of the survivors were 
on the grass away from the plane sympson said 
a van driver eusebio padilla said he was several hundred yards 
away when the plane cracked open and a column of flame erupted from 
the tail area 
sympson and others in the first wave of rescuers concentrated on 
establishing a triage area where survivors could be evaluated and 
the most seriously injured expedited to hospitals 
the paramedics said all they were told only that the plane was a 
boeing 727 it wasnt until thick black smoke cleared 15 or 20 
minutes later that they discovered they were working on another 
delta plane 
when paramedic jim hartman arrived on the scene all i heard 
was screaming from the people on the ground 
some of them the survivors were in severe shock but some of 
them were joking trying to i guess make the situation easier 
hartman said one guy laughed and said boy im not going to 
take an airplane home cant really blame him at that point 
brian mckinney an airport department of public safety officer 
was off duty when he heard about the crash on the news and came in 
to work about 940 am 
i just helped pull bodies out about nine said mckinney 
they were charred some of them were in seats some of them 
werent in seats some had belts on we had to take off 
the ones that i pulled out were in the back of the plane he 
said 
sympson said this crash was similar to the one three years ago 
there was not a big difference sympson said there was 
fire smoke and you didnt know what you were going to find im 
simply amazed there were this many survivors 
paramedic robert seadore said he was the first paramedic to 
arrive at both crashes i tell you i had some flashbacks 
seadore said of wednesdays disaster 
one result of the 1985 crash was a greater emphasis on helping 
rescuers cope with what they saw and had to do when they arrived to 
help wednesday 
mckinney still wearing his silver flameproof coveralls and 
hard hat said those who helped pull victims from the plane were 
sent to a stress center where they received tetanus shots then 
they were taken to a stress clinic for counseling 
anyone who pulled out bodies went through that he said 
you never get used to it but you got a job to do and you just 
go ahead and do it 
hundreds of people were on hand at the crash site within an hour 
after the accident within two hours volunteers from charitable 
agencies had arrived to provide food and beverages to workers in 
what was expected to be a daylong effort 
we work with relatives and victims ensuring theyve got 
nurses preachers to talk to and we meet their transportation 
needs by taking them to the hospitals and hotels cartier said

an ira bomb exploded by mistake 
wednesday in an apartment where a booby trap had been set for 
british soldiers killing an elderly man and a woman 
the ira apologized for the trap that went tragically wrong 
the ira has killed 20 civilians unintentionally since november and 
has apologized repeatedly 
also wednesday police said three men killed in a british army 
ambush tuesday were armed ira terrorists armed and dressed for a 
possible attack 
the ambush was seen as the start of a british crackdown on the 
outlawed irish republican army which wants to unite the 
predominantly protestant province with the overwhelmingly roman 
catholic irish republic under socialist rule 
on wednesday night gangs of youths in catholic enclaves of 
belfast hijacked 30 vehicles and set several on fire said a police 
spokesman 
meanwhile the republic of ireland called for an urgent meeting 
with british officials under terms of the 1985 angloirish 
agreement which gives the republic a consultative role in the 
affairs of northern ireland 
the frightening escalation of violence undermines the very 
maintenance of the rule of law and can only bring further 
divisions and tragedy for the people of the north said a 
statement by irish prime minister charles haughey and his cabinet 
west german police captured two heavily armed suspected ira 
guerrillas heading toward a british army barracks shortly after 
midnight tuesday after they drove through a remote border crossing 
from the netherlands 
the apartment bomb in londonderry about 60 miles northwest of 
belfast was triggered by an elderly man who climbed through a 
window worried that the young man living there had not been seen 
for several days police said 
the blast demolished the apartment killing an elderly man and a 
woman standing outside and injuring another man said spokesman 
sgt winston winters 
an ira statement and the police account indicated the ira 
abducted the apartments occupants several days ago and planted the 
booby trap hoping an army search party would enter the apartment 
and trigger the explosives 
the iras londonderry unit apologized in a statement circulated 
to the news media 
although the operation was carefully planned it went 
tragically wrong it said at no stage unfortunately was it 
anticipated that a member of the public would enter the flat 
through a front window and open a boobytrapped door 
this summer the ira has escalated its war to drive the british 
from the province killing 27 british military men in attacks in 
northern ireland elsewhere in britain and in continental europe 
the three killed tuesday were attacked while on a country road 
at drumnakilly county tyrone eight miles from ballygawley where 
an ira bomb on aug 20 killed eight soldiers in a bus 
it was that attack the bloodiest this year that prompted a 
british government pledge to crack down on the ira 
the ira said the three were members on active service the 
ira term for a guerrilla mission 
the british news media speculated that the special air services 
the countrys besttrained antiguerrilla squad ambushed the men 
they quoted witnesses as saying they saw men in civilian clothes 
being ferried away by military helicopter immediately after the 
shooting 
police said the three wore the typical ira outfit of overalls 
gloves and ski masks and that two rifles and a handgun were found 
in their bulletriddled car 
british press reports said the three were preparing to 
assassinate a soldier of the locally recruited ulster defense 
regiment but the police and army refused comment 
britain never confirms involvement by the special air services 
but several ira deaths in recent years have been attributed to the 
clandestine unit they include three unarmed ira members shot march 
6 in gibraltar where they allegedly planned a carbomb attack the 
ira has lost 11 members this year 
the provinces police force the royal ulster constabulary said 
brian mullen and brothers gerard and martin harte were hardened ira 
operatives who were often arrested but never charged 
it said gerard harte commanded the iras midtyrone unit and was 
a ruthless dedicated terrorist who from 1983 organized 
terrorist operations mainly against members of the security 
forces in the midtyrone area 
his brother martin played a prominent role in terrorist 
operations while mullen was active in the omagh area the 
statement said 
british news reports said mullen was martin hartes 
brotherinlaw and one of eight men detained after the bus bombing 
the eight were questioned for five days and released 
seamus mallon deputy leader of the moderate catholic social 
democratic and labor party said the three died in controversial 
circumstances mallon a member of parliament said britain would 
have to say whether troops made any attempt to arrest them 
the protestant rev ian paisley leader of the militant 
democratic unionist party said he was glad security forces were 
going on the offensive 
the two suspected ira guerrillas arrested in west germany had 
driven over the dutch border into the northwestern part of west 
germany by using a remote country lane off limits to traffic 
between the two countries police said

former mayor mike roark battling to 
save his law license after pleading guilty to drug charges 
admitted to a bar panel wednesday that he took no action while 
prosecutor against two men who sold him drugs 
roark who turned 43 on wednesday testified for about 25 
minutes before a subcommittee of the state bars legal ethics 
committee it is considering whether sanctions should be imposed 
up to revocation of roarks law license because of his guilty 
pleas 
roark pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor federal charges of 
possession of cocaine and resigned as mayor as part of the plea 
agreement he was released from federal prison on july 20 after 
serving 5 months 
ethics panel chairman arthur recht said the central issue at the 
hearing is whether a public official should be treated differently 
in a disciplinary matter from lawyers in private practice 
roarks side said he should not and asked for leniency 
but bar disciplinary counsel jack marden argued that roark used 
his position to shield those supplying drugs 
under crossexamination marden asked roark who admitted using 
drugs while kanawha county prosecutor whether he tried to bring 
charges against two men who supplied drugs to him and were 
convicted by federal prosecutors 
i took no steps to prosecute either or advise anybody roark 
said 
kanawha county prosecutor charlie king and peter brown both top 
assistants to roark when he was prosecutor said roark showed no 
leniency toward drug dealers but king said he could not recall 
roark participating in any drug prosecutions 
the state bar rested its case against roark without calling a 
witness 
on the stand roark took full blame for his actions and said he 
was sorry for what had happened 
i have no excuses and i offer none said roark who has been 
practicing law since his release from prison i obviously knew 
what i was doing was wrong at the time i was doing it 
but roark said he believes that he has paid and pays daily for 
his actions he asked the panel to allow him to maintain his law 
license so he can make restitution to the community for his 
misbehavior 
recht said the panel should render a decision sometime in 
october its recommendation goes to the full legal ethics 
committee which makes its final report to the state supreme court 
the court can then agree to the recommendation modify or reject it 
former charleston police chief jack buckalew called on behalf 
of the roark testified wednesday that roark never attempted to 
interfere with his agency 
buckalew said his drug officers generally worked under federal 
supervision and he had little control over them anyway but he did 
say that in 1985 he was aware that roark was being investigated 
concerning drug matters 
did roark try to curtail drug enforcement asked james 
mcintyre roarks attorney 
no he did not replied buckalew police chief from 1983 to 
1985 
on crossexamination marden asked buckalew whether roark had 
ever lied to him 
yes he did buckalew said he was not truthful as to his 
plea of guilty to cocaine use he indicated to me he was not using 
it

plans for the ronald reagan presidential 
library hit a snag wednesday when questions were raised at an 
environmental hearing about the projects effects on air quality 
plant life and traffic congestion 
the ventura county environmental report review recessed the 
hearing for a week to get more information at next weeks meeting 
the committee could either approve the library project delay a 
decision again or decide that an environmental impact report is 
needed 
the ronald reagan presidential foundation wants to build the 
library on a 100acre site which lies partly within a greenbelt 
area that is protected from largescale development by a 
decadeold nonbinding agreement among the communities of 
moorpark simi valley and thousand oaks 
the library scheduled for completion in 1991 would house 
president reagans white house papers and would contain museum 
exhibits about his administration like the eight existing 
presidential libraries it would be built with private funds and 
then operated by the national archives 
chuck thomas who represents the county air pollution control 
district on the sevenmember committee asked for the delay saying 
the district had found the project inconsistent with county air 
quality standards 
it would bring in a lot of additional traffic that is not 
projected thomas said 
the foundation estimates that the library would attract 350000 
visitors a year 
the environmental coalition a private environmental group in 
ventura county said however it believed the number of visitors 
per year could exceed 425000 
i think i would have to come down against it if the matter 
were voted on without further investigation thomas told the 
committee 
other members of the committee said they needed more information 
on traffic density and the effect on vegetation before making a 
decision 
fred worthley regional manager of the california department of 
fish and game wrote to county officials on may 12 that an 
undisclosed number of specimens of three sensitive plant 
species would be harmed or destroyed by construction he 
suggested a detailed site survey at the appropriate time of year 
when these plants can be readily identified and that the project be 
redesigned to avoid these areas as much as possible 
philip e gatch director of planning and community development 
for thousand oaks said in a letter written tuesday that part of 
the public road over which traffic would travel to reach the 
library site remains a twolane roadway operating at a level of 
service beyond its current capacity 
others at the hearing said they understood this section was to 
be widened before the scheduled 1991 opening of the library 
if the project is approved by the committee critics would have 
10 days in which to appeal the committee would hear the appeal in 
another 30 days 
if an environmental impact report is required it could take a 
year or more 
the foundation which hopes to break ground for the library this 
fall would have the right to appeal any decision to order an 
environmental impact report

top aides to michael dukakis denied wednesday that 
they told jesse jackson not to campaign in several states as 
tension between the two democrats increased 
sources close to jackson said the former presidential candidate 
was angered at being told to avoid campaigning in michigan 
louisiana mississippi georgia texas new york and alabama 
the sources said dukakis officials had determined jackson could 
hurt the ticket among traditionally democratic blue collar voters 
in some states who supported ronald reagan in 1980 and 1984 
i am aware of no list of states provided to him of states he 
should not or would not or we prefer he not go into said dukakis 
campaign manager susan estrich 
but one aide to the democratic nominee speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the campaign conducted polling in every state for 
favorable and unfavorable opinions on jackson to see how well he 
can do in the fall in attracting swing voters as well as blacks 
the results found that in some of the primary states he won 
jackson had high negatives among those swing voters 
dukakis is making a strong bid to woo those socalled reagan 
democrats back to their former allegiance to democratic 
presidential candidates 
in nashville tennessee state rep roscoe dixon of memphis said 
jackson has invited him and other key supporters to a meeting 
thursday in atlanta he said he did not know how many people have 
been invited 
us rep john lewis dga an atlanta congressman and former 
jackson supporter who now cochairs dukakis georgia campaign said 
wednesday night he intended to attend the thursday meeting which 
he understood was called to discuss voter registration and 
getoutthevote efforts in the south 
although lewis said he did not expect a discussion on tension 
between jackson and dukakis supporters dixon said he planned to 
bring it up 
we dont feel that we have been totally involved in the 
dukakis campaign dixon said the first thing im going to 
do is get with reverend jackson in atlanta on thursday and find out 
his thinking on the matter 
jackson met with dukakis aides in washington last week and was 
reported as angered by the suggestion he stay out of several 
states according to one participant in the discussions who asked 
not to be identified the request was withdrawn 
jackson agreed he would stay out of texas but will campaign in 
the other states the former civil rights activist won the 
democratic contests in michigan alabama louisiana and mississippi 
and finished ahead of dukakis in georgia 
jack corrigan a dukakis campaign aide who participated in that 
meeting said no suggestion was made that he stay out of those 
states 
states were discussed said corrigan but he denied it was 
in the context of places where jackson could hurt the ticket 
estrich said dukakis staff were working with jackson aides to 
establish a schedule how best to use his limited time 
dukakis aide donna brazile who was not in the thursday meeting 
but works on minority outreach for dukakis said the dukakis forces 
have been scrupulous in contacting jackson officials in every state 
in many ways our relationship and treatment of reverend 
jackson translates into black enthusiasm on the other hand we 
have to have a local strategy that involves the black community 
she said 
dukakis and jackson made a pact at the democratic convention in 
atlanta in july that essentially was designed to give the jackson 
constituency and its issues a voice in the democratic general 
election campaign including transferring some of jacksons aides 
and advisers to dukakis 
brazile acknowledged that only two jackson aides have been 
incorprated into the dukakis national staff but said that on the 
state and local level many former jackson officials have been 
brought into the dukakis campaign

three years after a delta air lines jet crashed on 
takeoff in a severe thunderstorm at dallasfort worth international 
airport a federal court battle continues over responsibility for 
the accident 
on aug 2 1985 delta flight 191 crashed and burned killing 
137 people and injuring 25 others 
in wednesdays crash of flight 1141 on takeoff in cloudless 
skies for salt lake city 13 people were killed and 94 survived 
the plane went down at the opposite end of the airport from the 
1985 crash 
national transportation safety board investigators ruled in july 
1986 that the delta 191 crash occurred when the l1101 flew into a 
microburst containing several wind shears the strong abrupt 
downward shifts in wind direction at the south end of the airport 
smashed the jet into the ground 
lawyers for delta and the government are continuing a 
6monthold federal trial in fort worth to determine 
responsibility earlier this month testimony was postponed until 
october while a federal judge tries to clear other cases 
delta which initially admitted some responsibility for the 
crash claims government air traffic controllers and weather 
forecasters failed to warn the flight crew of the storm 
the trial involving delta its insurers and the widow of the 
pilot is the first in which a major us airline has gone to court 
against the government to seek damages 
delta officials claim the government should bear responsibility 
for the crash and pay all or part of more than 90 million in 
death injury and damage claims the airline already has paid 
more than 90 lawsuits seeking more than 200 million dollars 
were filed by victims relatives 
lawyers for the government contend the flight crew should have 
been able to avoid the crash 
the ntsb faulted crew training for handling wind shears and the 
lack of definitive weather information as contributing factors 
in the accident 
but the atlantabased airline maintains the boards findings 
were incomplete inaccurate and most painfully flawed 
officials said the crew operated the craft in accordance with 
federal aviation administration procedures and regulations

polands striking workers wednesday night to settle their local 
grievances and end the countrys worst labor unrest in seven years 
walesa made the appeal hours after meeting with government 
leaders on the wave of strikes that began aug 16 calling for 
higher wages and the legalization of solidarity

pluralism and legalizing his outlawed trade federation would be 
taken up in roundtable discussions promised by the government in 
the near future according to a statement read by an aide piotr 
konopka 
walesa said he raised the importance of solidarity in his 
threehour meeting with polands interior minister gen czeslaw 
kiszczak his first with government leaders in six years 
the participants in the discussion recognize that all affairs 
related to trade union movement would be discussed by the 
roundtable walesa said 
i propose therefore that we suspend the current strikes i 
accepted further talks with central authorities and turn to the 
strike committes for the actual ending of the negotiation of other 
postulates and the suspension of the strikes walesas statement 
said 
after giving the walesa statement konopka added i hope that 
it will appear as a historical day 
konopka said walesa conferred with strikers at the idled lenin 
shipyard where the solidarity leader still works as an

a jewish settler whose car was hit by a 
firebomb accidentally shot and wounded two israeli soldiers because 
he thought they were terrorists coming to kill him a settler 
spokesman said 
in other violence two palestinians were killed in clashes with 
troops doctors and news reports said 
a third palestinian died of wounds suffered tuesday the three 
fatalities of arabs aged 16 to 22 brought to 258 the number of 
palestinians killed since the uprising began dec 8 four israelis 
have died during the same period 
prime minister yitzhak shamir meanwhile called for changing 
israeli policy to permit civilians and soldiers to open fire on 
arab stonethrowers without shooting warning rounds first an aide 
said 
shamir said he believes rocks should be reclassified as lethal 
weapons against which one should defend oneself in the same way as 
against firebombs and gunfire said aide yossi ahimeir 
a stone must be considered a weapon that can end your life 
ahimeir quoted shamir as saying 
shamir leader of the rightwing likud bloc has faced criticism 
from many of the 68000 jewish settlers who live in the west bank 
and gaza strip along with 15 million palestinians 
settlers have been angered by police confiscation of weapons 
after civilian shooting incidents in the occupied territories 
meanwhile an army spokesman said an israeli civilian chasing a 
firebomb thrower near the jewish west bank settlement of efrat 
opened fire and accidentally wounded two israeli soldiers 
the soldiers also were pursuing the suspect when they were shot 
the spokesman said without elaborating the spokesman said one 
soldier suffered moderate wounds and the other was slightly hurt 
israel radio said the civilian a resident of the nearby tekoa 
settlement was detained for questioning 
david bedine a spokesman for jewish settlements in the area 
said a firebomb hit the settlers car and exploded causing minor 
damage 
the settler got out of his car and opened fire when he saw two 
images holding guns running toward him said bedine he thought 
they were terrorists coming to kill him 
the two were soldiers who had rushed to the scene after being 
alerted by the sound of the explosion bedine told the associated 
press 
we are very sorry about the harm done to the soldiers 
bedine said adding that the settlements in the area south of 
bethlehem have an excellent relationship with the army 
in the occupied gaza strips shati refugee camp troops opened 
fire to disperse arab stonethrowers fatally shooting 17yearold 
hamis al minawi in the heart doctors at gaza citys shifa hospital 
said 
five shati residents were wounded including a 40yearold woman 
shot in the head the doctors said 
israeli media reports citing arab sources said troops also 
shot and killed a 22yearold arab man in a clash with palestinians 
who hurled rocks bottles and bricks at soldiers making arrests in 
the occupied west bank village of deir ghassani 
israel radio said villagers buried the victim luay barghouti 
immediately after the clash draping his body in an outlawed 
palestinian flag 
the army said it was checking both reported fatalities 
also wednesday 16yearold ayman ahmed nagar of gazas rafah 
refugee camp died one day after being hit in the head and body by 
rubber bullets his relatives said they claimed he also was beaten 
the army confirmed the death but said it was investigating the 
circumstances 
israeli troops frequently use corkshaped rubber bullets that 
contain metal pellets to disperse stonethrowers they bruise but 
usually are not lethal although they have caused eye loss and at 
least one death earlier this year 
last month the army introduced pointed plastic bullets that 
penetrate the skin but are generally only lethal when fired from 
20 yards or closer 
palestinians meanwhile went on strike for the second straight 
day in keeping with orders from underground leaders it was the 
sixth day of strikes in the last 11 days

jim bakker proposed a 165 million plan 
wednesday to buy back ptl and said he is confident he will regain 
control of the ministry he lost last year in a sexandmoney 
scandal 
bakker and his attorney jim toms met with ptl bankruptcy 
trustee mc red benton to present a rough draft of the plan 
weve discussed the terms weve agreed on everything 
benton said the lawyers are now documenting it and as soon as 
the papers are ready tomorrow afternoon and everybodys agreed we 
probably will both sign it and then well have us a deal 
canadian real estate magnate peter thomas chairman of samoth 
capital corp earlier offered 113 million to buy the ministrys 
assets 
thomas said wednesday he was unwilling to increase his offer but 
was skeptical of bakkers proposal 
although samoth enjoys first right of refusal it does not 
intend at this point to enter into a bidding war thomas said 
from his office in vancouver 
thomas said if bakkers bid fails to materialize he may renew 
his proposal bakker has been all talk so far and unwilling to 
reveal his financial backers he said it makes one wonder where 
hes getting the cash from 
bakker said he had the financial backing for a purchase that 
would total at least 165 million including 70 million in cash 
put up at closing part of the terms of securing a loan to back his 
offer was that he not reveal the identity of the lender he said 
ptl filed for reorganization in us bankruptcy court in 
columbia in june 1987 donations had plummeted after bakker left 
the ministry in march amid allegations of misuse of money and 
revelations of a sexual encounter several years earlier with church 
secretary jessica hahn 
when he announced the outcome of the meeting with benton bakker 
was greeted at the offices of the jim and tammy ministries his new 
organization by applause and cheers of praise god and thank 
you jesus 
as it stands now we will be able to have heritage usa its 
been a long wait bakker told volunteers friends and family 
members many of whom wept with joy 
were through the basic negotiations we just had a few 
changes to make in our plan bakker said well be working 
tonight burning the midnight oil and finish the details for 
tomorrow 
benton had said that he wanted all bids for the ministrys 
assets in before thursday benton will then recommend a buyer to 
bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds who has the final decision by 
sept 10 
when you boil it all down its a matter of who would provide 
the most dollars for the creditors the trustee said my 
responsibility in this case was to preserve the assets and sell 
them at the highest possible dollar value so that the creditors 
could be repaid if possible in full 
in addition to the 70 million cash bakker said about 80 
million would be held to restore the benefits of the lifetime 
partners large contributors to ptl who had been promised 
longterm perquisites in exchange for their support and up to 15 
million would be used to settle claims against bakker 
the ministrys assets include the heritage usa theme park near 
here with extra funds for improvements and repairs at the park 
the final purchase plan could total 200 million toms said

the death toll from flooding climbed to 
nearly 700 and thousands of people fled their homes wednesday as 
the buriganga river flooded lowlying neighborhoods and left 
onefourth of dhaka under water 
president hussain muhammed ershad issued an international appeal 
for food helicopters and boats after touring flooded areas in the 
countryside where people were throwing their dead into swirling 
waters because there was no dry land for burial 
local newspapers in thursday and wednesday editions reported 140 
more floodrelated deaths across the country wednesday raising the 
toll in recent floods to 676 
ershad said wednesday the official death toll was 250 but the 
governments count is generally considered low 
the independent newspaper sangbad said most of the victims it 
reported died when boats sank or houses collapsed but it said some 
were killed when they were bitten by snakes in the water 
we need food grains helicopters and river craft from our 
friends for tackling the flood ershad told reporters 
everywhere i have gone people have asked for drinking water 
in dhaka the capital residents stocked food anticipating that 
floods would force markets to close 
several thousand residents from a lowlying area on the 
southeastern outskirts of the city were evacuated wednesday as 
waters from flooded buriganga breached a protection dam and a 
10mile road 
 
at victoria park in the oldest part of dhaka about 3000 people 
camped out with the few possessions they rescued from their flooded 
homes 
we have now become one family we are not only sharing our 
common sorrows we are also sharing whatever little we have said 
mohammadullah a vegetable seller 
tears rolled down his face as he told how his 5yearold 
daughter rahima khatoon drowned in her sleep tuesday when she fell 
off her bed into the rising water at keraniganj on the outskirts of 
dhaka 
hundreds of people made their way to a high road near the 
buriganga river 
abdul hye a 35yearold government clerk put his two small 
children on his shoulders as he waded toward a shelter for refugees 
his wife naila begum propelled a pushcart loaded with the 
familys valuables and their white cat beauty 
we cannot let her die naila said as she petted the cat 
she will go with us wherever we go 
the relief ministry estimated that nearly onethird of the 
nations population of 105 million was affected by the floods some 
areas had only a few inches of water while in remote northern 
regions people scrambled up trees with their children and meager 
foodstuffs and waited for the water to go down 
municipal officials in dhaka a city of 4 million estimated 
onequarter of the city was affected by floods speaking on 
condition of anonymity they said up to threefourths of the 
sprawling capital could be covered with water before the end of the 
week 
other officials also speaking privately estimated that 100000 
displaced people were seeking shelter in the capitals makeshift 
relief camps open parks streets and with relatives 
floodwaters ranged from waistdeep at spots in mirpur on the 
outskirts of dhaka to 2 inches outside an office building whose 
upper floors house the us embassy in the motijheel commercial 
district 
thousands of laborers and volunteers worked around the clock to 
plug minor breaches in the embankment designed to protect dhaka 
from the buriganga during floodtime 
so far few deaths have been reported in dhaka most of the 
fatalities have occurred at least 40 miles from the capital 
rail service has been suspended in many areas because the tracks 
are flooded train and boats are the main form of transport in 
bangladesh where the scores of mighty rivers overflow every summer 
and wash out roads 
ershad said flood damage this year would be many times 
higher than last years loss of 1 billion 
in 1987 floods killed more than than 1200 people in 
bangladesh where the per capita income is 150 a year and 90 
percent of the population lives below the poverty level which is 
defined as being able to afford a diet of 2000 calories a day

president augusto pinochet called for 
support from opposition leaders on wednesday after violent protests 
followed his nomination as the only candidate in an october 
presidential referendum 
authorities said hundreds were arrested during widespread 
rioting tuesday and three people were killed including two 
teenage boys as residents threw open their windows and banged 
pots and pans in defiance 
rioting in the streets broke out after the military junta 
nominated pinochet who took part in the selection process to be 
the sole nominee in an october presidential referendum 
in a nationally broadcast address wednesday night pinochet made 
a rare appeal for opposition backing in previous addresses he has 
dismissed opponents as traitors rats highwaymen and 
cowards 
our democracy needs the collaboration of all chileans he 
said i call today on my compatriots supporters and opponents 
to assume this noble task chile needs you 
the remarks followed huge demonstratons by thousands of people 
in the capital and elsewhere 
in santiago alone 846 protesters were arrested during the 
daylong street demonstrations and clashes a report from the 
national police said it gave no precise figure for arrests outside 
the capital although scores were reported arrested in protests in 
most other cities 
many of those arrested were being released wednesday after an 
identity check some without being charged and others cited to 
appear before city judges 
the national police said the dead included two boys age 14 and 
15 and an adult it said 21 people were injured in the rioting 
pinochet who commands the army has led the military government 
that has governed chile since september 1973 when the elected 
government of marxist president salvador allende was overthrown in 
a bloody coup by the armed forces allende died in the coup 
pinochet was picked in a meeting with the chiefs of the navy 
air force and national police to be the sole candidate in an oct 5 
presidential referendum 
if a majority vote in his favor he will assume a new eightyear 
term on march 11 if voters reject him he remains in power until 
1990 when an open presidential election is to be held in conjuction 
with elections for a congress 
the nomination came despite appeals by the local roman catholic 
church and several moderate political organizations for a candidate 
who would have the backing of both the government and opposition 
it also ended speculation that the other commanders who had 
publicly expressed support for a civilian nominee would insist 
that pinochet give up his army commandership in return for the 
candidacy 
the formal nomination declaration refers repeatedly to pinochet 
as army leader and the army commander pointedly made his acceptance 
speech in military uniform 
he can legally remain army leader if he wins the referendum and 
remains president 
opposition leaders meanwhile said that pinochets nomination 
will backfire 
this confrontational decision directly compromises the armed 
forces who will suffer from his defeat in the plebescite 
patricio aylwin leader of the centrist christian democratic party 
said wednesday of pinochets selection 
the opposition cites several opinion polls that give a 21 
advantage to pinochet opponents in the ballot 
governmentcontracted polls give him a slight edge in the vote 
speaking to foreign reporters aylwin said pinochets army 
commandership acts as a kind of shield and exerts moral pressure 
on his institution 
pinochet is too attached to power and i dont believe he is 
willing to give up any of his priveleges he said 
aylwin described as generally peaceful tuesdays 
antigovernment protests in which thousands of people 
participated but he said he expected that the incidents of 
violence would be politically exploited by pinochets 
administration 
interior minister sergio fernandez issued a declaration 
wednesday that blamed the violence on the political opposition 
once again extremist groups have sewed death and fear those 
responsible for these acts are clearly identified with the 
supports of a vote of no 
christian democrat vicepresident andres zaldivar said however 
the only violence occurred where there was police repression 
riot police squads had broken the demonstrations with tear gas and 
water cannon 
aylwin described one of tuesdays falities that of a 
15yearold boy as one more youth added to the victims of the 
dictatorship the boy was participating in a potbanging protest 
when he was shot twice in the chest by gunmen in a passing car 
a 1980 constitution crafted by the pinochet government calls for 
a phased return to democracy including a resumption of congress in 
1990 however about a third of the senate would government 
appointees and highranking military officials the congress also 
a declaration signed by leaders of a 16party opposition 
coalition wednesday reaffirmed their plans to campaign for a vote 
of noin the referendum and if they win to negotiate with the 
armed forces for constitutional changes

belongings wednesday as forest fires roared to within a few miles

lines and toward ranches and grain fields firefighters also 
battled blazes blackening forests and fields in washington 
california and utah

contain the wildfires us forest service officials said they have 
filled hundreds of temporary firefighting positions and had to turn 
away volunteers only wyoming now needs more help they said

hunting season 
we simply dont need any more fires at this point schwinden 
told reporters at a hastily called news conference its not just

in montana an additional 173000 acres were burned in earlier 
fires

employee of a park concessionaire one minute the fire lays down 
and looks harmless and then the next day it gets up and comes at 
us 
the parks south entrance remained closed wednesday and 
officials closed a road between north junction and canyon two park 
villages they hope to reopen the south entrance thursday for the 
first time in about two weeks meaning all five gates will be open 
another blaze the north fork fire burned within two miles of 
west yellowstone mont but fire officials assured nervous 
residents that the flames would not reach the town about 1000 
firefighters constructed lines and removed vegetation and other 
burnable material from the edge of the town said fire information 
officer bill pidanick 
the conditions are a heck of a lot better than they were 
yesterday he said we dont have the wind 
driven by high winds the 92600acre fire burst out of control 
tuesday afternoon jumping the madison river and the main road from 
the parks west entrance to madison junction a flareup wednesday 
closed yellowstones west entrance for several hours in the 
afternoon 
in idaho a pair of strike crews and four bulldozers wednesday 
protected the star valley area of eastern idaho from the raging 
trail creek fire national guard jets surveyed fires 
the majority of the ranches are on alert said dan pugmire 
spokesman for caribou national forest in eastern idaho but we 
didnt have to alert them they were all standing outside watching 
it 
pugmire said winds shifted with amazing speed 
the winds were going one direction and we had a blowout on the 
northeastern flank he said then the wind shifted 180 degrees 
and the fire turned back on its self and began running east 
theres going to be some spots that are going to grow on us before 
we get a handle on it 
the trail creek fire southwest of palisades reservoir was the 
most threatening of 17 major blazes raging across idaho and up into 
the panhandle national forest more than 2500 firefighters backed 
up by national guard personnel and equipment battled the worst of 
the blazes that have burned more than 70000 acres of forest and 
range lands in idaho 
california firefighters got a break wednesday from mother nature 
there were only 243 lightning strikes tuesday night compared 
with nearly 9500 the day before said karen terrill a spokeswoman 
for the california forestry department 
by wednesday morning firefighters contained most of the more 
than 100 brush and timber fires started by lightning monday and 
early tuesday officials said 
but two new fires flared in the sierra national forest one 
called the garnet fire over about 100 acres in the kings river 
canyon in the southern sierra and another near mariposa just 
outside yosemite national park 
the mariposa blaze which was sparked by children playing with 
matches destroyed at least one home and forced the evacuation of 
17 people as it grew to 250 acres said state forestry spokeswoman 
kary weaver 
in oregon firefighters adopted a fallback strategy against the 
tepee butte fire which has burned 35775 acres of grass and timber 
on the wallowawhitman national forest and the hells canyon 
national recreation area 
the blaze will grow to 59000 acres before it reaches fire lines 
being built by 679 firefighters spokesman ron dehart said we 
cannot safely put crews up close to this fire because of the 
extremely rugged terrain and flash fuels he said 
utah firefighters controlled a 525acre fire near northern 
utahs pineview reservoir and a 100acre brush fire in butterfield 
canyon and expect to control a 60acre blaze in eastern utah by 
thursday night 
in eastern washington state a brief respite from hot and dry 
weather allowed firefighters to gain ground on major fires burning 
in more than 23000 acres of trees and brush 
but a warming trend is expected over the next few days thats 
not good said ron dehart a spokesman for the multiagency fire 
coordinating center in portland ore

looking for a disciplined systematic way to 
build up a nest egg for college tuition or retirement 
consider a technique that capt michael e edleson an assistant 
economics professor at the us military academy in west point 
ny calls value averaging 
edlesons idea is a new twist on the old popular strategy known 
as dollar cost averaging which calls for investing identical 
amounts at regular intervals in a vehicle such as a mutual fund 
but unlike dollarcost averaging value averaging provides a 
structure that tells you when to sell as well as when to buy 
the basic idea of value averaging described by edleson in the 
american association of individual investors aaii journal is to 
increase the total value of your investment by a set amount each 
month 
suppose you want to build up a mutual fund account to 24000 
over the next 10 years to help pay college costs for a child now in 
second grade 
you can pursue that goal by seeing that the accounts value 
increases by 200 each month through that 10year period 
the first month you simply make an initial investment of 200 
starting in the second month you invest whatever it takes to 
increase the overall value of your holdings by 200 
if the net asset value of the funds shares declines you will 
need to put up more than 200 in the second month if it rises 
however you will invest less 
assuming that sooner or later the fund enters a period of strong 
performance you are likely to encounter months in which price 
appreciation alone increases the value of your holdings by more 
than 200 
in those instances you dont invest any money at all rather 
you sell or redeem enough shares to bring the monthly increase 
back down to 200 perhaps by switching the surplus into a 
moneymarket fund 
a reserve in the money fund will help you keep the system going 
in periods when the fund declines making new monthly investments 
of substantially more than 200 necessary 
spotted a flaw or two in this whole deal well yes edleson 
concedes there are some 
for one thing the monthly mathematical exercise required makes 
it more complicated and timeconsuming than a simple dollarcost 
averaging program 
investing and redeeming odd amounts regularly can incur 
forbidding transaction costs one reason why as edleson says 
value averaging works best with a mutual fund that has no sales or 
redemption fees and generous telephone switching privileges 
then theres the problem of taxes on capital gains every time 
you sell you can dodge this if you are operating inside an 
individual retirement arrangement that is not subject to current 
taxation 
otherwise edleson says there is an alternative simply do 
nothing when the value averaging rules indicate that you should 
sell shares 
under this approach you let the surplus stand in the account 
for as long as it takes to have the 200 monthly increases catch up 
with it if there is still a surplus when the 10 years are up no 
complaints you have exceeded your goal 
this same variation lends itself well to use with dividend 
reinvestment and stock purchase plans a popular tool for 
individual investors edelson notes in such plans selling in 
small amounts is often impractical or not allowed 
an obvious objection to this whole arrangement presents itself 
readily you are limiting what your money can achieve the better 
your fund performs the more potential gains you will miss out on 
you wont get rich quick edleson acknowledges but the 
point of the system is to encourage both buying at low prices and 
selling or at least not buying at high prices

even for television the scene sounds 
improbable new york mobsters with sicilian accents making death 
threats in chinese subtitles 
but believe it the underworld sells overseas 
from italy to australia to brazil foreign viewers are so hungry 
for american shows that even borderline series like the failed mob 
drama our family honor or the grounded helicopter yarn 
airwolf can be resurrected 
us producers meanwhile are enjoying the windfall they 
expect to collect 600 million in foreign television revenues this 
year up 100 percent from three years ago 
international sales used to be considered gravy said colin 
davis president of mca television international now 
international revenue is considered an integral part of a shows 
budget 
the foreign market growing steadily for 10 years has yet to 
influence programming decisions directly don johnson isnt yet 
taking afternoon tea and snacking on scones on miami vice for 
instance 
i think those days are still a long way away said bruce 
gordon president of paramount international television division 
the producers must first pay attention to american tastes 
still said davis there are general discussions now of how a 
show will play in the foreign market 
in an era of tighter finances in hollywood it is increasingly 
important that us television shows travel that foreign 
audiences be able to understand the stories 
lucille ball and laverne amp shirley travel well because the 
comedy is visual said gordon but family ties is not visual 
comedy its spoken comedy cheers is the same its a play on 
words its hard to retain the humor in translation 
the most consistently popular shows overseas are 
actionadventure programs a car chase or a shootout is just as 
exciting in arabic as it is in english and who watches hunter 
for its dialogue anyway even if a show like macgyver is badly 
translated the action speaks for itself said gordon 
actionadventure shows also represent a programming bargain for 
foreign buyers the equalizer which could cost the british 
broadcasting corp 1 million an episode to produce for example 
costs a fraction of that through foreign syndication 
for the us producers those fractions add up and quickly 
many television shows are sold to the networks at a loss with 
producers hoping to recoup the shortfall through rerun sales if 
you cant make up your production deficits with foreign sales 
you shouldnt make the show said michael jay solomon a top 
executive at lorimar telepictures corp 
the writers guild of america is convinced that one of the 
brightest areas for television growth rests overseas the 
fivemonth writers strike against producers hinged on rerun 
payments for foreign reruns with the writers finally accepting a 
compromise payment formula 
whatever the producers are most hesitant to negotiate is 
always where the next boom lies said arthur sellers a member of 
the wga negotiating committee according to the wga while the 
united states has one television set for every person the rest of 
the world averages one set for every 10 people 
writers and producers alike are looking to europe where us 
television syndication is relatively new and so far predictably 
profitable 
in the 1970s when el show de dick van dyke was a favorite 
in paraguayan bars latin america audiences represented the 
majority of the foreign television audience then the latin economy 
slumped the easiest thing to do in latin america now is to 
sell solomon said the hardest thing to do is collect 
european markets began to open up in the 1980s as more and more 
countries allowed the operation of private networks italy was 
followed by france and private networks are emerging in britain 
west germany denmark and spain 
roughly 60 percent of international television revenues now come 
from europe according to davis and the future looks healthy 
in 1975 paramount international television sold about 1 
million in programming to eight european stations in the 1987 
fiscal year paramount sold programs to 78 european outlets with 
revenues of more than 47 million 
the biggest potential audience though may be one of the 
hardest to reach the soviet union 
but who knows maybe the soviets are ready for the gong 
show then again maybe world peace is more important

the new director of the miss america 
pageant says there will be so many changes in saturdays production 
that he fears raised eyebrows among fans of the 67yearold 
tradition 
but before anyone gasps leonard horn is quick to point out that 
the swimsuit competition is still in place even though he 
believes there may be other means of proving a young womans 
fitness 
the winner still will take her stroll down the runway a much 
longer runway this time to the tune of there she is 
and the show still will feature an elaborate stage production 
but new musical director donald pippin has created a livelier tempo 
thats not quite rock n roll but just as spirited 
horn is more concerned about the longtime supporters of the 
pageant who bought seats even in the lean years when it was 
weathering attacks from feminists some of those supporters have 
unhappily learned theyve been bumped from their box seats to make 
room for bigwigs representing the eight corporate sponsors and even 
some highrollers from atlantic city casinos 
horn also knocked out a production number and replaced it with 
video segments showing the finalists being interviewed by the 
judges he eliminated a prepared speech each inalist gave in the 
evening gown competition in favor of asking the women unrehearsed 
questions 
it wont be a cutesy question he said it will be 
sufficiently provocative to elicit an intelligent response which 
might give us further insight into her ability to articulate under 
pressure 
the changes were necessary to keep the pageant up to date and 
attract the younger female audience that had stopped watching the 
show in recent years horn said 
some people believe the pageant has gotten stale said horn 
who took over when albert marks retired last year after 37 years 
all were trying to do is give it the vigor it once had 
and reconfirm that its a positive program that deserves peoples 
respect 
for the 51 contestants from the states and the district of 
columbia a week of pageantry and preliminary competitions lead to 
saturday nights nationally televised finale 
reaching atlantic city has been a rocky trip for some 
contestants 
in th district of columbia the entire pageant was restaged 
after national pageant officials found problems with the judging 
the original winner edwina richard became first runnerup and has 
said i feel like i became a victim 
in georgia the winner frances frazier has denied accusations 
she was promised the crown when she was a runnerup the year 
before earlier this year a former georgia pageant board member 
wrote to national officials saying she had firsthand knowledge that 
blacks were not being given a fair shot at the crown 
miss california not only had to watch in dismay as a defeated 
contestant loudly denounced the pageant but also had to respond to 
rumors she suffers from anorexia nervosa the eating disorder 
in the new jersey state pageant some contestants grumbled that 
one of the judges was acquainted with the winner 
about 80000 young women enter local contests that lead to the 
miss america pageant more than 5 million in cash and tuition 
scholarships is available this year miss america receives at least

faced with the prospect of losing the 
grain farm that has been in their family for most of this century 
seven members of the richard kurth family turned to a new cash crop 
marijuana 
that decision discovered in a drug bust last fall has turned 
many in this farm town of 1700 against the kurths some see no end 
to the controversy particularly after most of the family received 
reduced sentences 
i dont believe they will ever be able to live in the 
community again said joan stewart editor of the river press 
newspaper its never going to be forgotten 
yet some of the kurths say all they want to do is remain on the 
4500acre farm and cattle feedlot which still faces foreclosure 
im not going to let a community shove me out said cindy 
halley daughter of richard kurth the family patriarch 
its not just the familys action that has upset fort benton 
about 960 valid signatures far more than the 549 needed have been 
gathered on a petition to recall chouteau county prosecutor tom 
sheehy over the way the case was handled 
this type of prosecution will only encourage more drug 
traffic says the petition which expresses concern over plea 
bargaining and notes the kurths were not required to post bond 
this prominent family has never paid a cent of bail they 
werent brought in complained winnie appleby who runs a local 
motel 
dr william gertson heading the recall effort said people 
wanted sheehy to turn the case over to federal prosecutors 
because we felt like he was inexperienced and we felt like he was 
so liberal that nothing would happen 
the prosecutor who is suing to invalidate the recall petitions 
defended the plea bargains that resulted in convictions of richard 
kurth and his wife judy both 57 and five others 
guilty is guilty sheehy said 
he noted that district judge chan ettien released the family 
members on their own recognizance and reduced sentences that sheehy 
recommended 
richard kurth received four concurrent 20year sentences with 
all but five years suspended while his wife received a fiveyear 
sentence with all but one year suspended both could be out in less 
than a year with good behavior sentences for the others were 
suspended altogether or deferred 
ettien struck a nerve with his courtroom comment that the social 
ill from marijuana use does not approach that of alcohol 
the judge who declined to elaborate wrote in his sentencing 
order that except for one criminal offense the kurths had been 
an exemplary group 
some people in town agree howard axtman who sells farm 
equipment and had two kurth children in his boy scout troop said 
im not a supporter of what they did i dont think anyone is 
but they were good people 
up to a point they were typical people too 
most farmers in montana have suffered years of drought and low 
prices for grain 
but in 1985 richard and judy kurth decided that to pay their 
debts they would grow marijuana they have said the decision 
stemmed from an offhand remark made by an officer of norwest bank 
in great falls 
perhaps in jest perhaps not the bank officer suggested 
they could save their ranch only by growing an illegal cash crop 
of some sort perhaps marijuana defense lawyer ralph randono 
said at the couples sentencing 
he contended the bank was very aware of what the kurths were 
doing 
frank shaw president of the bank termed the comments 
preposterous and total fabrications 
after beginning the operation the couple decided to recruit 
their adult children all three agreed along with two of their 
spouses son bill kurths wife lisa was not involved authorities 
said 
kind of the way i took it was either you hop on the bandwagon 
and help out or i guess you can just go down the road and find 
another job said soninlaw clay halley because it was either 
do this and save the ranch or there wasnt going to be any ranch 
in nearly two years authorities say the family sold 400000 
worth of marijuana 
in addition to the sentences the state is seeking 750000 in 
taxes and interest based on the estimated value of the 2155 
marijuana plants seized in last octobers raid 
family members had a lot to learn about growing marijuana they 
said in a recent interview first they went to libraries and 
bookstores they also received advice from customers lost some 
crops and learned from mistakes 
just like anything else in agriculture you try it and if it 
doesnt work you change it and try it again clay halley said 
hired men and customers came and went at the farm 14 miles 
south of fort benton without knowing marijuana was being grown and 
dried in four separate buildings with automatic watering and 
lighting systems windows and doors in those buildings were locked 
and covered 
even sheriffs deputies serving papers involving the kurths 
debts had no reason to suspect anything said undersheriff doug 
williams 
the loan agreement showed norwest bank had agreed to forgive the 
kurths 13 million loan if they paid 275000 they paid 125000 
and hoped to make the final payments by april 1988 then 
restructure their debts with the federal land bank save the farm 
and stop growing marijuana 
our objective was to not continue this thing over two years 
and when we got done in two years to still have a ranch said 
son doug kurth 
just 5 months before the last loan payment was due federal and 
county law officers arrived at the kurth property after receiving 
a tip 
the kurths say they were actually relieved to see law officers 
pull up on oct 18 two days earlier men posing as drug 
enforcement administration agents had attempted a robbery the 
following day they had received a 25000 extortion demand 
but they have since had to face their own young children deal 
with publicity and withstand the continued scrutiny of their 
neighbors and the townspeople 
the familys clothing cars travel and entertainment are often 
discussed and many people maintain the kurths could have altered a 
lifestyle described as highflying if they had truly wanted to 
get out of debt 
they lived so much higher than people who were in debt said 
gertson they were flashy in their dress flashy in their way of 
living 
and editor stewart said of richard kurth his lifestyle is not 
poor farmer and never has been 
doug kurth and his wife rhonda and the halleys say such talk 
is a price they pay for living in a small town despite it all the 
two families want to remain 
doug summed up the message hed like to convey to the community 
saying hey its over with were paying our debt to society 
leave us alone

in the five years since a federal panel branded 
americas schools mediocre states have responded by raising 
teacher salaries and heaping layers of tests rules and regulations 
on schools but ap reporters in all 50 states now find reformers 
urging a new route to school improvement more say from the 
teachers and less from the state on what happens in the classroom 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after spending five years and billions of tax dollars raising 
classroom standards and teacher salaries some states and school 
districts are turning to the teachers themselves to lead the next 
leg of the journey to better schools 
but they warn this latest reform effort will take years to reap 
benefits 
most states prodded by dozens of reports since a national 
commission in 1983 branded americas schools mediocre imposed 
layer upon layer of topdown reforms they raised teacher pay 
but also imposed stricter course guidelines and new competency 
tests for both teachers and students 
a 50state survey by associated press reporters now finds a 
growing willingness among states and school districts to ease their 
regulatory grip on public schools and give teachers a more direct 
role in shaping curricula 
reformers say teaching even with fatter paychecks has become 
less attractive because the new rules thwart initiative and while 
students may be better testtakers they add reforms to date have 
not provided the critical thinking skills needed in a competitive 
world 
most of the reforms so far have been paper and headlines 
said beverly l corelle president of the maryland state teachers 
association 
getting beyond such surface reforms has been difficult in many 
schools however where educators refuse to acknowledge how bad off 
some students are 
very few schools look at the national picture and realize that 
only 15 percent of high school students can write a simple 
letter and only a small percentage can locate the united states or 
the atlantic ocean on a map or work with a simple bus timetable 
said albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers so why should anyone change their ways and habits 
unless in their gut they feel the system isnt working 
shanker and other reform leaders are now telling states that the 
path to better schools goes through the schoolhouse not the 
statehouse freeing teachers to try new lessons and ideas and 
students to learn at their own pace instead of in lockstep with 
peers 
some districts are getting the message 
a dozen arizona districts are experimenting with outcomebased 
education in which students scoring less than a b on 
assignments get extra time and tutoring to redo the work without 
getting a poor mark utah is spending 1 million on a similar 
program 
there are people who say kids need to fail said dave 
briggs principal of alhambra high school in phoenix i think 
thats garbage were here to teach you success 
rochester ny made headlines with a teacher contract raising 
top pay to 70000 from 51000 but more important than the lofty 
salaries say both the school board and the teachers union are 
schoolbased planning teams in which teachers and 
administrators will plan how to run their schools relatively free 
of school board interference 
a contract with similar provisions and teacher salaries as 
high as 64000 takes effect this fall in dade county fla 
which includes miami and administrators this summer report getting 
as many as eight applications for each opening 
the new thinking is getting teachers more involved in the 
decisionmaking in the school said pat crawford a spokeswoman 
for pittsburghs public schools where instructional cabinets of 
teachers and administrators can shape teaching techniques for 
individual students 
minnesota has given most students the right to attend any school 
districts they wish advanced high school students can even take 
courses at public colleges at the states expense 
in moses lake one of several washington school districts being 
freed to tailor education programs with less bureaucratic 
interference teacher lounges are suddenly alive with talk about 
how to use this new freedom to help the districts lowincome 
children who arent achieving 
we are experimenting this is a search for solutions we want 
to remove the shackles of bureaucracy and regulation that inhibit 
creativity and initiative in our schools said gov booth gardner 
of washington 
arizona one of the only states requiring students at all grade 
levels to pass standardized tests is now excusing firstgraders 
out of concern for the pressure the tests put on young children 
its gratifying i think some political leaders now realize 
school reform is more complicated than they thought they are 
straightforward enough to say well lets take the other road 
said theodore sizer head of brown universitys education 
department and a guiding force behind the reform wave 
since his widely acclaimed book horaces compromise was 
published in 1984 sizer has pressed school authorities to free 
teachers from blackboard lectures dull texts and multiplechoice 
tests to function instead as coaches training students to think 
independently 
five states arkansas delaware illinois new mexico and rhode 
island have said they will free at least 10 schools this year to 
try sizers philosophies 
but some fear the odds remain stacked against fundamental change 
in spite of the few examples here and there i do not see 
anything like the will and creativity to achieve radical 
restructuring said ernest l boyer president of the carnegie 
endowment for the advancement of teaching which has produced 
several widely acclaimed reform documents 
he and others are especially concerned that reform has created 
few meaningful programs for the most troubled students those at 
risk of dropping out because of poverty pregnancy or parental 
neglect 
there are some arizona this year appropriated 45 million to 
help atrisk children statewide and indiana will award 20 million 
to local districts to help such children colorado is spending 
850000 on 2000 disadvantaged preschool children florida has 
earmarked 23 million to help disadvantaged 3 and 4yearolds 
minnesota requires districts to provide education programs for 
pregnant teens and teenage parents 
shanker whose union this year endorsed the principle of local 
school experimentation as did the rival national education 
association said his biggest worry is that schools might be too 
cynical to adopt new ways 
if theres an enemy its likely to be us he said a lot 
of school districts arent doing anything and they are praying for 
the others to fail because they dont want to look bad themselves 
after five years of efforts reform leaders worry that an 
impatient nation will be disillusioned if the latest tactics fail 
to pay off 
you cant reform schools rapidly unless youre faking it 
said judith lanier dean of michigan state universitys school of 
education 
if youre at the beginning of a revolution you have to 
support and encourage different trials not condemn the whole 
movement if a few things dont work but accept the complexity of 
the task

involved in a bold plan aimed at giving the state a world class 
education system by the 21st century in the words of gov booth 
gardner 
backed by 21 million in state money to pay teachers for extra 
time spent planning the program will allow the teachers to shake 
up their classrooms rather than their bosses and the school boards 
whove been dictating what to do 
now with the flexibility of the 21st century program we can 
experiment it gives us a way to create to do something 
different said sutter who teaches spanish and social studies in 
moses lakes a central washington city about 230 miles east of 
olympia 
sutter says his first order of business is to expand his 
homework hotline a program in which high school students can call 
peers for help with homework 
were starting a guest speaker program were also starting a 
telephone counseling service where students can call anonymously 
and get referred to places where they can get help for drug 
addiction or whatever sutter said 
sutters excitement can also be found at moses lakes larson 
heights elementary school there teachers are reorganizing 
curricula and classrooms for the 300 pupils many of whom are from 
lowincome families and lag in achievement 
basically what the teachers are doing is creating 
opportunities to enrich these kids to enrich their minds said 
pj benedetti a district official working with the teachers on 
alternative education plans 
for example the teachers have decided to keep larson heights 
open until 6 pm each day giving latchkey kids and others a way 
to profit from free time 
the kids can use the school computers they can work on their 
homework in a quiet supervised setting there will be storytime 
organized recreation arts and crafts benedetti said 
i dont think ive ever seen our teachers this excited or this 
enthusiastic said moses lake superintendent ben edlund

backed by a broad new law new jersey is 
trying to seize control of a major urban school district it 
considers to be educationally bankrupt 
state officials say schools in jersey city new jerseys second 
largest city are so crippled by political patronage that local 
leaders cannot make desperately needed improvements 
symptomatic they say are curricula on afroamerican history 
that end with the nixon administration 
city officials disagree and are trying to block the takeover 
jersey city is providing the first test of a law enacted in 
january giving new jersey power to take over chronically troubled 
schools 
kentucky south carolina texas and new mexico have laws of 
varying strength allowing state takeovers of failing school 
districts according to the national governors association laws in 
illinois and arkansas let the state eliminate deficient districts 
and an ohio law allows the state to revoke a districts charter a 
georgia law allows financial penalties in the form of reduced state 
aid 
if new jersey wins it can abolish the local board of education 
fire administrators and appoint a state superintendent to operate 
the district of 32000 students for five years 
when schools fail its adults who failed and adults should 
pay the price gov thomas kean said when he signed the law 
jersey city officials say their city suffers from the poverty 
and crime typical of urban districts they contend that to single 
out jersey city for state takeover is unfair when efforts are being 
made to reverse the decay from years of political intrusion under 
former administrations 
the state launched the takeover in may after almost three years 
of investigation and monitoring in the district 
i dont think they were looking for anything right they were 
on a mission to point up what was wrong said william massa 
attorney for the jersey city board of education 
takeover hearings before an administrative law judge are 
expected to last into january the earliest the state could take 
control is next may but appeals by the district could further 
delay action 
state investigators said they found financial irregularities 
questionable payroll and personnel practices and incompetent 
management richard kaplan the states lead investigator said 
district employees are routinely rewarded or demoted based on which 
mayoral candidate they backed in the most recent election 
they also cited low test scores and high truancy rates last 
year jersey city students registered the third lowest passing rate 
in the state on a mandatory statewide ninthgrade test 
eleven other new jersey districts including newark are in the 
third and final stage of state monitoring that precedes a takeover 
six of the districts are working with the state to make 
improvements and officials hope the jersey city action sends a 
signal that new jersey is ready to act again if a district fails to 
make the grade

costagavras is unique among worldclass filmmakers he alone 
has made a career of polemics on such issues as military 
dictatorships z and american meddling abroad missing 
his films have swayed world opinion while gripping audiences 
with his documentarystyle drama because no one else attacks 
social ills on a regular basis it is regrettable that he stumbles 
with betrayed 
the film begins with a costagavras imprint a graphic depiction 
of heartpounding violence over the titles an acerbic radio 
talkshow host spouts insults at his favorite targets rock music 
fat women and bigots as he leaves the studio he is followed by 
another car then is gunned down in a parking structure by unseen 
assailants 
the episode obviously inspired by the murder of denver 
broadcaster alan berg establishes the timeliness of betrayed 
but this early promise later dissipates in an illogical and 
overstated melodrama 
a dedicated fbi agent debra winger unwillingly accepts the 
assignment of trying to infiltrate a midwestern hate group 
suspected of the broadcasters murder posing as a harvester 
machine driver she quickly ingratiates herself to a good ol boy 
charmer tom berenger with his overalls homespun manner and two 
small motherless children he seems as american as a big mac 
the romance grows and marriage is proposed but berenger has a 
challenge for his wifetobe he wants her not only to approve of 
his secret paramiliatry society but to participate in its robberies 
and murders 
an intriguing situation but it is destroyed by overkill 
wingers first trial is taking part in a midnight game in which 
a young black is set loose in a thicket with a gun and 10 bullets 
and hunted down by dogs and heavily armed farmers even rambo 
fans would have trouble buying this one 
following the trend of recent films wingers fbi superiors are 
portrayed as incompetents they allow her to remain in a 
lifethreatening situation with no backup or support they dont 
even follow her and berenger when the pair embark on an 
assassination trip nor is there concern when winger herself 
commits a crime shooting a guard during a bank robbery 
the actors strive for credibility but the joe esterhaz script 
and costagavras overzealous direction defeat them debra wingers 
intensity helps keep her character alive tom berenger proved his 
talent for portraying evil in platoon but he has no chance 
here to reconcile the normalseeming farmer and the hatewarped 
psycho

jc penney company inc has borrowed 700 million 
to create a leveraged employee stock ownership plan in conjunction 
with an expanded stock buyback program the retailing company 
announced tuesday 
the socalled lesop a taxqualified employee benefit trust that 
invests in the sponsoring companys securities will replace jc 
penneys existing employee savings and profitsharing retirement 
plan 
penney employees already own 15 percent of the companys 132 
million common shares outstanding through their existing retirement 
plan 
the lesop is using the proceeds of the 700 million loan to 
purchase a new issue of convertible preferred stock from the 
company officials said the preferred stock is convertible into 
about 118 million shares of the companys common stock about 9 
percent of the currently outstanding common shares 
penney will use the 700 million it gets from the employee trust 
to buy back 15 million common shares from the public therefore 
the employees will end up controlling 316 million common shares 
or about 245 percent of the common shares that ultimately will be 
outstanding 
william r howell penneys chairman said the plan would help 
boost shareholder value 
we see these steps as strengthening the interests of our major 
constituencies our investors our consumers and our associates 
employees 
it wont really have an effect on our daytoday operation 
said company spokesman harvey mccormick as far as long term it 
should boost our earnings per share reduce costs and increase our 
cash flow 
such employee stock ownership plans commonly have been 
implemented by corporations anxious to place a large block of their 
shares into friendly hands thus helping thwart potential raids 
penneys plan is the largest such lesop yet created according to 
some reports 
penney said it would redirect its annual contribution from the 
savings plan to the lesop last year those contributions were 50 
million 
penney stock rose 187 a share to 4812 tuesday on the new

the stock bond and currency markets showed little reaction 
after the government reported a 08 percent drop in its main 
indicator of the economys strength the biggest decline since 
after the crash of the stock market 
tuesdays report actually comforted some economists and 
investors who feared the economy was expanding too rapidly raising 
the danger of higher inflation higher interest rates and 
eventually a recession 
the government also said tuesday that factory orders fell 35 
percent in july the biggest monthly drop since january 1987 but 
economists said the decline had little significance because it was 
caused mainly by a swing in the volatile category of defense orders 
for those people who were worried that we were in for a major 
acceleration of inflation these numbers probably calm some 
nerves said lawrence chimerine chairman of the wefa group a 
bala cynwyd pa economic forecasting firm 
stock prices generally rose tuesday in a slow session although 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 320 points to 
203823 after a 24point gain on monday 
the dollar fell tuesday against most major currencies while 
bond prices finished slightly higher the yield of the treasurys 
30year bond which falls when the market strengthens dipped to 
932 percent from 933 percent late monday 
chimerine said the reports should help encourage the fed to hold 
off on any further tightening moves unless new evidence of 
inflation surfaces 
the decline in the leading indicators was the biggest since last 
november when the index dropped 10 percent in the aftermath of 
the october stock market crash 
economists noted the index posted an exceptionally strong 
increase in june and cautioned against reading too much into a 
onemonth downturn 
despite the declines were not going to have any slowing in 
the imminent future said bruce steinberg an economist with 
merrill lynch amp co in new york 
us manufacturing which languished earlier in the decade 
because of the strong dollar has rebounded the weaker dollar has 
fueled a resurgence in sales of american goods overseas and 
businesses have responded by spending more to upgrade and replace 
plant and equipment 
but demand for us goods has been so strong that some analysts 
are concerned that factory capacity will be strained pushing 
prices higher 
factory orders excluding the defense category were down 07 
percent in july following a healthy 29 percent gain in june 
samuel d kahan an economist with kleinwort benson government 
securities inc in chicago said that despite the overall drop in 
factory orders in july there is very little evidence yet that 
the manufacturing sector is moderating 
the economy as measured by the gross national product grew at 
a 33 percent annual rate in the three months ended in june and at 
a 34 percent pace in the first quarter 
in an effort to ease inflationary pressures the federal reserve 
board has attempted to dampen economic growth by boosting 
shortterm interest rates since late march

some rivals in the fight against computer 
viruses are spending a large portion of their time battling 
each other instead of their common enemy of software invaders 
the bitter battle concerns which of two groups has the 
qualifications and impartiality to evaluate antivirus software for 
potential customers the competition could slow down progress in 
combating viruses 
i personally know most of the people in this industry and i 
have never seen this kind of animosity brian camenker head of 
the pc users group of the boston computer society said tuesday 
the battle centers on products sometimes known as vaccines 
that are intended to deal with viruses which can wreak havoc with 
computer programs viruses are tiny pieces of computer code that 
pranksters or other outsiders can secretly put into normal 
programs which infect computers when used 
although they are rare and have done limited damage so far 
viruses are feared because of their potential to be spread from one 
computer to another wiping out millions of dollars worth of data 
in minutes 
publicity over viruses such as the israeli virus the christmas 
virus and the pakistani brain has led dozens of companies and 
individuals to create antiviral software products but there is no 
easy or reliable way for customers to know whether they work 
customers and producers agree on the need for an independent 
panel of experts to review the software the question splitting the 
industry is who should be in charge 
pitted against each other are the 2monthold computer virus 
industry association which is based in santa clara calif and a 
loose collection of other computer figures led by jon r david a 
consultant in tappan ny and harold highland editor of 
computers amp security magazine in elmont ny 
the controversy heated up monday with the publication of a 
frontpage article on the debate in mis week a weekly trade 
newspaper 
each side accuses the other of using sloppy techniques and 
manipulating the testing process for its own purposes the 
intensity of the debate has left some software developers disgusted 
with the whole business 
were not casting our lot with anyone said raymond glath 
president of rg software systems inc in the philadelphia suburb of 
wilow grove pa who has nonetheless been loosely aligned with 
david and highland 
an independent testing panel is essential because most computer 
users have never seen a virus if they had a useless defense they 
would not know it until a virus invaded and caused problems 
this kind of testing needs to be done professionally and 
carefully particularly if other people are going to place reliance 
on it said robert v jacobson president of new yorkbased 
international security technology inc 
jacobson has cautiously thrown his support behind the computer 
virus industry association which was formed in june by a group led 
by john mcafee president of interpath corp in santa clara calif 
the group has eight corporate members 
the industry association is assembling an independent university 
testing panel composed of people from three new york metropolitan 
area colleges pace university adelphi university and sarah 
lawrence college 
the head of the university testing program is john cordani who 
teaches computer science in the business schools of adelphi and 
pace cordani is a lieutenant colonel in the army reserve and has a 
parttime post in the computer security division of the pentagon 
david and highland say cordani and the three schools dont seem 
to have the necessary credentials they also say mcafees interpath 
products will have an advantage in the testing which has not 
begun because mcafee is the inventor of a virus simulator that 
will be used as one of the testing mechanisms 
highland is getting money from his magazines britishbased 
publisher elsevier advanced technology publications for his own 
review of a range of antiviral software with the help of david 
and various consultants around the world 
but highland said he is not interested in operating an ongoing 
software review board at the age of 71 id rather sit on the 
sidelines im having more fun running a magazine 
the virus issue is crucial enough that a major invitationonly 
symposium on it is scheduled in october by deloitte haskins amp sells 
and the information systems security association most major 
corporations and government agencies are probing the issue 
for all the controversy over antiviral products computer 
security experts agree that the best protection against viruses is 
not new software but prevention that means being extremely 
careful about dangerous practices such as loading computers with 
software that is offered free on computer bulletin boards

two former bank officers sentenced to prison for 
crimes that contributed to the nearcollapse of continental 
illinois national bank and trust co say they are relieved that 
years of court proceedings are over 
sentenced in a hearing were john r lytle a former continental 
vice president and william g patterson the head of energy 
lending at the nowdefunct penn square bank of oklahoma city 
the two pleaded guilty to charges stemming from an alleged 
scheme that left continental illinois holding millions of dollars 
in bad energy loans from penn square penn square failed in 1982 
and continental illinois nearly collapsed two years later following 
an unprecedented run on its deposits 
us district judge milton shadur sentenced lytle to 3 years in 
prison despite lytles pleas for probation shadur sentenced 
patterson who choked back tears as he spoke in his own defense to 
a 2year term 
lytle 53 and patterson 38 pleaded guilty june 30 to one 
criminal charge each for a scheme in which lytle allegedly took 
kickbacks in exchange for arranging to have continental buy 
millions of dollars in risky energy loans from penn square the 
maximum sentence allowed under their plea bargain was five years 
im going to be able to put a red circle on my calendar which 
signals the end of this affair lytle told the judge before 
sentencing he said he had lived under indictment for more than six 
years 
patterson who held his head and cried as he spoke said he was 
sorry for his actions and was concerned about his family he also 
had sought a sentence of probation and community service 
im sorry for the people in chicago and oklahoma he said 
i think of that a lot 
pattersons attorney burck bailey said after the sentencing 
that were relieved to have it behind us 
bailey said he was convinced the ordeal had harmed pattersons 
longterm health he said patterson had to be carried from court 
when acquitted of charges in oklahoma related to penn square only 
to find out the next day he had been indicted in chicago 
testifying before his sentencing lytle said he accepted 
responsibility for his actions he asked the judge to sentence him 
to no more than six months in prison and assign him to work with 
the poor on chicagos west side

entertainer merv griffin has received 
approval from a majority of resorts international inc stockholders 
to buy the gaming and real estate company but state gaming 
regulators have thrown up a roadblock 
griffins proposed trust agreement needed before he can buy 
the resorts stock from class a shareholders and controlling 
stockholder donald trump failed to win approval tuesday from the 
state casino control commission 
the trust agreement is necessary in case the commission finds 
griffin ineligible for a new jersey gaming license in that case 
the trust would run the company until griffin could appeal the 
decision or sell off the companys assets 
the commission voted 32 against the proposed trust agreement 
largely because it calls for a trustee to take control of the 
griffin co rather than just the resorts stock griffin officials 
wanted the trust agreement to cover the griffin co to ensure the 
firm can take advantage of prior tax losses of resorts potentially 
worth 100 million 
griffins deal to buy resorts was to expire at midnight tuesday 
but robert trump vice president of the trump organization said 
after the commission meeting that he expected griffin to extend the 
offer for another 30 days 
griffin was present at tuesdays hearing but did not testify 
the former talk show host said afterward he had asked the internal 
revenue service for clarification on the tax issue and he still 
expects the deal to go through 
commissioners carl zeitz and w david waters argued that the 
griffin co did not do enough to satisfy the law concerning the 
structure of the trust 
griffin also must obtain approvals from the atlantic city 
housing authority and the bahamian government where a resorts 
facility is located said resorts president ig jack davis 
the deal also is contingent upon settlement of shareholder 
litigation now pending in the delaware chancery court and another 
lawsuit by showboat hotel casino 
trump who owns resorts class b stock which has 100 times the 
voting power of the class a stock will receive 135 a share or 
about 96 million trump will also receive another 63 million to 
break his management agreement with resorts and he will then buy 
the companys unfinished taj mahal casino project for 255 million 
holders of the 57 million class a shares will receive 36 a 
share under griffins offer or a total of 2052 million on 
tuesday holders of 29 million class a shares just slightly over 
the number needed to approve the proposal agreed to accept 
griffins offer more than 236000 voted against the deal and more 
than 58000 abstained

a federal appeals court panel has ruled in 
favor of the maker of the drug bendectin in a classaction suit by 
some 1150 plaintiffs who claimed the antinausea drug caused birth 
defects 
the attorney for merrell dow pharmaceuticals inc maker of 
bendectin said the decision by the us 6th circuit court of 
appeals upholding a 1985 us district court decision was the most 
important yet in bendectinrelated litigation which has been 
active for years 
it shows the plaintiffs lawyers lost fair and square said 
frank woodside iii merrell dows attorney 
a federal court jury in cincinnati decided in march 1985 after 
five weeks of testimony that the drug did not cause birth defects 
when taken in prescribed doses by pregnant women 
the threejudge appeals panel upheld the verdict as well as 
judge carl rubins decision to keep the jury from seeing all 
plaintiffs who had birth defects 
woodside said merrell dow has not asked that plaintiffs be 
removed in any of the individual bendectin suits against merrell 
dow in other courts but was concerned that having hundreds of 
children testify may have distracted the jury and attorneys in 
the classaction case 
stanley chesley one of the attorneys representing more than 800 
individual suits in the class action did not return phone calls 
tuesday 
appeals judge nathaniel jones dissented in part tuesday by 
saying the judge should have first met with the excluded plaintiffs 
before denying them their day in court 
the appeals court also affirmed rubins decision to split the 
trial into two parts if the jury had found that the drug caused 
defects there would have been subsequent trials to determine any 
negligence or damages 
the court also upheld rubins ruling that the district court did 
not have jurisdiction in 80 of the 1150 cases those 80 cases were 
dismissed or sent back to state court 
an estimated 32 million pregnant women worldwide took bendectin 
or its overseas version debendox from 1956 to 1983 merrell dow 
voluntarily removed it from the market in 1983 although it 
maintains the drug is safe and does not cause birth defects in 
children 
merrell dow said in a news release that it had won 22 jury 
verdicts or judgments in bendectin birth defect suits and was 
appealing four trial verdicts won by plaintiffs 
woodside said dozens of lawyers across the country were awaiting 
the appeals court ruling before deciding if they should file 
similar claims against the company which is based in suburban 
reading 
its going to have precedential effect all over the place 
woodside said this opinion is a very thorough review of all the 
issues presented to the court of appeals

eastern airlines has 140 fewer flights today but 
because of a federal judges ruling still employs 4000 workers it 
wanted to lay off 
eastern is going ahead with previously announced plans to 
curtail service from 14 cities in the aftermath of an order tuesday 
by us district judge barrington parker the order allowed route 
cuts but barred the company from making mass layoffs without 
negotiating with its unions 
massive layoffs are not and shall never be business as 
usual parker wrote in a 50page opinion the railway labor act 
requires eastern to bargain with its unions before taking 
unilateral action to eliminate 12 percent of its workforce 
parker signed a preliminary injunction barring eastern from 
altering in any way the status quo working condition of easterns 
pilots machinists and flight attendants a trial will be 
scheduled later 
eastern president phil bakes called the decision gravely 
wrong and said the carrier would file an emergency appeal 
eastern like any american business must be allowed to prune 
moneylosing operations bakes said in a statement released at 
easterns headquarters here we must be able to take prudent 
although sometimes painful measures in the best interests of the 
company and our employees 
overall eastern is discontinuing 204 flights mostly in the 
west and the caribbean with some new flights resulting in a net 
reduction of 140 eastern flights 
parkers opinion did not spell out what should happen to the 
employees whose jobs were salvaged even though their duties were 
not union attorneys suggested they could be transferred and 
leaders of easterns three unions said they wanted to meet with 
management to discuss ways to cut costs without layoffs 
charles e bryan president of machinists district 100 
easterns largest union with 12000 workers of 32500 eastern 
employees called the decision an opportunity for texas air corp 
chairman frank lorenzo to belie his reputation as the no 1 
unionbuster 
were not here as laborers trying to direct the business of 
the airline were trying to protect jobs said dan vician 
vicechairman of the pilots local 
mary jane barry local president said the flight attendants 
still were willing to offer a jobsharing and leave plan rejected 
earlier by management to save jobs and money 
lawyers for the three unions submitted financial statements and 
parker ordered bonds of 25000 each to indemnify the airline if 
the decision is reversed 
meanwhile the airline said easterns basic fall schedule 
remains intact travel agents and passengers can continue to book 
flights with full confidence that the schedule will be as 
announced 
parker said the service cuts which reduce easterns daily 
flights from 1225 to 1085 were financially motivated eastern 
says the route cuts will save 50 million monthly in operating 
costs and the layoffs would have saved another 7 million monthly 
eastern posted a secondquarter net loss of 898 million 
following a 645 million firstquarter loss and 182 million in 
1987 losses houstonbased texas air has warned it needs cash to 
keep eastern some 2 billion in debt when bought 2 years ago in 
operation 
spokesman robin matell said the airline has no plans to file for 
federal bankruptcy protection as it had hinted before the ruling 
the only court were headed for is the court of appeals he 
said 
union leaders say the federal courts which have generally been 
ruling in their favor this year probably would make it difficult 
for lorenzo to repeat his 1983 move at continental where he used 
federal chapter 11 bankruptcy to void union contracts 
the union leaders also noted parkers findings that texas air 
had worsened easterns financial state by taking loans and payments 
totaling hundreds of millions of dollars from the miami carrier to 
texas air and continental 
parker also said texas air and lorenzo have exhibited an 
antiunion bias 
it confirmed what weve been saying bryan said this is a 
federal judge its not the unions anymore or our consultants 
talking 
the cities eastern is cutting are albuquerque nm fort de 
france martinique las vegas nev minneapolisst paul oklahoma 
city omaha neb dallas pointeapitre guadeloupe reno nev 
san antonio texas san diego st lucia west indies tucson 
ariz and tulsa okla 
the company and its unions still have myriad court battles under 
way including a union effort to reverse the texas air sale and 
allow employees to buy eastern 
continuing are contract talks with the machinists and pilots 
the machinists in federal mediation since january will vote sept 
15 on a company call for 161 million in annual wage concessions

senior bank of japan officials indicated that the 
central bank has no plans to raise its discount rate despite recent 
interestrate hikes in europe and the united states 
at a briefing wednesday for japanese reporters bank officials 
said it is part of the central banks contribution to international 
policy coordination not to push up the key interest rate the 
officials did not elaborate 
the news sent the us dollar up sharply against the japanese 
yen in foreignexchange trading other central bank officials were 
quoted as saying that the bank of japan might have to intervene to 
stop the yens decline 
kyodo news service said bank of japan officials made the remarks 
after the dollar rose above 136 yen in european trading on the 
earlier reports that the japanese central bank would not raise 
rates 
last week west germanys bundesbank raised its discount rate a 
half point and several european banks quickly followed the us 
federal reserve had made a similar move a few weeks earlier 
kyodo quoted some bank of japan officials as saying the 
yendollar rates have reached a level that should be watched very 
carefully and that action might be warranted if new movements in 
the currencies occur 
the remarks appeared to indicate that the bank of japan may 
intervene to brake the dollars rise if the us currency continues 
to advance 
the central bank doesnt want to see the yen slide further 
against the dollar because of concern about higher domestic 
inflation 
the yens sharp appreciation since late 1985 has helped to hold 
down domestic prices but accelerated growth in money supply amid 
the present robust economic expansion and the yens recent downturn 
have spawned worries about inflation 
according to kyodo bank of japan officials said they would 
consider not only the yens levels against the dollar but the pace 
of its decline and the strength of yen selling in deciding whether 
or not to intervene against the dollars rise 
the senior bank of japan officials who indicated that no rate 
hike is in the works described the recent key rate increases by 
the us and european central banks as aimed at fighting inflation 
they said the us and european rate increases honor the 
spirit of policy coordination by the group of seven major 
industrial countries since it advocates stemming inflation in 
order to sustain world economic growth 
the group of seven countries are the united states japan west 
germany britain france canada and italy 
some foreignexchange and moneymarket participants said 
japanese monetary authorities have refrained from raising the 
discount rate because such a move would make japanese funds more 
expensive overseas and may prove counterproductive in keeping the 
global economy on an expansionary track 
japan is a launching pad of investment funds for the world 
the united states and other industrialized countries would do 
whatever they could to keep japan from raising interest rates 
further said an official at chemical bank in tokyo

the european economic community 
wednesday slapped provisional antidumping duties on exports of 
video cassette recorders from south korea and japan after 
complaints by domestic manufacturers 
the duties follow a surge in vcr exports to the eec since 1985 
primarily from south korea who tripled its vcr exports to europe in 
a years time the eec executive commission said 
the duties affect three south korean companies that account for 
all of that countrys vcr exports including daewoo goldstar and 
samsung the japanese companies affected are funai and orion 
the commission said south koreas vcr exports into europe surged 
from 75000 in 1985 to 425000 in 1986 and 122 million last year 
imports from the two japanese companies more than doubled to 
991000 units in 1986 from 466000 in 1985 in the first eight 
months of 1987 762000 funai and orion vcrs entered the eec the 
commission said 
the duties levied include 292 percent for daewoo 264 percent 
for goldstar 252 percent for samsung and 18 percent on funai and 
orion vcrs 
the level of the duties was fixed after a commission inquiry 
into the sharp rise of vcr imports 
the commission began its probe in september 1987 on a complaint 
by an eec industry association representing producers of consumer 
electronics the group complained that vcr imports from the three 
south korean and two japanese firms surged because of their 
artificially low prices 
the groups members include philips international bv of the 
netherlands grundig ag and telefunken fernsehen und rundfunk gmbh 
both of west germany thomson grand public of france and britains 
ferguson plc 
the commission said it found that the south korean and japanese 
companies sold vcrs in the eec at dumping prices or at prices 
considered unfairly low as a result their combined share of the 
eecs vcr market rose to 30 percent last year from 86 percent in 
1985 
since 1985 vcr purchases in the 12nation eec rose to 7 million 
from 58 million european currency units or the equivalent of 77 
from 638 million the commission said 
it concluded the market share gains of the south korean and 
japanese exporters were made at the expense of the eecs vcr 
industry and that their dumping prices lowered the sales and profit 
margins of their eec competitors

the nations poverty rate was 135 percent 
last year about the same as in 1986 the census bureau reported 
today that means 325 million americans were living in poverty in 
1987 
in 1986 about 324 million people or 136 percent of the 
population were living in poverty the census bureau said the 
changes between 1986 and 1987 were not statistically 
significant 
the slight decline in the poverty rate occurred despite the 
small increase in the total number of people living in poverty 
because the nations population also grew during the period 
the census bureau also reported that americans median family 
income rose to 30850 in 1987 a 1 percent increase from the year 
before after adjusting for the rise in consumer prices 
the report said the nations poverty rate for whites declined by 
05 percentage point last year to 105 percent the poverty rate 
for blacks was 331 percent up 2 percentage points the rate for 
hispanics increased from 273 percent to 282 percent 
regionally the poverty rate in the south was 161 percent 
unchanged from the year before in the midwest the rate was 127 
percent down from 13 percent the rate in the far west was 126 
percent down from 132 percent and in the northeast the poverty 
rate increased from 105 percent to 11 percent 
between 1986 and 1987 the gross national product grew 34 
percent while unemployment fell from 7 percent to 62 percent 
according to government figures 
todays report on poverty in 1987 was prepared by the census 
bureau based on a survey of about 58000 us households last 
march a survey of that size has a standard error of well under 1 
percentage point 
median family income in 1986 was 29458 up from 29269 a year 
earlier 
median family income indicates that half of all families had 
more income than that and half less statisticians prefer to use 
medians to make comparisons contending that averages can be 
distorted by a small number of families with extraordinarily large 
incomes 
the 1987 poverty threshold varies according to family size but 
the most commonly used figure is 11612 for a family of four 
thats up from 11203 in 1986 
while the rise or fall of national poverty figures tends to 
generate the most immediate attention later debate is more likely 
to concentrate on smaller groups 
in 1986 for example while the national poverty rate was 136 
percent 198 percent of children under age 18 lived below the 
poverty level 
for blacks the poverty rate was 311 percent including 427 
percent of children under 18 hispanics had a 273 percent overall 
rate including 371 percent of youngsters 
the national poverty rate was first calculated in 1959 when it 
was 224 percent the rate fell steadily as national antipoverty 
programs were developed reaching a low point of 111 percent in 
1973 since then its gone up and down peaking at 152 percent in 
1983 
federal officials take pains to point out however that the 
figures over time are not necessarily comparable because of the 
increase in antipoverty programs many of which help people 
without showing up in the official poverty count 
thats because poverty status is based on cash income and does 
not reflect noncash benefits such as food stamps medicare and 
subsidized housing if those things were counted as income the 
1986 poverty rate would have ranged between 9 percent and 125 
percent instead of the official 136 percent rate federal 
officials said

regulators say they are planning to spend 
billions of federal dollars over the next 10 days in several 
transactions to rescue ailing savings and loan institutions 
karl hoyle a spokesman for the federal home loan bank board 
said late tuesday the board was working on several deals he 
declined to say where the next transaction would take place and 
said none of the anticipated federal rescues have received final 
approval 
however the tulsa world said in todays editions that the bank 
boards next move likely would come in oklahoma with the 
consolidation of 14 of the states most troubled savings 
institutions into six holding companies 
hoyle said the board was meeting today but would not reveal what 
it was considering 
in a report attributed to unidentified officials in the office 
of rep jim inhofe rokla the newspaper said regulators plan to 
sell the holding companies to the highest bidder thus placing 14 
of the states 48 sampls under new ownership 
meanwhile the washington post in todays editions said the bank 
board was preparing this week to spend 12 billion to sell or 
merge a dozen or so institutions somewhere in the southwest 
hoyle said that if all goes according to plan over the next week 
and a half the bank board will spend substantially more than that 
in several large transactions in a number of states 
in recent weeks the board has announced it was spending more 
than 8 billion to assist ailing sampls including a major deal in 
texas which like oklahoma has been hard hit by the depression in 
the oil drilling industry 
on another front the bank board was facing a selfimposed 
deadline to wrap up negotiations with the robert m bass group of 
fort worth texas which is seeking federal assistance to acquire 
american savings and loan association of stockton calif one of 
the nations largest sampls 
the board began negotiating with the bass group exclusively on 
april 21 and twice has extended the deadline with the most recent 
extension expiring thursday 
hoyle said the board would have an announcement regarding 
american by thursday industry sources have said between 13 
billion and 2 billion in federal money will be required for the 
rescue

japans nippon mining co ltd 
plans to shell out 11 billion to buy gould inc an electronics 
maker struggling to reduce its debt and reverse a string of losses 
nippon mining one of japans 50 largest industrial firms will 
launch a tender offer to purchase all of goulds 45 million 
outstanding common shares of stock for 2325 a share the 
companies said in a joint statement issued tuesday 
the buyout is one of the biggest ever of a us industrial 
company by a japanese concern topped only by bridgestone corps 
acquisition of firestone tire and rubber co for 26 billion 
earlier this year 
this transaction fits well with our strategy to enhance the 
focus development and growth of the materials and components 
business particularly copper foil fuses and fiber optics said 
gould chairman james f mcdonald 
goulds stock price soared in late trading on the new york stock 
exchange gould closed up 712 a share at 2275 
gould posted a net loss of 956 million last year on revenue of 
9334 million it has been shedding divisions mostly those 
involve in defense manufacturing for several years in an attempt 
to reduce its longterm debt which stood at 250 million at the 
end of june 
on monday the company announced it was selling its ocean 
systems division which makes underwater listening equipment for 
the navy to martin marietta corp for 117 million 
nippon mining already goulds partner in two enterprises 
intends to proceed with goulds plan to divest its remaining

gould based in suburban rolling meadows will retain its name 
and operate as nippon minings whollyowned subsidiary 
gould has 6500 employees in its remaining businesses and 80 
people at its trimmeddown headquarters while the company 
officially said it has yet to determine how employees will be 
affected by the deal analysts believe most jobs will remain in 
place including top management positions 
basically i see no signs of change in headquarters or 
employment relationships for an 18month period it will be hands 
off for a while said julian menear an analyst with the pershing 
division of donaldson lufkin amp jenrette in chicago 
mcdonald said the transaction was based first and foremost on 
maximizing share value for our stockholders 
by further combining the resources of our two companies we 
believe there is great potential for these businesses to expand 
he said in the statement 
nippon mining president yukio kasahara expressed deep respect 
and admiration for goulds products and employees 
gould has a very solid core business in materials and 
components he said despite some of the difficulties 
experienced by the company in the recent past we have great 
confidence in the future of that business 
gould and nippon mining which earned 598 million last year on 
sales of 65 billion have been partners since 1981 in nikko gould 
foil co ltd which makes electroplated copper foil 
should gould accept a competing offer to be acquired by another 
company the agreement contains a provision giving nippon mining an 
option to purchase goulds 50 percent stake in nikko gould foil for 
60 million

the secretarygeneral of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries arrived here after a similar visit 
to iran to discuss ways of curbing overproduction by some of the 
cartels member states 
subroto indonesias former energy minister made no statement 
on his arrival wednesday he was met at baghdad airport by oil 
minister issam abdulrahim alchalabi 
on tuesday subroto met separately with iranian president ali 
khamenei and oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh seeking to persuade 
them to allow iraq a production quota of 239 million barrels a 
day the same as iran 
but there was no word on whether the iranians agreed to an 
increase in iraqs present quota of 15 million barrels a day 
iraq has refused to abide by its quota insisting on parity with 
its gulf foe iran the two countries recently began talks on 
possibly ending the 8yearold persian gulf war 
iraq is pumping an estimated 25 million barrels a day 
worsening the overproduction problem by some of opecs 13 member 
states 
the middle east economic survey a respected oil publication 
based in cyprus reported this week that opecs production in 
august stood at 20 million barrels a day or 35 million barrels a 
day over the overall production ceiling this was seen as a key 
factor in declining oil prices 
since he assumed his post june 1 the secretarygeneral has been 
trying to find a practical formula that would curb the surplus and 
stabilize oil prices 
he has visited venezuela equador saudi arabia mexico and 
kuwait and succeeded in persuading venezuela to drop its veto 
against giving iraq a quota equal to that of iran 
some opec members have opposed raising a members quota because 
it increases production and further weakens prices 
iran has been the only member opposing an increase of iraqs 
quota

top chinese government officials have decided 
against rapid decontrol of stateset prices a key element in the 
nations economic reforms in an apparent move to ease unhappiness 
with spiraling inflation 
the cautious approach toward price reform disclosed tuesday by 
the state council chinas cabinet differed from a more aggressive 
outline adopted by the communist party politburo in midaugust and 
highlighted the growing debate within the leadership over how fast 
china should proceed with its reforms 
the state councils stand was widely reported in the official 
media wednesday with the national evening news devoting five 
minutes to explaining the decisions made 
the council agreed not to initiate further price increases for 
the remainder of this year and decided there will be no radical 
reforms in the price system next year 
the nation will continue to restrain construction projects and 
other capital investments that have pushed industrial growth to 
unsustainable levels and will further control credit and the 
issuance of currency to cool off the overheated economy the state 
council said 
it also said a fiveyear plan of price and wage reform outlined 
by the politburo in midaugust is still tentative and subject to 
revision 
the politburo plan called for removal of price controls on most 
commodities in favor of market regulation 
the plan while also stressing the need to control a 
nearrunaway inflation rate said chinas economy is full of 
vitality and is developing vigorously the time is favorable to the 
price and wage reforms 
the 17member politburo the main decisionmaking body of the 
party is led by general secretary zhao ziyang the leading 
advocate of rapid marketoriented reform 
the state council meanwhile is headed by premier li peng who 
is thought to be more cautious toward change and more concerned 
about the effects of reform on economic and social stability 
there is consensus in china about the pressing need for price 
reform primarily the removal of state controls so that the value 
of goods can be determined by market forces 
artificially low stateset prices for many products have led to 
chronic shortages corruption influence peddling and a thriving 
black market profiteers commonly buy up lowpriced raw materials 
and items from state factories and resell them for far higher 
prices to producers and consumers 
decontrol of prices of some basic goods and foods in the past 
year coupled with the inability of producers to meet rising 
consumer demand have pushed inflation to levels never before 
acknowledged in chinas communist system in june prices were 19 
percent higher than a year earlier

grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower 
today on the chicago board of trade in reaction to the agriculture 
departments refusal to extend pricesupport loans scheduled to 
mature today analysts said 
unless the loans are extended as was recommended tuesday by a 
federal magistrate in st paul minn an estimated 400 million to 
500 million bushels of corn will be released onto the market 
the magistrates recommendation is not binding but it will be 
considered by the judge hearing a case brought by several farmers 
who are seeking to have the loans extended 
the usda feels as though theyve got a mandate to make their 
own decisions with regard to extending loans which they say they 
will not do and people are worried about an influx of oldcrop 
corn coming to the market said ted mao grain specialist with 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
he said the bearish impact of the potential loan expirations was 
offset by an increase in grain export business which was keeping 
prices from falling significantly 
in early trading wheat was unchanged to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 394 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to 1 cents higher with september at 277 a bushel 
oats were 1 cents to 3 cents lower with september at 251 a 
bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 4 cents lower with september at 
842 a bushel

for at least one industry housing including 
building sales and rentals the script was written in the 1950s 
and 1960s and will be played out in the 1990s 
the plot is a demographic one a twodecade bulge of americans 
of homebuying age will have passed through the economy leaving a 
still large but substantially smaller demand for lowerpriced 
starter homes 
among the characters affected will be developers lenders 
builders trades people brokers materials suppliers and investors 
they have no choice but to accept that notion and accommodate 
themselves to the reality says james wooten chairman of lomas 
mortgage usa and publisher of us housing markets a subscription 
newsletter 
the latest analysis by the newsletter whose surveys and studies 
are widely accepted in the housing industry offers these 
demographicbased projections 
annual household formations gradually will fall to less than 
twothirds of the 19841987 average 
private housing starts will average no more than 14 million a 
year for most of the decade of the 1990s compared with 2 million 
in 1977 and more than 17 million in the years 19831985 
new housing will shift inexorably toward higher price ranges 
reflecting the greater affluence and grander lifestyles of older 
buyers 
traditional rental apartments aimed at younger tenants will be 
in less demand says wooten landlords will need to find 
innovative products to attract households in higher age brackets 
housing targeted for older americans those retired or 
planning retirement will be find a growing market 
wooten butresses his conclusions with immutable demographic 
evidence 
in 1975 for example nearly 40 million americans were in their 
20s the primary market bracket for apartments and starter homes 
while only 23 million were in the moveup category of 35 years 
to 44 years 
by the end of the century the numbers will almost flipflop with 
more than 43 million individuals in the age 35 to 44 bracket while 
those in their 20s will have contracted to 34 million 
these numbers portend a development that might also have a 
serious impact on those who currently own homes and are relying on 
the equity in them to finance their retirements 
wooten describes the potential phenomenon in this way 
as america ages as the middleyears cohort climbs the ladder 
from first moveup and thence to second third and fourth the lower 
rungs will be holding fewer and fewer potential buyers 
the homes being left behind will be offered to a dwindling 
list of prospects 
thus in overall terms the existinghome market will 
gradually evolve into a buyers market beginning in the lower 
regions of the price spectrum 
the situation wooten describes doesnt dictate lower prices nor 
does it mean that prices cannot increase 
but it strongly suggests that the sharp price increases of the 
1970s and 1980s will be by the year 2000 a thing of the past

a federal probe into accounting procedures at 
georgia power co involving a possible attempt to avoid paying 50 
million in taxes may involve other companies and individuals the 
government says 
court documents made public tuesday showed the investigation now 
focuses on georgia power its parent the southern co and the big 
eight accounting firm of arthur andersen amp co 
but us attorney robert barr who confirmed the investigation 
said the probe is continuing and may involve others 
meanwhile the state public service commission said today it has 
upgraded its own investigation of tax and accounting practices at 
georgia power and specifically wants to know whether the utility 
attempted to hide vital financial information from psc scrutiny 
barr refused to elaborate beyond what was in the court papers 
because a grand jury is still hearing details he said the 
investigation involves possible criminal wrongdoing including 
violations of the us tax code 
a statement issued by arthur andersen from the companys chicago 
headquarters denied any wrongdoing but georgia power chairman 
robert w scherer speaking for the electric utility and southern 
co said he was shocked by the allegations and vowed to get to 
the bottom of this matter the papers raised the question of 
whether the companies and their accountants sought to hide about 
61 million in spare parts to avoid paying 50 million in federal 
taxes interest and penalties 
key elements in that question are whether parts are classified 
as emergency spares or for maintainence and when they become 
expenses to the company 
the papers also raised the question of georgia powers 
accounting for the sale of 5 percent of the vogtle nuclear power 
plant to the municipal electric authority of georgia 
in the documents officials say the deal was treated as a sale 
of 5 percent of the 887 billion plant for book value purposes 
but as 135 percent for tax purposes saving the company between 
10 million and 12 million 
the papers include excerpts of taped conversations in which 
southern cos tax chief agrees with an informant that the company 
misled the irs over the tax accounting of the spare parts but 
adds dont ever say that 
the investigation dating to 1982 is based largely on 
information contained in taped conversations between utility and 
andersen officials and the informant georgia power employee gary 
gilman who is getting paid for his participation and been exempted 
from prosecution the court papers show 
the papers also include affidavits requesting search warrants at 
the downtown atlanta headquarters of georgia power as well as the 
home of tim fallaw southern cos director of taxes 
the affidavit by irs criminal investigation division agent 
arthur d mcgovern jr alleges fallaw and at least five georgia 
power employees and four andersen employees knowingly participated 
in a scheme to hide the incorrect accounting of spare parts

a federal judge has dismissed an attempt 
by the younger brother of ernest and julio gallo to gain onethird 
ownership of the worlds largest winery 
however us district judge edward dean price ruled tuesday 
that eampj gallo winerys trademark infringement suit against joseph 
gallo will proceed to trial on nov 15 
ernest and julio gallo had charged that use of joseph gallos 
last name on a brand of cheese he produced violated their 
trademark joseph gallo countersued contending that his older 
brothers comingled assets from their parents estate to begin the 
modesto califbased gallo winery in 1933 
price said he found no legal basis for joseph gallos contention 
the judge said joseph gallos allegation that ernest and julio 
gallo concealed part of the parents estate clearly fails 
price said evidence presented to the court of the gallo family 
making wine before prohibition is mostly the stuff that family 
anecdotes are made of 
the court can only conclude that ernests administration was 
appropriate and that all of the assets of the estate were reported 
and administered the judge said 
it was always our belief that once the true facts were known 
this ludicrous and false claim would be thrown out of court 
gallo winery spokesman dan solomon said 
attorney dennis rice said he will continue trying to let joseph 
gallo use his own name on his own products 
i continue to believe joseph is entitled to use his own name 
in his own business rice said we intend to move forward with 
that phase of the case at the appropriate time 
price said several issues must be resolved in the trademark 
trial 
they include a contention by joseph gallo that the winery made 
false statements in applying for a trademark to the name gallo 
which means rooster in italian ernest and julio gallo contended 
that their father began using the trademark in 1909 
the court cannot say that a fraud was practiced upon the 
trademark officials by the winery during the registration 
process price said it is simply the position of the court 
that the record does not establish that the statements made to 
secure the trademark as a matter of law bar the winery from the 
relief it seeks 
that issue remains for trial he said

a federal judge said his sentence of 
corporate imprisonment for a softdrink bottling company 
convicted of price fixing was unprecedented but was justified for 
a company that did not have a conscience 
us district judge robert g doumar suspended the sentence and 
placed allegheny bottling co of maryland on probation tuesday 
saying any violation of probation would result in the us marshal 
being sent to padlock every facility allegheny owns 
doumar also imposed the maximum fine of 1 million suspending 
50000 and ordering four top corporate officers to perform as much 
as two years of fulltime unpaid community service 
the corporation cannot come in here profit to the tune of 10 
million and walk away with a 1 million fine doumar said i 
cannot imagine any company being more tied up with illegal 
activity 
james h walsh a lawyer for allegheny said he would appeal the 
sentence adding that he could find no precedent of corporate 
imprisonment 
doumar also ordered that allegheny bottling not sell any of its 
assets without the courts permission 
walsh said alleghenys parent company pepsico had planned to 
sell some of alleghenys assets this week and that the sentence 
could result in a financial fiasco 
doumar said he would consider the transactions in private but 
would not allow the company to be left with no one to fullfill the 
terms of probation 
the government said allegheny a pepsi bottling franchise and 
its arch rival midatlantic cocacola bottlng co ended years of 
cola wars in 1982 by secretly rigging wholesale prices in virginia 
and maryland 
prosecutors said a number of executives including maryland 
multimillionaire morton m lapides who founded allegheny 
orchestrated the conspiracy lapides later sold the company which 
is now owned by pepsico 
doumar said virtually every executive at allegheny was in on the 
scheme where was there a beacon of some sanity doumar asked 
was there any did anyone care why didnt anyone care 
some 200 years ago the lord chancellor of england said you 
cannot expect a corporation to have a conscience when it has no 
soul to be damned and no body to be kicked obviously allegheny 
bottling co did not have a conscience 
doumar said he could find no similar case of corporate 
imprisonment to justify his sentence but added stone walls do 
not a prison make 
he said the sentence would discourage other potential price 
fixers from making illegal agreements with competitors 
lapides and james harford former president of midatlantic 
cocacola were found guilty by a federal jury in may of price 
fixing 
last week lapides and harford received threeyear prison terms 
with all but six months suspended and were fined 100000 each

macmillan inc has discussed a takeover of part 
or all of the company with maxwell communications corp which has 
an outstanding 234 billion tender offer for the publishing and 
information services concern both sides said wednesday 
macmillan had rejected maxwells current 80ashare tender 
offer as inadequate but the company said it has provided 
londonbased maxwell with information on its operations 
the information pertains to macmillan as a whole as well as its 
information services group macmillan said in a statement its 
chairman and chief executive officer edward p evans met with 
british media tycoon robert maxwell on tuesday to discuss a 
takeover of all or part of the company 
we have an agreement to hold talks said a maxwell spokesman 
in london 
maxwell previously had expressed interest in acquiring only the 
information services operation a unit that could fetch as much as 
11 billion 
separately maxwell said in a filing with the securities and 
exchange commission it has received permission to proceed with the 
bid and acquire more than 50 percent of macmillan federal 
regulators allowed the time period in which they must raise 
antitrust concerns to expire last week 
maxwells bid topped a 75ashare tender offer launched by the 
robert m bass group of texas which owns about 92 percent of 
macmillans outstanding shares 
bass overtures prompted macmillan to devise a restructuring 
plan that essentially would split the company in two and pay 
shareholders a special dividend but a court blocked macmillan from 
proceeding with its plan 
the publishing company which is appealing the court order 
indicated recently it might sweeten its restructuring proposal but 
did not unveil any details 
macmillans shares consistently have traded above the 80 mark 
in afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange macmillan was 
off 137 at 8224 a share

deadpan comic selfnominating 
presidential candidate and vintner pat paulsen who has been trying 
to sell his sonoma county winery for more than a year has finally 
made a deal on the property the company reported wednesday 
paulsens general manager george w litras said the comedians 
name will remain on the label and he will continue as the wines 
prime promoter and consultant he has agreed to make 40 public 
appearances a year for the wine 
we hope to take full advantage of pats marketing ability 
said litras adding that the new owners hoped to raise production 
to 35000 cases in less than two years 
no sale price was named but paulsens 20000case winery and 
other property including the 55acre town of asti first listed 
for 37 million the deal includes paulsens 33acre tasting 
room delicatessen gas station and some houses 
the buyers are reported to be mark majestic of palos verdes and 
neal broidy of transaction securities of oakland 
pat paulsen vineyards whose label prominently carries paulsens 
underscored name and sadlooking portrait gets its grapes from 37 
acres of cabernet sauvignon sauvignon blanc and chardonnay planted 
on a 500acre alexander valley ranch 
aside from his wry dry humor paulsen is well known for his tv 
appearances with the smothers brothers who also make wine under 
their own label and the fact that paulsen has been running for 
us president for some 20 years 
its tough campaigning paulsen once said kissing hands 
and shaking babies 
wine sales plunged when paulsen first put the winery on the 
market as distributors feared the wine would not sell without his 
name in may in a move to assure distributors that the label was 
safe paulsen announced he would continue running the winery but 
was looking for an investor as partner 
he paulsen has a national recognition and quite a large 
following and that helps sales litras said at the time adding 
that the wine itself was good enough to stand on its own merits 
in 1985 and 1986 two paulsen generic wines 425 offerings 
labeled refrigerator white got very high marks for quality 
from the wine writers following a 15liter 1984 gamay that was 
lauded as superior and a buy at 650 all of paulsens wines 
including gewurztraminer and muscat canelli are in the premium 
price range currently priced from 6 to 11

bellsouth corp on wednesday unveiled an 
electronic gateway that will allow computer users to reach several 
information services with a single local phone call 
bellsouth the first bell company to offer such a service said 
its transtext universal gateway is available in the atlanta calling 
area after the initial introduction there bellsouth plans to make 
the gateway available in other cities in its ninestate region 
we believe information services are an important segment of 
the telecommunications industry and its important for our 
business to be involved said john r gunter bellsouth vice 
president for information services 
but gunter alluding to several failed attempts by companies to 
launch videotex services said bellsouth will proceed slowly and 
were going to be listening a lot to see how information 
service providers and users respond to the gateway 
us district judge harold greene in modifying the consent 
decree that stripped american telephone amp telegraph co of its 
local bell operating companies ruled last year that bell companies 
could establish gateways to transmit electronic information 
supplied by others he continued to bar them however from 
originating any of the information themselves 
without a gateway computer users with a modem must 
presubscribe to the various information services that are 
available and dial into each one separately they also are billed 
by each separately 
using the bellsouth gateway a computer user needs only to 
subscribe to it and can then dial one phone number to reach 
multiple information services subscribers will be billed by 
bellsouth advanced networks an unregulated subsidiary for use of 
the gateway and for the information services they used 
currently eight services are available through the gateway and 
10 more are scheduled to be added soon the company said 
the services that are already on line offer information about an 
atlanta theater company local and national news the stock market 
and travel among other things one service sponsored by an atlanta 
hospital provides health and fitness information and plans soon to 
offer an online heart test another service allows callers to 
chat electronically with one another 
gunter said the company hoped to sign up 300 customers during 
the initial offering and slowly grow to 1000 in atlanta before 
offering the service in other areas 
gateway charges are 150 per hour from 7 pm to 7 am and 3 
per hour during the other 12 hours of the day users would be 
charged an additional fee depending on how much information they 
access typically about 60 cents during the day and 40 cents at 
night gunter said 
customers also must pay for the cost of access to any of the 
information services on the gateway a couple of the services 
charge nothing but the cost of others range up to 50 an hour 
computer users may pay more for some services obtained through 
the gateway than if they dialed into the service directly but 
depending on the time of day some services may be cheaper through 
the gateway 
for example travel plus which is part of general videotex 
corps delphi service charges 780 an hour on the gateway day 
or night but when a caller dials into delphi and calls up travel 
plus it costs 740 per hour during the evening but 1740 during 
the day the daytime rate reflects the higher cost of data lines 
needed for computer transmissions said jon gilbert marketing 
director of general videotex

oil companies submitted 371 bids totaling 
more than 190 million wednesday in an effort to grab up 
bargainpriced leases on 270 tracts of offshore properties in the 
western gulf of mexico 
the high bids ran to more than 131 million 
sohio petroleum co had the highest bid of the day with a 75 
million offer for a tract in the high island area off the 
texaslouisiana coast the bid came to 130624 per acre 
officials of the interior departments minerals management 
service opened the bids as several hundred oil industry executives 
looked on 
it was the second offering of governmentowned tracts in the 
western gulf and the third gulf lease sale since the interior 
department dropped the minimum peracre price on the property from 
150 to 25 
interest was high with 93 companies qualifying to bid 
eightyfour qualified last march for a similar offering in the 
central gulf 
however when the number of submitted bids was totaled tuesday 
afternoon it was far below the 931 bids received last march for 
central gulf properties 
eileen angelico spokeswoman for the minerals management 
service said the number was down for two reasons 
the central gulf waters are considered better risks and the 
western gulf tracts were up for bids a year ago shortly after the 
minimum bids were lowered to 25 per acre 
almost 520 bids were received on the first western gulf 
offerings 
almost 28 million acres of offshore property mostly off the 
texas coast were offered when the government announced the sale in 
july that property was divided into 5080 tracts

stocks headed higher at the opening as the dollar climbed in

interest rates for us government securities in the credit

at chubb corp summer ended at midnight 
wednesday the cutoff for measuring rainfall under the insurers 
controversial drought coverage plan that has farmers suing 
insurance departments angry and chubb officials struggling for 
damage control 
a spokeswoman at the warren njbased company who spoke on 
condition that she not be identified by name said several weeks 
would be needed to determine the amount of chubbs liability the 
insurer hopes to pay all claims by early october she said 
reports from 1100 us weather measuring stations will filter 
in to chubbs computer some of the stations are remote making 
collection of the data more difficult she said 
chubb officials have said that recent rainfall after dry weeks 
in june and july may have relieved it having to pay roughly half 
the 40 million in coverage granted 
its certainly been raining and its substantially reduced 
our exposure said the spokeswoman 
the policies granted to 1160 farmers promise payments if 
rainfall is less than half or less than 70 percent depending on 
the policy of an areas average rainfall from june 1 to aug 31 
a check wednesday with weather officials in farm belt states 
showed a range of roughly calculated rainfall levels for the eriod 
though it is difficult to estimate what the effect might be on 
chubbs liability 
in iowa about 15 percent of the state had less than half normal 
rainfall 55 percent to 60 percent received less than the 70 
percent threshhold minnesota reported that less than 10 percent of 
the state fell below the halfway mark and just under half had less 
than 70 percent of the average 
rainfall in more than twothirds of indiana dipped below 70 
percent of the average and onefifth was below 50 percent 
in illinois more than half the state received less than 50 
percent of normal rainfall from april 1 to aug 1 and nearly all 
of it dipped below 70 percent twentytwo counties in the southeast 
quarter of nebraska alone received less than 70 percent of normal 
rain since january figures since june were not available 
weather officials in louisville ky said rainfall was about 22 
percent shy of normal for the june 1aug 31 period and that 
conditions in the rest of the state appeared similar 
the chubb policy became embroiled in controversy when the 
company was flooded with applications that exceeded the amount of 
coverage it had authorized 
agents offered an estimated 400 million in insurance compared 
to the 30 million limit which chubb later increased to 40 
million about 8700 farmers applied angered over the disparity 
farmers sued chubb and the cases were consolidated in a 
classaction suit in federal court in cincinnati 
insurance regulators in ohio indiana minnesota and iowa have 
scheduled hearings on the issue 
chubb offered to return double the premiums paid by farmers who 
were denied a policy and has sent about 6000 checks totaling 20 
million the spokeswoman said 
midnight wednesday was also the deadline for farmers to have 
letters postmarked asking for the doubled refunds 
lawyers for farmers in the cincinnati case said an agreement 
with chubb lawyers was filed promising that the double payments 
could be requested without forfeiting the right to sue 
the chubb spokeswoman said the promise was part of the companys 
original refund offer she also said the deadline would not be 
extended 
she said most of the applying farmers had been contacted by 
telephone about the potential refund but an unidentified numbers 
of others could not be reached and had been written 
chubb has reacted to the image crisis created by the 
controversey not just with the refunds but with fullpage newspaper 
ads tollfree numbers and a special task force staffed by 125 
people 
the volume of phone calls wednesday was not heavier than usual 
the company said

the chicago board options exchange and some of 
its traders overcharged more than 1000 investors who lost at least 
40 million the day after the stock market collapsed a lawyer 
charged wednesday after filing a lawsuit 
the cboe and floor traders responsible for making markets in 
certain options on the standard amp poors 100 stock index violated 
federal law and the exchanges own rules by charging inflated 
prices for options contracts last oct 20 attorney herbert beigel 
alleged in a classaction lawsuit 
the investors were gouged by virtue of being charged excessive 
prices beigel a partner in the chicagobased law firm beigel amp 
sandler said in a telephone interview from his new york office 
the market makers with the assistance of the cboe 
deliberately charged investors very excessive prices which made it 
difficult for the investors to make money because there was not a 
legitimate market 
cboe officials were aware of the lawsuit which consolidates 
three previous classaction lawsuits but would not comment on it 
said spokesman warren moulds 
an option is a contract giving the holder the right to buy or 
sell a commodity or financial instrument for a specific price at a 
future date in the case of sampp 100 index options the item being 
traded is the value of the sampp 100 index which measures the 
performance of 100 stocks 
the price or premium of an index option depends on a number of 
variables including the time until the expiration of the option 
and the volatility of the underlying index 
the cboe the worlds leading options exchange has said the 
doubling and tripling of index options prices on oct 20 were 
understandable in light of the markets unprecedented volatility 
that day 
the exchange also facilitated the collection of 12 million 
earmarked as refunds for investors who paid extremely high prices 
for sampp 100 index options contracts on oct 20 the money was 
collected from traders and distributed to brokerage firms 
but beigel said the refunds amounted to at most 20 percent of 
the total lost by some investors 
the lawsuit filed tuesday in us district court in chicago 
combines and broadens the claims of the three previous lawsuits it 
seeks an amount equal to the money invested less any returns or 
refunds plus an unspecified amount for lost use of the money and 
interest 
it names as plaintiffs all people who purchased oex or 
oezseries index options on oct 20 at the cboe except those who 
acted as market makers for such transactions 
the lawsuit names as defendants the cboe the options clearing 
corp a separate firm that processes trades made at the exchange 
and all cboe floor traders who were designated as market makers for 
the oex and oez series of sampp 100 index options on oct 20 
trading losses in index options on oct 19 and 20 have been 
estimated at several hundred million dollars nationwide index 
options were among the largest sources of investor complaints in 
the weeks after the 508point drop in the dow jones industrial 
average on oct 19 
index options which account for more than half the trading 
volume at the cboe are hedging tools that investors use to protect 
themselves against losses in the stock market

businesses could unite workers at 
various locations in a telephone conference and create the illusion 
they are in the same room with a video wall bellcore said 
wednesday in unveiling a prototype 
bellcore a research concern formed after the breakup of 
american telephone amp telegraph co said the video wall uses 
image merging techniques that bring together images generated 
by multiple cameras a final single image can be the product of 
transmissions from several locations said coinventor lanny smoot 
the wall is 8 feet wide for a panoramic view and people appear 
to be lifelike he said its as if you were looking through a 
wall into an adjacent room 
smoot said research has shown that workers who may share common 
concerns or goals do not work together as well if they are in 
separate buildings or even on different floors in the same building 
the video wall could encourage people to work more closely 
together he said 
bellcore which has headquarters in livingston developed the 
wall at its research center in morris township 
the research and engineering consortium serves the telephone 
companies of the seven regional bell holding companies 
smoot said it will be the companies decision to market the 
video wall as a service

last year has been withholding its cocoa beans from the market in 
hopes of selling them for higher prices

to the icco to support its operations

new international cocoa pricesupport agreement 
a lot of people who may have believed the price of cocoa might 
rally because of the upcoming meeting were very demoralized said

securities inc in new york

to pay levies the icco is facing very very severe financial

american family income rose by 1 percent last 
year but the number of people living in poverty also edged upward 
slightly the census bureau reported ednesday 
the economic recovery is leaving many poor americans behind 
said robert greenstein of the center on budget and policy 
priorities a private research group 
he said the most disturbing figures dealt with black americans 
who suffered a significant increase in poverty the government 
defined the poverty income level as 11611 for a family of four in 
1987 up from 11203 the previous year 
william p butz the census bureaus associate director for 
demographic programs said the nations economic performance in 
terms of income and poverty has been mixed as usual 
the number of americans living in poverty last year totaled 325 
million slightly higher than the 324 million reported for 1986 
the poverty rate was 135 percent down from 136 percent 
butz said neither change is considered statistically significant 
because they are within the margin of possible error in the report 
which was based on a sample of about 60000 households across the 
country 
it is possible for the poverty rate to decline even when more 
people are poor because the size of the population is growing 
faster than the number of people living in poverty 
median family income last year was 30850 up from 30534 the 
year before the bureau said 
the poverty report was likely to generate controversy in the 
presidential election campaign because of its bad news for blacks 
president reagans spokesman marlin fitzwater said in 
california that the report provides further evidence that the 
most effective means of improving the life of americans is a 
strong productive economy 
fitzwater said the increase in poverty among blacks obviously 
is disappointing but that women were making the greatest 
gains 
we think this is a good report fitzwater said it 
documents a decrease in poverty a continuing rising income and 
reflects a growing strong economy 
butz saw the figures somewhat differently 
the poverty rate for blacks increased but not for whites 
butz said income went up for whites but not for blacks but 
butz said it is premature to consider this a trend 
the poverty rate for blacks increased from 311 percent in 1986 
to 331 percent last year the study said meaning the number of 
blacks living in poverty rose from 89 million to 97 million 
median family income for blacks fell from 18247 to 18098 
while the median income for white families rose from 31935 to 
32274 
the poverty rate for whites dipped from 11 percent to 105 
percent indicating there were 214 million whites living in 
poverty last year down from 222 million a year earlier 
for hispanics the poverty rate rose from 273 percent to 282 
percent and median family income fell from 20726 to 20306 the 
number of hispanics in poverty rose from 51 million to 54 million 
median family income means half of all families receive more 
than that amount and half less statisticians prefer medians as a 
standard of comparison because a few families with extraordinarily 
high incomes can distort an average 
hispanics cannot be counted in figures for blacks and whites 
because hispanics are an ethnic rather than a racial group and 
already are included in figures for both blacks and whites 
officials said 
farmers got good news in the report the farm poverty rate 
plummeted from 196 percent in 1986 to 126 percent last year 
meaning the number of farm residents living in poverty declined 
from 996000 to 616000 
butz said that while he had no immediate explanation for the 
decline but cautioned that the figures do not reflect the economic 
hardships that farmers suffered because of this summers widespread 
drought 
the study found that womens incomes continue to trail those of 
men it said women receive about 65 percent of males takehome 
pay a percentage that has remain unchanged since 1984 
families headed by a female with no husband present had a 
poverty rate of 343 percent down slightly from 346 percent in 
1986 families headed by a man with no wife present had a poverty 
rate of 125 percent up from 114 percent the year before 
children under age 18 had a poverty rate of 200 percent not 
statistically different from the 198 percent of a year earlier 
the rate for persons 65 and older was 122 percent down from 124 
percent in 1986 
even so children made up about 40 percent of the nations poor 
last year and the elderly accounted for 107 percent meaning more 
than half of all poor people were the oldest and youngest americans 
the report said the poorest 20 percent of americans account for 
only 46 percent if all income a share that has declined from 55 
percent in 1967 
over the same period the wealthiest 20 percent increased their 
share of all income from 404 percent to 437 percent 
the 60 percent of people in the middle received 541 percent of 
all income in 1967 and 517 percent last year 
butz said the poverty figures count only cash income not 
antipoverty programs such as food stamps subsidized housing and 
medicare if those benefits counted as income he said the us 
povetry rate would decline to between 8 percent and 125 percent

the washington public power supply system has 
settled its part of a securities fraud lawsuit brought by 
bondholders after the system defaulted on 225 billion in bonds 
sold to finance two nuclear power plants attorneys announced 
wednesday 
plaintiff bondholders would drop claims against wppss in return 
for access to power plant accounts containing millions of dollars 
plaintiffs attorneys also said the deal would gain them the 
cooperation of wppss employees who will be leading witnesses in 
the trial set to start sept 7 in tucson ariz 
remaining defendants include 20 public utilities in washington 
and one in oregon three engineering firms and a firm that had 
provided wppss with financial advice 
attorneys reached the settlement which had been proposed by the 
plaintiffs late tuesday the wppss executive board was expected to 
approve the agreement at a special meeting friday in richland 
wash said carl halvorson board chairman 
its a very favorable settlement for the supply system he 
said 
the settlement also needs approval from us district judge 
william d browning who is presiding over the wppss default case 
under the tentative settlement the plaintiff bondholders agreed 
to dismiss all claims against wppss based on securities fraud 
misrepresentation and violation of state law 
wppss in turn agreed it had an obligation to pay the face value 
and interest on the bonds which would come to about 3 billion 
even though it paid no money in the settlement the agreement also 
noted that because of limited assets pledged to secure the bonds 
there was no expectation the money would ever be paid 
however the agreement did give bondholders unconditional access 
to an account for the terminated plants nos 4 and 5 which has 
been under control of new yorks chemical bank the trustee for 
plaintiff bondholders since 1983 
the account now has about 75 million in it and has withdrawn a 
total of about 90 million mostly for attorneys fees 
other additional funds the bondholders might realize from the 
settlement could come from a pending lawsuit seeking to wrest from 
two other wppss projects funds that were spent when those plants 
were twinned with the terminated projects that could amount to 
tens of millions of dollars but a determination is years away 
since you cant get blood out of a turnip why not get all the 
other benefits you can said mel weiss who represents class 
action plaintiffs in the giant lawsuit 
the abrupt pullout of wppss from the litigation caught other 
defendants by surprise and one said defendants were considering 
seeking a trial delay 
were surprised they wppss didnt stay and defend their 
actions said chuck shigley administrator for the snohomish 
county public utility district its not clear that we need more 
time to prepare for trial there is a good chance we will be able 
to pull it together 
in addition to access to funds the settlement will allow 
plaintiffs to talk with supply system employees before they are put 
on the stand according to paul bernstein a plaintiffs lawyer 
because of rules in a civil lawsuit there were questions on 
whether the wppss employees even would have to testify 
bondholders had sued the supply system 88 utilities bond 
underwriters various directors and managers engineering firms and 
advisors after wppss defaulted on 225 billion worth of bonds to 
build the two nevercompleted nuclear power plants 
many defendants including bond underwriters and more than 60 
utilities have reached settlements totaling 331 million over the 
past year
